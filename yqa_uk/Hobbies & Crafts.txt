Probably. People collect old cameras. Search on ebay and you will see. If you were to sell it, ebay would be a good place to do so.

It could be worth a little bit, but it would depend partly on whether it's in good working condition.
There is a whole forum of people who are interested in these types of cameras, they were all called rangefinders because the lens could focus but you had to set the distance, rather than doing it by looking through the viewfinder like you do in the SLRs which finally made them redundant:
http://www.rangefinderforum.com/forums/s...
There's a page about the history of the company and different types of cameras here, if you did want to sell it on eBay it would help to have as much information about it as possible:
http://www.ensign.demon.co.uk/ensigncame...
It looks from this as though yours is from the 1950s, if that's any help.  Some pics here to see if it looks like one of these:
http://www.ozcamera.com/ensign-folding.h...
http://www.camerapedia.org/wiki/Ensign_S...
There's some idea of prices here, not very high, but often people bid more for things on eBay:

Hi!  I'm guessing that when you turn the screw the whole assembly spins around instead of coming undone.  If this is the case, I think I can offer some help.  Get a screwdriver with a wide blade and a pair of pliers.  Gently grab the "stationary" end of the screw post with the pliers to hold it still, and use the screw driver to turn the other side.

It may be that the screw was put in a little crooked.  I hope this helps.

You can try freehand of course. Or you can go to your local craft store that supplies a die cut machine, purchase the felt, choose the shapes you want, and then cut them out.

But if you want more control of the size, you may need to just trace around something onto the felt and cut it out yourself. And the more you do it the better it will turn out, if you are concerned about cutting it freehand.
