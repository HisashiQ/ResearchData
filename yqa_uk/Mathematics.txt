How do I find values of x &lt; sin(x) algebraically?



I have been asked to solve the following statement:



{x:x&lt;sin x} is equal to...



I can do it pictorially, it's easy to see that -1 &lt;= sin x &lt;=  1, but how do I solve this using calculus?



It's a simple problem, but it's driving my nuts!!



Thanks for any advice.

Math Questions..Cross Products of Sets?



1.Villiant Bank’s website requires that your pin number only be two numerical digits long. So, the first number to choose will be from set A below and the second number to choose will be from set B. Find the cross product A X B to determine the number of combinations possible. (4 points)



A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}



B = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}



2.Vall ant Bank’s website requires that your pin number be two digits long, the first must be a V or B and the second a number from 1 to 5. So, the first digit to choose will be from set C below and the second digit to choose will be from set D. Find the cross product C X D to determine the number of combinations possible. (4 points)



C = {v, b}



D = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}



3.Based on your answers from parts 1 & 2, what is the difference in the number of possible pin numbers between Genuine and Valliant Banks. Which would you be more comfortable using if you were concerned with identity theft? Why? Compose a short paragraph to explain.

If he could earn 2.1, but only works enough to earn 1.2, then he has skipped out on earning .9 of the 2.1 he could earn and thus .9 of the 2.1 work he could do. To convert this to a percentage, it's:
(.9/2.1) * 100 = 42.8%



So he does 42.8% less work.

1.2mil is 57.14% of 2.1mil ((1.2/2.1) * 100).



So the college grad would be working 100 - 57.14 = 42.86% less time.

Mathematics Probability question. Can you help?



Hey.



I've recently done a recap on Probability and i'm having some problems. I've learnt difference between independent events and mututally exclusive events but i'm having trouble with answering some of these questions. There is the AND Rules and the OR Rule.



Can you explain a method of solving this question please.



1. Find the probability of picking 2 queens plus the ace of spades from a pack of cards (without replacement).



The answer in the book is 3/11050 but i get the answer of 1/11050 becuase i do 4/52 x 3/51 x 1/50. Why is it 3/11050?



All comments are very much appreciated. Many thanks!

No, 3rd quadrant.



The positive values of these lie in the second quadrant. But because they are negative, you go in the reverse direction. Then, the second and third quadrants interchange.



Easier way: subtract the numerical value from 360 (i.e. 360-119, or 360-167), and check where those values would lie.

Quadrant I = 0° to 90°
Quadrant II = 90° to 180°
Quadrant III = 180° to 270°
Quadrant IV = 270° to 360°



Going clockwise:
Quadrant IV = 0° to -90°
Quadrant III = -90° to -180°
Quadrant II = -180° to -270°
Quadrant I = -270° to -360°

1) Combine the "d"s on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other, then multiply both sides by the same value such that you end up with "d =" and a number on the right. That would be the answer.



2) Exactly the same, except that it's n, and you'll need to multiply out the brackets first.



Just do the same thing on either side of the equals sign at every step.



I'm really struggling with this being considered "advanced" for a 13-14 year old. It's about as basic as algebra gets.

Matrix and rank question?



Two vectors are given as:



x=[1;3;5] and y=[(k-1) (k) (k+1)]



When the two vectors x and y are multiplied, a 3 X 3 matrix is formed. Determine the values of k for which the rank of the (3 X 3) matrix xy will be 1 or 3.

Maths Question Problem?



On Sat, there were 60 less male visitors than female visitors to a park.
On Sun, the number of male visitors increased by 30% while the number of female
visitors decreased by 10%.



If there were a total of 494 visitors on Sunday,
a) find the number of female visitors on Sun.
b) what was the total sum of money collected from the admission fees on both days if each admission ticket to the park cost $4?

</answer from>



<answer>



Let x be the male visitors on Saturday, and y be the female visitors on Saturday:



x + y = 494 (because there were 494 total)
y = x + 60 (because there were 60 more women than men)



If you substitute (x + 60) for y in the first equation, you have:
x + x + 60 = 494
2x + 60 = 494
2x = 434
x = 217



So, on Saturday, there were 217 men and 277 women.  On Sunday:
men went up 30% = 217 * 1.3 = 282
women went down 10% = 277 * 0.9 = 249



So, there were 531 total visitors on Sunday (282 men and 249 women).



To find the money collected, add up the totals from each day and multiply by $4:
(494 + 531) * 4 = 1025 * 4 = $4100

Let there be x females on saturday. Then (x – 60) male on saturday
total visitors = x + x – 60 = 2x + 60
on sunday
female visitors = 0.9x amd male visitors 1.3(x – 60) = 1.3x – 78
total visitors on sunday = 0.9x + 1.3x – 78 = 494
2.2x = 572
x = 260 female on saturday
a) 0.9 × 260 = 234 female on sunday



visitors on saturday
female 260 and male 260 – 60 = 200
total on sunday = 260 + 200 = 460
total on sunday = 494
total on both days = 954
collection = 954 × 4 = $ 3816

<answer>



1)  if the diagonal is 50, then x^2 + y^2 = 50^2 (from Pythagoras)
from area, we know that xy = 1200, or y = 1200 / x



substituting in to the first equation:
x^2 + (1200 / x)^2 = 50^2 = 2500
x^2 + 1440000 / x^2 = 2500
x^4 + 1440000 = 2500 x^2
x^4 - 2500 x^2 + 1440000 = 0
(x^2 -1600)(x^2 - 900) = 0
so x = 40 or x = 30 (for positive values of x)



if x = 40, then y = 1200 / 40 = 30
if x = 30, then y = 1200 / 30 = 40



the dimensions are 30 by 40
(diagonal = 50 and area = 1200)



2)now the equations become:
x^2 + y^2 = 13^2 = 169
xy = 60, or y = 60/x
x^2 + (60/x)^2 = 169
x^4 + 3600 = 169x^2
x^4 - 169x^2 + 3600 = 0
(x^2 - 25)(x^2 - 144) = 0
x = 5 or x = 12 (for positive roots)



the rectangle is 5 by 12 (diagonal = 13 and area = 60)

nott is correct.  however, 3-4-5 and 5-12-13 are well known right triangles.



when i read the first problem, i wondered.
when i read the second, with diagonal of 13, i did the 5x12 multiplication in my head and got 60.



so the 2nd rectangle is 5x12  which has a 31 diagonal.



the first is 30x40 which has an area of 1200  and a diagonal of 50.

162 / 2 = 81
81/3 = 27
27/3 = 9

First, divide by the smallest possible prime number (2).



2×324



Then, do it again, until you can no longer divide by that number.



2×2×162
2×2×2×81



Then, factorise the remaining numbers, if done easily, else divide by the next smallest prime number.



81 = 9×9, and 9 = 3×3



So 648 = 2×2×2×3×3×3×3

Since you have the same amount for each coin, you can solve for x:



.01x + .05x + .10x + .25x = 8.20



.41x = 8.20



divide each side by .41



x = 20



so there are twenty coins of each



20 pennies = .20
20 nickels = 1.00
20 dimes = 2.00
20 quarters = 5.00
total = 8.20

Prove if M is a group?



Prove if M is a group and m^2 = I (the identity) for all m ε M then the group M is commutative.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



If m² = e (the identity) then m = m^-1. In other words,
every element equals its inverse.
Now let a, b be any 2 elements of M
Then ab = (ab)^-1 = b^-1*a^-1.
Since every element equals its inverse, the last
expression equals ba.
Thus ab = ba and the group is abelian.

Using Newtons Method to solve  a problem?



Hi, I'm trying to solve the following problem:



"Use Newton's method with 2 iterations and initial value x1=1 to solve the equation x^3 - x^2 - 1 = 0. Give the answer with 4 decimals."



So I've set up:
f(x) = x^3 - x^2 -1
f´(x) = x (3x - 2)



xn+1 = xn - ( f(x) / f´(x) )



And this is what i got:
n1:
x2 = -1



n2:
x3 = -0.2000



so the answer i came up with is -0.2000, which for me doesn't seem to be right.
Am I doing something wrong?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Youe method is right, but I think you missed a sign or something. Using Newton's Method, if your guess isn't very good, then you might not converge to the root.



f(x) = x³ - x² - 1
f'(x) = 3x² - 2x



x(n+1) = x(n) - f(x)/f'(x)



x(n+1) = 1 - ( 1³ - 1² - 1) / (3(1)² - 2(1))



x(n+1) = 1 - (1-1-1) / (3-2)



x(n+1) = 1 - (-1/1)



x(n+1) = 2  &lt;~~This is the answer after the first iteration



Now, we use this to find x(n+2) with the same procedure
You will find that



x(n+2) = 2 - ( 2³ - 2² - 1) / (3(2)² - 2(2))



x(n+2) = 1.625

f(x) = [5 - x^2]/2 + x^2



Yes, use the quotient rule.



Easy way to remember the quotient rule:
bottom times deriv of top - top times deriv of bottom, all over bottom squared.



top = 5 - x^2
deriv of top = -2x
bottom = 2 + x^2
deriv of bottom = 2x



f'(x) = [(2 + x^2)(-2x) - (5 - x^2)(2x)]/(2 + x^2)^2



f'(x) = 2x[-2 - x^2 - 5 + x^2]/(2 + x^2)^2



f'(x) = 2x[-7]/(2 + x^2)^2



f'(x) = -14x/(4 + 4x^2 + x^4)

yup. the quotient rule is right.



Quotient rule states that: [(low)(dhigh) - (high)(dlow)] / (low)^2



................A........[(B)(dA) - (A)(dB)]
Dx f(x) = -------- = ---------------------------
................B................B^2



so..



Dx (5 - x^2) = -2x
Dx (2+ x^2) = 2x



............5 - x^2
f(x) = ---------------
...........2 + x^2



.........[(2+x^2)(dx 5-x^2) - (5-x^2)(dx 2+x^2)]
f(x) = ----------------------------------------...
........................(2+x^2)^2



..........[(2+x^2)(-2x) - (5-x^2)(2x)]
f(x) = ---------------------------------------
...................2+x^2)^2



simplify:



.................14x
f(x) = -----------------------
...........x^4+4x^2+4

I can't tell whether the (x-4) term is negative or not so I will assume that it is not. Let's put this in general terms:



For the x-4 term, let's say x=a and b=(negative) 4
So c=2x (squared?), d=(negative) 7x, e=8.



so now we have (a+b) * (c+d+e)



So your answer will be (a*c) + (a*d) + (a*e) + (b*c) + (b*d) + (b*e).



For your purposes, that'll be
(x*2x^2) + (x*(-7x)) + (x*8) + (-4*2x^2) + (-4*(-7x)) + (-4*8)
=2x^3 - 7x^2 + 8x - 8x^2 + 28x - 32
=2x^3 -15x^2 + 36x - 32

(x - 4)(2x * -7x + 8) = 0



Multiply 2x and -7x first
(x - 4)(-14x² + 8) = 0



Then distribute. It's still FOIL even though an exponent is different.
-14x³ + 8x + 56x² - 32 = 0
-14x³ + 56x² + 8x - 32 = 0

Please check my solution!?



It's a simple differential equation, but I think I've done something wrong- when I do the checkout it doesn't work...:
dy/dx + (y^2)/(x+1) = 0
dy/dx = -(y^2)/(x+1)
-dy/(y^2) = dx/(x+1)
after integrating both sides:
-(-1/y)=1/y=ln(x+1) + C =&gt;
y=1/(ln(x+1) + C)



what's wrong?

Which two numbers would you combine first to simplify 3 + 6 + 27? Explain.
My answer:  It would not matter which one as described in the commutative property. No matter which way you added the numbers together you would still get the answer of 36



What she wrote: Which 2 numbers are easiest to add first? Remember that the commutative property of addition allows you to move the terms around.

derivate it implicitly, you'll get



2y (dy/dx) + 2x = 4y^3 (dy/dx) - 2



get dy/dx separate for all the other stuff, I'm not going to do that for you. So you'll get (dy/dx) = something. That something will have two unknowns - y and x. Plug in 1 for y and -2 for x, get the answer. Hope that helps!

Differentiate the parts:
2y (dy/dx) + 2x = 4y^3 (dy/dx) - 2



Now plug in your values for the point (-2, 1):
2 (dy/dx) + 2(-2) = 4 (dy/dx) - 2



Solve for dy/dx:
2 (dy/dx) - 4 = 4 (dy/dx) - 2



-2 (dy/dx) = 2
dy/dx = 2/(-2)
dy/dx = -1



Answer:
The slope at the point (-2, 1) is -1

What is a solution of a linear equation called?



a) expression
b) ordered pair



c) matrix



d) exponent



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



An ordered pair is closest, but not really the answer to this, since you didn't specify what kind of linear equation it is..



To find a solution for any equation, you are looking for the value of an unknown variable. Kind of like when you graph an equation, where would x be if y=whatever? Since you didn't specify what kind of linear equation, I'll give both situations.



Say all you want is a solution to just a plain linear equation. Since all you are looking for is x, you are just looking for x, since you aren't really looking for a root, since the equation must equal 0 in order to find a root. However, if you are given y, and you must put the answer in the form of an ordered pair, you would have this:



4=2x+6, where y would be 4. Then solve for x and put it in an ordered pair.



For a system of linear equations, your answer would be an ordered pair, since you are looking for where the lines intersect, that is, if they do.



Either way, the answer is b, but not always.

Math Question Involving Odds (Texas Hold Em)?



In a deck of cards, everyone knows that there are 13 cards, with 4 different suits (i.e. J of clubs, J of hearts, J of spades, J of diamonds) for a total of 52 cards in a deck.



If you are familiar with Texas Hold Em, then you know that players receive 2 cards each, then 5 cards are placed face up on the table.



My question is this:
If there are two players, with two cards each, and 5 cards are placed face up on the table, what are the odds of all four of a card showing up?



Another way of asking the question:
If there are 9 cards in play out of a deck of 52, what are the odds of the same card showing up 4 times?

There are C(52,9) = 3,679,075,400 total ways that 9 cards can be chosen out of 52.



First, choose the rank of the four of a kind. There are 13 of these.  Then, choose 5 out of the remaining 48 cards.



Thus there are 13 * C(48,5) = 13 * 1712304 = 22,259,952
ways to have all four of the same rank.  (Note that this also includes combinations which have all four of two different ranks plus one more card.)



probability = 22,259,952 / 3,679,075,400
= 18 / 2975 ≈ 0.006

First, subtract 1 from both sides and you have
-y &gt; -|x+3| - 1
Now negate both sides and you have
y &lt; |x+3| + 1.



y will be its smallest when x = -3.  At that point y = 1.  So (-3,1) is the vertex.



As x increases to the right, y increases.
As x decreases to the left, y increases.  So the graph looks like a solid V



Shading will be below the line.

-y+1&gt;-|x+3|
-y&gt;-|x+3|-1



multiply both sides by -1(when multiplying by negative switch inequality sign)
y&lt;|x+3|+1



vertex is at (-3,1) (soz cant explain without diagram)
the line will be broken as it is only "less than" not "less than or equal"
and shading below (u test this by subbing in a point on the number plane and seeing if the inequality is true or not)

f(x) = sin(x)
f(x + h) = sin(x + h)



[Here h is a very small quantity indicating change  in sin]



According to first principle of derivatives



Dy/Dx f(x) = lim (h--&gt;0) { [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h }
therefore...



lim (h→0) { (sin(x + h) - sin(x))/h }



= lim (h→0) { (sin(x)cos(h) + sin(h)cos(x) - sin(x))/h }

f(x) = sinx



from the definition of a derivative,



let delta x = Dx
f ' (x) = lim(Dx -&gt;0) [f(x+Dx) - (f(x)] / Dx



= lim(Dx-&gt;0) [sin(x+Dx) - sinx] / Dx



remember that, sin(a =b) = sina cosb + cosa sinb



f ' (x) = lim(Dx-&gt;0) [sinx cos(Dx) + cosx sin(Dx) - sinx] / Dx



= lim(Dx -&gt;0) [sinx(cos(Dx) - 1)] / Dx + lim(Dx -&gt;0) [cosx sin(Dx)] / Dx



= [-lim(Dx -&gt;0) [1-cos(Dx)] / Dx (lim(Dx -&gt;0) sinx)] + [(lim(Dx -&gt;0) cosx) [lim(Dx -&gt;0) sin (Dx)] / Dx] ---&gt;&gt;&gt; equation (2)



theorem1: lim(Dx -&gt;0) [1-cos(Dx)] / Dx = 0
theorem 2: lim(Dx -&gt;0) [sin(Dx)] / Dx = 1



substituting from these equations into (2) we get:



f ' (x) = -0(sinx) + cosx(1)
f ' (x) = cos x

This function is written so you can calculate "y" if you know "t".
The inverse function should give you "t" if you know "y"



Rewrite to express "t" as a function of "y" (solve for "t")



y = 100 * (0.5)^(t/5730)
y / 100 = (0.5)^(t/5730)
log(base 0.5) (y/100) = t/5730
t = 5730 * log(base 0.5) (y/100)



Depending on your situation, you may or may not want to simplify.

<answer>



The above answers are right, but here is why so you'll understand how to do these...



First you just do the math.  If two terms have the same variable (k in the first problem), just add or subtract the numbers attached to them (the coefficients).  The one thing that people forget most often is the signs... if it is a negative you subtract, a positive you add.  Then, you need to get the variable all by itself.  Divide both sides by the number attached to the variable and that is your answer.



In #5, you have to get all the terms with "y" in them on one side of the equation and all the regular numbers (constants) on the other side.  To do this, you either subtract or add the opposite of the term you are trying to move... like this:



-12y - 10



You want to get the -12y on the other side, which also, by the way, turns it into a positive.  You do this by adding +12y to BOTH SIDES (to keep it in balance).



So... -12y +12y - 10 = -6y +12y +14
-10 = 6y + 14



Do the same on the other side, but this time you're getting the +14 over to the left side, so you subtract (negative) because it is a positive.  Understand?



So... -10 -14 = 6y + 14 - 14
-24 = 6y



Now you need to isolate the variable, which means in this case to get rid of the 6 on the 6y.  To do this, divide BOTH SIDES by 6:



-24 / 6 = 6y / 6
-4 = y



See?  You can also write it backwards, which is the usual way:  y = -4



Below is a really good link that explains this for you.  :)

Annette walks 1x Annete.......x
Total distance = 4x + 2x + x = 7x
Total distance = 2100m



x = 2100/7

<answer>



Let the distance each student walked be m for Mark, a for Annette and s for Susan.  Then m + a + s = 2100 m.



Also m = 2a and s = 4a.  Just plug the values for m and s in the first equation and get 2a + a + 4a = 2100.  Therefor 7a = 2100 and a = 2100/7 = 300.



m = 2a =600



s = 4a = 1200

Distance that Annette walks (x) in meters:
2x + x + 4x = 2,100
7x = 2,100
x = 300



Distance that Mark walks in meters:
= 2(300)
= 600



Distance that Sue walks in meters:
= 4(300)
= 1,200



Answer: Annette, 300 meters, Mark, 600 meters, Sue, 1,200 meters or 1.2 kilometers



Proof (Total distance in meters is 2,100):
= 600 + 300 + 1,200
= 2,100

divide the numerator (top number) by the denominator (bottom number)



you would NOT multiply it by 100, unless you were asked to find the percentage of the fraction

What level of measurement would this data be considered?



I just took my first Prob & Stat exam, and I was shocked that the two questions I was unsure of was with the easiest part of the material. What level of measurement would the following two types of data be at:



1.) Ages of a sample of survey participants (I couldn't decide whether this would be considered ordinal or ratio).
2.) Sample of spheres from softest to hardest. (I found this one hard because I couldn't get a visual image in my head of a sample of hard and soft spheres - spheres? wtf?)

1: Ratio level (A 20-year-old is twice as old as a 10-year-old.)



#2: I would argue Ordinal level (Because there's no apparent numerical designation of relative hardness, and the 'labels' are ranked.) If, however, there's a numerical designation of the hardness (say, density), you could argue the Ratio level.

Don't panic!  lol  It's very simple...



a fraction is the top number divided by the bottom number:



5/13 = .384646153 x 100 = 38.46%



Just round it to two digits on the right side of the decimal or whatever your teacher tells you to do.



Simple, see?

First, factor the trinomial.  I came up with:



(3x +71)(x-16)



Now solve for 0 with both factors:



3x + 71 = 0  and x - 16 = 0



3x + 71 = 0
3x = -71
x = -71/x  (that is -71 over x)



x - 16 = 0
x = 16



The roots of this equation are x = 16 and x = -71/x

1st value of x:
3x² + 23x = 1,136
x² + 23/3x =  1,136/3
x² + 23/6x =  1,136/3 + (23/6)²
x² + 23/6x =  13,632/36 + 529/36
(x + 23/6)² =  14,161/36
x + 23/6 = 119/6
x =  119/6 - 23/6
x =  96/6 or 16



2nd value of x:
= - 119/6 - 23/6
= - 71/3 or - 23 2/3



Answer: x = 16, - 71/3



Proof (x = 16):
3(16²) + 23(16) = 1,136
3(256) + 368 = 1,136
768 + 368 = 1,136
1,136 = 1,136



Proof (x = - 71/3):
3(- 71/3)² + 23(- 71/3) = 1,136
3(5,041/9) - 1,633/3 = 1,136
5,041/3 - 1,633/3 = 1,136
3,408/3 = 1,136
1,136 = 1,136

Question about Normal distribution?



There's a question in my maths book that says "Which of the four sets of data most closely fits a normal distribution?"



I just want to know how do i find out which set of data most closely fits a normal distribution, in the easiest way if possible. And it would be good to know how i can show that in excel, possibly with graphs.

The most graphical way is to do a a pair of histograms -- one of an ideal distribution and one of your data.



(Or alternately, you can illustrate an ideal normal distribution with a line graph, and your data with a bar-histogram).



As you probably know, 2.28% of the area under the normal curve falls below 2 standard deviations below the mean, 13.2% bewteen 2 standard deviations below the mean and 1 standard deviation below the mean, 34.2% between 1 standard deviation below the mean and the mean, 34.2% between the mean and 1 standard deviation above the mean, 13.2% between 1 standard deviation above the mean and 2 standard deviations above the mean, and 2.28% beyond 2 standard deviations above the mean.



Which ever data set(s) follow this approximate breakdown are very likely normally distributed.



If you know how to use the histogram tool in Excel's analysis toolbox, you can use that, specifying the bins in standard deviations. Or it really isn't difficult to do by hand. Just calculate the mean and standard deviation of each set, and off ya' go.

lol ok...im gunna show my working lol......



ok



so each girl has 7 bags...so 7x7=49
so one cat has 7 lil cats....so 7 sets of 8 cats
which is 7x8=56



so what we've got so far is that there is 56 cats PER BAG
so in 49 bags thered be 49x56=2744 cats
thats ALL the cats on the bus



now for the legs
2744x4=10976 cat legs on board



&



7x2=14



and bags dont have legs so altoghether...
10976+14=10990 legs all together!!!



lol hope you got that!

girls = 7
#bags = 7*7 = 49
#big cats = 49*7 = 343
#small cats = 343*7 = 2401



#cats = 343+2401 = 2744



#cat legs = 2744*4 = 10976
#girl legs = 7*2 = 14



Total number of legs = 10976+14 = 10990



Of course, that's not counting the bus driver. Perhaps one of the girls is driving the bus???

<answer>



1 girl has 2 legs
so 7 girl's total legs are 14



1 girl has 7 bags
so 7 girls have 7 * 7 = 49 bags



1 bag has 7 big cats
so 49 bags have 49 * 7 = 343 big cats



Each cat has 4 legs
so 343 cats have 343 * 4 = 1372 legs



1 big cat has 7 small cats
so 343 big cats have 343 * 7 = 2401 small cats



Again 2401 small cats will have 2401 * 4 = 9604 legs



so total legs = 14 + 1372 + 9604 = 10990
So in the bus there are 10990 legs in all

Difficult to tell without more context.



However, it could mean that the answer is a function of n-squared.  You can replace the sum of (functions, I presume) something that goes from j=2 to n (meaning n-1 elements) with a single function (called theta) where the only variable is n^2.



The only place where I have seen this as a formal notation is in the determination of bounds (a number known to be no smaller than the answer).  A bound is often easier to calculate and may be sufficient to prove (or disprove) a claim.  It is sometimes used to verify algorithms.



For example, if someone claims that adding all the numbers from 2 to 100 gives a million, you can check for a bound (the answer is known to be smaller than n^2 = 10,000) so that you can disprove the claim without having to actually perform the entire calculation.



But, again, I have no idea if your particular problem has anything to do with that.

If I remember correctly, it means that the sum from 2 to n has a result that is directly related to n^2.  In other word, when you sum from 2 to n, the resulting sum is equal to



n * (n+1) / 2 - 1 = 0.5 n^2 + 0.5 n - 1.



The highest power of n dictates what goes inside the Θ( )

Integrate:



∫x/√(9-x²) dx



u = 9-x²
du = -2xdx



∫x/√(9-x²) dx
= ∫(-1/2)(1/√u)du
= (-1/2)∫u^(-1/2)du
= (-1/2)u^(1/2)/(1/2)
= -√u
= -√(9-x²)



Apply the limits to get
-√(9-3²) + √(9-(-1)²)
= √8
= 2√2



The integral is convergent

∫ x dx / sqrt(9 - x^2)



Let x = 3sin∅
dx = 3cos∅d∅



sqrt(9(1 - sin^2(∅)) = 3cos∅



∫ 3sin∅ 3cos∅d∅ / 3cos∅ = 3∫sin∅d∅ =



- 3cos∅
Since sin∅ = x/3, then
x^2 + (b)^2 = 9
b = sqrt(9 - x^2)
cos∅ = sqrt(9 - x^2) / 3



-3 sqrt(9 - x^2) / 3 = -sqrt(9 - x^2)



F(b) - F(a) = -sqrt(9 - 9) + sqrt(9 - 1) = sqrt(8) = 2 sqrt(2)



This integral wasn't really improper because between a = -1 and b = 3, the curve exists and is continuous.

How would i solve this equation:

If i use trial function x = acost + bsint
then dx/dt = -asint + bcost



subbing in to equation gives:



-asint +bcost + 6acost + 6bsint = 5cos3t
now this is where im stuck, would this be right
-a + 6b = 0
b+6a = 5

I assume this is

If you want it in x and y coordinates, multiply through by r



r^2 = r sin Θ + r cos Θ



x^2 + y^2 = y + x



x^2 - x + y^2 - y = 0



x^2 - x + 1/4 + y^2 - y + 1/4 = 1/4 + 1/4



(x - 1/2)^2 + (y - 1/2)^2 = 1/2



This is a circle centered at (1/2, 1/2) with a radius of sqrt(2) / 2

log (base 2) 8 = 3
log (base 4) 8 = 3 / 2
log (base 8) 8 = 1
log (base 16) 8 = log (base 16) (16/2) = 1  log (base 16) 2 = 1 - 1/4 = 3 / 4



log (base 2^n) 8 = [log (base 8) 8] / [log (base 8) 2^n] =



= 1 / [n log (base 8) 2] = 1 / [n  * 1/3)] = 3 / n

<question>



Could you help me with a couple of maths problems?? :)?



An electricity company supplies electricity to a family with the following charges : -



Standing charge : 9.13 pence per day
Electricity used : 6.19 pence per unit



VAT of 5 % is added to the total.



The Green family receives a bill for 91 days.
In that time, they had used a total of 1272 units of electricity.



Calculate the amout that the Greens have to pay. Show your working clearly.



Can you do it for me?? I mean.. not ALL of it . Could you just tell me HOW to do it & what sums I need to do please?? :)
Because I need to learn how to it as my teacher hasn't told me at all :/



Bad teacher... :P
Thank you very mucho x



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



91 x 9.13 is the standing charge.



1272 x 6.19 is the charge for electricity used.



Work those out and add them together to give the total, then:



total x 5/100 is the vat.



Add the vat on to the total.



Hope helps.

Can anyone help with finding these eigenvalues?



Hi everyone,



The characteristic equation is this:



(α + 1 - µ) (α + 1 - µ) – 4 =0



where µ represents the eigen values.



Now the eigen values are apparently α - 1  and α + 3 but I haven't got a clue how to factorise the terms. Can anyone help? Much appreciated if you can.

(4x^2-3y^2)/(2x^2+5y^2)=12/19
cross multiply ,u will get a second degree equation in x and y
divide the whole equation by y^2

cross multiply so we get
19(4x^2 - 3y^2) = 12(2x^2 + 5y^2)
76x^2 - 57y^2 = 24x^2 + 60y^2
76x^2 - 24x^2 = 60y^2 + 57y^2
52x^2 = 117y^2
x^2 / y^2 = 117 / 52
taking square root on both sides we get
x / y = √117 /√52
x / y = √(13 * 9) / √(13 * 4)
x / y = √9 / √4
x / y = 3/2
therefore x:y = 3:2

[QUESTION 1]
4x^4 - 18x^2 = 0



Factor out a 2x^2 from both terms on the left-hand side:



(2x^2)(2x^2 - 9) = 0 ...eq. [1]



Eq. [1] is satisfied when either of the terms on the left-hand side of the equation is equal to zero. So, set each term equal to zero, and solve for 'x':



2x^2 = 0
x^2 = 0
x = 0



2x^2 - 9 = 0
2x^2 = 9
x^2 = 9/2
x = 3/sqrt(2)
x = 3sqrt(2)/2



So, the solutions are x = 0 and x = 3sqrt(2)/2.



[QUESTION 2]
x^4 - 81 = 0



Factor by the difference of two squares:



(x^2 + 9)(x^2 - 9) = 0 ...eq. [2]



Eq. [2] is satisfied when either of the terms on the left-hand side of the equation is equal to zero. So, set each term equal to zero, and solve for 'x':



x^2 + 9 = 0
x^2 = -9
x = +/- sqrt(-9)
x = +/- 3i



x^2 - 9 = 0
x^2 = 9
x = sqrt(9)
x = +/- 3



So, the solutions are x = +/- 3i and x = +/- 3.



[QUESTION 3]
x^3 + 216 = 0
x^3 = -216
x = -6



So, the solution is x = -6.



[QUESTION 4]
5x^3 + 30x^2 + 45x = 0



Factor a 5x from each term on the left-hand side of the equation:



5x(x^2 + 6x + 9) = 0
5x(x + 3)^2 = 0 ...eq. [3]



Eq. [3] is satisfied when either of the terms on the left-hand side of the equation is equal to zero. So, set each term equal to zero, and solve for 'x':



5x = 0
x = 0



(x + 3)^2 = 0
x + 3 = 0
x = -3



So, the solutions are x = -3 and x = 0.



Hope this helps!

outside is sine , inside is (x+y)



derivative outsise cos and keep inside so its cos(x+y) then time derivative inside
cos(x+y)*(x+y)'



assume x or y is constant then derivative(x+y) = 1
so answer is cos(x+y)

Farming = more food and capital for civilizations



This capital will be converted into technology (so some of money made from farming will go to taxes and gov't, and the money can go to research and development)



Control is important because, back then, farming + land = power. The Hittites would have wanted power, so they would want farming land.



Please don't take this word by word, rephrase and use your own words (or at least cite this - it might be wrong, too).

Math Question Trigonometry?



an ant leaves his home to search for food. when he catches a whiff, he leaves off at a speed of pi/2 inches per second. after 30 seconds he realizes that he's been moving around a circle of a 5 inch radius. how many times has he gone around the circle? (Best answer must be supported)(related to trigonometry)



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



He has been moving at pi/2 inches per sec for 30 secs, so he has travelled a distance of



30 x pi/2



= 15 pi inches.



Circumference of circle = 2 pi r



= 2 x pi x 5



= 10 pi inches



Number of times round the circle



= 15pi/10pi



= 1.5 times.

You need to get x on one side so you can find out what "x" is.
3x+8=20-3x
6x+8=20 (i did this to get the variable on one side. I added the 3x from the right side on both sides so I could cancel the x on that side and isolate the variable)
6x=12 (I subtracted 8 from both sides to get the 6x alone as a variable)
x=2 (divided both sides by 6)

OK, Gran - rearrange things to get all the x values on one side (usually the left) and all the number values on the other side. Then add up each side and divide across by the x coefficient. See below:



3x + 8 = 20 - 3x



3x + 3x = 20 - 8 (signs change when you switch sides)



6x = 12



x = 2

<answer>



Your rates are correct: r -c and r + c. So we have two variable, but c = 6 kph.



We know Rate X time = Distance and we know that the distance up stream equals the distance down stream so:
(r - 6)*5 =( r +6)*3



I will leave it to you to solve for r.

<answer>



you're correct about the upstream down stream thing



Distance = rate * time
rate upstream = r-6
rate downstream = r+6
time ups = 5
time dwns = 3
so:
distance ups = 5(r-6)
distance dwns = 3(r+6)



BUT SINCE HE TOOK THE SAME PATH GOING AND LEAVING, WE CAN SAY THAT THE DISTANCES ARE EQUAL...
Get it?



so:
distance ups = distance dwns
5(r-6) = 3(r+6)
5r - 30 = 3r +18
5r-3r = 18 +30
2r = 48
r= 24 kph



D = rate* time
so: substitute in any one of the equations:
lets try down stream:
D dwns = 3(r +6)
D dwns = 3(24+6)
D dwns = 3(30)
D dwns = 90 km



lets try the upstream
D ups = 5(r-6)
D ups = 5(24-6)
D ups = 5(18)
D ups = 90 km
theyre just the same so... tadaaaa.



total distance traveled = D ups + D dwns
total D = 90 + 90
total D = 180 km



hope it helped...

The probability that a girl is selected doesn't really depend on what family is selected.



There are 11 girls and 11 boys.  The total number of children is 22.



Thus the probability of selecting a girl is 11/22 = 0.5

In f(x), substitute (x + ∆x) everywhere you see x.  In other words,



[(x + ∆x)^3 - x^3]/ ∆x



expand, combine like terms, find common factors, ...

<answer>



1.  Use u substitution



Let u = e^x  (The exponent)
then du = e^x dx



Integrate e^u (du) = e^u + C



The answer is e^(e^x) + C



2. Again, use u substitution
Let u = -2 / x = -2 x^(-1)
du = 2 x^(-2) dx
dx = 0.5 x^2 du



Substitute in



Integrate e^u (3/2) du
= (3/2) e^u +C



= (3/2) e^(-2/x) +C

<answer>



Use "u-substitution" on both of the problems.



[QUESTION 1]
Let u = e^x
....du = (e^x)dx



So, now you have the integral of:



(e^u)du



Integrating this gives:



e^u + C



Where "C" is a constant of integration. This is included since you didn't specify any limits of integration. Now, substitute back to get your answer in terms of 'x':



e^(e^x) + C ...[sol'n]



[QUESTION 2]
Before doing anything, take the 1/3 to the outside of the integral. You can do this since it is a constant. So, now  you have 1/3 multiplied by the integral of:



[e^(-2/x)] / x^2



Let u = -2/x
....du = (2/x^2)dx =&gt; (1/2)du = (1/x^2)dx



Now, the integral becomes 1/3 times this:



(1/2)(e^u)du



Integrating this gives:



(1/3)(1/2)e^u + C



Where "C" is a constant of integration. Now substitute back to get your answer in terms of 'x':



(1/6)e^(-2/x) + C ...[sol'n]



Hope this helps!

You have to first know the differentials of some functions !!!



d/dx (e^x ) = e^x



so integral e^x = e^x



Niow substitute u=e^x  so get e^u and du/dx =u



2) substitute u = -2/x  and note du = 2 dx/x^2



Now they shd only take a couple of minutes max each !!!

this is the working equation



[3^x + 5(3)^(-x)]/2 = 3



[3^x + 5(3)^(-x)] = 6



3^x + 5/(3)^x = 6
see that write the 3^(-x) in the denominator so that it will have a positive exponent



then i'll be multiplying the whole equation by 3^x
3^2x + 5 = 6(3^x)



now you let 3^x = . this is an equation in the quadratic form.
y^2 + 5 = 6y



y^2 - 6y + 5 = 0



(y - 5)(y - 1) = 0



y is either = 5 or = 1



remember that y = 3^x so



3^x = 1 and 3^x = 5



x = 0 and x = (log5)/(log3) = log(base3)(5) =  1.4650

Don't believe in the first answer, that's completely stupid.
The given is already factored. I tried to factor it but nothing seems to work. Trial and error:
If you factor it with (x^2-2)(x^2+2), the answer would be (x^4-4). wrong.
If you factor it with (x^2-2)(x^2-2), the answer would be (x^4-4x+4). wrong.



Maybe you made a typographical error? Is the sign correct?
Hope I helped in some way.

The area of a triangle is A = 1/2(base)(altitude). It is a linear equation. If A remains the same, then a change of one of the parameters will result in an opposite change by the same amount in the other parameter. So, a 10% change in the base would equate to a -10% change in altitude.

28.1 How many litres of water are in the tank, if it is always kept 2/3
full?
(Leave the answer in terms of π .)
[Hint: Volume of cylinder = πr2h where r is the radius and h the height.]



28.2 Suppose that the inside of the tank (including the base) is painted with a waterproof paint that costs R20 per
litre, and 4/5
of a litre is used for every square metre. How much does it cost to paint the tank? (Leave the
answer in terms of π .)



28.3 Suppose the shelter has shadecloth over the top and around all four sides. How many square meters of
shadecloth must be provided?
28.4 Suppose a bigger tank must be built underneath the same shelter. Two options are considered. For tank 1
the radius of the given tank is increased by 1/2
m; for tank 2 the height of the given tank is increased by 1/2
m.

GRAPHS experts : does f lie below, on top or on the x axis? ?



SKETCH = http://i55.photobucket.com/albums/g154/A...



The sketch above shows the hyperbola defined by y = f (x) = h/x , the straight line defined by y = g (x) = mx +c, and a parabola (the graph of some function k) whose axis of symmetry passes through Q.
The point (2, −4) lies on the hyperbola. R is a point on the x–axis and P is a point on the line so that RP is parallel
to the y–axis and cuts the hyperbola at Q. The length of QR is 3 units.



16.1 Find the equation of the straight line through M and L.



16.2 Use the graph to find all the x–values for which

Help determining the functions inverse?



Find f(g(x)) and g(f(x)) and determine whether the pair of functions f and g are inverses of eachother.



f(x)=6x-8
g(x)=(x+6)/8



The answers need to be simplified and I need to see the problem worked out step by step.



Thanks



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



f(g(x)) = 6[ (x+6)/8 ] - 8
f(g(x)) = (6x + 36)/8 - 8
f(g(x)) = 3x/4 + 4.5 - 8
f(g(x)) = 3x/4 - 3.5
f(g(x)) = (3x - 14) / 4



g(f(x)) = ( (6x + 8) + 6) / 8
g(f(x)) = (6x + 14) / 8
g(f(x)) = (3x + 7) / 4



f(x) = 6x - 8
y = 6x - 8
To find the inverse of this function, solve for x in terms of y:



y + 8 = 6x
x = (y + 8) / 6
This does not match g(x), so f(x) and g(x) are not inverses of each other.

assuming that the first column is the score you received second column is score that was possible.  Adding all of the first column together gives you 361.  Adding the second column gives you 450.



361/450=80.2%



How this converts to a grade depends a great deal on your professor.  I've had some who require a 99 for a 4.0 and have had others where you could get the same grade with a 90.

Statistics problem !!!?



In a group of 8 manufactured items, 2 are known to be defective. If you buy 2 of them;



a-) What is the probability that none is defective? At most one is defective?



b-) What is the mean number of defectives? Find the standard deviation.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



(a). P(none is defective)
= P(one is not defective) * P(one is not defective)
= [1-(2/8)]*[1-(2/8)]
= (6/8) * (6/8)
= (3/4)*(3/4)
= 9/16



P(at most one is defective)
= P(one is defective)*P(one is not defective)
+ P(one is not defective) * P(one is defective)
= (2/8)* [1-(2/8)] + [1-(2/8)]* (2/8)
= (1/4)*(6/8) + (6/8)*(2/8)
= (1/4)*(3/4) + (3/4)*(1/4)
= 3/16 + 3/16
= 6/16
= 3/8



(b).
Mean number of defectives
= 2*(2/8)
= 2*(1/4)
= 2/4
= 1/2

Need help setting up Excel spreadsheet for complicated salary distribution.?



Someone already gave me the principle behind the distribution but I need help putting this all into Excel.
A bit of a weird situation but here goes:



I'm leader of a guild in a game and the guild get 10 million gold for each territory we own. Our distribution for the weekly salary is based on the players level. The idea is to add up the levels of all the players who attended each week, then 10mil (8mil for the first week) divided by the total player level...and that amount is then multiplied by each player's respective level, which determines how much they get.



Since there are a LOT of members, it would be useful to put this into a spreadsheet, but I am terrible with Excel so I need some guidance.



I would like to have each players name in one column, and then a seperate column for each of their levels for every territory battle we have...so I know how to distribute money based on which one they attend.



I'll also need to be able to change the total amount we get each from from 10 mil to 20 mil to 30mil as we win more land...



I hope this isn't too hard. If someone can even tell me the basic formula to type into a box in Excel it would help....

<answer>



When you substitute -1(for x) in your first equation you will get zero.
So this is the first root of your equation to find the next one. We would make this (x + 1) at the bottom when we factorise. Set -1 in the curlly braces and the co-efficients of your equation aside.
i.e
{-1} 1  2  -11  -12



0  -1  -1



12



-----------------------



1  1  -12



0



Then take the answer you got i.e 1  1  -12



0 and substitute x's to get the equation x^2 + x -12 (Note that the co-efficients here are what you got above)



Now factories: Remember above we have (x + 1), so
(x + 1)(x^2 + x -12) = 0
(x + 1)(x + 4)(x - 3) = 0
x = -1 or x = -4 or x = 3



We have the roots now we still need to solve the equation:
a^2+b^2+y^2
set a = -1, b = -4 and y = 3
Then
(-1)^2+(-4)^2+(3)^2
= 26



Hope this helps, Cheers

for a cubic equation ax^3+bx^2+cx+d
the sum of the roots would be α+β+γ=-b/a
αβ+βγ+αγ=c/a
αβγ=-d/a
now a^2+b^2+y^2 can be written as
(a+b+c)^2=a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ca)
here a+b+c=-2
ab+bc+ca=-11
a^2+b^2+y^2=26

there is an easy way to calculate compound interest.....



you do the amount invested times the percentage interest as a decimal plus one, to the power of however many years, so for example in your case...



950 * 1.07^5 = 1332.42 (2dp)

<answer>



The equation is of the form y = mx + c, where m is the slope, and c the y intercept



The slope is the change in y divided by the corresponding change in x:



The change in y = (4 - 0) = 4



The corresponding change in x is (2 - 3) = -1, so the slope is -4.and



y = -4x + c



When x = 2, y = 4, so



4 = -4*2 + c, so



4 = -8 + c, so



c = 12, and



y = -4x + 12.

Thanks for any help received. It is very much appreciated.

</answer from>



<answer>



Dividing by x, the integral becomes
∫ (9*x^2-11)  dx, from [1,8]
= 9x^3/3 - 11x from [1,8]
=3x^3-11x from [1,8]
when x=8, 3(8)^3 -11(8) = 1536 -88 =1448
when x=1, 3(1)^3 -11(1) = -8
Subtracting , 1448-(-8) = 1456

you put all constants on the right side



- |x + 2| = 2



- |x + 2| = -22



the first equation has no answer because the absolute value of a number is always positive.



now for the 2nd equation



|x + 2| = 22
x + 2 = 22 and x + 2 = -22
giving x = 20 and x = -24

10 - |x + 2| = 12



Subtract 10 from each side:



-|x + 2| = 2



Multiply by -1:



|x + 2| = -2



Since the absolute value of anything at all is zero or larger, then there's  no x to make this absolute value equal to -2.



So the equation has no solution.

the first one 10 - |x + 2| = 12 is wrong as when we solve,
-|x+2| =12 - 10
-|x+2| = 2
|x+2| is a positive value and after getting minus it will be negative
but on the right hand side 2 is positive



Second equation
10 - |x + 2| = -12



- |x + 2| = -12 - 10
- |x + 2| = -22
we can say that x+2 = 22 (as minus sign is both side)
therefore,



x = 22-2



x=20



i really don't know how there will be 2 values !

1)  1kg=1,000g, so you do 25 x 1,000, and the answer is 25,000 g.
2)  1L=1,000mL, so 9.3 x 1,000, and the answer is 9,300mL.
3) 1mm=1,000um, so .36 x 1,000, and the answer is 360um.
4) 1km=100,000cm, so for this one, you do 24 divided by 100,000, and the answer would either be .00024km, or 2.4 x 10 to the -4 power (if you don't understand exponents, then just write .00024)
5) 1mi=1.61km, so you do 3.4 x 1.61, and the answer is 5.474km.
6) 1lb=453.59 grams, so you do 180 x 453.49, and the answer is 81646.2 grams.
7) 1L=33.81 fluid ounces, so you do 33.81 x 3, and the answer is 101.43 fluid ounces.

<answer>



let a = 3^x
b = 2^x



notice that the equation becomes
8a^2 + 3ab - 81b^2 = 0
(a - 3b) (8a + 27b) = 0



thus



a = 3b
or  a = -27b/8



then
3^x = 3*2^x
or 3^x = (-27/8)*2^x .... this second one is not possible



thus
3^x = 3* 2^x
3^(x-1) = 2^x
get the logarithm of both sides .
(x-1) log3 = x log2
x log3 - log3 = x log2
(log3 - log2) x = log3
thus
x = log3 / (log3 - log2)

<answer>



First, a spelling tip: "squared" instead of "squered"



This binomial is the difference of two squares.  Both 4x^2 and 16 are, individually, perfect squares:
4x^2 = (2x)(2x)
16 = (4)(4)



There is a formula you should remember for factoring when you are given the difference of two squares:
a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b)



Since a = 2x, and b = 4, this means that the binomial can be factored as:
(2x - 4)(2x + 4)

<answer>



It's a difference of squares. These are very cool little equations, because, when everything is a perfect square like that, in a second degree binomial, you can simply take the square root of each: 2, x, and 4, and write:



(2x+4)(2x-4)



pull a 2 out of each



2(x+2)2(x-2)



Group your terms.



4(x+2)(x-2)



Quick and easy, if you know how to solve perfect squares.



Let's do a check. Let x=3



Original equation:



4(3)^2 -16 = ?
4(9) -16 =?
36-16=20



And the simplified equation:



4((3)+2)((3)-2)
4(5)(1) = ?



4(5) = 20



It works.

now, back 2 your question, 4x^2 - 16



it can be factored out first by 4



so,,, 4(x^2 - 4)



ok??next, use the formula, (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b²



4(sqrtx^2 - sqrt4)(sqrtx^2 + sqrt4)



which is  4(x - 2)(x + 2)



that is the answer!!!

The trick for this one is to locate the vertex. You do this by completing the square and get this in the form



a(x-h)^2+k=0  Then the vertex is (h,k)  Since the coefficient of the x^2 term is positive this parabola will open up or hold water. This means it's decreasing on( -infinity,h) and increasing on (h, + infinity)

You have two ways to find an answer. The one is to put it in a graph, then see where it is "increasing? decreasing?"



When a &gt; 0 then function is decreasing (-∞,-b/2a) and increasing (-b/2a, +∞).



When a &gt; 0 then function is increasing (-∞,-b/2a) and decreasing (-b/2a, +∞).



For your function, -b/2a=-3, a&gt;0, which means that function is decreasing (-∞,-3) and increasing (-3, +∞).

Whether a function is increasing or decreasing can be determined by analyzing it's slope. If the slope of a function is positive, the function is increasing; if it is negative, the function is decreasing.



So, keeping that in mind, we need to analyze the slope of the given function:



f(x) = x^2 + 6x - 4 ...eq. [1]



To get the slope function of f(x), we take the first derivative of f(x) in eq. [1], which gives:



f '(x) = 2x + 6 ...eq. [2]



Now, there exist points on functions where the function is neither increasing nor decreasing. In other words, the tangent line has a horizontal slope (slope = 0). These are called critical points. Also, it is at these critical points where the function switches from increasing to decreasing (the critical point is a maximum), or vice versa (the critical point is a minimum). We need to find these points. Since the slopes at these points are equal to zero, we set eq. [2] equal to zero and solve for 'x':



2x + 6 = 0
2x = -6
x = -3



So, we only have one critical point, and that is at x = -3. So, we at least know the function switches directions (increasing/decreasing) at this point, but we don't know how exactly. To determine this, find the slope at a point to the left of x = -3 and at a point to the right of x = -3. I will use x = -10 and x = 0 for my two points. (NOTE: You can use any two points, but one has to be to the left of x = -3 and one has to be to the right of x = -3.) Evaluate the slope at these two values:



@ x = -10:
f '(-10) = 2(-10) + 6



f '(-10) = -20 + 6



f '(-10) = -14



...so, the function is decreasing to the left of x = -3.



@ x = 0:
f '(0) = 2(0) + 6
f '(0) = 0 + 6
f '(0) = 6



...so, the function is increasing to the right of x = -3.



So, to sum this up:



Decreasing: (-INFINITY, -3)
Increasing: (-3, +INFINITY)



That is how you would write your results in interval notation.



Hope this helps!

VA: zeros of denominator (x + 9)(x - 8) ==&gt; x = -9 and x = 8



HA: limit of 8x^2 / x^2 as x ==&gt; + / - infinity
y = 8



alternatively:
divide everything by x^2
y = (8 + 1/x - 2/x^2) / (1 + 1/x - 72/x^2)
as x gets really big, 1/x and 1/x^2 get really small and tend toward 0
this leaves 8 / 1 as the end behavior as x ==&gt; +/- inf
y = 8 is the HA



*** you should also check to make sure the -9 and 8 are not zeros of the numerator (they aren't)-- that would become a removable discontinuity instead of a VA

<answer>



y = (8x^2 + x - 2) / (x^2 + x - 72) ...eq. [1]



First, let's find the vertical asymptotes. These occur when the function has a denominator of zero. So, set the denominator of eq. [1] equal to zero, and solve for 'x':



x^2 + x - 72 = 0
(x + 9)(x - 8) = 0 ...eq. [2]



Eq. [2] is satisfied when either term on the left-hand side of the equation is equal to zero. So, set each term equal to zero, and solve for 'x':



x + 9 = 0
x = -9



x - 8 = 0
x = 8



So, at x = -9 and x = 8, there are vertical asymptotes.



Now, to find the horzontal asymptotes, compare the degree of the polynomial in the numerator to the degree of the polynomial in the denominator. The degree of the polynomial in the numerator, in this case, is the same as the degree of the polynomial in the denominator. They are both second degree. Since this is the case, we can just compare the x^2 term in the numerator and the x^2 term in the denominator while ignoring everything else.



To find the horzontal asymptote, just take the x^2 term from the numerator, and divide it by the x^2 term in the denominator. (NOTE: This only works when the polynomials in the numerator and denominator are the same!)



(8x^2) / (x^2)
= 8 / 1
= 8



So, there is a horizontal asymptote at y = 8.



Hope this helps!

How to find square footage on a grid with two different scales?



autocad, drafting question:
I have a grid set up that is scaled:



1"=2' vertical, 1"=20' horizontal



I have a ditch that we've surveyed and plotted on this profile.  I have figured out the area of the ditch.  It comes to 1259.5543 square feet.  However, since i'm on a 2 and 20 scale, what do i need to do to get this in the correct square footage?
Thanks!

<answer>



I'm not sure your original numbers in the reduced scale, so I'll just give an example instead.



If you had a 1" x 1 " square that would represent the following area:



(1" * 20'/1") * (1" * 2'/1") = 40 square feet



or if you had a 5"x3" square  (this is horizontal by vertical.  I'm not an engineer so I won't assume your notation is the same as mine.):



(5" * 20'/1") * (3" * 2'/1") = 600 square feet

Let's say your GPA for the fall is G.  Then in order for your full GPA to average out to be 3.6, you need to have (G + 3.27)/2 = 3.6.  Solving this for G gives G = 3.93.  So basically, yes it's possible, but only if you get all "A"s.

Geezah is almost right, but he's not doing a weighted average like he should be...

You see, we can't really know what your GPA could be unless you tell us what your total number of hours is. For example, if you had only 20 hours total (plus 10 summer and 18 in the fall), it would be easy to bring it up. But if you had 200 hours (plus 10 plus 18), it would be much harder, because your new grades don't carry as much weight.

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------



So let's say this: Assume you have H hours so far.

Those H hours are weighted as 3.27.
The 10 summer hours are weighted as 3.1.**
The 18 fall hours are weighted 4.0.***

**This is the "worst" case possible. You've told us "3 Bs and 1 A" but that doesn't tell us how many hours each class is. If the A is in a 2 hour class, or a 4 hour class, that's a big difference.

***This is the "best" case possible. You want to know if it's "possible" so the best you can do is a 4.0. We will use this to determine H.

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------



So you have:

H(3.27) + 10(3.1) + 18(4) = Total Grade Points (GP)
H + 10 + 18 = Total Hours

Simplify:
GP = 3.27H + 103
Hours = H + 28

We you want:
3.6 ≤ GPA = GP / Hours



3.6 ≤ (3.27H + 103) / (H + 28)

3.6(H+28) ≤ 3.27H + 103

3.6H + 100.8 ≤ 3.27H + 103

(3.6 - 3.27)H ≤ 103 - 100.8

0.33 H ≤ 2.2

H ≤ 2.2 / 0.33 = 6.666...

So, the actual real answer to your question is:

YES if you have at most 6 hours so far (before this summer).

NO if you have more than 6 hours so far.

The fewer hours you have, the easier it will be to bring up the average, but you need 6 or fewer for it to be possible. If you get better than a 3.1 in the summer, it will also or make possible or easier your ability to bring up the average.

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------



You can also use more variables and figure it out:

H hours are weighted as 3.27
The 10 summer hours are weighted as S
The 18 fall hours are weighted G

Now you have three variables:
H = total number of yours
S = summer GPA
G = target GPA

You still use the same equations as before, but with the new variables instead of the guesses from before:
GP = 3.27H + 10S + 18G
Hours = H + 28

You want to find the minimum possible G so that:

3.6 ≤ GPA = GP / Hours

3.6 ≤ (3.27H + 10S + 18G) / (H + 28)

3.6(H + 28) ≤ 3.27H + 10S + 18G

3.6H + 100.8 ≤ 3.27H + 10S + 18G

0.33H + 100.8 - 10S ≤ 18G

18G ≥ 0.33H + 100.8 - 10S

G ≥ 5.6 + 0.0183333H - 0.555S

Now, for this to be possible, the value of G must be bigger than the right-hand side. But notice the 5.6 -- this is what kills your chances. G cannot be that big. The only way to balance that out is to hope that your S value (summer GPA) is high enough to outweigh this (since that part is subtracted). Even then, if you have a large H value (total hours so far, before the summer), it will not be possible.

As you can see, if you get a 4.0 in the summer, you come to:

G ≥ 5.6 + 0.0183333H - 0.555(4)

G ≥ 5.6 + 0.0183333H - 2.22

G ≥ 3.38 + 0.0183333H

And to have a minimal G value of at least 4 you need:

4 = 3.38 + 0.0183333H

0.62 = 0.0183333H

H = 0.62/0.0183333 = 33.8182

At most 33 hours.

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------



So here's a different "final answer":

If you get a 3.1 this summer, you need to get a 4.0 in the fall AND have at most 6 hours total before the summer.

If you get a 4.0 this summer, you need to get a 4.0 in the fall AND have at most 33 hours total before the summer.

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------



If you get less than a 4.0 this fall, it becomes harder/impossible.

For example, if you get five As and just one B, that's a 3.83333333 GPA for the fall. That changes our problem to:

3.833 = 3.38 + 0.0183333H

0.453 = 0.0183333H

H = 0.453 / 0.0183333 = 24.709

You can only have at most 24 hours (instead of the 33 we said before).

------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------



To give you an idea of an impossible scenario, we know that this is your goal:

G ≥ 5.6 + 0.0183333H - 0.555S

Assume you have 36 hours total, and you get a 3.7 in the summer. Is it possible to bring it up? No, because you get:

G ≥ 5.6 + 0.0183333(36) - 0.555(3.7)

G ≥ 5.6 + 0.6599988 - 2.0535

G ≥ 4.2064988

You would have to have a value of G bigger than 4.2, but the maximum possible GPA is 4.0.

5x/2 -5 = 3
add 5 to both sides

5x/2 = 8
multiple each side by 2

5x = 16
divide each side by 5

<answer>



Solve

5x/2 - 5 = 3

To get rid of the fraction which is very scary, multiply the WHOLE equation by the DENOMINATOR of the fraction.
The denominator of 5x/2 is 2.

2( 5x/2 - 5 = 3)

5x - 10 = 6

5x = 6 + 10

5x = 16

x = 16/5 or  3 1/5

to check

5x/2 - 5 = 3

5( 16/5/2 - 5 = 3

16/2 - 5 = 3

8 - 5 = 3

3 = 3

==================

Simplify

( 2p^2 - 12pq)/ 6p^2 =

Factor the numerator



2p ( p - 6q) / 6p^2 =

2p/ 6p^2  = 1/ 3p

(p - 6q)/ 3p ===&gt; final answer

In simplifying, always factor the numerator and the denominator, to see if some terms can be cancelled out. But remember also the rules of exponent ==&gt; when you multiply, you add the exponent; when you divide, you SUBTRACT the exponent.

GOOD LUCK!!!

1st problem:
5x/2 - 5 = 3
5x/2 = 8
5x = 16
x = 16/5 or 3 1/5

Answer: 3 1/5

Proof:
(5[16/5])/2 - 5 = 3
16/2 - 5 = 3
8 - 5 = 3
3 = 3

2nd problem:
= (2p² - 12pq)/6p²
= (2p[p - 6q])/(2p[3p])
= (p - 6q)/3p

Answer: (p - 6q)/3p

Checking:
= ([p - 6q]/3p)(6p²)
= (p - 6q)(2p)
= 2p² - 12pq

You factor these as you would polynomials without fractions. You look for two numbers that multiply together to get the third coefficient, and add together to get the 2nd coefficient.

Factor
t^2 + t + 1/4

If the t^2 has no coefficient ( the whole number before it), you can follow these steps.

First term:  t^2 , we know that the factor of t^2 is  t  times  t

Last term : 1/4 , we know that the factor of 1/4 is  1/2 times 1/2.

Middle term : if you ADD  the 2 factors of the last term, you must get the coefficient of the middle term.

If you add 1/2t + 1/2t = 1t or t, which is the middle term.



Our factor is



( t + 1/2) ( t + 1/2)

1st algebraic expression:
t² + t + 1/4 = 0
t² + t = - 1/4
t² + 1/2t = - 1/4 + 1/2²
t² + 1/2t = - 1/4 + 1/4
(t + 1/2)² = 0
t + 1/2 = 0

Answer: (t + 1/2)² or (t + 1/2)(t + 1/2)

Proof:
= (t + 1/2)(t + 1/2)
= t² + 1/2t + 1/2t + 1/4
= t² + t + 1/4

2nd algebraic expression:
m² + 2/3m + 1/9 = 0
m² + 1/3m = - 1/9 + 1/3²
m² + 1/3m = - 1/9 + 1/9
(m + 1/3)² = 0
m + 1/3 = 0

Answer: (m + 1/3)² or (m + 1/3)(m + 1/3)

Proof:
= (m + 1/3)(m + 1/3)
= m² + 1/3m + 1/3m + 1/9
= m² + 2/3m + 1/9

The question , as presented , may be read in many different ways.

Suspect that you may mean :-

(a + 6) / (5a) + (b - 4) / (2b)

2b (a + 6) + (5a) (b - 4)
------------------------------
(5a) (2b)

2 a b + 12 b + 5 a b - 20 a
---------------------------------
10 a b

7 a b + 12 b - 20 a
------------------------
10 a b

PS
Use brackets when presenting questions.
You are likely to receive many different answers due to the fact that question presentation is causing confusion.

id go with the formula y=mx+c and adapt it to ax+by+c

m=(y1-y2)/(x1-x2)=(-1-(-3))/(-2-5) = (-2/7)



then use this to find c by using one of your test points

-1=(-2/7)(-2)+c
c =-11/7

testing this
-3=(-2/7)(5)+c
c =-11/7

so your equation is y=(-2/7)x-11/7

change that to (-2/7)x-y-11/7=0 multiply that all by -7 so u take out the fraction getting

2x+7y+11=0

All you need to do is to use mensuration. Generally,

Area of triangle = 1/2 x Base x Height

So, substituting the given values,

5 = 1/2 x 6√2-2√3 x Height

Therefore rearranging we can write,

Height = 2 x 5 / (6√2-2√3)



= 10 /(6√2-2√3)



= 5 /(3√2 - √3)

We can simplify this further by rationalising the denominator. To do this multiply both the numerator and denominator of the above by 3√2 - √3, so,

= 5/(3√2 - √3)  x  (3√2 + √3) / (3√2 + √3)

= 5 (3√2 + √3) /  (3√2 - √3) (3√2 + √3)

= 5 (3√2 + √3) / 15

= 1/3(3√2 + √3)

= √2 + √3/3

=  √2 + 1/√3

Well the formula for area of a triangle is (0.5 * base * height=area)
So all you need to do is plug in the stuff you know such as area and base and you just solve for height.Note that the height no matter what the triangle is perpendicular to the base.So dont let the "stretching out" confuse you.

Now lets plug in. 5=0.5*(6sqrt2 - 2sqrt3)  * height. Simplify and you get 5= height * 3sqrt2 - sqrt3. Rearrange and you have ure answer. height=5/(3sqrt2 - sqrt3)  .

Area of triangle = (1/2) * (base) * (height)

That's all you need.



area = 1/2 * base * height
height = 2 * area / base

You have 
base = 6√2 - 2√3
area = 5
height = 2 * 5 / (6√2 - 2√3)

Simplify:
2 * 5 / (6√2 - 2√3)
= [10 * (6√2 + 2√3)] / [(6√2 - 2√3) * (6√2 + 2√3)]
= (60√2 + 20√3) / [ 36*2 - 4*3 ]
= (60√2 + 20√3) / 60
= (3√2 + √3) / 3
≈ (4.243 + 3.464) / 3
≈ 7.707 / 3
≈ 2.569

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Initially you might think of this as a linear function

y = mx + b

where the growth rate 
m = 0.295% = 0.0295



However think about each year...
Initially we have a population 32,738,376



After the first year we have the 100% of population + growth rate or

32,738,376  ( 1 + 0.0295)

which simplifies to
32,738,376  ( 1.0295)

Now think about the next year... 
It would be the new population + the growth rate again or...
32,738,376  ( 1.0295) ( 1.0295)



This is known as a "Geometric Progression"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_p...

In a geometric progression we can write a general equation by knowing two things.  This initial value or 'a', and the rate of increase, r.

a * r ^ k

Where k is the number of times we sequence has elapsed.

In our case 
a = 32,738,376 
r = 1.0295
k = 4,



( 2012 - 2008)



So our general equation for any year will be
( 32,738,376 ) (1.0295) ^ k

Thus for k = 4 we have
( 32,738,376 ) (1.0295) ^ 4 = 36 775 834



At this rate in 2008 we could say that Denmark's population will have increased more that 4 million people in only 4 years.  If we currently had approximately 32.7 million it would mean that our population had increase by roughly 1/8 or 12 %.  This means that the country would require at a minimum 12% more resources just to keep at current pace economically.

It would be -10 because the signs are different. 
Think of it this way. When multiplying and dividing, it doesnt matter how huge or small the numbers are. If the signs are the same ( both positive or both negative) the answer will ALWAYS be positive. If they are different it will ALWAYs be negative. 
So once you've determined what the sign will be, just do the basic math as normal. 30 divided by 3 is 10, it must be negative, so the answer is -10!
Hope that helps!

Part 1. find the logarithmic formula that gives the pH of a substance. State what each variable in your equation represents.

Find the pH of a substance of your choice that is alkaline (basic). Using this pH, show how to find the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+], of the substance using the formula. Discuss the meaning of pH and [H+], the pH scale and why your chosen substance is alkaline. Use scientific notation or enough decimal places so that your answer has at least 3 place values. For example, either use 3.44*10^-9 or 0.00000000344.



Part 2.
Suppose that the number of new homes built, H, in a city over a period of time, t, is graphed on a rectangular coordinate system where time is on the horizontal axis. Suppose that the number of homes built can be modeled by an exponential function, H= p * a^t , where p is the number of new homes built in the first year recorded. If you were a homebuilder looking for work, would you prefer that the value of a to be between 0 and 1 or larger than 1? Explain your reasoning.

1) pH = -log[H+]. log has base 10. [H+] = concentration of hydrogen ions in solution. The pH of ammonia from certain fishes is around 11.45, which means that 11.45 = -log[H+], so [H+] = 10^(-11.45). This substance is alkaline because it has pH &gt; 7.0. In scientific notation, this is 3.548 * 10^(-12).

2) The home builder would want more homes available so that he can earn money. If you look at the behavior of a function with a between 0 and 1, say just Y = (a)^x, you would find that Y never stops DECREASING. This is very bad. The only option left would be larger than 1. (Why can't it be 1?)

Theoretical probability is pretty self explanatory as a term. It is a theoretical measure of the likelihood that an event will have a particular outcome, used when the event cannot be readily tested.



For example, what is the likelihood, theoretically, that I will throw a 6 10 times when I throw the dice 100 times?



You calculate the outcome rather than stand there throwing dice all day. Also, when you think about things like theoretically, what is the probability of a black hole eating the earth, there is no way of actually doing an experiment. You have to do it theoretically, ie. on paper. (or in your head if your smart. :-)

<answer>



The probability of an event is the proportion of a large number of experiments that it should occur. For instance, if you shuffle a standard deck of cards and randomly choose one card, it should be an ace about 1/13th of the time. That calculated probability is theoretical: it doesn't tell you whether it will happen any given time.

If you're drawing cards from a standard deck, for instance, you calculate the probability of drawing an ace under the assumption that there are four aces in the deck. That theoretical probability ought to be reliable over a large number of random draws (assuming the drawn cards are put back and the deck reshuffled each time), but it doesn't tell you when you'll get an ace or when you won't.

It also ignores the possibility that the dealer is cheating and you're getting seconds when an ace is on top of the deck, or you're cheating because you're using a marked deck.

you take the two middle numbers, add them together, and then divide by two.  the answer you get is the median.



for example..

1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.

take 4 and 5, add them and get 9, divide by two, and get 4.5, the median is 4.5

hope this helps you out!

I would

take eqn 2, rearrange to give y as the subject , y=8-x^2

substitute thats y into eqn 1



2x + 16 - 2x^2=7

use quadratic formula ( ill assume you know this, if not, ask - and someone will give it) on that nice eqn

that will give you the x values , then put those x values into the y=8-x^2, to get the 2 y values



HOWEVER I think you may have mistyped, or misread something as I cannot even put the values you give, back into the eqns you give

x² + y = 8 .................. eq1
2x + 2y = 7 ............... eq2

y = 7/2 - x ................. rearrange eq2

x² + (7/2 - x) = 8 ........ substitute eq2 into eq1
x² - x = 9/2
(x - 1/2)² = 19/4
x = (± √19 + 1)/2
x1 = (1 + √19)/2
x2 = (1 - √19)/2

y1 = 7/2 - (1 + √19)/2 . from eq2
y1 = (6 - √19)/2
y2 = (6 + √19)/2

Answer: [(1 + √19)/2, (6 - √19)/2] , [(1 - √19)/2, (6 + √19)/2]

P.S. You can clearly see that (3,1/2) does not satisfy x²+y=8 
(3)² + 1/2 = 9.5 ≠ 8

They are asking you to rewrite each number as a power of something.



Example- 4 would be rewritten as 2^2, as 2*2 equals four.



Another example- 25 is rewritten as 5^2 as 5*5 equals 25.

I have a basic programming problem (involves some algebra) (please helpppppp)?



Hi there ppl. This might be very basic (or extremely hard, depending on who you are) but i have only just started college and i have been given homework in my programming class.

I have been asked to make a program which completes basic mathematical functions. One of my tasks is to make a code that can answer - ('A' mod 'B').

I know what the questions means and i would possibly know how to code it, but i do not know the formula for ('A' mod 'B')

One of my questions is to write 'A' to the power 6 so i wrote - (num1^6) and it works fine. (where num1 = 'A'

By the way, 'A' is the number 12 and 'B' is the number 5. so obviously the answer is 2 but i need a formula for it.

Any help would be greatly Appreciated

Thank You :)

It is very roundabout, and I am sure that there are better ways of doing it, but:

for(i=0; i &lt; A; i++) {



if(A-i*B &lt; 0) {



mod = A-(i-1)*B;



break;



}

That should work, I think?

Bernoulli probabilities?



One day your teacher surprised you with a 21-question multiple-choice quiz. Each question has 5 possible answers, only one of which is correct

If you answer the questions completely based on guessing, what is the probability that: You will answer at most 3 correctly?

i worked it out using a previous formula given to someone elses question and got .324259 but the answer was wrong, did i do this wrong or need a new formula? thanks



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Okay, it has been way too long since I did anything with probabilities, but I will certainly try to help.  After reading this problem I would lean toward a Binomial Distribution instead of a Bernoulli Distribution.  The Binomial is just a Bernoulli, but instead of a single trial (Bernoulli) we have n number of trials (Binomial).

There are a few things we must look for to determine whether this is, in fact, a Binomial Distribution:

1.  Experiment consists of a fixed number of n identical trials - This holds true, since there are 21 different trials, or guesses, in this case.

2.  Each trial can result in either a success or a failure - This is true, since there is only one correct answer for each question.

3.  Probability of success is constant from trial to trial - One answer correct out of five choices for each question, p = .2

4.  Trials are independent - Not going to prove independence here, but it should be obvious that the answer of one question does not change the probability of answering correct on a different question, if all answers are random guesses.

Since all these hold true, we will use the Binomial Distribution.

Pr(Y = y) = {n\choose y}p^y(1-p)^{n-y}

where



{n\choose k} = n!/k!(n-k)!

n = 21
y = 3
Pr(correct answer) = p = .2
Pr(incorrect answer) = 1-p = .8

Since we are not just finding the probability of getting 3 correct answers, but instead the probability of getting 3 or fewer correct, we must modify our Binomial Distribution function.  Instead we will use the Cumulative Distribution Function for the Binomial Distribution, which follows:



F(x;n,p) = \Pr(X \le x) = \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor x \rfloor} {n\choose i}p^i(1-p)^{n-i}.



http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_di...

If you feel that summations are no fun (as I do), you can just use the Initial Binomial Distribution Function given above, but do it for y = 0, y = 1, y = 2, and y = 3, then just add em up.

My answer may be horribly off, since I have never been that good at probabilities, but I got a probability of .375433.  I am pretty sure you don't use a Bernoulli though.  Hope that helped, even if it is wrong, I hope it helped you look at the problem from a little different perspective.  :-)

Solving a tangential circle problem?



1. The problem statement, all variables and given/known data
A ball that is circling with x=cos(2t), y=sin(2t) flies off on a tangent at t=Pi/8. find its departure point and its position vector at a later time t (linear motion; compute its constant velocity v).



2. Relevant equations
v=dR/dt T=v/|v|= (dR/dt)/(ds/dt)=dR/ds.



3. The attempt at a solution
I have got to be the dumbest person on the planet. all I can think to do is this: R= cos(2t) + sin(2t). I thought after that it'd be a good idea to differentiate to find the velocity, but I'm not sure I'm doing it correctly. what I find is this: v=-2sin(2t)+2cos(2t). then I went to find |v|, but I'm don't know how to compute it when I've still got the t in there.

whatever I do there, it's just not coming out right with the answer key. (thank goodness I have at least one odd-numbered problem tonight!!) what the author says is this:
leaves at (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2); v=(sqrt(2), sqrt(2)); R= (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2) + v(t-Pi/8) which is the position at time t.

3x-4+4x=0
add 4 to both sides
3x+4x=4
add the x's
7x=4
divide by 7
x=4/7 or about .571

this only works if the equation ='s 0 btw

If you mean sin^2(θ) - 1 = cos^2(θ), and not sin(2θ) - 1 = cos(2θ), or sin(2θ - 1) = cos(2θ), or some other combination, then

sin^2(θ) - 1 = cos^2(θ)
sin^2(θ) - (sin^2(θ)+cos^2(θ)) = cos^2(θ)
-cos^2(θ) = cos^2(θ)
The only way a value can be its own negative is if it's equal to 0.  So
cos^2(θ) = 0
cos(θ) = 0
θ = pi/2, 3pi/2, etc.

<answer>



If sin 2Θ - 1 = cos 2Θ
It must be true that
2sinΘcosΘ - 1 = 2cos² Θ - 1
so add 1 to both sides
2sinΘcosΘ = 2cos² Θ 
divide both sides by 2
sinΘcosΘ = cos² Θ 
Set this equal to zero
cos² Θ  - sin Θ cos Θ = 0
factor cos Θ from all terms
cos Θ [ cos Θ - sin Θ]  = 0
and we set each factor to zero to determine
solution set presumably on [0, 2π)

Now cos Θ = 0 implies that Θ = π/2 or 3π/2 {90° and 270° if you like to think in degrees, calculus uses radians, however}
and  cos Θ - sin Θ = 0 ↔ cos Θ = sin Θ



and that is satisfied in the first and third quadrants at
 Θ = π/4 or 5π/4 {45° and 225° are degree equivelents, but use radians}
Complete solution set on [0,2π) is  π/4 π/2 5π/4 3π/2
--------------------------------------...
I solved this assuming you meant exactly what you typed, not sin² Θ - 1 = cos² Θ  as some of the 
other answers are assuming
If you did intend sin 2Θ to mean sin² Θ 
I would expect you to write (sin theta)^2 
or, at least sin^2 theta {less preferable but OK}
as sin² Θ means (sin Θ)²

This is not true. If A is a subset of B then A intersect B is A. For example, let A = {1, 2} and B = {1, 2, 3}. A is a subset of B and A intersect B is A is not the empty set.

[7x^2 - 6x - 1] /(x^2-1)

=(7x+1)(x-1)/(x+1)(x-1)

=(7x+1)/(x+1)

lim x---&gt;∞ (7x+1)/(x+1) = ∞/∞, since it is indeterminate form apply

L'Hopital's rule

lim x ---&gt;∞  derivative of (7x+1) / derivative of (x+1) = 7/1 = 7

Pre-Calculus Question Help!?



OK so, I've stared at my math book dozens of times and repeated the steps it said... its obviously on crack because i take those steps and still get the wrong answers... so there's 2 i need help with

1- Product of two trinomials - (using vertical format) Find the product of:



(-x^2 + x - 5) (3x^2 + 4x +1)

2- Product of two trinomials - Find the product of:

[(m - 3) + n] [(m - 3) - n]



And try to explain each step please, I'm not very good at math :[ , i have a test tomorrow so i need to get this down ASAP, Much appreciated for help.

1.  (-x^2 + x - 5) (3x^2 + 4x +1)
distribute going from one parenthesis to the next. (ex: -x^2(3x^2+4x+1)) and do it for all the terms.
-3x^4 -4x^3 -x^2 + 3x^3 + 4x^2 +x -15x^2 -20x -5
simplify
-3x^4 -x^3 -12x^2 -19x -5

2. [(m-3) +n] [(m-3)-n]
distribute
(m-3)(m-3)-n(m-3)+n(m-3)-n^2
do a little simplifying
(m-3)^2 -n^2
more simplifying
m^2-6m+9-n^2

good luck on your test ^_^

just try to simplify it.
for instance, if you had 
(a + b + c) * (d + e + f) what would you do?

you would do

'a' times everything in the second bracket, then 'b' times everything in the second bracket, and same for 'c'.

i.e. you'd get 
a(d+e+f) + b(d+e+f) + c(d+e+f)

do you follow?

so it's just the same for these.

i.e.
(-x^2 + x - 5) (3x^2 + 4x +1) 
=(-x^2)(3x^2 + 4x + 1) + (x)(3x^2 + 4x + 1) + (-5)(3x^2 + 4x + 1).

then expand that out and simplify, a simple exercise but lengthy so i won't do it here.



the same is true for your second problem, but note that the extra brackets do not make any difference.

yes, if you have a calculator, just divide 1 by 13. this can be very difficult without a caluclator i admit! but just to remind you, there is one on your computer, or the internet.

and the answer is 0.07692307692 by the way. (rounded to 0.08 1dp)

Everybody here is correct, it's 1 ÷ 13.
I'm presuming your teacher told you not to use a calculator.  It's good to learn the principle of long division on your own before you start letting machines give you the answer without ever having to understand how it's derived.

Check out this site.  It spells out the whole process of long division including decimals in simple steps:  http://www.mathsisfun.com/long_division3...

1 kg



*



(1000 grams/1kg)*(1 peso/ 15 grams) =  66.67 pesos



(in this case I guess I'd say 66 pesos since you can't have 0.67 of a coin, so you round down)

Learn this format of converting units ("for every 1 kg, there is 1000 grams, and for every 15 grams, there's one peso").



It comes up alot in chemistry and practically every other science class.



Anyhow, also note how the units cancel each other out until you're just left with the units of the answer....pesos.



Not only is this a way to solve a problem, but a good way to check it as well to see if you forgot anything along the way.

What kind of pesos are these? Argentine peso? Chilean peso? Colombian peso? Cuban peso? Dominican peso? Mexican peso? Philippine peso? or Uruguayan peso?

66.66 Mexican pesos in US money is about $6.18, which is 4.30 Euros or £3.40.
66.66 Argentine pesos is $21.48 or €14.97 or £11.80. 
66.66 Uruguayan pesos is $3.21 or €2.24 or £1.77. 
66.66 Dominican pesos is $1.90 or €1.32 or £1.04.

This probability question is really giving me trouble... need help!?



An insurance company classifies people into one of the 3 categories; good risk, average risk, and bad risk. Historical data shows that the probability of a good risk person getting into an accident over a one year span is .05, for an average risk person it is .15, and for a bad risk person the probability is .30. Suppose that 20% of the people are good risk, 50% are average risk, and 30% are bad risk.

-what fraction of the population is involved in an accident in any one year?
- If Joe(a policy holder) had no accidents in 2005, what is the probability that Joe is a good risk person?
- what is the probability that he is an average risk person?

You must bear in mind that all of these numbers a re probabilities, not certainties.

For your for you first question. Take the sum of the products of the probabilities and the percentages (decimal):



(.05)(.2) + (.15)(.50) +(.3)(.3) =



.01 + .075 + ,09 =  0.175



If Joe had no accidents the probability that he is a good risk person
is 1 minus the probability that he is not a good risk person..  That probability, from the answer to question 1 is 1 - ,075 - .09 = .0.8835



The probability that Joe is an average risk person is 1 minus the probability that he is not average risk person. Again, from the answer to question 1, that probability is 1 - .01 -.09  = 0.9

Word Problem Find the percent increase Please help!!?



Hi everyone I've been stuck on this problem forever if somone could help me i would really appreciate it! Here's the problem. By what percent did daily offshore oil production increase from 1960 to 2000 if in 
1960 it was: 319
1970 it was: 1577
1980 it was: 1034
1990 it was: 1082
and in 2000 it was: 1741
Round to the nearest tenth. Thank you all!!

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



The percent increase can be found using the forumal is/of =%/100

So the increase is 1422.

We want to know what percent 1422 is of 319.



So you get

1422/319= %

1422/319= 4.45768

445.768%

Rounded is 445.8%

The poster above made a msitake in calculation and divided the original by the increase instead of the increase by the original.

The percent increase is the amount of increase divided by the original amount (times 100%).
Amount of increase: (1741-319)=1422
Original amount: 319
% increase: 319/1422=.224 or 22.4%

<answer>



Rearrange to get ln x + 2ln(x+1) - ln 4 = 0

Recall that ln(a) - ln(b) = ln (a/b), ln(a) + ln(b) = ln(ab), and a*ln(b) = ln(b^a).

ln{[x*(x+1)^2]/4} = 0

Exponentiate both sides to get

[x*(x+1)^2]/4 = 1

Now convert into a cubic equation and solve normally.

<answer>



ln 4 - 2ln(x+1) = ln x

ln 4 - ln(x+1)^2 = ln x (since a ln b = ln b^a)

ln [4 /(x+1)^2] = ln x ( since ln a - ln b = ln (a/b))

take out logs

4/(x+1)^2 = x

4 = x (x^2 + 2x + 1)

x^3 + 2x^2 + x - 4 = 0

x^3 + 3x^2 + 4x - x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0

x(x^2 + 3x + 4) - 1(x^2 + 3x + 4) = 0

(x - 1)(x^2 + 3x + 4) = 0

x = 1 (ignoring imaginary roots)

so denominator u get (4+sqrt5)(4-sqrt5)

as (a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2

Multiply (3-sqrt3)/(4+sqrt5) by (4-sqrt5)/(4-sqrt5)

then the denominator becomes (4+sqrt5)(4-sqrt5)
multiply it out and you get 16 +4sqrt5 - 4sqrt5 - (sqrt5)(sqrt5)
which equals 16 - 5 = 11

Since you know you're multiplying by 4-sqrt5, you have a difference of 2 squares in the denominator:

(4+sqrt5)(4-sqrt5)

Multiply that out and you get:

4^2 - (sqrt5)^2 =
16 - 5 =
11

recall that (x + a)(x - a) = x² - a², so

(4 + √5)(4 - √5)

multiply your original equation by "a well chosen one"
I choose [you should too]



(4-sqrt5)
------------
(4-sqrt5)

the numerator is as you show it.
the denominator is
(4 + sqrt5)(4 - sqrt5)
expands to:
16 + 4sqrt5 - 4sqrt5 - sqrt5sqrt5
middle two terms cancel last term simplifies to 5
16 - 5 = 11

full answer is as you showed.

x ( 4 - sqrt5)

The terms are multiplied together
(3-sqrt3)



x  ( 4 - sqrt5)

Remember FOIL
Numerator:-
12 -4sqrt3 - 3sqrt5 + sqrt(15)

Denominiator
(4+sqrt5)



x ( 4 - sqrt5)

16 - 4sqrt5 + 4sqrt5 - sqrt(25)
16 - sqrt25
16 - 5 
11 - THE '11' in your answer!!!!!!
NB :-
- 4sqrt5 + 4sqrt5 these two terms are the same value, but one is positive and the other negative and so eliminate each other.

It is possible, but i don't know why. 
If you make a square 8x8 and cut it in a way that I don't remember and then rearrange them you get a triangle 5x13 . I'm not sure how it was exactly but it's something like that. The area of the pieces is the same in both the triangle and the square but when you calculate their area directly they are 64 for the square and 65 for the triangle.

You can't prove it, because it isn't true.

However, here is a link to what you are probably looking for:

http://www.moillusions.com/2008/02/anoth...

This doesn't prove that 5x13 = 8x8--it's just an illusion. If you cut an 8x8 rectangle as shown and rearrange the pieces to make the 5x13 rectangle, then the 5x13 rectangle will have a very small hole down the diagonal (the pieces do not line up exactly). The area of the hole will be 1 square unit, but it's spread over a long ways so it's not very noticeable.

<answer>



Denote length of stick by x, length of marked field by y.  Then
y = 20x

Let me use d for delta and e for epsilon.
We require
|120 - y| &lt; d
i.e.
-d &lt; 120 - y &lt; d
i.e.
-d &lt; 120 - 20x &lt; d

Divide each term by 20:
-d/20 &lt; 6 - x &lt; d/20

Thus x must be within e of 6 yards where
 e = d/20

this is a separable variable equation:

dy/y^2 = 4x^2 dx

-1/y = 4/3 x^3+C

when x=1, y=-1 or:

1=4/3+C =&gt; C=-1/3

1/y = 1/3(1-4x^3)

or y=3/(1-4x^3)  this has critical points when x=(1/4)^(1/3)

<answer>



This is separable:
dy / dx = 4(x^2)(y^2)
y^-2 dy = 4x^2 dx

Integrate both sides to get
-y^(-1) = (4/3)x^3 + C

Plug in x=1, y=-1 to solve for C

y'=dy/dx=4(x^2)(y^2)
y^-2 dy = 4x^2 dx (integrate both sides)
-y^-1 = (4/3)x^3 + c
-1/y = (4/3)x^3 + c
y=-1/((4/3)x^3 + c) ******

y(1)=-1=-1/((4/3)1^3 + c)
-1=-1/((4/3)+c)
4/3+c=1
c=-1/3 (Plug back into stared equation)
Answer: y=-1/((4/3)x^3 -1/3)

Theres problems when:
(4/3)x^3 -1/3=0
(4/3)x^3 =1/3
x^3=1/4
So x can't equal the cubed root of .25

x cannot equal 1/2

because at x = 1/2 the denominator will be zero, and that's not allowed in math!

so x has to be greater than 1/2 or less than 1/2. But since you only want &gt;0, the answer is x &gt; 1/2

Rounding and Significant Figures?



Considering the problem, 8.698cm divided by 0.20cm = about 42.49.
How would I round to 2 sig figs?
I did it as 42.49 -&gt; 42.5 and then rounded that to 43.
Would I just plainly round off the 4 instead of rounding it as a whole?

I believe it should be rounded to 42 see explanation below and examples.



Common method
This method is commonly used in mathematical applications, for example in accounting. It is the one generally taught in elementary mathematics classes. This method is also known as Symmetric Arithmetic Rounding or Round-Half-Up (Symmetric Implementation)

Decide which is the last digit to keep. 
Increase it by 1 if the next digit is 5 or more (this is called rounding up) 
Leave it the same if the next digit is 4 or less (this is called rounding down) 
Examples:

3.044 rounded to hundredths is 3.04 (because the next digit, 4, is less than 5). 
3.045 rounded to hundredths is 3.05 (because the next digit, 5, is 5 or more). 
3.0447 rounded to hundredths is 3.04 (because the next digit, 4, is less than 5). 
For negative numbers the absolute value is rounded and the sign is added back afterwards.

so you use the starting value (20,000) and multiply by the interest rate (1+.02) and the number of years as an exponent (5)
so y=20000(1.02)^5
so she would owe $22,082

<answer>



With a low number of years like 5, you could simply use a calculator and find 2 percent of 20,000 (well, you can do this without a calculator - it's 400) and add it on, giving 20,400, then 2 percent of this is 408, add it, giving 20,808, then 2 percent of this is 416.16, add it, giving 21224.16, the 2 percent of this is  424.48, add it, giving 21648.64, then 2 percent of this is 432.97, add it, giving 22,081.61 dollars.

But this takes ages, and you could never do it with a greater time period.  There is a formula which you can use to go straight to the answer.  It looks complicated at first, but is simple.  Here it is.

Initial amount (1 + r/100)^n

Your initial amount is 20,000, and your rate is 2 and the n at the end is 5.

So find the bit in brackets first.  1 + 2/100

The answer is 1 + 0.02, which is 1.02

Now you have to raise it to the power of 5.  You need a scientific calculator.  Get your answer and then multiply it by your initial amount of 20,000, giving 22081.62 dollars.

Notice that there is a cent of difference when calculating it this way.  This is because this formula allows for more exactness as you avoid rounding inaccuracies.

It's very difficult to demonstrate this kind of formula on the pc, but I'll give you a link to a site.  This site gives explanations and examples for a lot of maths topics.  It will help a lot in your revision of maths.

First click on schools, then lessons, then secondary.  You will then be given a choice of key stage 3 maths or key stage 4 maths.  You might like to start with key stage 3 if you have forgotten a lot.  It's ages 11 - 14.  Key stage 4 is for 14-16 yrs.  You have to register to access the lessons, but it's free.

Good luck.

Let's take any two consecutive values in that sequence and subtract them:
19-11 = 8
(Check: 27-19 also = 8)

So this means we have '8n'.
But, of course, this is not right... (e.g. 8n - n=1, first term is not 8!)
So we need to adjust 8n to make it fit into the sequence.
So, the nth term is '8n+3'
(Try it out! It works :))

It's 8n+3.
To find the nth term you just work out how much the numbers differ, in this case it is 8. So you know it is 8n. Then you just figure out how much you have to add to each number to reach each number in the sequence. In this case, +3.
So it comes out as 8n+3. :-)

any quadrilateral (ie a polygon with four corners and 4 straight edges drawn on a flat plane) will comply with this

if you want to try it i would suggest drawing up a few different kinds of four sided shapes, cut out and tear off the corners and place the corners together

you ought to find they all make a full turn ie they add up to 360 degrees
