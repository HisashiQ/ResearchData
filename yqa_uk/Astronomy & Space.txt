How will shooting stars move away from Perseus for this months Perseid Meteor Shower? Will they move randomly?



I mean will the shooting stars move away from the  Perseus constellation is random directions? Are they easy to see?

<answer>



There will be some apparent random motion, but due to the Earth's rotation and speed in orbit, most will appear to move East to West.  Before midnight there might be quite a few that appear to be moving West to East due to their much higher orbital velocity.

If you live in or near a large city you may not see anything because of the light pollution.  You are better off getting to a campground as remote as possible, or even hiking to a remote clearing.  One thing you can do to improve your "seeing" is to roll paper or poster-board (preferably black) into a cone shape to block out ground light  This will, of course, limit the area of sky you can see at once, but it may be your only solution where you live.

The Perseid shower is typically one of the brightest showers of the year, meaning that the individual 'shooting stars' are often very bright and their trails are very long and impressive.  The darker the sky , of course, the better, but the perseids is one of few showers that you could see in town.  Take a reclining lawn chair, maybe binocs, but no need for a telescope, bug spray perhaps, a blanky maybe, and a friend or two...oh, and some liquid refreshment of your choice, maybe some snacks, and have fun.
Oh and if you can stay up until about 3 or so, that's when any meteor shower is best...that's when the part of earth that we are on is charging head first into the mass of rocks that are the meteoroids.

Who knows, the answer is maybe because when Mars was much warmer and wetter there is a remote chance life could have formed there but i doubt that because we humans have only been on this planet for maybe 3 1/2 million years in the form if hominid primates, so once again i stress the word maybe, the highest form of life that could have evolved on Mars under absolute perfect conditions would be a small amphibious lizard or insect perhaps, no intelligent civilization there.

It’s almost like you think civilisations grow out of nothing.  In order for there to have been civilisations, there would have been billions of other evidences of lifeforms.



You are in fantasy land.
______________________________________...

And to Hellbent’s answer – on the scale of the evolution of life on Earth, Amphibians would rank as a recent and highly complex lifeform.  A frog is a vertibrate, has four limbs with the same number of joints as you, and 5 digits on hands and toes, has heart, lungs, two eyes, two nostrils, has sex, etc etc.



Amphibians came about 400 million years ago, but that is recent compared with the 3 billion + years of the evolution of life.

I believe there is a small but finite chance that there is evidence of an ancient civilization on Mars. There WAS a period of warmish wetness there which MAY have been long enough for indigenous life to develop there. But no fossils have ever been found on Mars. Yet. It's possible they will be, one day. 
It is more likely that there would be an abandoned alien outpost there. The Universe is over 12 billion years old, and the Solar System is over 4.5 billion years old. There has been life on Earth for 3.7 billion years, so that is a long time for an alien species to come along and take an interest in developments here.
But, space is vast, and space travel is difficult. Would anyone have gone to the trouble?
In all likelihood, there will be no evidence of any structures found on Mars, from any source. 
But only time will tell for sure.... : )

Only two people so far have given decent, informed answers. The answer is a resounding "no". Mars has never had the conditions for supporting advanced, multicellular life as we see on Earth. Yes it was "warm and wet" billions of years ago, but if we look at Earth it took about 3 billion years just for multicellular life to evolve. That means for the vast majority of time on Earth, there was nothing but single celled microbes for life. Mars' hospitable climate could not have lasted more than a billion years, which leaves around 3.5 billion years of Mars being the frigid desert as we now find it.

To even contemplate the idea of "civilisations" on Mars is to singularly misunderstand just how difficult it is for creatures like us to evolve. For that, you need a planet like Earth. Sure, aliens from other star systems could have colonised Mars, but why would they want to do that when the Earth is so much more hospitable? It's preposterous.

I'll stick my neck out and say why not.

As we know the earth and the planets came from the sun and over the billions of years are now in the positions they are now. So surely at one point in its life Mars must have been in the position that the earth is in. So why couldn't there have been life on all of the other planets. They didn't just appear in the place they are now.  This would go some way in explaining all the ancient markings and symbols in the desert in mexico, perhaps we were visited by the remaning civilisation before mars became inhospitible ???? Who knows.



Thats my theory anyway, Just try and prove it wrong.

Astronomers don't know yet. Considering that water is the basic requirement for life, there's a decent chance there is life. Even if it isn't fish, simple life such as single cell organisms would suffice as "alien" life. We may be getting answers sometime in 2015, assuming the mission doesn't get canceled.

This is one of the current questions NASA is trying to get the answer to. They are planning to send a submersible probe to explore the depths. The temperatures there will be about the same as those found in the oceans at the north and south pole.



Currently, we don't know for sure if there is life. Its probably too cold for their to be fish, but hey, there could be some small fish swimming around there. Life seems to be a lot more adaptable than we seem to think. Until the last decade, we thought there was no life at all in the oceans in the artic regions. However, marine biologists have discovered these underwater structures that release hot water, warming the area towards the sea floor. This allows some algae planets to thrive down there. There are also some plankton, but no observed fish. There are fish that could probably survive in those temperatures, but they feed on the fish that can't survive there... and if their prey isn't there, why would they be there?

Life can be a plant too. It could be a micro organism.



NASA wants to get a probe there by 2020, and I think that we can make it. I do think there will be some life there. It might not be discovered because the probe won't last very long, and any life there is probably fairly rare. It might take multiple missions to find life.

Personally, I would rather see a probe land on Europa than on Mars... but that's just me.

NASA relies on public support a lot. With the economy the way it is, they will probably hold back the project until the economy gets better. NASA might team up with the ESA to design a probe and satellite to travel to Europa. It would take less time, and would be an international project.

The answer is we do not know. Although it is my educated belief that besides earth Europa's deep oceans are the most likely place to find life in the solar system.

It has been suggested that life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean.

Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to habitate on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of the moon's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean.

Are there any Meteor Showers in 2008 in the UK?



I am now in York and after a few weeks I will move to Scunthorpe which is also in Yorkshire.
Please . When can I see some meteor showers in UK. I mean the Perseid's or something like that. and where is the best place to watch a meteor showers?

You're in luck.
The next meteor shower is the Perseids, which will peak on the night of August 12, 2008. The moon spoils the view a bit, but after the first-quarter moon sets, around 2 a.m., meteors should be more easily visible until dawn.



If you have the chance, and it's not cloudy, get as far away from civilization as possible, to get to as dark a place as possible. In cities, you have lots of light pollution, so get out into the countryside, or to an empty beach. Look towards the northeast.

If you're a really big fan, you could go sometimes this week and scout out a location and have a look, there should allready be about a dozen shooting stars each hour, more as we get closer the night of August 12th.

After that, you'll have to wait until October 21, for the much less spectacular Orionids.

As a side note, meteor showers are global, we all get to see them, provided they're not to far north or south.

There's no air in space, so the air inside his suit would rush out. He wouldn't be able to breathe, but if he shut his eyes and held his breath he could survive for a minute or so. After that he's start to run out of breath. After 4 minutes his brain would start to be damaged by lack of oxygen.

If he opened his eyes, the vacuum would cause all the moisture on his eyes to evaporate, and his eyes would dry up, possibly damaging them.

People talk about the pressure difference in space, but it's not huge. The pressure difference between the air in the guy's lungs and the vacuum outside is only one atmosphere. He could easily stand that sort of pressure. People wouldn't explode in space - it's a myth.

The decompression would kill him instantly, and he would explode like a popped balloon from all pressure escaping from his body.  Even a small tear will do this because space is a vacuum and the slightest tear would rip the space suit wide open and kill the person inside.

Trying to hold breath will result in instant death as the lungs will explode under the pressure. An astronaut would have a minute or two to return into the spacecraft, or he will pass out without air and die. He won't freeze, because vacuum has no temperature. It's a myth that things freeze in space.

These answers are all terrible... The range from just wrong to movie fiction... Close your eyes and hold your breath?? Space is nothing more than a very hostile environment and the astronaut would not implode nor would he turn to jelly... The vacuum would instantly draw the air from your lungs and with an equal negative pressure inside and outside of his diaphragm he would not be able to inhale or exhale... Soon the -455 degree Fahrenheit temp would freeze him solid and he would float endlessly preserved... If it happened in low earth orbit he would continue to orbit until we ventured out to get him...

In the Shuttle suit, an astronaut can survive 22 minutes with a 1/8" hole in his suit. At that point the pressure will drop to where he is likely to suffer permanent brain damage, if he survives. The Shuttle suit has a secondary oxygen pack pressurised to 5,000 psi. If the primary system cannot maintain pressure in the suit (due, for example, to a 1/8-inch hole), the secondary oxygen pack will open its valve and attempt to maintain the pressure.

If there is a large tear, the astronaut might have a few seconds to live. No matter what he does, severe vascular damage is certain, and the probability of permanent damage to the neural system (including the brain) is extremely high. However, as several notes here have pointed out, the outer layer of the space suit is very tough, and the probability of even a small puncture is low.



Even if the external pressure drops to a vacuum, blood vessels maintain a high enough pressure that the body's temperature remains below the boiling point of water and prevents blood from boiling. The body will not instantly freeze either because even though space is generally very cold, the fact that it is a vacuum means there is no medium to conduct heat away from the body and it cools rather slowly.

He would be out of oxygen, and would lose consciousness within a few seconds.  After a few minutes, he'd die of anoxia (total lack of oxygen).

The lack of pressure would also produce air embolisms in his bloodstream and tissues, but he'd probably die of a lack of oxygen before these embolisms did any damage.

Contrary to popular misconceptions, he would not explode.  In some circumstances, if he held his breath or if there were a lot of gas in his GI tract, it could cause something to rupture, but again, he'd already by dying from the lack of oxygen by then.

A number of people have survived brief exposure to vacuum and survived without problems.  One of them remarked that the last thing he remembered before passing out was a bubbling sensation on his tongue as the water there boiled away.

All atmosphere regulator devices for use in manned space have high-flow modes or high-flow backups that can be used to maintain sufficient pressure for certain sizes of leaks for lengths of time necessary to mitigate the failure or reach safety.  This applies to space suits and space ships.

It is amazingly difficult to puncture a space suit.  It is amazingly difficult to crack a helmet visor.

Under conditions of total anoxia you have about ten seconds of useful consciousness: less if the suit decompression is explosive or if the astronaut has been exerting himself up to that point.  Depending on the subject's cardiovascular health, revival may be possible up to a minute elapsed total anoxia.

Since you will die long before you reach the edge of the observable universe, you don't "come out" anywhere.
If the universe is "closed", eventually your ship could theoretically end up back at Earth - but that would take longer than the estimated lifetime of the universe.
If the universe is "open", your ship would simply continue moving outward until the universe itself dies.

Well if you somehow artificially preserved yourself, whether by reversible cryogenics, or threw extremely advanced life extensions.. Assuming your space ship was beyond our present day "limitations" You would probably travel on for ever, And possibly witness what our narrow minded earthling minds cannot present grasp. The thought of infinity is INSANE.. it defines everything, nothing last forever, NOTHING, so how can the universe have NO boundaries? I believe there is and If you could somehow reach them, it'd be insane to witness the edge expanding, obliterating nothingness into "Black matter- Nothingness" Maybe the edge isn't dark.. I know even the brightest minds have no definite universally agreeable "fact"... So it'd be insane I'd LOVE to take that trip for sure! with like that big head robot from "Hitchhikers of the Galaxy" or something like that, lol.

All most recent research and observations strongly imply that the geometry of our universe is "flat," meaning that parallel lines never converge and the angles of a right triangle always add up to 180° The first thing that means is that you would *never*...repeat, NEVER...come back to where you started.

And even if you could travel as fast as the speed of light, it would take you at least 30,000 years just to get to the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way. Beyond our Milky Way we can "see" about 13.7-billion light years into the universe, so it would take you 13.7-billion years to get there. Beyond that point though there's still an immense area of the universe that's expanding faster than the speed of light.

There is a simple reason for why this increase of technology has not given us proof of E.T. life forms that do anal probing- THEY DON'T EXIST. They are nothing more than science fiction. Before cameras, people with tin foil on their head could just say that they were abducted by aliens but now that there are cameras they have to have video proof. Which they will never het because there are no flying disks because that is science FICTION. sure there is E.T. life but not green men with tubed ears and oxygen tanks. AGAIN THATS SCIENCE FICTION.

And i wish that when people here of extra terrestrial life they stop assuming that they are green men with large black eyes that come in flying disks to come and get us and take us back to the mothership. THINK ORGANIC MATTER. THINK SIMPLE ORGANISMS. FISH MIGHT BE ON OTHER PLANETS BUT NOT PEOPLE THAT TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT! People need to realize that when scientists, such as myself, think of organic life forms, we think of plants or single celled organisms but not those wierd life forms you see in scary sci fi movies or in a comic book.

Right there with you.



I wish, with every falling star wish, that people in the world would stop associating the term UFO with exterrestial alien life forms invading the earth.



UFO simply means that who ever it is that sees something is not able to identify exactly what that object is.  That is all.  Once you know what it is, it is no longer a UFO because you have identified what it is---and you know what??? It didn't come from another planet and it doesn't have some ray gun that vaporizes you either.

What space center are you planning to visit?  I have two children (13 and 10 now) and we have visited several space centers - ESA center is Belgium, JFK Space Center in Florida, and Stennis Center in Mississippi (close to Gulfport).  My kids also attended a week-long summer camp at Stennis few years ago.  All of them were very interesting visits and worth the trip.  For sure the 8 and 6 years old will enjoy it.  The 4 years old may be a little too young, so you may need to bring something (his favorite books or toys) to keep him entertained during the visit.

We use the Gregorian calendar which was adopted in 1582 AD from the Roman Julian calendar. Not all countries wanted to change. The last European country did not adopt use of the Gregorian calendar until 1923 AD. The Roman Julian calendar was adopted from the Roman Etruscan calendar in 46 BC. The Roman Etruscan calendar likely was adopted from the Greek Hellenic calendar by Romulus in 753 BC when the city of Rome was founded. Complicating matters is the fact that there was no standard Greek Hellenic calendar. Each Greek territory was allowed to establish its own lunar and solar calendars. These calendars did not have an established zero date. Most were used to keep track of time as compared to what year it was at the time. For instance, some event would be said to have happened 'ten years ago' and the like.



Other countries, while understanding the Gregorian calendar, still maintain the use of their traditional calendars:

Whitaker's Almanac reports that the Gregorian year 2000 AD/CE corresponds, respectively with:

Year 5109 in the Kaliyuga calendar; 
Year 2552 in the Buddha Nirvana calendar; 
Year 2551 in the Buddhist Era (BE) of the Thai solar calendar 
Year 2065 in the Bikram Samvat calendar; 
Year 1930 in the Saka calendar; 
Year 1929 (shown in terms of 5-yearly cycles) of the Vedanga Jyotisa calendar; 
Year 1415 in the Bengali calendar; 
Year 522 in the Gaurabda Gaudiya calendar; 
Year 1184 in the Kolla Varsham calendar

The current Chinese year is 4706 AD.

The current year in the Hindu calendar is 5106 AD.

The Gregorian calendar is based upon the supposed birthyear of Jesus the Christ.

Other calendars in use, are based upon the birth of a king who was a great leader.

If you do not want to use the birth of Jesus, and it all goes back to the Greeks who kept no official zero date, you are free to pick any year you wish. There is no such thing as an exact time. You can call this year 5 billion if you want to start with the birth of our Sun. Or you could call this year 14 billion if you wish to start year zero since the big bang.

Or just pick out someone from history and make up your own calendar year. Calendars are mostly meaningless other than using them as a tool to explain when an event in the past happened or when some event is expected to occur in the future.

Hi Nora.
I don't know much about Telescopes but the old saying is " you get what you pay for " If you buy an "Astral Telescope" images that you see will be back to front so if you want to use it for normal viewing as well then remember this. I have just looked on the Argos web site and they have a couple that seem pretty good. Depends on what you want to spend. Remember that if you go to a specialist shop they will give you the best advice but will probably be more expensive.

Celestron is a good make of telescope. A five-inch lens will allow you to see a few of the features of the planets:

The moons of Jupiter
On a good night, you might just make out the Great Red Spot and the Bands of cloud on Jupiter.

Mars is pretty featureless - you'll see the disc.

The phases of Venus - always a surprise to anyone who hasn't seen them before.

The rings of Saturn.

You'll also be able to see some beautiful double stars such as Mizar, Albireo.

You might just about be able to make out some of the nebulas but they won't be very impressive.

Make sure to get a telescope with computerised tracking.

You can see all of the constellations and planets without a telescope, just go outside and look!  All of the major planets (venus, mars, jupiter, and saturn) are visible to the naked eye without a telescope!

For a beginner scope, I would really not recommend anything in the "EQ" line.  EQ stands for Equatorial mount, which means that the telescope rotates around the same axis as the earth.  This is helpful when imaging or tracking a star/planet, but is incredibly difficult to get the hang of and requires properly aligning the telescope every time you bring it out, which is a hassle.

I would recommend against any telescope smaller than 8".  8" is a good starting scope that is still easy to pull out of the closet and use without an hour of setup time.  I would also recommend going with a "Dobsonian" style telescope.  They're easy to point and move around, they are constructed very simply so they are much cheaper for the size than other scopes.

I've got below two links for the main telescope manufacturers who are doing entry level dobsonians.  As I said, 8" is a good starting size, though in a pinch you could probably get away with a 6", though I'd really not recommend it.  (C'mon, $300 for an 8" Dob is a steal!) Don't get anything bigger than a 12", otherwise you'll never get the thing out because its too big and heavy.  My current scope is a 10" and its GREAT.

Also... Find a local astronomy club!! :)

The Earth is picking up mass from all the meteorites that fall on it, but that is only about 50000 tons a year.

The moon is getting further because of the momentum transfer from a slowly decelerating Earth, and that change in spinning velocity (the days are progressively getting longer as a result) is due to the tidal effect. The tidal bulge on the Earth drags the moon along, causing it to gain energy, and that extra energy translates to an increased elevation from the Earth.

You'll need an engine to use the IPN.  The IPN reduces your energy requirements.  It doesn't eliminate them.

There's a possible down side to the IPN.  The object that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago came in from the Sun side, and slow.  It's quite possible that the object was guided down one of the IPN routes to L1, where it came to nearly a stop before coming straight down on Mexico.

The day varies from 12 hours exactly at the equator to 24 hours at the Arctic and Antarctic circle. The only place where it is longer is in the Arctic regions in the northern summer and in the Antarctic regions in the southern summer. Since October is in the southern summer, the only place in the world which will get a specially long day on 17 October is within a few miles of the South Pole.

Ignore the scare mongering, it really isnt worth living your life in fear because someone somewhere said that we were all going to die.

Apart from the obvious (ie they wouldnt have got approval for such a test if there government or the eu actually thought it was that serious) one of the scientists doing the experiment has said how safe it is - and that all they are doing is repeating someone that happens naturally and safely everyday.

One of the posters has asked - what will happen if we do die - The answer is not an awful lot, thats the point behind dying.

If you mean a blackbody with temperature T = 2600 K,

Stefan-Boltzmann constant sigma = 5.67*10^-8 J*s^-1*m^-2*K^-4

power/area = sigma * T^4



= 5.67*10^-8 J*s^-1*m^-2*K^-4 * (2600 K)^4



= 2.591 * 10^6 J*s^-1*m^-2



Peak intensity:

Peak Wavelength lambda = 2.898*10^-3 m*K / T = 2.898*10^-3 m*K / 2600 K



= 1.1146 * 10^-6 m



= 1.1146 * 10^-6 m * (10^10 angstroms/m)



= 11146 angstroms

What kind (or how powerful) of a telescope do I need to see Saturn's rings?



I just bought Starmap application on my iPhone, and I can now locate any object in the sky, but I want to be able to see Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, etc.  Maybe Andromeda.  I don't have a lot of coin to spend on this.  I saw a 50x00x Vivitar at CVS for $14.99, I am sure it's a POS, but with that resolution would I be able to make anything out?

I would say I am willing to spend 50 to 75 bucks.  I dont need anything uber fancy.  Do I have any hope?  Is there any telescope you can recommend?  What is a good one's magnification levels?

I've seen 10x50 binoculars at the grocery store for under $50.

I've seen Saturn in 8x42 binoculars (though they were $400).  But Saturn's rings were tipped over much more than they are at the moment, and the sky was really, really clear and steady, and all i mean by seeing the rings is that they were minimally separated from the body of the planet, and i was able to brace the binoculars on something - possibly a $250 tripod, and Saturn wasn't on the other side of the Sun at the time.

I personally find it difficult to hand hold 10x binoculars.  But they can be OK if you brace your elbows on something.  It could get you started.

Keep your receipt.  If the binoculars are not aligned with each other (double images) return them right away.  Don't get zoom binoculars, that's just asking for lower quality.  Oh, and don't have the attitude that "these are cheap binoculars, so it doesn't matter if i toss them into the truck".  Inexpensive binoculars often have good optics, but they're more delicate that expensive binoculars.  I love my 22x60 monocular.  It was $250, but it's built like a bridge abutment.  The tube is cast iron.  The thing would survive nuclear war.  Not so my 7x35's from Sears.  They were toast the moment my wife tossed them into the bottom of the canoe.  I'm looking for a replacement now.  You take a guess if it's the binoculars or the wife...

Magnification isn't that important.  Aperture is.  That's the "50" in 10x50. I have not seen the rings in my 8x21 binoculars ($50). It's the aperture that's important.  Have i mentioned how important aperture is?

The cheapest way to get into astronomy by far is to visit a club.  They can show you stuff through their instruments, show you what's cool to look for, tell you how to find stuff, show you what you should buy when you've got the cash, are fun to hang out with, tell you where to get resources of any conceivable kind.  My club has loaner scopes for members - including a couple 10 inch scopes.  My 10 inch scope was $800.  For that, i could have belonged to the club for 26 years.

I can usually find Saturn in the Fall where a I live, and can usually see faint rings with my 3.6mm Super Eyepiece.But if you want it actually SEE saturn like you do in those NASA photos, I suggest going to your local Astronomy Club, or Wing at University and using on of their telescopes

For that price, it's going to be difficult.  However, most of the smaller, inexpensive refractors will allow you to see Saturn's rings alright, but it will definately not be spectacular.



You want at least 50x magnification for a descent look at the rings.  Binos won't do it.

Telescopes aren't rated by their magnification, since any telescope is capable of producing any magnification with the right eyepiece installed. They are rated by aperture: the diameter of the main lens or mirror. This in turn determines the resolution of the telescope and, to some extent, the maximum magnification possible with it. This is nothing but a toy telescope: poor optics on a shaky flimsy tripod -- don't waste your money on it!

You'll need at least 25x to see that Saturn even has rings (elliptical in shape) and at least 100x to see them as rings. You'll need an aperture of at least 50mm to use this magnification.

Here are a few web pages with good information on beginner's telescopes:
http://www.gaherty.ca/tme/TME0702_Buying...
http://www.scopereviews.com/begin.html
http://observers.org/beginner/j.r.f.begi...

For more advanced information, read Phil Harrington's Star Ware, 4th edition (Wiley).

You'll get the greatest value for your money with a Newtonian reflector on a Dobsonian mount, such as these:
http://www.telescope.com/control/categor...
http://www.skywatchertelescope.net/swtin...

Buy from a store which specializes in telescopes and astronomy, either locally or online; don't buy from department stores, discount stores or eBay as mostly what they sell is junk. Find your local astronomy club and try out different telescopes at one of their star parties:
http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community...

[Edit] You may be able to find a used telescope in the $75 range, but you're looking at about $180 for a new telescope which will give you satisfying views, like this one:
http://www.telescope.com/control/product...

Any cheaper telescope will be nothing but a toy, and give you nothing but frustration.

saturn is non-stellar in 8x42 binoculars, and distinctly oval in 20x80s. personal experience on both.

to actually resolve the rings you need a telesscope. you won't get anything worth buying for the money you want to spend. the minimum is a couple hundred (e.g. orion starblast, strongly recommended).

why not look up local astronomers and hang out with them? they will let you look through their scopes and you can see what's what. this may help you with your purchasing decisions, since it sounds like you need to reconsider your requirements and expectations.

you won't be able to see much of saturn for a few weeks anyway. use the time wisely.

There is a load of debris flying out there in case you are wondering. And yes we are alone so far. I mean there are about 1 000 000 species of animals, but speaking of alien forms the closest we got is the movie ET or series ALF. The flying stuff in the sky is usually CGI(computer generated image) if it looks too real or its a bad quality film that will be a plane looking like a big smudge on the screen. UFO is a unindetified flying object so if its unindetified how can we tell if its alien:?ˇ=D. Maybe ,and I havent seen a flying dish, those flying objects are just recon drones trying to figure out why are we still not flying to space and why are we still fighting wars like stupid and killing each other for no reason!

Provided that you have do not get torn apart by the tidal gravity, and you have sufficient shielding to not get vaporized by the radiation at the event horizon, it is possible to fall through the event horizon of a black hole and not die unitl you get closer to the singularity.



How can you survive with one half of you on one side of the event horizon and the other side of you on the other side?



And how can you survive in the black hole where gravity is so strong that even a ray of light falls towards the singularity?  How would your head know what your toes are doing?



</question>



<additional details>



Assume that the black hole is big so that you don't get torn up by the tidal forces until you are closer to the singularity.



I am doubling up and asking this in Physics too:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...

Check out the answer in the link to the physics section.  Their answer was by far the best.



And no, you wouldn't get torn up by the event horizon.  Space is sliding over the edge of the black hole.  If your toe slipped over the edge, you would follow so quickly that you would run into the light ray from your toe after you crossed the boundary.  As far as you could tell, everything would be normal.

There is nothing special about crossing the Event Horizon.  If you could resist getting torn apart by the tidal gravity up to that point, you would not have any problem getting across the event horizon.  There is no sudden jump in gravitational force at the Event Horizon.  It is just the place where the gravitational force has increased to a magnitude that light could no longer escape.

If you were orbiting extremely close to the the speed of light you could stay just outside of the event horizon. Any part of you that entered would not be able to maintain an orbit though and would fall in. It would be impossible for any part of your body that's inside to stay connected to anything outside the event horizon.

The part of your body within the event horizon is really screwed. Unless there is no force to hold things back, the event horizon of a black hole becomes infinity... so u have no choice, but to propagate to the center of the black hole.



If there is a force to hold you back, the event horizon shifts back from infinity to a finite value. If half of your body is on the worng side of the event horizon, your body will get ripped from the event horizon. say your body cant be ripped... then your blood will be 'pulled' right through your skin, into infinity... Also, you would lack a sense, because the radiation from the black hole will smoke your brain waves, and prevent nerve impulse from flowing (because the immense gravity will not let the electrons flow properly)... There are a wide number of things that coulg happen, but ur situation is quite impractical...

The problem here is that you're thinking of the event horizon as a static radius around the center of the black hole. The event horizon is actually dynamic; the closer you get to the black hole, the farther it moves towards the center of the black hole, because you yourself are moving into the black hole's gravity well and so there will be some light which can curve up and reach you but which might not be able to get all the way out to infinity. For a black hole many light years from the Earth, the event horizon for light being removed to infinity is essentially the same as the event horizon we perceive from the Earth, because the black hole's gravity is very weak where we are. But as you get relatively close to a black hole, you will effectively push back the event horizon, and upon crossing the area you thought was the event horizon as looking from the Earth, you would see the event horizon still some distance ahead of you.



That said, eventually you would reach a point where the event horizon would be close enough to you that part of your body could extend past it. At this point, you would have to be careful what you define as 'your body', because the part beyond the event horizon would no longer be able to communicate with the part up where your eyes are seeing from and so you would no longer be able to perceive any sensations of that part of your body existing at all. A short time later, you would reach the point where different parts of your brain would no longer be able to communicate with each other either, whereupon your consciousness would simply cease to exist. However I don't know if there is any black hole in the Universe large enough that you would not already have been torn apart by tidal forces by this time.

Ya, I don't see how one could neutralize tidal forces which puts a big hole in your question.



I suppose IF you could resist tidal forces time would slow down as you accelerate to nearly the speed of light which I believe would make it seem like you would pass through the event horizon in an instant. As you fall closer and closer to whatever is at the center of a black hole, my guess a swirling vortex of super dense death, the event horizon would remain directly in front of you as no light from a lower level would be able to reach you, but light from beyond the black hole would still be coming in. Once you hit the super dense mass at nearly the speed of light its all over.

Technically, The Russians "landed" a space probe on the Moon First...But it was a little over shadowed by the US when Neal Armstrong took an extended vacation with Buzz Aldrin...And decided to get out of the vehicle and stretch his legs...(Also, because the US tax payers spent a whole lot of money and wanted him to bring back some post cards from the gift shop..) Like the log jam ride at the amusment park...just as you slide down...there is a camera which takes your photo...Well, they came back with a lot of photos...Buzz was pretty upset that HE was not the First man on the moon...Because all the fame went to Neal...If I was Neal...I would have been very nervous ...being the First man on the Moon with Buzz still in the vehicle ... Would have been paroniod that he would lock me out...and take off with out me.

<answer>



I'm not sure, but I can offer some suggestions how you could work it out for yourself.



First find the average distance to Pluto, I'd google "distance to pluto"
Then look up the speed of an interplanetary spacecraft, the Voyager or Galileo probes might be good ones to use as a guess.



The answer is going to be a VERY rough estimate because Pluto, and all other planets are sometimes nearer and sometimes further away, and sometimes if you choose to pass by certain planets on the way to others you can use their gravity to give you a small boost in speed.



The answer is going to be many years. Something like 7-12 I'd bet.



But it might be possible to build a spacecraft that could make the trip much faster.



Current interplanetary probes can take a long time because they are unmanned, and don't have to carry air or food, or people who want to get someplace and then get on with their lives. If a ship were built to get people with a busy schedule to Pluto and back it might be possible to build one that could accelerate continuously and make the trip in just a few weeks.

Most of the sun's energy just travels off into the voids of space. Either it never hit the planet, or it's being reflected off the planet out into outer-space. The sun's energy often bounces off of our atmosphere into space. When the Earth does receive the energy, it emits infrared rays which are either trapped in Earth's atmosphere or radiate off into space.

Dangerous "Satellitorial Belt"?



Satellitorial Belt is nothing but debris released by all space missions so far. Humans have launched about 6000 satellites so far. Out of them, 400 are on interplanetary missions and only about 800 satellites out of remaining are operational. That means about 4400 satellites have become debris. In addition, there are thousands of bolts, nuts and waste dropped by the international space station, flying at about 52000 km an hour. Even if any ET spacecraft wants to visit us, they have to be very careful from the Satellitorial Belt.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Yes, we're leaving a pretty good mess up there, and we need to be careful.  However, there's a lot of space up there.  Even with all those thousands of objects, NASA considers it a "near miss" when something comes within a mile of the space station, and those aren't too frequent.



Luckily, most of that stuff is in low orbit, with gradually decaying orbits.  That trash will fall down, burning up in the atmosphere, and gradually solve the problem over time, unless we keep putting more junk up there.

The moon stabilises the rotation of our planet. The moon also is moving away from us. It will eventually leave orbit. When this happens the earth will perhaps wobble causing many thing such as a reverse of polarity.



A very large impact on the moon would also shatter it and produce a planetary ring. Something like Saturn.

Not sure what you mean. Do you mean fall out of orbit? Or do you mean the axis of spin changing? I don't see how it is possible to "fall off its axis".
In the absence of other, massive gravitational pulls, it cannot fall out of orbit.
The angle of the axis slowly changes over time, oscillating back and forth a few degrees over the course of 25,000 years. I presume this has some effect on our seasons and weather patterns, but I don't know to what degree.
Rather more dramatically, the polarity of the Earth has suddenly switched several times over the course of its history. We can tell this from the polarity of different layers of iron-rich rock in the Earth's surface. There's no real explanation as to how this happens and so one can only speculate what the consequences would be. That could be rather catastrophic.

Before the Earth and Sun formed, there was a giant cloud of gas (hydrogen and a little helium) left over from the Big Bang, and dust (left over from explosions of supernovas in our galaxy.



The dust and gas gradually coalesced by gravity to form a disc. Because the cloud was spinning slightly, gravity pulled the cloud into a spinning disc shape rather than concentrating all the mass at the centre. Even so, 99% of the mass clumped together at the centre, and the sun ignited. There was light. At the same time or soon afterwards, the rest of the disc formed into the planets, dividing the heavens from the firmament. This happened about 4.5 billion years ago.

<question>



How do I identify the things I saw, do you know what I saw (see my obs. notes)?



September 30 night - October 1 early morning (2008)



first clear night sky in monthsssss!
1♦ Where was the Moon!? Did it really have to not show up for this night...
went out with my new binocs, my first time seeing through 25x100s WOW I've never seen so many stars in my life.



Front porch facing N
9:30 - 11:30pm
2♦ Brightest star N, saw it as the sky was growing darker 9:30 pm, another bright star lower on left side of it. Planets?stars?



Started seeing satellltes. 16 satellites & 7 meteors (seen later on), amazing! Most I've seen in a night.



3♦ Saw Milky Way "clouds", what is it called?  Spiral arm dust or something?



4♦ With naked eye a big blob of fuzzy light, looked through 'nocs & they were a cluster of fairly bright stars (name?), NE about 11pm



Went inside to warm up & dress warmer, I wore sandals with no socks lol (got too excited, ran out the door)



Back porch facing S
12:25am - 3:32am



Proper footwear & many layers of clothes later...



Started seeing meteors.
5♦ Possibly Mars?, redish looking bright - WNW, about 1am
6♦ A bright ? that looked sort of bluish on edges - WSW
7♦ A set of stars that looked like a backwards J (with long line of 6 stars on top) - what is it?
8♦ Looked through 'nocs and found a relatively big blob of fuzzy light, I thought it looked like a galaxy? but I've never seen one b4! SSW
9♦ A relatively bright star? that appeared yellow, SW



I saw lots of stars & things, LOTS. I am so thankful for my new 'nocs.



Strange satellites:
one looked like it was falling but slowly turned E then slowly back down,



10♦ one was heading W & made a short U-turn as if it changed its mind about direction - why did it do that? too many cell phone calls in the E?!  j/k
Meteor stories:
The first meteor I saw made me say outloud, "Thank you God!"
2nd one was, "Wow!"
Last one scared me half to death because I looked at the time & it was 3am (I get scared) & right when I looked up there was the hugest one !



I would have stayed out till dawn but I got scared lol, it was dark! & cold, windy. But I had an amazing night. P.S. am I officially an amateur astonomer!?



</question>



<additional details>



I would have asked right after my observation but didn't have internet connection!  Rural Alaska...



Can you pleaaaaaase do it for me?  I can't download anything!

Not sure, I saw the documentary your talking about, plus another that explained most of the disputed points (Like the shadows going in different directions and the flag moving in the absence of an atmosphere, and lack of stars).



But that still leaves a lot of questions I'd like answered, like how when crosses were etched on the camera lens, could objects in pictures these cameras took, obscure some of the crosses?



How when the cameras were fixed to the astronauts spacesuits and were not fitted with viewfinders, was every picture perfectly framed?



How come the communication with the astronauts on the moon in 1969 was clearer than from many of the space shuttle missions thousands of miles nearer earth in missions after 2000?

I think that the answer is very open, you are not saying if they landed or not, but there are some facts that haven't been explained, so I agree with your answer, very mysterious this moon landing.

Yes, I believe 12 men walked on the moon.  The Apollo missions were tracked by many other countries, including Russia, who also sent unmanned missions to collect moon rocks.  If it had been faked, the rest of the world would have been howling with laughter and America would still be trying to live it down.  Thousands of people were involved and scientists still regularly bounce a laser off the lunar experiments left there.



I've seen the photos, the so called analysts dont seem to know much about photographic exposure, film development or printing which are the sources of most of the claims.  People also talk nonsense about the danger of the Van Allen belts (which Van Allen himself disagreed with).

In 1969 three men did not simply get into a rocket in someone's back yard and go to the moon with a film camera. The space race to the moon involved literally thousands of people, scientists, technicians, astronomers, specialists in many different fields, over many years. It is inconceivable that if the landings were faked then someone in the last 40 years would not have blown the whistle.



Also, this was the height of the cold war, and the soviets had some very sophisticated equipment of their own. You can bet they tracked that capsule every inch of the way to the moon and back. If there had been the slightest hint of a fraud, they would have screamed the place down.



The conspiracy theorists are complete idiots.

Which scientists? I know only one Apollo hoaxer, who left a university successfully. As Bachelor of Arts, Bill Kaysing even worked for Rocketdyne, but not as engineer, he prepared technical documentation.



You will not find any engineer on this planet, who will doubt the lunar landings... even in Russia, they know that it happened.



You don't even need to finish studying engineering... just the rocket equation and it's implications and the basics of astrodynamics is enough to check the Apollo numbers and come to the conclusion that they work out. The question, if the rocket is fitting to the numbers, is harder to answer without engineering degree, but the masses of the Saturn V had been even less favorable as the older Atlas. When Atlas was able to launch satellites and astronauts into space, the Saturn V was able to bring three people to the moon.

I believe that we almost certainly did go to the moon. Why?



Well, there's the kilos of moon rocks, the experiments that were conducted, the fact that the Russians didn't seem to think there was any hoax...



Then there's the fact that there's no real motif to fake the landings other then to save a bit of money. In reality, making an elaborate hoax and keeping the hundreds of people that were in on it quiet would probably have taken just as much effort and money then actually going to the moon.

I do think there was something odd about the coverage at least.  The trouble is, I just cannot believe such a thing could or would be fabricated.  On the other hand, having seen some of the evidence, particularly the photographic evidence, there is obviously something very fishy about it all.



As Jim Marrs once said, I believe in 10% of this conspiracy theory, the trouble is, I don't know which 10% it is!



I would also quote Ambrose Bierce who in his 'Devil's Dictionary' defined CERTAINTY as..."being mistaken at the top of one's voice!"

The documentary you mentioned brings to view and debate other theories that seem to arise just because people are looking for loopholes. Remeber the theory of "Who killed president John kennedy".
more recently we have had the theory that the president of America and the CIA were responsible for the Twin Towers disaster. if you had a telescope as big as the one at cape canaveral, you would be able to see the American Flag on the moon. Proof enough?

No, they weren't scientists.  But they fervently want you to think they are.  I've investigated the backgrounds of all the major Moon hoax conspiracy theorists.  None of them is an expert.  Most of them never even finished college.  Not surprisingly, their claims are based on very ignorant expectations and beliefs.  Among bona fide experts there is no question that the Moon landings were real.



Those who have asked specific questions about the Apollo evidence can check out the answers at my web site.  Yes, there are answers to all the conspiracy theorists' handwaving claims.

Yes, I've seen that documentary, and it is complete rubbish. The people responsible are _not_ scientists -- they have no scientific credentials at all.



The six Apollo Moon landings are among the best documented events in human history: thousands of pictures, hours of video, nearly half a ton of Moon rocks, and millions of eye witnesses, including myself. There is not a single scientist in the world who doubts that they took place. To deny them is to discredit the magnificent achievement of the team which went to the Moon, and to reveal abysmal scientific ignorance.



You obviously haven't done any serious research on this topic, but are just repeating the same old lies. Everything in this "documentary" has been refuted in detail on web sites like these:

Solar Eclipse? When Sun is not shadowed by any thing Earth or Moon - why to call solar eclipse?



Eclipse occures when the sun light is blocked either by Moon or by the Earth due to their  rotations around their exis and also around the sun. If earth blocks the sunlight, there is a Lunar Eclipse but when the Moon blocks the sunlight, it is called Sun Eclipse, Why? Sun is never eclipsed. The source of Light cannot be eclipsed. Even we are receiving the light from the distant galaxies, stars - the distance is unmeasurable.

Very good point!



From the point of view of the phenomenon of the shadow-casting (source, light obstacle, and the shadow itself) it would be more consistent to call a solar eclipse an "Earth eclipse".



From the point of view of an observer on Earth watching something becoming hidden from view then "solar" and "lunar" do make sense as these are the objects which are being hidden from view.



This is a very astute observation into the language we use. Nice one!

3) what should I look for when looking at the stars?



i'm not expecting great activity, but was wondering if i should keep my eye out for something (not UFOs)

I look up at the stars every night. I haven't lately because I caught the flu, and I've been glued to my bead for 48 hours now. But usually I spend most of my free night time looking at the night sky.



Mostly, I see satellites. As Nickleback said in one of their songs "we're confusing stars with satellites". Sometimes I'll see a meteorite, but not often given all the light pollution I have around here.



You can be on the lookout for Jupiter- it's currently the brightest object in the night sky second to the moon. Great time to view it. You can see at least 4 of its moons with simple binoculars.

I see lots of "falling stars"!  Last time I went out I saw 7 of them.



My friends keep telling me to download Stellarium.  You can look at the map before you go out and try to identify constellations or stars and planets.



I'm new at this too, I was looking for supernovas =D but I didn't see any.  I don't know if you can see them.  I was also looking for galaxies.  I like to look for satellites.

NASA routinely operates at a staggering loss. It undercuts private companies in the satellite launch business just to keep the competition out. This is taxpayer funded and equivalent to monopolising the industry. It is the reason why nothing of consequence has happened in space exploration in over 30 years.



Down with NASA. It is not a necessary government department. The private sector could do a tenfold better job.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You are wrong.



First, commercial satellite launches are not controlled exclusively by NASA.  The French satellite agency sends up commercial satellites all of the time.  The Russians also launch commercial satellites.  Private launches will happen in the near future.



Second, the real work of NASA is space exploration.  This is not an area of activity in which the private sector would invest.  After all, what company wants to sponsor a rover on Mars looking at rocks?  No matter what the rover finds, it will not be of any immediate economic value.  NASA does basic scientific research with little prospect for economic value in the near future.  Private industry will not create its own Hubble telescope, its own gamma ray observatories, its own planetary probes or any other far reaching scientific instrument that has no near term economic value.  The economic value of space is in satellites for communication, navigation, remote sensing, photography, and other earthly concerns.

If the Mayans told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?



With the flood of 2012 questions we always get I've found that people take the Mayans very seriously, and seem to believe in anything they say (even though they never predicted the end of the world in 2012). So to all those Mayan Maniacs out there: If the Mayans told you to jump off a bridge, would you do it?



</question>



<additional details>



If only their calendar predicted the end of the world.... too bad it didn't.



Ram: I'm really not sure what point you're trying to make. "Believe in a tribe"... you do realize that the Mayans never predicted the end of the world, right?



PRS: That's what I'm wondering too... what's the point of taking a prophecy from an extinct civilization seriously? What's the point of taking any prophecy seriously? I guess the History Channel needs something to run a "documentary" (and I use that term lightly) on.

How high off of the ground is the hypothetical bridge?



Are the Mayans offering me any type of reward if I comply?



Are there any detrimental consequences which I must pay if I refuse?



Source(s):



PRS- Try telling the Mayans sometime that they are no longer around.



Ali- I guess that means that there are no more Huns nor Egyptians nor Romans nor Scandinavians nor Germans in the world anymore either.



Suitti- I expected you to know better.



Looney- Maybe it's because it's the people of YOUR TIME who are behind this 2012 hoax and not the Mayans.



RAM- How did it divert? Umm, have you heard of money? And it wouldn't hurt to use a spell check. If you are so freely willing to allow these hoaxes to pass as harmless jokes, then you might be interested to note that there is an end-of-the-world scenario set for each year from now to 2012. So check out the doomsday set for 2009 and have your giggles. Then when 2010 comes, look up that doomsday event also so you can chuckle through that year as well. It should prove to give you some 'interesting' reading while you await your demise.

I would jump off a bridge for fun, the Mayans aren't in charge of me and as for predicting stuff i bet 90% of them had herb/drug induced visions like some of the north american indian tribes, i have done some reading about south american cultures like the Olmec, Toltec and the Mayans and while they might have had culture and civilization i'll bet they couldn't predict there way out of a wet paper bag, but just imagine if some archaeologist found a Mayan relic that was a disclaimer for their predictions,(warning our predictions are for entertainment purposes only) then i would really laugh at all the 2012 nutcases lol.

People believe in the Mayans because what they predicted on their calendar is very good/accurate.
But sometimes I think people take stuff too seriously. My brother told me that the Mayan predicted something big happening in 2012, but a lot of people (who believes in it) are saying it's the end of the world, haha.

It's up to the individual to believe or not, anyhow it's just 4 years away. Let's not take thing seriously or personally. Let's wait and see, as simple as that.



When a man came and told that i spoke to god, so many people belived it (even though no one have seen god, or do we have any prove of it) and still following it blindly.



What's wrong in believing in a tribe, not one man, but a tribe that was so accurate in astronomy with proves of their building structure and artifaks based on astronomy. I don't see anything wrong with that.



Let's not judge anyone and just follow with our own believes, as long as it doen't hurt anyone.



I personally think all this 2012 issue and the theories given are very interesting to read, but i'm not making any conclusions.



LIFE GOES ON



And jumping of a bridge, come on i wouldn't even do it if my parents told me so, who are mayan?
I think it's not a very good question. Sorry for that.



Note: Yes, i know that the mayan did not say it is the end of the world, but the mayan did say that at every end of the cycle something bad in a big scale will happen.



But i have to agree that people are over reacting to this, and i have no clue how this diverted to the end of the world.

First, if the Earth's rotation slows down the day gets longer, not shorter, because a day is how long it takes for the Earth to rotate once.



Second, the Earth's rotation is slowing due to the drag from the Moon.  This currently adds 1.5 milliseconds to the day every century.  Extrapolated back in time this means that billions of years ago the Earth's day may have been only 16 hrs long.  The rotational energy being lost by the Earth is being added to the Moon's orbit causing it to move further away.



The slow down has been measured by atomic clocks.

I believe we should terraform mars because the risk that invalid with sending a humans to mars. Because they may never come back. So if they are to go it should be at lest to terraform mars, i would not like to see any human take that risk with out a real good resin. Like making Mars habitable for farther mission to mars so their live would not be in vane in the cause, that they might die. yes it would be all most in possible to terraform Mars. that why they should not go tell they could possibly terraform Mars are lay the grounds for more mission to Mars so that the risk would be a lot more save. what do you thank?

What is the coldest Galaxy?



Astronomy is a great science; it's the exploration of space. Space is like the earth's ocean has so many events and lights and places as much as billions near infinite possibilities.
A galaxy is a whirlpool of stars; our sun is a star in a galaxy called The Milky way Galaxy. And there are millions of galaxies unknown could be even more. And with galaxies there are many different characters or types and different temperatures.



What are the recent 5 coldest galaxies found? (All answers welcome)

Here are two questions ... about asteroids?



1. If you were the president and NASA had told you that an asteroid that could destroy the earth was definitely going to hit in 3 weeks... then would you tell the world... or just keep it to the government so everyone didn't go scarce??



2. If you did find out about an asteroid that was going to hit in 3 weeks... what would you do? if there was no getting away from it and the asteroid would destroy the earth??



thank you.

i definately wouldnt' say anything til i was sure.... humans are dumb panicy animals, so instantly the world would be thrown into pandemonium..... after i was positive i would tell the world immediately.... there's no telling what people could do with their last few weeks before they're about to die.... i assume most would get closer to their families, make up with those they had fights with etc... i'd wanna make sure to give people this chance, rather then just spring it on them at the last second (traffic would also be highly congested, so i'd wanna give people enough time to actually get back to their families and loved ones.)



as for what i'd do... well, even if there was 0 chance of survival i would try... i'd likely get ot the highest elevation i could... most of the face of the earth is oceans, so there's a high chance it would hit water...

No, it can't do that. And NASA does not say something like that.



NASA says, that Earth's axis can be in different orientations as it is today, there is actually possible evidence, that before Dinosaurs started to walk over Earth, the axis of Earth was 52° away from it's present orientation. But the speed of such a transition is around 1° per one million years.



But the evidence for this theory is not solid and very rare. There are only two places on Earth, which indicate such a orientation and both times, the evidence is based on the orientation of Earths magnetic field.



Small variations of Earths axis are normal. But also normal are LARGE variations in Earths magnetic field.

Since Nasa may have surveyed and/or researched on it, but finally the whole world is been worked out by the Almighty since he has created the world he is the only person to distroy it hence it is neither scientifficaly or bilogically beneficial for the people living on this earth whether the earth go away 60 degree or 100 degree from its axis, eveything has been written and elaborated about the destruction / end f the earth, so why to worry what will happen just we the people of the earth should think positive and live a peaceful life, live like a human being and not to fight for greed either in terms of money or power in the end no one on this earth understand that he has come alone without any money and he will go alone without money after death after all we cannot carry cash, gold etc with us, Hence people should focus on humanity rather than other things.

The Earths orbit is far more convenient as it is a shorter distance and requires no specific launch time when the two bodies are in close alignment

The costs to launch even a small payload of humans to the moon is much more expensive than earth orbit.  The risk is much less in earth orbit as well.  More radiation protection is also needed outside of the van allen radiation belt on the moon.  These factors and many others make the earth orbit approach easier to justify our tax dollars spent there to politicians/taxpayers.



Also, the idea was started by Ronald Reagan and his goal was for earth orbit and not the moon again.  The momentum for such a high profile project definition is hard to change to something else - especially when we have international cooperation involved on longe term complex projects to make safe hardware.

Low Earth orbit is easier and cheaper to get to. From before the beginning of space flight people assumed there would be both an orbiting space station and a base on the Moon. The original thinking was that the orbiting space station would come first because it was easier to do. In fact it was originally thought we would complete an orbiting space station before the first Moon landing. That didn't happen, but NASA is still planning a Moon base. They need congress to pay for it though and so far congress has not been willing to do that.

Well, first off, a space station on the moon wouldn't be a space station, it'd be a moon base.



The reasons they have a space station and not a moon base are, first, it's easier to fly a hundred miles into orbit to a station than it is to fly hundreds of thousands of miles to the moon, and second, they do experiments and stuff dealing with zero gravity, which wouldn't quite work if they were on the moon.

It would be great if we had warp drive too.  That doesn't mean it's possible.



The Apollo missions were brief jaunts to the Moon.  That's not enough experience acquired to undertake building a permanent base there and dealing with all the problems like long-term exposure and resupply.  The missions currently under planning are the prelude to establishing a more permanent base on the Moon.  But the ISS serves an important purpose, and its position in Earth orbit makes it relatively easy and inexpensive to access it.

I don't know, i am fairly bemused by the whole thing. Went to the moon a few times, then got bored with all that exploring planets stuff. Maybe there is no money in it so they would rather fob us off with the old, we are short of funds, line.



I am 90% in the "camp" of we went to the moon though. And I love the all alien stories, basically because there is no way of ACTUALLY knowing. But if they are there then they must be peaceful. If they are not peaceful, then what are they waiting for?



And anyway, the moon is an illusion. Its an artificial satellite placed there by higher beings to accelerate evolution on earth. Its diameter and distance are in perfect mathematical sync with the the earths astrological journey. I thought you would agree.

Time to get to near-earth orbit: 90 minutes or less.
Time to get to the moon: 60 hours.
The costs are also at least 40 times more to get to moon orbit, even more if you want to go down to the surface and get back up again.

Should we terraform mars ?



I believe we should terraform mars because the risk that invalid with sending a humans to mars. Because they may never come back. So if they are to go it should be at lest to terraform mars, i would not like to see any human take that risk with out a real good resin. Like making Mars habitable for farther mission to mars so their live would not be in vane in the cause, that they might die. yes it would be all most in possible to terraform Mars. that why they should not go tell they could possibly terraform Mars are lay the grounds for more mission to Mars so that the risk would be a lot more save. what do you thank?



P.S. I would go to Mars if NASA would let me.

Sure, why the heck not?



On the other hand, this terraforming is probably going to be more complicated than just tossing a bunch of kudzu seeds all over. Either because of the gravity difference or perhaps the lack of a magnetic field Mars may not be able to hold on to an atmosphere like we have here.

Why not.



We are destroying and overpopulating Earth so to do the same to another planet would be in our nature.



I know I might seem a bit narky but if we cant even look after our own planet, what chance does any other planet have with us infesting it?
Besides... rather than spend BILLIONS and BILLIONS of Dollars, pounds, euros etc on doing this, perhaps we could spend the money on research into curing diseases, or perhaps giving more food to people dying of hunger etc.

Adventure and exploration is fraught with risk, that's the whole point about it. It's about going beyond your boundaries and re-writing what is possible for humans to do. If everyone was put off by exploration because they were afraid to die, we'd all still be living in caves.



We should terraform Mars, but not for the reasons you've stated. Besides, how are you going to terraform it without sending people there first? Robots can't do everything, at least not yet.

We call them aliens. And we must be aliens to them. The Universe has 10 to the power 11 galaxies. And each galaxy has 10 to the power 11 stars. The Sun is one one of those stars. So we cannot question the existence of a similar earth in the Universe. Can we ? As science and communication will progress we will soon know the truth. Its just like a few centuries ago we did not know that an atom existed but it does.

Even though the universe is finite the existence of aliens is a sure thing.



DNA emerged from a combination of time,chemistry and environment all of which are abundant in all parts of the universe.



We are the result of DNA and it is unimaginable that it did not occur anywhere else.



We have not and may never get proof of their existence or they of ours but they must exist.

I think aliens do exist coz if in so many planets within our reach earth posses life then our universe has about 1billion * i billion stars then consider the number of planets they possees. Atleast one of them may have life. The only problem is that the distance between life supporting planets are in term of millions of light years and only few maybe smart enough to communicate.



therefore aliens do exist but far enough to be incommunicable.

there are small pieces of evidence suggesting the presence of aliens or alien-like beings.I mean that all around us we have many weird constructions like the pyramids of egypt and south america,the stone



henge and other  stuff like the huge formations present in sand in argentina(dont know wat they are called,sorry).there are also things like the "wow" noise recorded suggesting their presence.after all, the universe is HUGE and the chances finding just one planet with life in a universe with more stars than grains of sand on earth(its true!!)is almost zero.

Milli means one thousandth, so a millisecond is one thousandth of a second and there are 1000 milliseconds in a second.



This applies to any metric unit:



1000 milligrams in a gram
1000 millimetres in a metre
1000 millilitres in a litre
1000 millipedes in a ???

Dangerous "Satellitorial Belt"?



Satellitorial Belt is nothing but debris released by all space missions so far. Humans have launched about 6000 satellites so far. Out of them, 400 are on interplanetary missions and only about 800 satellites out of remaining are operational. That means about 4400 satellites have become debris. In addition, there are thousands of bolts, nuts and waste dropped by the international space station, flying at about 52000 km an hour. Even if any ET spacecraft wants to visit us, they have to be very careful from the Satellitorial Belt.

You don't actually trust politicians and the private sector to reverse the effects of global warming do you? This planet is dying. It will take a few years to build these super launchers.

It would be infinitely more feasible to reverse the effects of climate change here on Earth, than to get in spaceships and look for another Earth. We don't even know whether such a planet exists in our galaxy. Earth might be unique in the universe, for all we know. That's why it's imperative that we look after it.



Having said that, if we plan for our species to survive indefinitely, we will eventually be forced to leave the planet by our brightening Sun. That is in the very distant future, however.

Science, as we understand it today, is the recipe we follow in order to understand how the universe works, and to make this knowledge available in a standardized way.



The manner in which we conduct science today was created, over a few centuries, by scientists in the Western World (meaning Western Europe).  People like Galileo, Newton, even William of Ockham (13th century), established the principles that are still used today by scientists.  Because most universities were established by (or with the help of) the Christian churches, then most scientists at the time were Christians.



For example: Ockham's razor (known in those days as "lex parcimoniae"  a Latin expression which, today would be translated as Keep It Simple) is still used to determine the usefulness of one theory compared to another.  William of Ockham was a Franciscan Friar.  Even more recent scientists:  Lemaitre (who formulated the hypothesis that became the Big Bang theory) was a catholic priest.



However, this does not mean that science (in a larger sense) was not practiced before.  It may have been practiced differently and it did lead to understanding and knowledge that is still used today.



For example, the idea of giving names to stars (in order to make the study of astronomy easier) comes from Arabic-speaking astronomers, many of them muslim.  Algebra (as we use it today) was created (or explained) by  Islamic Persian mathematician, Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī.  He did not invent calculation.  However, he did bring together (al-jabr) methods to solve equations by following specified rules -- rules that we still use today: for example, transposition and cancellation.



The Greeks of two thousand years ago had Philosophy (pure science explaining the working of the heavens -- e.g., astronomy) and Physics (impure science that explains what happens on Earth -- e.g., mechanics).



The Babylonians were heavily into arithmetics which led to the Greek geometry.



and so on.



Every civilization did practice "science" in its own way (trying to understand how the world works).  Some civilizations recorded information that is still used today by people practicing science using our practices.



However, the knowledge itself is not science.  It is the result of science.



The fact that the Earth is a sphere (or almost) is not science.  It is an item of information that can be established by science, but it is only a piece of information.



Therefore, the Quran itself contains information, not science.  The information in the Quran shows that the muslim world was practicing science a long time ago and that it found out a lot of information that way.



Some of that information is still used today.  Just as we still use information that was found by the Greeks who were practicing science their way.



But we know that nothing contains ALL science nor all information that can be found by science.

Yeah, the 2012 hype is just hype. Some of it is shamelessly taken from failed predictions that the world would end in 2003 or 2004.



People ascribe a lot of various causes to what will destroy the world in 2012, but none of them hold up.



A planetary alignment can't happen. You will never see the planets line up straight. It's a consequence of orbital mechanics that this will never happen. Even if it did, it wouldn't do anything.



Some also think the magnetic poles will flip (so a compass would point south), and somehow that will destroy the world. But such magnetic flips happen naturally, and when they've flipped before there was no evidence of anything bad happening.



Some say it's related to the Mayan calendar, which supposedly ends on December 2012. This is based on the notion that on the Winter Solstice of 2012, the Sun will be in front of the center of our galaxy, from Earth's point of view. Still, even if this happened, it would have 0 effect on the Earth. Worse still, the Mayans had no way of knowing where the center of the galaxy is. It took until the invention of X-ray telescopes for modern civilization to find out where the center was.

We can do a very, very rough back-of-the-envelope calculation and see.



Distance to nearest star is very roughly 6 trillion miles.
Speed of rocket, say, 250,000 miles per hour (get to the moon in an hour!)



That distance at that speed would mean about 24,000,000 hours. That is very roughly 2,800 years.



So, if we started today. we would arrive September 3, 4808



Not exactly a quick trip.

Why are planetary orbits so stable?



You would think that some time in the past 4 billion years something would have nudged the earth out of its orbit and caused it to spiral either towards or away from the sun, but it hasn't. The fact that planetary orbits have remained stable for billions of years seems to indicate some kind of negative feedback system is at work. Is that the case?

We humans on this planet are accustomed in thinking to our scale. Average height 5'2, weight 150lbs. The way we move, the way we can move ourselves is how we compare and contrast all other events in the universe. To us, an ant is a supermover. To us, the Pacific is a vast ocean. Regarding time is the same story. To us, a year can be a tremendous period. My point being is that the scale for space is much larger than us humans. Gargantuan things take huge amounts of time to happen. A million-year-old star is still an infant. To your question, the solar system appears stable to us, because of the time scale difference. In reality, this solar system is changing. Phobos is spiraling down to crash into Mars. The rings of Saturn are only temporary; they are spiraling in, or dispersing out. Miranda will be smashed apart again in some future time. Jupiter will lose some of its outer moons to the sun. The planets themselves are probably changing but we can't be precise enough to detect it, yet.

No, it's not negative feedback.  It's just gravity plus the _emptiness_ of space.  There really isn't anything out there to "nudge" the earth out of orbit.  Even  when the Moon hit the Earth, back about 4 billion years ago, that wasn't enough to change the orbit by more than 2% -- probably a lot less.



Remember, there is practically no friction on the orbit of the planets.  The tiny bit of friction that exists would take a lot more than 4 billion years to move the orbits by even a few miles -- and Earth is 93 million miles from the Sun!  (The same applies to energy stealing by passing asteroids -- they are just too small to do anything.)



An orbiting planet has a certain amount of orbital energy.  There is nothing to reduce or add to this energy.  So the orbit remains stable.



Actually, gravity interactions mostly with Jupiter & Saturn cause the Earth's orbit to oscillate slightly.  The eccentricity of the orbit changes over periods of 100,000 of years, ranging between 0.5% and 5.8%.  Read up on Milankovitch cycles.

For spiraling downward (constant loss of energy) you need a force slowing Earth down for a long time. Collisions are short events. Actually Earth is spiraling upwards, because the sun gets lighter in every second - in 4 billion years, we will be as far away from the sun as mars today.



Most planetary orbits are stabilized by resonance effects with other planets, as well as the huge difference of the mass of the sun to the planets.

You need to look in the north west as soon as it gets dark. The Big Dipper is below the horizon during the middle of the night, so you need to look before then. At 8 p.m. on the 3rd, Alcor will be at azimuth 320º and altitude 26º. By 9 p.m. it's at azimuth 324º altitude 18º. If you're up early on the 3rd, Alcor rises at 3.22 a.m. At 6 a.m. it's at azimuth 30º, altitude 11º. By 7 a.m. the sky will be too light for Alcor to be seen.

Gravitational pull is stronger with more mass. So for greatest gravitational pull from least gravitational pull it would be most massive to least massive:



1. mountain
2. car
3. person
4. basketball.



It's opposite for least to greatest.

For launch the STS uses 2 systems: the main engines in the orbiter



that burn hydrogen and oxygen from the external tank (the great big orange



cylinder that the orbiter is attached to for launch); and the SRBs (Solid



Rocket Boosters) that burn a solid rocket propellant that is a mixture of



powdered aluminum and ammonium perchlorate.  These are used only for launch.



The orbiter (what most people think of as "the Space Shuttle") has two



propulsion systems: OMS (Orbital Maneuvering System) used to change orbit and



to return to earth, and the RCS (Reaction Control System) used for station-
keeping and attitude control.  Both systems burn hydrazine with oxygen.

Your original question begins with "Why"



The main reason (if not the original one) is that a group of charlatans have a book to sell about the end of the world.  The book is on how to survive the end of the world, and it was about the end of the world in 2003.
Obviously, they did not sell enough.  They modified the book (at the very least, they changed the dates to fit the minor hoaxes already circulating about 2012) and created a lot of hoopla around the date of the Winter Solstice of the year we call 2012.



That date had already been picked by astrologers (not astronomers) as a portent of a New Age:  The position of the Winter Solstice will cross the Galactic equator (which is not a normal astrology line) in early 2013.
Therefore, the day of Winter Solstice in 2012 will be the last time that the Sun will be at the position of the Winter Solstice, before the position of the Winter Solstice crosses the equator.



In astronomy, it means nothing.  In astrology?  Who knows what is important in astrology.  Anything that sells, I guess.



Once the idea of a New Age was "out there", people found links and "coincidences".  For example, the Mayan day-count calendar used by the Mayan astronomers (not the common Mayan calendar used by the general population), reaches a round figure on that date.
This is not surprising as the Mayan astronomers (like all the ancient astronomers -- Greek Babylonians, Chinese...) knew the precession cycle and they set up their calendar that way.



For Mayans, the day of the Winter Solstice was their New Year's Day (just as it was in Northern Europe until the Church came along and tried to change it to a date linked to the Spring Equinox).



So, it is not surprising that they set up their calendar so that it would reach a round figure on New Year's Day of a year when the position of the Winter Solstice was in the thickest part of the Milky Way.



The Mayan day-count calendar just... counts days.  It makes no predictions.  It does not even end (unless you know of a maximum number beyond which there are no more numbers).



All the "predictions" about the end-of-the-world are recent inventions intended to fit with the Big 2012 Hoax Off.



Planet Nibiru (in this context) was invented by a translator who worked with old Sumerian texts (and had a vivid imagination).  We know the planet is fictitious and we know who invented the legend and when.  Even this guy is fed up to see how "his" fictitious planet was hijacked and forced to participate in the Big 2012 Hoax Off.  As far as the inventor of the legend is concerned, the return of Nibiru should be in 2085 (or later).



Planet X is a term used to design an undiscovered planet that could exist beyond the orbit of Neptune.  At one time, it was thought that Pluto would be that planet, but Pluto is too small to explain perturbations in Neptune's orbit that started the search for Planet X.  All we know about Planet X (the real one, not the one invented for the Big 2012 Hoax Off) is that it never comes into the inner solar system (otherwise, the Kuiper belt would be far more disrupted than it really is).



A pole shift will not occur.  A magnetic reversal could be starting and these things can take "as little as" a thousand years.  On average, though, they take about five thousand years.  When I was studying that stuff a few decades ago, it had not yet started.  Most of us think the date will be 3500.  In any event, even if it had started in the last few years, it cannot be done in time for 2012.



The LHC is a particle collider.  It is not the first one.  When it works full power, it may cause particle collisions with as much energy as 7 TeV (the tera-electron-volt is a unit of energy in particle physics), making it the most powerful man-made collider.  It is still puny compared to Mother Nature's.



Earth is bombarded every second by cosmic particles arriving with an energy greater than 1,000,000 TeV.  The record observed is 320,000,000 TeV.



A particle collision is a particle collision.  If a 7 TeV collision is dangerous for Earth, imagine how dangerous a collision of 1,000,000 TeV would be.



Every second.



For billions of years.

Scientists don't expect anything out of the ordinary to happen in the year 2012, or specifically on the date December 21, other than the solstice, which happens every year.



None of the "predicted" happenings for 2012 hold up under close scrutiny. "Planet X" and "Nibiru" simply don't exist. The Mayan calendar ends a cycle, but there were no predictions of the end of the world. The Sun doesn't line up with the galactic centre; it's 6 degrees off. No asteroids or comets are actually predicted to hit Earth.



All of this stuff was put together by crackpots in order to promote their books and TV shows, and shamelessly promoted by the History Channel. Don't take any of it seriously!

I personally feel that it was the end of the calendar. The calendar couldn't go on forever. It had to end somewhere. It so happens that it ended at the end of autumn and beginning of winter. No big deal.



There currently does exist interest in trying to locate Nibruru. I wouldn't put much stock in it being found anytime time soon. What really get stupid is the notion that its a big planet and that it would crash against the earth. NOT. If it was even the size of earth, we would have found it by now considering that 2012 is a little over 3 years from now. Which would place it in a position in space easily to be spotted.



Pole shifts do occur. Its natural occurrence in earth's history. The magnetic field is weakening but the true shift could be several hundred to thousands of years off. And the true shift change is really tripped by our sun's activities or lack thereof. Note. All sun spot and solar flare activities have ceased for the first time in a very long time. The last time the sun went without solar flares and sun spots, triggered a mini ice age felt very hard throughout europe and asia.

I did read an article not to long ago suggesting a pole shift in the near future was possible. But from what I've been able to gather, such an event would not have a significant (as in deadly) impact on life as we know it.
