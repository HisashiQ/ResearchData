Some helpful suggestions.....

If it just started, sometimes rest alone can get rid of it.

-ice it a lot, 20 minutes a few times a day at least
-anti inflammatory meds can give some relief 
-wear a counterforce brace when possible
-rest it
-use warm-up, stretching, and strengthening exercises (I'm sure you can find these online)

If the pain is beyond this and it's ongoing, you may have to consider surgery or cortisone injections.  Ultrasound therapy can also be pretty effective.

I know exactly how to get rid of tennis elbow.I used to go to the gym and was okay but then i decided to lift a peice of big concrete  slab from my garden and devolped tennis elbow which i had for 3 months. I found holding a pint of lager difficult.I read online and followed instructions.These excerises should be done everyday as that muscle has been damaged and needs to build up again slowly...

1.The table edge.Squeeze the front of a table edge 10 times.
2.Fist your hand and squeeze as though you are squeezing a squeezy ball.Even better to sqeeze a sqeezey ball.Do this 10 times.
3.Fist your hand completley.Do not sqeeze.Position as holding a bunch of flowers upright.Move wrist only up and down 10 times. 
4.Fist your hand.Postion as holding a bicycle handle bar and move wrist left and right 10 times.(Speed for 3 and 4 should be 1 sec for an up and down motion.

This does work and wil be cured in 1-2 weeks.But best advise is from a doctor.

You may never. A buddy of mine has a sever case, He has to go in and get pain killer shots into his elbow every four months or something ridiculous like that. Go to a doctor before you do any more exercise. I hope the best for you.

There is something called Bi0-freeze that chiropractors use on there patients. It works for all kinds of things. It is kind of like icy hot but better. You can't get it at the store but there is something very close to the name if it. I am not sure if that will help you. I hope it does though. You can find it at walmart.

Hi there

What you need to do is find a good school that teaches the basic principles of how to turn everyday common objects into deadly weapons. You simply cant go around carrying lethal weapons because its against the law but if you know how to use things like your belt, coins, keys etc then you don't have to.

A good respectable self defense class will show you these things and more.

But its far better to have overall awareness. If you know what you're looking for you can avoid nasty people and the places they like to visit.



Best wishes

I am sorry but the fact is that no specific technique that anyone tells you on here will actually do you nay good if you are jumped if you have not practiced it 1000's of times, with a resistant opponent. There are no shortcuts to learning self defense, at least non that are worth squat.

As suggested by a few others if you are that worried you need to find a good martial arts school with a good instructor, who teaches and trains for realism. I wouldn't worry so much about what style, just the level of instruction and training that you can get.

Unless you do a technique or move enough to burn it into your muscle memory, it will be of no use to you when your fight or flight response kicks in.

There are many answers on here about how to find a good school and instructor, so I wont go into that here.

Wish I could tell you something easier but it is just like anything else worth having in life, it takes work and commitmrent. Good Luck.

Join a reality based training program, such as Street self defense. it does not help to start doing a Martial Art from scratch if you purely want to be able to get out of situations unscathed.

My best advice would be to take a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu course.  It is the best way to make an attacker stop fighting without killing them.  My coach teaches a women's self defense course and since most rapes happen on the ground, it is convenient to be able to choke or decapacitate your attacker from that position.

stretch everyday in the morning and at night. you'll be sore the first few days but trust me, it'll be worth it. you can not speed up this process. some people are born flexible and others just aren't. everyday you should get a little more flexible. herews some simple stretches that i've been doing for years (they will help you flexiblility a lot)
***hold each stretch for at least 10 seconds.
- sit in stratle and reach for your left foot, right foot then in the middle. 
- sit in pike (legs together in front of you) and bend forward as far as you can.
make sure your also roll out your rists, neck and arms. 
well i hope i helped! and good luck =D

Why is there snobbery in karate?



after taking my son to the leisure center in south shields tyne & wear
uk, we were ignored as if we didnt exist by the the dans and nearly dans so i took my son to a different place after being presented by
bob roads 5th dan who, by the way wasnt a snob. i was watching my son doing his "catta" and later, was spoken to by his 3rd dan teacher
and i have to say, i was flabbergasted because i was used to being
treated with contempt by the by the south shields lot

Trouble is you'll find snobbery and arrogance in a lot of things these days. I went into EBGB music in Durham a couple of months ago and the prat that time forgot just ignored us and when i asked him about something for my daughter he didn't even look at me and gave blunt answers. Another occasion i went into the cycle shop on Claypath in Durham and got a similar attitude. Not very good for business in my opinion. As far as karate is concerned i've never experienced that myself, however after attending a kickboxing class in Houghton le Spring recently i never went back. The teacher was a total d1ck. Pulled me to one side during a spar and said he wanted to see kickboxing, not karate. HELLO!! NEW STARTER. You're supposed to be teaching me.

I am sometimes suspicious of these questions.We dont know the "south shields lot" or you for that matter.And you could be the problem not them you could also have a grudge with them or someone there and this is just an opportunity to poison the well .

Your use of the spelling catta instead of kata is also suspicious as even the worst no nothing wannabe does some research at least reading previous postings and the proper spelling has been used here at least 10000 times .

You may just have a "I need to be catered to ego" and feeling anything less is contempt.That is a very strong word and entails things I feel your aren't even aware of.

Why is there snoberry in coffee shops? Why is there snoberry in resteraunts? Why is there snobbery in a school? It's all in who runs it.

The fact is that your question is really not valid. Why not ask why is this karate school so snobbish, rather then generalizing karate as a whole?

Quite honestly this is the type of thing that flows from the top on down, so i would imagine that it starts with the Sensei and gets passed on to his students. I have not seen this in any school I have visited. Normally the upper ranks are at least required to help with the lower ranks, however many do it because they want to, not because it's required. My outlook is that if it hadn't been done for me I would not be where I am.

Good move changing schools.

A lot of schools simply aren't interested in youth programs / young karatekas...I've noticed in the US that there is a real segregation by age, and by gender for that matter, in some schools.



Honestly, you can't expect a young person to perform at the same level of power, form, etc. that an adult will.  So many schools (especially competitive ones) simply ignore the "kid" program.  It's not necessarily snobbery, just a lack of encouragement toward developing youth.

I think you did the right thing switching schools to a more friendly environment.  Part of Martial Arts is teaching respect and personal responsibility - you've done well for your son!

I am sorry that you have encountered this ignorant attitude. You have been unfortunate and chosen a rogue club - speak to other karateka and find a dojo on recommendation. Sadly, there are good and bad folk all over the UK - we're not all 'snobby' or unfriendly down south!!
Hope you find a good club soon!

the kurikata is actually the knob on the saya that holds the sageo (chord)...i'm not too sure what the knot itself is called. Different knots exist...Cho Musubi is one of these for example...

Thai boxing sparring questions.. Look! :P But only if you've done it longer than a year or two please?



Alright so i moved up from beginners class into the next class like a month ago. Been thaiboxing for 4 months now. I would say i'm easily one of the youngest and being like 5'9 and not really built doesn't help either. I'd say i can move around faster than most but not punch as fast.  What should my strategy be against these people?



i have trouble against really strong people while sparring. Like this big boned fat strong guy who has like the worst technique i've seen in my life. Just reaaaaaally strong



people with amazing hand speed because of a boxing back ground give me trouble too. I try kicking and keeping my distance but eventually you have to box.



Sometimes the awkwardly tall experienced people give me trouble too



My punching is abit crap but my kicks are preety good.. I'm trying to work on the punching

I don't Thai Box. I do know one BASIC principal that crosses all disciplines that is often forgotten. Never fight force to force. This is especially true if you are not the strongest or fastest fighter. You need to learn to slip up to the side of the attacker and let the attack miss you and attack the opponents blind side. Wait for the attack. Another strategy that works is to open the door. From a middle stance step either the right foot or the left foot back and let the attacker's punch or kick pass. This will present their blind side to you. You will have to read body language to use these strategies. They work against fighters who are used to overpowering their opponents. They work well in boxing and Tae Kwan Do.



Remember to always counter with combinations. Always be one kick or punch ahead of your opponent. A way for this to work is always use combinations of three or more moves.

Kind of sounds like anyone is better than you in that class.



Just stick with it and keep trying. You just recently started at an intermediate level and you've only be training for four months. Stick in a few jabs and move around, being faster this is likely your best strategy.



At the same time, work on your conditioning and trying to improve the speed of your strikes. Only way to get better is to practice.

Best way to deal with big punchers (assuming they are in a similar league to your skill) is to use your legs.  Every time they step forward to strike, bang in a low kick to their lead leg.  They soon stop coming forward.



If they throw a jab constantly, try n read their movement and kick under their arm into the ribs as it will be open.  And use your push kick a lot to keep the distance.



They will soon become disheartened n stop attacking, in which case you can go on the offensive, and use your punches and kicks together to hit multiple areas i.e a couple of punches to the head, theyll cover up then kick to the leg while their more concerned about protecting the face!!



Hope it helps

If you've moved up from beginner to mid-level class in 4 months you are progressing fast, so your instructor must think you are doing well.  Congratulations!



I am a slim guy as well, and I don't mind going in with the big guys.  The big strong guys usually get tired fast, so use your defense and evasion to your advantage to tire them out.  Try breaking rythm (throw a combo like 1,2 pause,3), double kicks with just a foot tap between (leg then body or body then leg), high/low strikes etc.  The concept is that you get them used to expecting you will attack one place, then you attack another.  It really helps to mix up your initial attack - don't always lead with that jab or outside leg kick.



Big, strong guys also don't expect a clinch from a smaller opponent - clinch, strike, break, move.  The in/out technique works well so long as you don't get stuck in a clinch with the big dudes.  So clinch a couple times then switch - move in like you are clinching then teep instead.  Their arms will move up to reach for the plum and the mid section stays wide open.



Fast guys are tougher for me, so I prefer to get them moving backwards.  Most fast guys don't have power, and they lose even more power when they are retreating.  So go on the attack - I like a flurry of punches to get them defending, then charge in.  As soon as I move in I go double column forearm defense and clinch, or use my inside boxing and knees.  If you can get head control with a good clinch, just yank them around a little.  Being thrown by your neck/ head is no fun, and it puts them on defense.



Last are the tall guys - jam them up by staying really close to them.  When they move out punch high then body kick to the direction they are retreating - if they move straight back a mid-section shot works quite often.  It's easier to move a lanky guy into a vulnerable position than a fast guy (my opinion).  Load up with punches to the head then knee body or work the curve knee on the legs.  I also like kicking arms on tall guys.  I don't even try for the head, just beat the crap out of their biceps.  I get called for it sometimes, but I love elbow strikes to the bicep.  Eventually the arms get heavy and the head gets exposed.

one thing you could do is use the ring.if your faster than the guys your sparring, use movement and jabs similar to western boxing to corner them, light them up with a few small furries of punches and knees and get out of there. no sense in trying to stand toe to toe with someone whos bigger and stronger than you. i realize that is the traditional muay thai style but i believe that may be somewhat limited to people within your size, its good to use aspects from other arts as well

Judo gis ("uniforms") have to be a lot thicker than other martial arts' gear because it's all about grappling and throwing (think wrestling and rugby).  Taekwondo is about punching and kicking, so you have lighter attire which allows quicker movement over a greater range.



As a one off, there's nothing wrong with wearing a judo gi to a taekwondo lesson, although she might get a bit hot. You wouldn't want to turn up for judo in a taekwondo gi, though because it would tear like paper.



However, many martial arts clubs are quite precious about whether you're wearing the right gi, even down to whether it's the right one for their particular association's version of that particular martial art.  I've even been to clubs that make you unpick the stitching of the manufacturer's logo!!!



Most beginers turn up in t-shirts and tracksuit bottoms for the first couple of lessons before they decide whether they're sticking with it long enough to be worth buying the clobber.

Weight.  Judo uniforms are designed to withstand getting thrown without ripping.  TKD uniforms are much lighter.  You won't want to do TKD in a judo uniform.  Likewise, you wouldn't want to do judo in a TKD uniform.  There is a reason they are different.



There are usually several grades of uniforms.  You should be able to find a suitable uniform for the price you're looking for.

my boyfriend said that I'm just looking to pick a fight because I came home around 10pm and was tired but we did our thing which we hadn't done in quite awhile because of issues and me working two jobs. Then we cuddle and start going to sleep. Phone rings he decides he's hungry and goes with a friend up to McDonald's and comes home around 5 something in the morning. I thought that was jacked up that he just left me hanging. He says what's the big deal you were sleeping. Am I just looking to pick a fight or am I right to be mad?

True, he just doesn't have the stamina to move around and throw punches for 10+ rounds.



Besides, even though he is old, I think he could become legit in MMA under the training of Bas Rutten.



I would love for Kimbo to keep improving and maybe one day after he's proven he is a versatile fighter end up in the UFC. Dana White's even said that if Kimbo proved he was for real then he'd want him in the UFC.

Dude, Kimbo Slice has all ready won 3 MMA fights.
Boxing is way too fast for hiim, and it would be difficult to build up his cardio to hang a possible 12 rounds.



MMA, you, me and your sister could be successful in the MMA world.
The MMA is like a real school yard fight except in a cage and wearing sissy gloves.



Where on any given day a looping over head right with your eyes closed could possibly knock some one out.
Rasaad Evans with his eyes closed over Chucky



If a fighter is carefull and sticks to what his/her strengths are they have a better percentage of being successfull.



I could go on, but what's the point.



Understanding the body makes learning a martial art skill easier, and most MMA fighter even though they have studied an art for a long time, and very clueless to the actual art and have not even mastered it themselves.

<answer>



boxing not only takes a lot of stamina the stratedgy is also very different to that of MMA, for example if you are a BJJ fighter fighting from your back is not a problem whereas if you are a wrestler on you back is a problem so its ground and pound for the wrester.
A boxer does not have these to consider.



The reason you don't get 'arts' such as Akido etc in cage fighting is that most or these rely upon the co-operation of the attacker, or they spend most the day punching fresh air which generally doesn't hit you back.
Although some of the more practical arts have been adapted for the cage Karo Parisyans use of judo is a fine example of this.



Contrary to popular belief it doesn't take years of sitting meditating in a cave on a strictly vegetarian diet whilst going through prolonged periods of self denial to become a fighter.



During the Second World war Commandos where trained in little over a weekend to kill with their bare hands as they were needed urgently to be ready to be sent on missions behind enemy lines, and the majority of Military CQB systems most of which are based on the WW2 system designed by Fairbarn and Sykes take equally as long to master



Kimbo is essentially a street fighter and so the Cage style MMA would be more suited to his skill set especially as the rules in boxing also would be limiting, and I believe he's having lessons in submissions and ground and pound which would be more to his liking, where a stand up boxing match against a smarter opponent with some ring craft would I believe limit him, I mean if someone is out striking you in MMA you take him to the ground and see if you can do better there, in boxing you don't have that option.

<question>



I'm in China... BaguaZhang or something else?



I'm currently in China, and to be honest I don't really know what my MA resources are.  I know that I'm in a small city, and I have a lot of free time.  I've always wanted to do a few CMA's, such as Baguazhang (Maybe Cheng style) or something similar.



I know there's a lot of debate over CMA's because of the way they train.  I'll admit I'm a huge critic on a lot of things.  I use to do Aikido and as much as I liked doing it, I constantly questioned some of the practical applications when people resisted.  Having a wrestling background before Aikido I could tell what would work and what wouldn't.  Considering Aikido is suppose to use minimal effort, what would be the point of learning something you'd have to absolutely force when you could probably learn something more useful that required less?



The point I'm making is, if I could find a Baguazhang school where they do practice and spar at normal or near-normal speeds does the contents of the style look practical in anyway?  If I find one and do it for fun, hey I'll do it for fun since what else can I do right?  But if I'm looking for something besides wrestling to supplement some striking skills in case I ever need them, would something like Baguazhang deliver (again, granted a school that actually spars and doesn't just drill.)



If not, what arts should I look for here?  And what would be a chinese equivalent folk style wrestling/any grappling?

It may be written on Mighty Mo's profile that he's is a Kickboxer



but he has only really is trained in Boxing.



With only Boxing skills, he has gone so far in K-1 knocking out



Kickboxers and Muay Thai boxers. So if he can defeat Muay Thai



boxers why doesn't he just do normal Boxing in which he will go far



in, remember even though he has had alot of losses lately



(mainly because he's 38) he has only be KO'd twice and TKO'd once.

What are the advantages/disadvantages of training in any of these styles before going into another one?  I.E, I hear wrestlers have a very good stand up game going into BJJ, but have a very hard time with the ground work because they're so use to staying off their backs and such.

Wrestlinging is good for avoiding submissions and takedowns.



It is a very rapid grappling sport which is good for escaping from



control positions and submission holds, also good for maneuvering



around your opponent and gaining control positions. When



standing it is good for Takedowns (pick-ups) and avoiding takedowns.



Disadvantages



Not very strong on Submissions as to Brazilian Jiu jitsu and Judo.



It has good maneuvering but alright esacpes and control positioning.



JUDO



Advantages

Muay Thai Respects and Rules?



I was wondering about the rules and respects surrounding Thai Tattoos and the acquiring of Muay Thai gear such as armbands and headbands. Is there certain passages I must take or certain rituals surrounding the acquisition of tattoos and things such as armbands, headbands?

The armbands, headbands, etc are supposed to signify respect and your individual expression of the art and your predecessors.



The Mongkol (the cord around the head) is sacred and signifies respect to the ancestral teachers; they are usually blessed by the teacher or a monk.  They are not worn in the ring while fighting.



The armbands aren't always worn, but they are supposed to offer protection, and are only taken off after the fight is over.



Like the Wai Kru (ceremonial dance / warmup) before a match, each Muay Thai fighter will express themselves differently, and each mongkol or arm band may have some special meaning to a given fighter.



The tattoos are more western and modern.  Look at traditional MT fighers.  Only a few fighters have them.  They are just decorations and have no traditional meaning in Muay Thai, although some people use traditional Thai symbols or writings that have special meaning to them.



There aren't rituals per se to get these things, but knowing what you are doing and being properly respectful is a huge part of them.  Otherwise it's just playing dress up.

Shamrock will win if he takes it to the ground.  Kimbo has no ground game.  Hell, Thompson would have beat slice if he could hit harder than a wet noodle once he got Kimbo on the ground.



If Shamrock wants to make this a stand up fight, I don't think he will last too long.

Yin and yang put into action. Flowing with the opponents energy and never meeting force with force. Yielding and using the opponents strength against him.
Tai chi chuan, baguazhang, wing chun, aikido, jujitsu, hapkido, and many other arts all adhere to this concept.  It's kind of rare that you actually see someone use it effectively.

I would say Muay Thai is probably at the top simply because it focuses on hard striking to take your opponent out. The average person on the receiving end of a leg kick or knee from a Muay Thai striker is going to be in a LOT of pain.



Second would probably be Krav Maga because of its focus on realistic situations rather than theory. Third, I would say mixed martial arts because it deals with both ground fighting and striking.



Now, I put Muay Thai first because in a real-life situation, you do not want a fight to go to the ground. You want to hit hard, fast, and get the heck out of there because if a fight goes to the ground and you're winning, expect the loser's pals to jump in.

A 55 year old male aquaintance of our family, Gordon, is currently a Tae Kwan Do black belt (not sure what dan) and has been practicing the art for over eleven years, possibly longer. He is healthy, fit and a great swimmer.



If you love the training and are in good physical condition there is no reason not to give it a try. Body combat is also a great builder of self dicipline, which is great for your mindset aswell as your physical condition.



It is not your age, but your physical condition that matters, although after the 50s a deteriorating body condition may be detrimental and the risk of heart attack or brittle bones is greatly increased.
