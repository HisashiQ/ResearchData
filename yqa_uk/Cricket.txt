You sound like Ajantha Mendis. LoL
He came out of no where. He played for a cricket team in the army and was selected to play for Sri lanka. If your as good as you say someone will notice you.

you obviously have a lot of faith in your bowling, look around, ask around maybe there's a higher division of cricket being played near you. It's hard to get your talent out there if you can't travle around.

Good Luck

He can only be better than Michael Vaughan (he got to up himself and thought he was better than he was....served him where I work and he was so rude!) I think we have definitely gained a captain. He's a very enthusiastic player who takes the game very seriously and hopefully this will rub off on the rest of the team. Though only time will tell.

time will tell whether the captaincy will affect what he does with the bat i suppose. I personally think he will continue to do well as a batsman, he seems to me the kind of person who likes the pressure and being in the spotlight, it brings out the best in him

When a batsman is just that, he only has to consider his own performance, but when made captain, batting and/or bowling always suffer, due to extra considerations; Michael Vaughan, a case in point.

I would have made Strauss test captain and Pietersen One Day captain, just to evaluate what difference captaincy made to Pietersen's batting.

In the days before boundaries were brought in, players had to run for everything. As in some grounds there were no defined boundaries, occasionally a double figure score would incur from just one delivery.

As for the most: who knows. I read about a match in Australia back in the 1850's where 17 were scored from one delivery.

Here's the WINNER

286 runs

The first ball of an 1893/94 match between Western Australia and Victoria was hit into the branches of a jarrah tree just inside the field of play. The ball was out of reach and so the home side appealed for "lost ball". The umpires however disagreed seeing as the ball wasn't lost because everybody could see exactly where it was.



The batsmen carried on running while the home side tried to find an axe to cut down the tree. They couldn't find an axe but instead brought out a shotgun and tried to blast the ball from the tree. After several misses, the ball was finally dislodged and fell onto the outfield.



Nobody thought to catch it. Therefore the batsmen claimed the 286 runs they had accumulated. The home side then declared their one-ball innings and went on to win the match

He definitely was crying but perhaps not for quitting his captaincy but for playing too much cricket and not being with his family enough.



He did tell the press that all he wanted was to do is be with his kin.

Best not to judge him harshly, as none of us have been in that position & don't know how it would effect us. I think he was feeling more that he was letting his team down, though he had no reason to, as he has been a good captain.

umpires are all blind, and now making Indian batsmen play in dark, you robbed Tendulkar and Dravid in bad light , Dravid was again pitched outside off and playing a shot, lol !

anyways, we will win this test match, Sri lanka is a poor team, Gloaters will be silenced soon, a hammer to SL with their favorite spinners on their favorite conditions will be an ultimate slap on their face!

Absolutely.  He can bowl at any pace he likes, off any run up.

However he must release with the declared hand (can't bowl left handed instead of right) and he must also bowl from the declared side of the stumps (over or around).

When the batsman faces - the umpire advises him of where the bowling is coming from and how many balls remain in the over  - for example "Left arm over, three to come" and then declares "play"

Were England robbed of victory by bad umpiring decision



graham Smith was clearly out when he was bowled by Monty Panesar and gloved the ball to backward square when he was on 90 something.........this would have left Boucher and the tailend bowlers to get the remaining 100 runs which would have been a good chance for england to target the SA tail and win the match.............this to me is just another reason for tv replays to be used to help the umpires decisions when needed

Decisions in cricket are human made and so it has been for centuries(no pun intended) in the game. A tv replay is often still decided by a panel of human reviewers and only improves the decision to a certain point. Other than outright match fixing, I think most players accept that opinion and human flaw will always be there. They will appeal, but finally accept. It's the 'game' we all play.

I don't think we can blame losing the match just on that one wicket (or lack of).
I just don't think we can be good for a whole game. The team can play as well as any team in the world for a day and look like total amateurs the next day.

Why can no one except defeat gracefully? England were beaten by a better side. And that's that. Stop trying to find a scapegoat to blame. England lost because they didn't get enough runs in the first innings.
Let's celebrate a wonderful innings by Graeme Smith.
As for TV replays: sometimes even they are not conclusive. De Villiers took a good catch earlier in the day, but even the TV replay couldn't confirm it.

I partly agree because I think there have been some poor umpiring decisions throughout the whole series.However England have been the cause of their own downfall.The batting in the last two tests has been abysmal.Basically we are not in the same class as S. Africa and I shudder to think what humilitations are in store for us when we play the Aussies next year.

That sucks the fun out of the game
you dont want mechanical games with exact decisions which makes it dull
Its exciting appealing and controversy
Each team had bad decisons like COOK LBW but the SA's took advantage of the situation and thats the difference between the sides is the concentration

South Africa won. And it was a great match.
Graham Smith not given out was one bad decision (so I'm told, i didn't actually see it) , England were just unlucky that Smith was the man they needed to get out. But saying that, Kallis and a few other players weren't able to see the ball especially when Flintoff was bowling. Even though nothing could be done about it, it was a slight disadvantage for them. So maybe it's just karma.



The 'umpire review system' (whatever it's called) will be coming in, because it looks like it'll stop these minor mis-decisions having such a big impact on the game and in the India v. SL match the review system is doing quite well.

I thought England played really well, i haven't watched England play in a while, but the energy i saw in that match was amazing from the England players.I wanted to jump up with them, every time they got a wicket.

But really well played by the South Africans, really nice finish, they fought hard. There was a lot of pressure.

Overall it highlighted for me how good test match cricket really is.

Some replays give the wrong indication, ie catches need ground level, but I definitely think "hot spot" should be used, to see if the ball came off a batters bat or glove, that always gives the correct decision.  LBWs should also be left to on field umpires.

Modern cricket is a team sport originating in England and popular mainly in areas that formerly made up the British Empire. The major international test teams are England, Australia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, South Africa, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and the West Indies. The language of cricket is particularly idiosyncratic and tends to reflect the somewhat complicated and eccentric nature of the game itself. The majority of the terms used in cricket have originated in England and Australia, however these terms have generally been adopted by the majority of playing nations and their cricketers.

The game is played between two competing teams of eleven players on each side, on a large expanse of (usually grassy) ground called a pitch. The teams are comprised of players with a mixture of abilities, some who specialise at batting, some at bowling, occasionally some who excel in both capacities, and one highly specialist player who acts as 'wicket-keeper'. In the centre of the pitch is a length of grass, (usually 22 yards long), called 'the wicket'. At each end of the wicket are placed three sticks adjacent to each other in an upright position: these are the 'stumps'. They are separated by a gap not greater than the diameter of a cricket ball. On top of each set of stumps are placed two smaller sticks, or 'bails'. A chalk outline is drawn in front of each set of stumps called a 'crease'. The game is refereed by two 'umpires'.

The length of games can vary in duration of time, and number of balls bowled. One side will 'bat' first, the other side will bowl to them. Batsmen play in pairs, each equipped with a bat, one at each end of the wicket.

The object for the batting side is to score the optimal number of 'runs' (points) before the bowling side have dismissed them. The object for the bowling side is to dismiss the batsmen as economically as possible. Once the process is complete the roles are reversed, i.e. the side which were batting then bowl and the bowling side then bat. This reversal may happen only the once (typically in 'one-day' or 'limited overs' cricket) or twice, as in county or international test match cricket.

Runs can be scored in a number of ways: each time that the batting pair is able to run between the wickets after a ball has been bowled (and before the stumps are or potentially can be touched with the ball) a run is scored. If the ball travels outside of the playing area, and it has touched the ground prior to leaving the playing area, 4 runs are scored. If the ball does not touch the ground on its way out, 6 runs are scored.

Additionally, runs can be accrued through the failure of the bowler to correctly deliver the ball; either through an incorrect bowling action, when  this is deemed a 'no-ball', or through the ball being delivered too wide for the batsman to strike it, known as a 'wide'. The number of runs accrued can be affected by where the ball ends up; a no-ball which crosses the boundary will count for 4 runs. Additionally, any balls which are deemed foul have to be bowled again by the same bowler before his turn or 'over' of 6 correctly delivered balls is deemed complete.

Dismissal of the batsmen can occur in a number of ways. The batsman facing the bowler can be 'bowled' out, i.e. the ball will hit the stumps without him being able to prevent it. If the batsman strikes the ball with the bat and it is caught by the bowler or one of the bowler's side who are dotted around the ground to field the ball before it hits the ground, then he is deemed to be out. A batsman can also be stumped by the specially equipped wicket-keeper, a player who stands immediately behind the batsman to retrieve balls coming through from the bowler, if the batsman steps in front of the crease leaving no part of his anatomy or the bat behind, and the wicket-keeper is able to remove the bails from the wicket with the ball. A batsman can also be out 'leg before wicket' or 'lbw': this is one of the more complex and vexatious rules and usually involves the ball striking the batsman's leg-protectors or 'pads' and the likelihood of the onward trajectory of the ball striking the wicket has the player's anatomy not intervened.

Either player can be 'run-out' if the wicket towards which they are running during the course of play is struck with the ball prior to their reaching the  safety of the crease

Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport contested by two teams, usually of eleven players each.[1] A cricket match is played on a grass field, roughly oval in shape, in the centre of which is a flat strip of ground 22 yards (20.12 m) long, called a cricket pitch. A wicket, usually made of wood, is placed at each end of the pitch.

The bowler, a player from the fielding team, bowls a hard, fist-sized cricket ball from the vicinity of one wicket towards the other. The ball usually bounces once before reaching the batsman, a player from the opposing team. In defence of the wicket, the batsman plays the ball with a wooden cricket bat. Meanwhile, the other members of the bowler's team stand in various positions around the field as fielders, players who retrieve the ball in an effort to stop the batsman scoring runs, and if possible to get him or her out. The batsman — if he or she does not get out — may run between the wickets, exchanging ends with a second batsman (the "non-striker"), who has been waiting near the bowler's wicket. Each completed exchange of ends scores one run. Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the playing area. The match is won by the team that scores more runs.

Cricket is a game played with a ball and bat by two teams of 11 players; teams take turns trying to score runs.

Cricket is a game played between two teams, generally of 11 members each. In essence, it is single combat, in which an individual batsman does battle against an individual bowler, who has helpers known as fielders. The bowler propels the ball with a straight arm from one end of the 22-yard pitch in an attempt to dismiss the batsman by hitting a target known as the wicket at the other end, or by causing the batsman to hit the ball into the air into a fielder’s grasp, or by inducing one of a number of other indiscretions. The batsman attempts to defend the wicket with the bat and to score runs – the currency of the game – by striking the ball to the field boundary, or far enough from the fielders to allow the batsman to run to the other end of the pitch before the ball can be returned. At least two bowlers must take turns, from alternating ends; also, there are always two batsmen on the field, each to take a turn as required. When all but one of the batting team have been dismissed – or after an agreed period – the teams’ roles are reversed. After all the players required to bat on both sides have done so either once or twice (which can take from a few hours to five days) the total number of runs accumulated determines the winner. But sometimes there isn’t one.

Cricket boots stop you slipping period. Just about anything in cricket can involve explosive action - running between wickets, bowling or fielding. The sprigs can help avoiding the slip on the wicket or the turf.

Other than that these days a cricket boot can afford some protection to the batsman's toes while facing or some protection to the bowler's feet if he "drags" his toes during the delivery.

Modern boots no longer provide ankle protection.

I do not wish to see Pietersen given it, as in my opinion he only plays for himself.  A good example was the way he got out in the second innings yesterday.  He tried to score a spectacular 6 to get his hundred to show how good he is but his cheap dismissal ultimately led to the test being lost.  I also hope it goes to someone already established in the team, such as Cook or Bell.  We tried bringing a purpose built Captain into the team in Chris Cowdrey but he wasn't a good enough test match batsman so the experiment ultimately failed.

I think Strauss or Pietersen - and I think KP is the man for the job. Has lots of confidence and experience of looking at the match from both sides. Don't think it'll hurt his batting, and that's important.

It looks like it could be Pieterson , but as it is taking till tomorrow lunchtime for the selectors to make up thier mind sounds like they are not convinced either !!!  probably they dont think someone with such a huge inflted ego can not be a team guy in the real senses of the word 
The whole team needs a good shake up and in my opinion Robert Key should be given a bit of a run to open the batting with Strauss and captain the team . Foster should take over the gloves as he is certainhly the best glove man around and Monty needs to improve his act . He spins the ball a lot on a turning wicket but is a one trick pony with no vatiation . His fielding is inconsistant and his batting non existant . Maybe we should give Swann a chance ??

The rumour was correct mate. Collingwood was definitely pushed out of the ODI captaincy!! Colli was building something special with a good group of young players and it was disappointing to see his "era" end so abrupbtly

There are 4 names, that have a chance to get the England captaincy. Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, Andrew Flintoff and Andrew Strauss

Kevin Pietersen- He is the bookies favourite to get the captaincy and he has potential to be a great captain. BUT he would not be my pick.
Reason no.1- Great batsmen who become captain of there country, historically perform worse with the bat when captain. Michael Vaughan for example averaged 50 until he was England captain (now he averages a measly 41) Pietersen currently averages 50, can England afford to lose runs from Pietersen?
Reason no.2- Even though Pietersen, would be an excellent motivator and man-manager. The tactical side of cricket is just as important and because Pietersen has had little (to no) experience captaining his county in 4 day cricket i believe Pietersen is not the right man for the job

Andrew Flintoff- 3 words- too much workload!! Can Flintoff handle the captaincy. The Ashes 2006/07 proved that he couldnt!! Flintoff has never been a master technician and i believe we shouldnt jepordize Fred's career by giving him captaincy

Ian Bell- An outside shot, he is in both the test & ODI squads, he has experience of captaining England (although it was U19) and he has a good reputation in the side. Bell would be a good selection as captain if he can ask for advice from previous captains and maybe toughen up a little more, because Bell has the tendancy to get down, when things are going bad for him

Andrew Strauss- He would need a ODI recall, but again Strauss is a good man to have. He is loved by the players, he has experience of captaining England in a WINNING series! and dont forget he is a handy ODI player so Strauss has a chance

Cook is too young in my opinion, but he will be the next England captain after the new one takes over.

Rob Key, wouldnt be a bad choice (although suprising) he is a man with fresh ideas, and a gung-ho spirit, he has had success with Kent in the past and he could be the man to lead England to success.

Three months ago the question of who would be the next England captain was asked:
http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...
and I said it was Strauss or Pietersen and that's how it remains. Safe-hands Strauss has skippered in over 100 matches and was captain when England had their best victory since 2005. Show-pony KP has captained just twice but is clearly the first name on both team sheets. The fact Colly's followed Vaughan down the plank suggests the path is being cleared for KP although I would probably have given the job to Strauss.

Why the hell is everyone championing Rob Key. People are acting like he's the Mike Brearley of captaincy. He took over Kent in 2006 when they were 5th and last season they finished 7th. Sure he's had some success in the T20 but what goods that to the Test arena, why not stick Graham Napier in the Test team while you're at it. Also he averages 40 this season in the CC so wouldn't get a place as batsman. So why oh why has everyone fell in love with Rob Key?

Misbah-ul-Haq what a player he is. Superb quality-wonderful talent-well organised-good cricket brain.?



He has settled in team at 33 years of age,so late because of dirty selection committee of Pakistan. He is a high profile player of domestic cricket as well even didn't get chance at that time. 
Any way hopefully he will play till 38-39.

So many Indian and Pakistani players had been finished in just domestic level because of dirty selectors.

Misbah is truly amazing for Pakistan.  The Board needs serious fixing... their politics cause Pakistan so many amazing players, like Misbah.

In today's match, Ajmal turned out to be an excellent spinner.  He's been playing first class cricket for ten years, but never made it to the national team!  The politics need to be fixed.

Misbah Could Have been in same bracket of Lara,Tendulkar And Inzy if Your Pakistani selectors have given him more chances in his 20's.
Never Late,I Think Misbah will serve his country very well and lead Pakistan to many wins.I think He is a better option than Malik as i liked his captaincy.
In yesterday's match against india,he didn't panic when Sehwag And Gambhir were destroying bowling like Malik did in previous match.Due To his experience,Pakistan will again rise to high levels.

Yes, I have always appreciated Misbah's style of playing very much, and pure talent is something which can't be suppressed forever. Rightfully, Misbah ul Haq has gained entry into the team, and at the moment, he is one of the most reliable batsmen of Pakistan. In his last innings against India, he showed his quality. Same is true for Younis Khan as well. I think these 2 players are underrated.

Misbah is an awesome player who came to the international side very late. Even though he came late, he made his name very quickly when he was named in the squad after Mohammad Yousuf was thinking to join the ICL, so we should thank Yousuf for going out of the picture for a while and letting in Misbah for the T-20s. He came and played very well and almost almost got the team to win that tournament. Then when he played against India in India in November-December 2007 he batted well in the ODIs and also proved his worth in the test matches when he batted for hours and hours and made huge hundreds while the others failed to impressive. He was like lone man, playing his part. Yes he's real fighter and an impressive-intelligent batsman. I love his flick shots and the sweep he plays even though that's the shot he played to get out many times. I love his style. He has taken over the great ul-haq (Inzamam) and made his name Misbah ul Haq. I also think he should be promoted in the batting order because Pakistan are wasting him at no.6-7 he plays well, doesn't let the bowlers get on top, he can accelerate, he can bat for hours he is just perfect. So give him a chance you damn selectors and the team! Also he stands as a good figure, wonder of him becoming captain.
Hope to see him impress in further matches and keep going for as long as he can!=]

This in my opinion is a problem that English cricket has had for a long time.  There is no tenure for the captains and there is no sucession plan.  Example is the Aussies, Ponting is the captain but they are already grooming Michael Clarke to take over the reins when Punter calls time.  English cricket select the captain basically as an after thought and at any one stage the team may include two or three ex-captains.  No way to run an international cricket team IMO.

(answer partly recycled from another answer I gave)

Not sure how I feel about it to be honest. I'm sure it is a natural progression (and not because 'he's hot' as the brain donor above so eloquently put it) as other than Bell, Strauss, Flintoff and possibly Cook there isn't anyone else in the team who could take up the role. Flintoff and Strauss have already done it with varying degrees of success (one getting fired!), Cook is too young, Collingwood has just resigned as ODI captain so would never be in the running, and I don't think Bell has done enough with his own batting or confidence to merit the job (you could make the same argument about Strauss). The other players in the team were never in contention.

The selectors have obviously had KP earmarked for that role for a while and are obviously keen to get the best player into that role but I'm not sure it's the right thing to do. I'm not sure we need our best batsman burdened by that responsibility but who knows he might relish the role and do a great job on the other hand he might not. Only time will tell and he needs to be afforded that time to set his marker down and see what he can do. His last game in charge wasn't great but whose first game as captain is.

Mate this one of the simplest decisions anyone would have to make.



Kevin Pietersen (sadly) is the only England player to be guarenteed a place in the England side in both test cricket & ODI cricket. Ian Bell is almost a certainty in both, BUT his ODI form has declined over the past few months.



England wanted 1 captain for both forms of the game, and as Pietersen is the only man for the job, it was always going to be his.

I dont believe that this is natural progression, if Andrew Strauss was playing in the ODI side and he was scoring runs, then Strauss would now be the new England captain. Strauss is the best man for the job, not only has he got experience (captaining England & Middlesex) but he also has experience of winning a series with England. Pietersen in my opinion is not captaincy material, he has had little to no experience captaining any team, and you have to feel that he will be an "impulse" captain rather than a tactician.

You also have to remember that with being captain of the England national team, comes responsibility. Michael Vaughan averaged 50 with the bat before he was England captain, after his long run as England captain his average dropped to 41. Pietersen currently averages 50 in tests and 48 in ODI's. Can we afford to lose KP's runs?

As mentioned by me earlier, KP is the only player who is an automatic choice for England in test matches as well as ODIs. Hence the decision.

Hope, he can prove his ability. But the team selection for the 4th test appears to be faulty again. My 11 would be:

Staruss, Cook, Bell, Pietersen, Broad, Flintoff, Prior, Anderson, Sidebottom, Panesar and Collingwood. This team has the best chance against SAF.



The current form of England and SAF are given below:

Batting: England - 852; SAF - 1,000
Bowling: England - 848; SAF - 888
Fielding: England - 808; SAF - 1,000
Overall: England - 864; SAF - 1,000

South Africa will again win the last match. The gap between these two teams is too huge to bridge. Irrespective of whom they would bring inside the team, England would lose the 4th match.



KP will have to start his captaincy on a wrong note. But then, his success as a Captain will depend on the choice of the other 10 players. Like Brian Lara in his team, KP will wage lone battles but lose series after series.

KP is the best (I think only) choice England have for cricket under International Cricket Circus Rules. His name will pull in the crowds and with Flintoff, Ambrose, Sidebottom and Panesar there will be plenty for them to cheer/jeer and laugh at. That's what the ICC business needs and it should make for great fun outings. Serious cricket folk should get something out of Strauss, Cook, Bell, Bopara, Collingwood, Harmison and Anderson, depending on who plays.

Pietersen made it clear in his Press Statement that he is a South African, pleased to represent (as he said) "your country". He also left it open to consider the IPL offer in a bit. So now we have a South African captain of England up against a South African captain of South Africa at the Oval. Brilliant! We know the hostility between them so we can be confident it will bubble over and give us plenty of fireworks.

Having had some time for the news to sink in, I think KP will make a very good captain. Someone to take the game to teams. Someone who pretty much guarantees their position in the side. Also he's completely different from every other England captain before him. Not sure what the stripey tied members of the MCC will make of his appointment but who cares.

GOOD LUCK KEV!!!

He was already stand-in Captain for the One Day team. Besides him the only other real choice was Andrew "Freddie" Flintoff. However, the last time he was in charge was a disaster (lost to Austrailia 5-0). Also Flintoff is just back in the side after a long time out with injuries, he doesn't need the added stress of being captain whilst still regaining his form.

KP was the sensible choice.

I think it is a fantastic appointment, and I am really excited about it. Pietersen will bring a fresh impetus to England's cricket; he will lead from the front by example, and I think his batting will go onto a new level. I don't believe he will be burdened by the captaincy.

For those who are saying that his batting will suffer, it is a difficult theory to prove. Statistically, looking at the records of the last 5 England captain's (dicounting Butcher and Lamb, who stood in when the main incumbent was injured) we can see that 3 of them had worse records as captain, whilst 2 had better records:

Vaughan as captain: 3170 runs at 36.02. Not as captain: 2549 runs at 50.98;
Hussain as captain: 2487 runs at 36.04. Not as captain: 3277 runs at 38.10;
Stewart as captain: 1059 runs at 39.22. Not as captain: 7404 runs at 39.59;
Atherton as captain: 3815 runs at 40.58. Not as captain: 3913 runs at 35.25;
Gooch as captain: 3582 runs at 58.72. Not as captain: 5318 runs at 35.93

What those statistics show is that Gooch and Atherton had substantially better records as captain than when they were in the ranks; Hussain and Stewart saw only a slight dip in overall form; but Vaughan had a large drop in his form.

Overall I would say that as England captain, players generally maintain their previous form, and, as was the case with Gooch, are sometimes inspired to a whole new level.

I think Pietersen will be inspired, both personally, and for the team.

Well I really think Micheal Vaughan's resignation was one of the worst things that happened to England. Vaughan might have not been very successful captain during the SA and England series ,but he has been successful captain during many other series. For an example the test Series against NZ. Under his captaincy England won the series 2-0 in June and 2-1 in February. The point is that Vaughan should had stayed as the English test captain until the 2009 Ashes were over but he must have been very frustrated that his team lost the test series against South Africa. The next English test captain should be Andrew Strauss or Andrew Flintoff.

I agree Flintoff, but for completely different reasons to you.



In the past he has behaved very badly, making him captain would put a responsibility on him, and make him a more mature and responsible person.

I think Vaughan's resignation is rather premature.
Yes his batting has been dismal but i am sure that he would have found form in the next test and in the county cricket. It was a matter of time......look at collingwood turn around it could have happened for vaughan.

The guy is undoubtedly a ruthless and brilliant captain it was a joy to see him st up batsmen all over the  world.
In my opinion he should have stayed on until the next ashes.

But anyways good luck to him on his future.

inamon2, this is the saddest day for English cricket, Vaughan has been the best English captain of our times.  Rather that Vaughan resigning (did he jump or was he pushed?), I think maybe a shake up of the English management and selectors would have been in order.  Where do they get their ideas from.  They select the same old players regardless if they are in form or not, select would be Aussie who know one has ever heard of the the present team never played with.

No it shouldn't have been Vaughan, but the selectors, who is to take Vaughan's place?  Please don't let it be Pieterson.  Captains need respect from the team, and I doubt very much if Pieterson has earned that respect!!

Sure Vaughan has been a great captain for many years but lately and this has been increasingly obvious in the latest series is that he is Englands worst player, his numerous ducks and he hardly bowls anymore (I´m not suggesting that he is a bad bowler his glorious wickets of Tendulkar all those years ago were crucial) but of late he is useless. I am pleased to see that he has quit rather than being forced to resign.

It was very sad to see Michael Vaughan resign but it was obvious the pressure of leading England had took its toll. He is without doubt our greatest ever captain and lead us to the pinnacle of the game in 2005.

I hope that without the captaincy, he can recapture the form that made him the best batsman in the world at one time.

Can I just point out to you that you have posted this question in the Cricket section. I know Y!A throws up some interesting choices to categorise questions in, but this is one of the weirdest.

Anyway, to the question. Firstly, Severe Disablement Allowance is only for those under 65. Secondly, you can no longer make a new claim to Severe Disablement Allowance. To get Severe Disablement Allowance, a person would need to have claimed before April 2001, and have been ill for a 28 week continuous period before April 2001.

Also, if this man is retired, he would probably be eligible for Pension Credit. He may also be able to get Incapacity Benefit if he was ill before reaching state retirement age.

Attendance Allowance is the main disability benefit claimed by the over 65's. To get it, a person must have needed help with personal care because of a physical or mental disability for at least six months.

From the Top 10 answerers in the Cricket section, the one who created his account earlierst was A.R. Raja. He started on January 30, 2006. however, he is no longer active, having answered his last question over a year ago. His profile still exists:

http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile;_ylt...

Among the current users who are in the Top 10, vakayil k is the oldest, having been around since July 8, 2006.

http://answers.yahoo.com/my/profile;_ylt...

Yahoo! Answers was launched on 14th December, 2005, so there were users in the Cricket section before A.R. Raja, however, none of them seemed to have made an impact.

It is possible that some of the earliest users changed their Yahoo! account (username) and thus had to start afresh with a new account at a later date. I do not know who they might be.

As for me, I have had two accounts on Yahoo! Answers, one from April to December 2007, and this one from January 2008 till now. I, therefore, do not qualify as the oldest user in the cricket section, but have certainly been around a while.

Contrary to popular belief, KooKee and JPeeling are not old users, KooKee has only been around since November 15, 2007, and JPeeling since November 3, 2007. Among the mistakes other answers include are: nalakafairly joined on September 19, 2006, so does not become the oldest user; Furioso Lion joined on March 31, 2007, so is far from being the oldest user and Montitude joined on July 14, 2007, while poison ivy 606 joined on July 2, 2007.

Interestingly, the user who nicknamed himself "KooKee + Adarsh + Montitude" has been around longer than any of them, debuting on October 18, 2006 (although Adarsh may have been around here earlier, he kept getting his accounts deleted).

Is Shane Warne Right?



Shane Warne has said that without Vaughan at the helm, England have no chance of regaining the 2009 Ashes.Although he is a close friend of Pietersen, Warne said that' he (Pietersen) tends to get a bit above himself & doesn't keep his feet on the ground. Vaughan is such an excellent captain'
Do you think Warne is right on both counts?.

Warne's not right

Even though i would have preferred Andrew Strauss to captain England rather than Kevin Pietersen, the main objective with any captain is to forget about the past and concentrate on the future. Pietersen has the potential to inspire England. He's been the main rock in the England side for 2 years now.

Vaughan was a superb captain but maybe it was time for a change, Vaughan had lost all his confidence in his captaincy and his batting and surely Vaughan's atitude had to rub off on the rest of his team

The Ashes is the biggest series in world cricket. Every match England play is a lead-up to The Ashes, even when we play teams like South Africa pundits and fans still mention The Ashes.

Pietersen has potential to be a great England captain, if he learns and adapts quickly. Pietersen is already a great motivator of teams, and even when Vaughan was captain, Pietersen was the rock of the team. If Pietersen can develop a tachtician's brain as well as motivating the team, then he can be successful

Anyway England have a huge chance of winning The Ashes. Australia are not the team they once were, no longer do they have the best spinner,wicket-keeper and fast bowler in the world. Without Gilchrist, McGrath and Warne (Australia 3 biggest match-winners of the last 10 years) Australia are definitely beatable.

No longer can Australia just throw the ball to one bowler (McGrath & Warne) and say give me a wicket!! Australia's side is nothing compared to 3 years ago. Australia also have NO spin threat anymore. Beau Casson is a joke of a spinner (and he's the best one they have got) England will feel comfortable chasing in the 4th innnings

England on the other hand still have all there resources from the 2005 Ashes, BUT they have more as well. Players like Sidebottom, Cook and Prior will only strenghthen the England side. So if England have a fit Pietersen, Flintoff and Jones for the Ashes series, then England can win.

It sounds like the sort of nonsense you would expect from Warne. I like Warne, he is one of my favourite cricketers, but I wouldn't necessarily trust everything that comes out of his mouth. This is a man, after all, who blamed his mum for his drug ban, and has professed undying love for his wife whilst flirting with other women. And lets not get onto his burgers and pizzas diet.......

As for him saying that Pietersen tends to get above himself, and not keep his feet on the ground.....talk about the pot calling the kettle black!

I think there is a bit of winding up going on here on the part of the Warnster.

In comparison to Pietersen, of course Vaughan is a better captain. He has had 5 years in the job, whilst Pietersen's sole captaincy experience, in any form of cricket, is a solitary ODI.

Pietersen will grow in the role, and England will be a formidable force in the next Ashes campaign.

Be prepared for more open top bus parades featuring KP and his boys. Flintoff may even bring a pedalo!

Edit: And within 35 minutes of posting I have 5 thumbs downs! My record is 12.

I would say he is right about Pieterson but probably not the rest. The australians are not as strong as they once were so england has a very good chance of regaining the ashes. That being said, I don't think that they'll get it unless they play extremely well.

Warne as a cricketer is a very canny.  However I am not sure that I trust, verbatim, what he says.  Some of it is genuine opinion but also a some of it is carefully targeted rubbish, IMO.

Vaughan was an excellent captain and his problems probably stemmed from his fragile body.  I think that this probably played more in his loss of batting confidence as his dropping average than the weight of captaincy.  It's a shame really.

For me, KP as the captain, lacks the leadership skills.  Mind you it would help if he had an bowling attack of value.  Easy to be a good captain when you have a kick @ss attack.

I happen to think Warnie is talking through his (you know what)...
Warne has too many things to say about everyone else and this time he is way out..
I am positive Pieterson is going to bring nothing but good into the England side.His youthful energy is bound to spur the guys on..
Warnie should pull his head in..
Yes Pieterson is full of himself,but he is a good player who is going to get even better..
This is going to make next years Ashes very exciting..
I wish K.P all the best of luck in his Captaincy of the England team..

Shane Warne is a very good reader of people like me, lol !
he hit the nail on the head on the second count that Pieterson tends to get above himslef and go haywire!
but on the first count i would say , he is not absolutely right, there are some extremely superb players like Collingwood, Ian Bell, Flintoff, Anderson, Panesor, who can shut down the doors of Australia easily , so Warne is half right , lol !

Edit: To The Oracle, you don't have a bigger record than me , mine is 18 thumbs down , lol !

hope it helps your cause!

How will captaincy affect Kevin Pietersen's from?



Kevin Pietersen has achieved every English cricket lover's dream job: England Captain.
A lot of people I have spoken to today have been uncertain over his appointment, feeling that the burden of captaincy will affect his batting in a negative manner.
If comparing his predecessor, Vaughan's form (50.98 average when not captain; 36.02 as captain), then this argument seems to be bearing fruition. However, the four previous incumbents before Vaughan all had superior, or only marginally worse records as captain: Hussain 36.04 as captain, 38.10 when not; Stewart 39.22 as captain, 39.59 when not; Atherton 40.58 as captain, 35.25 when not; Gooch 58.72 as captain, 35.93 when not.
Australia's last two captains, Ponting and Waugh, have better record as captain than when in the ranks. Ponting averages 62.00 as captain, and 55.97 when not; Waugh 52.30 when in charge, and 50.44 before taking over.

My belief is that Pietersen will become an even better batsman now that he is the captain. He will want to lead from the front, and will have a more responsible approach to his game.

What are your thoughts?

And have England picked the right man?

I don't think that the captaincy will affect Kevin Pietersen form. He is responsible and England will do very well under him. England are a very good team.

Vaughan took the captaincy after his peak thats why he averaged far less with bat when captain.



Gooch took the captaincy before he reached his peak thats why he averaged more as captain. (Same with Ponting)

Pietersen has yet to reach his peak, so i expect him to average more with the bat as captain because he is still improving with the bat. Plus KP thrives under pressure, and as you know the England captain is always under pressure

At first I wasn’t sure if I overly liked the idea of him being the new captain but now that I’ve had a few hours to thing about it I think it’s a good decision.

There is no doubt that KP has matured as a cricketer in the last few years and has become more experienced all round so it's probably a given that he could thrive in the role. He's a great player anyway so will probably relish the responsibility of the captaincy and all that it brings. He’ll want to lead by example and make sure his team are working to the best of their abilities by showing how good the team can be and I think he has the capacity to inspire other people in that way. I really hope he can make a success of it and bring some good, new ideas to the table. He seems like the type of player that can make some really innovative decisions.



And look what impact he already has off the field with young kids, perhaps it will inspire even more to take up cricket.

The Problem I have with Pietersen as captain is the worry that it could take away is match winning abilities and could tone him down a little in the way he bats which isnt good for the game at all and especially for England.



Assuming the KP can handle the pressure, which surely someone with his self confidence will be able to handle, then his cricketing knowledge will allow him to set inventive fields and with the help of close friends Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood (assuming they keep their places for the foreseeable future) will be able to give him valuable advice with their previous experience captaining their country to help England's newest captain out.

K.P. would seem to have the strength of character for this job. Everything he does both on and off the field will come under the microscope. The press will not put him down. The pressure will be huge. It is anyone's guess how this will affect him. My fear is that he will start to play more conservatively as a result. The fact that he has no captaincy experience is a big question mark too. Many people think that Robert Key would have been a better captaincy choice but would his batting have been up to it?
I applaud Vaughan for having the guts to step down and make himself unavailable for the next match. He has been an excellent captain but he is completely out of form with the bat.

1)I'm a Sri-Lankan supporter...but i still say Warne.
yeah, his leg-spin was really awesum! of course he isnt my fav bowler by any means, still i think he utilized his variations to greater effect. He wasnt the greatest person off the field...but he was a captain that australia never saw:P (IPL)

2)Murali comes second, even though his performances put him in the first place. I still think he's over-doing the doosra:( anyways he's our best ever bowler..and i hope he'll get 1000 test wickets one day:P

3)Harbhajan and Kumble: both are good spinners, but they might go wicketless on an off-day...and kumble seems to be having quite a few such days in the recent.
btw harbhajan's length was unplayable in the second test..hats off for his gr8 performance:D

4)Mendis: hmm great talent, but needs more experience...and some more confidence as well. i'm sure he'll be one of the best from our country(SL) after Murali=D
i wouldnt rate him among the other great spinners yet...even though he picked up18 wickets in his first two test matches.
but one thing that will always remain to mendis's credit is however much he's been scored off, he'll always be a wicket-taking option:P

What a lot of whingers you are! I know exactly how the man would have felt & you would think his fellow countrymen could have a little more sympathy for him.Yes Oracle, Kim Hughes did cry, & not without good reason, he was badmouthed by Ian Chappell, Rod Marsh & others from the day he was named Aussie captain. Every move he made was criticized by those creeps, even the fact that he dared take the time off to attend his father-in-law's funeral. Now Michael Clarke took a whole week off to go to his GF's fathers funeral & no-one so much as murmured. As they shouldn't of course, but such things Chappell ,Marsh & co. didn't take into consideration. Anyway, I hope Vaughan can now get his game back up to scratch without the captaincy burden on his mind. He still has a lot to offer.

He cried because he is only human and have feelings that can be hurt. The Australians are not necessarily better because they are mentally tough but because over the years they have produced some of the finest cricketers who have lead Australia to victory but I see  signs of decline in Australian dominance. Sri Lanka, England, India, and even Pakistan can change the equation with some luck.

Haha learn your cricket history mate, and see that Kim Hughes cried, when he resigned as captain of Australia.

In this day and age, any man should be able to cry and not be called "soft" for doing so. Do we still live in a stereotypical age where men are supposed to be tough and women are supposed to be gentle?

Now is a very emotional time in Vaughan's life, you can tell that he has put his heart and sole into English cricket.

Oh yeah didnt England try the "win at all costs" attitude against NZ (when Colli ran the batsmen out after the collision) and i tell you, the win at all costs doesnt always work and it makes you very unpopular

I think this is a real insensitive question to be asked..So what if Vaughan cried,he is human and humans have emotions.Just because some nationalities are as hard as nails,doe not make Michael Vaughan any less of  man...It takes a 'real' man to show his emotions,and after so many years of being in the /England team,and also their captain he has every right to show how he feels..
Don't make fun of a man because he is showing his emotions,a lot of people can take a lot away from seeing this sort of emotion from someone who is meant to be a 'man'..Well he is a bigger man in my eyes now,yes a man not a hero who thinks it is UN cool to show his feelings..Good on him,he deserves all the best..

SeanH-He was not sacked by the way,he handed in his resignation.

Not in the slightest. During his time as captain he has been stoical in front of the media (if a little boring). His crying simply showed how much he had given to the England cause and how much captaining his country had meant to him.

He was right to go because he could no longer be picked on form. I hope he makes it back.

The batsman himself will better know, if he knows where the stumps were when it hit his pads. He knows the movement of the ball, where it pitched, it's line & height as well. He can also know whether he snicked the ball or not.

The wicketkeeper will be behind the stumps, he may move according to the line & length of the bowling, but still the ball could get a faint inside edge, which the 'keeper may not be able to perceive. His view will be obstructed when the ball hits the pads, any late movement will not known to the 'keeper. But the 'keeper and the bowler together can access an LBW properly.

If the bowler is a spinner, there are better chances the bowler could know whether it is plumb or not. If it is a fast bowler, chances are the ball will hit the pads before he finishes his followthrough and settle down. It is hard to know whether it pitched in line or not.

Fielders in slips, gully or silly point can never judge an LBW properly. You should have eidetic memory to recall where exactly the pitched and where exactly it hit the pads and then reconstruct the whole scene  so that you can say whether it is out or not.

Only people who are directly in front of the wicket.  People to either side of the wicket cannot see the line of the ball in relation to the wicket.  The wicket keeper cannot see the ball a lot of occasions, so may not see the edges.  This leaves the bowler and the umpire.  However asking a bowler to adjudicate his own LBW's is akin to putting the fox in the henhouse.  Personally I think that for 1st class cricket, technology may have the answer with something like Hawkeye. Obviously not everyone can afford Hawkeye so it is better left to the umpire behind the wicket

what a great Q buddy , you made my day blissful !

there are great people and followers of the great game of cricket but there are some very good judges of the LBW , one of them is Brett Lee because whenever he hits the pads , he is extremely sure that the batsman is out and he never watches the umpire and runs towards the wicketkeeper and team mates raising his finger instantly !

just check the videos of Lee and you will be clear how great judgement Lee has so that he doesn't even need to have a look towards the umpire !

other than him, i feel Steve Bucknor, Mark Benson, Rudi Koertzoen, Darell Hair, Daryl Harper and Billy Doctrove are very good judge of LBWs!

hope it helps!
god bless!

It is not only Gilchrist, Steve Waugh, Ganguly, Fleming etc are backing Gilchrist's idea of T20 in Olympics 2020. It is viable idea, if ICC takes up the cause with IOC, by 2020, 20-20 will be a part of Olympics. 20-20 can make cricket totally global.

I do think that the ICC will be able to get T20 added to the olympic roster for 2020.  The thing I fear is that People wont want to play Test cricket any more.  With the Big Money in T20 and the chance to have an Olympic Medal I dont think players would apply themselves to test cricket.

But on the plus side Exposure through the Olympics going out to the whole world i should help to bring more people to enjoy cricket.

that mark must have remained by that glue (some organic compound) used to stick those stickers... so you can use some organic solvents like kerosense for example to remove that prints... i am not so sure however what color those solvents might leave on the wooden bat...

Wash the bat with a bit of water first. It helps because it makes all the prints a bit fainter...then sand it down. Should work. Hope it helps.

Not sure you, can the wood has changed colour by the atmosphere, like paper does with age, the stickers prevented this, you could find a suitable wood stainer. but you may choose to leave it as it is.

providing this is a bat made of actual willow you will need to use a very light sand paper but do not be to aggressive then wipe down the bat with warm water leave it to dry for about half an hour do not leave it in the sun. then use a cloth to apply a coat of linseed oil if its old give it a couple of coats
hope this helps let us know

i think almost all of the players on the list are Test specialists, not one-dayers. But if I had to pick one, it would be Matt Hayden because he can control the match in the first 15 overs when the field is up with his powerful strokes over the top of the in-field.

It may not sound well to some but its M.S Dhoni, the ICC ODI player of the year & no. 1 ranked batsman on current form.
Overall- Hayden especially for his performance in the 2007 world cup. He made a come back to the ODIs just before the WC at the New Zealand tour but he just stunned everyone by playing some consecutive great knocks.

For sheer on field presence, stature and consistency, I would have to go with Matt Hayden. Pieterson would be next but his consistency lets him down.
