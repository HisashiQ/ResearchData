yep coarse they are- they arent big enough to get stuck in the wind pipe and dissolve unlike say a carrot cut into discs. My pony loved them and fizzy chewits! He also loved the peel of an orange as apposed to the actual orange itself lol

edit: for thoses that dont know polos are a mint sweet or candy, they are round in shape with the centre knocked out of them

What are polos? I have never heard of them.



Polo wraps, polo shirts and polo I know of but never polo that you can eat.

EDIT: OK, got it. A horse can eat sweet treats but it needs to be in moderation. Feeding a lot can cause problems.

Polos are circular peppermint candy, with a hole through the middle!  Like a Lifesaver. We have them here in England. Don't think I've seen them for sale in US.

And to answer the question, oh yes!!!  Horses can have Polos. They absolutely adore them and they cause no risk when given occasionally in small numbers.  Like any treat.



Be careful not to feed any horse too many treats, too often, by hand. It can make them sour and grouchy if they suddenly discover you haven't arrived with their usual supply of treats; or, at best, it turns them into a pest - rubbing and banging at you, begging for treats!

Why would you want to?  You really should reconsider beginning the bad habit of hand feeding your horse treats of any kind, as it teaches them bad habits like nipping and trying to beg and push you around looking for them.  Why start it?  If you want to use something to bond with your horse, use a brush, your hands and your voice, and be consistent with all of the things that you do with him so that he can learn to trust and depend on you.

Hay is dried grass that has been pressed into bales. Haylage, also called silage, is grass, alfalfa, or oats (or a combination) that has been baled, wrapped in plastic, and allowed to ferment. Silage is more nutritous than regular hay.

Hay is cut grass that is dried and baled dry.

Haylage is cut grass that can be both baled or just pushed together wet and ferments in its own juices.  It is like corn silage - but you are using grass hay instead.

I personally would never use it on a horse because of how much gas and stuff builds up as it ferments - horses just don't have stomachs meant to deal with that.  Cows on the other hand can deal with it.

Here they are very different things. Hay is dried forage, usually a grass of some kind or alfalfa or clover.  The hay is cut and dried in the sun before it is baled either in small square bales, large square bales or round bales.  Haylage is usually clover or alfalfa and it is not dried but put into a silo or a silage bag while it is still green and fresh.  While in the silo or bag the haylage then ferments.  Haylage is to hay as silage is to corn and sourkraut is to cabbage.

Hay is dried grass - comes in different varieties meadow hay, timothy hay etc, depending on the grass species used.

Haylage is grass that is cut, allowed to wilt and then baled by being wrapped in plastic and left for about 8-10 weeks to ferment a bit. It has a much higher moisture content than hay as it is baled before it dries out.

Haylage is not the same thing as cattle silage - which must never be fed to horses. Also, you can get haylage made from Alfalfa but this is extremely high in protein and very 'rich'. It should not be fed without veterinary supervision.

The differences in feeding the two are roughly: haylage is moist, higher in protein (usually) and tends to be lower in dust and spores than hay and is a good forage for horses that suffer from respiratory problems. On the other hand, some horses find it too rich and it may give them the runs - ponies in particular seem to suffer from this in my experience. It also tends to be more expensive than hay. Also, you need to feed haylage within 4-5 days after opening the bale otherwise it starts to ferment and cannot be fed. If the plastic wrapping is punctured then the bale will be mouldy.

You are much more likely to be offered hay than haylage - if the bales are unwrapped it will definitely be hay. Give it a good sniff - it should smell sweet and not mouldy, otherwise your horses may not eat it.

Can anyone help with my napping horse?



Right well i got a new horse a couple of weeks ago and got 2 shetlands to keep her company, they're all mares. And after a couple of days i put her in their field, but she has been in her own field a couple of hours each day and not bothered!
It started last week when i went out for a ride and she wouldn't go past the ponies and just mesed around, and thn when i took one of the shetlands out of the field and she jumped out!!
Then this morning, when i was putting her in a seperate field she started rearing when i was holding her and then she jumped a 5 bar gate! so she's getting really naughty!! 
Any one got ANY tips for me??? pleeeease!!



</question>



<additional details>



the shetlands canno be ridden and cannot be put in the big field due to the grass being so lush and get laminitis, one of them just got colic as it was in there, so i'm not putting them back in, and there's hardly any food in the field they are in so the big horse cannot live in that!

well, this is quite tricky but maybe she enjoys the company from having her own field to sharing one so its a bit different for her. 
once a horse knows how to jump out a field, it is tricky to get them out of the habit. when you have to ride past the field, get off. this shows leadership and some people might disagree with getting off but it has helped me so much with one of my horses and respects me more for getting off, look straight ahead of where your looking to go and dont look at anything else. you could try moving the shetlands into another field so she wont nap at that area where she can see them.
if you only got her a few weeks ago she could be trying you out as about this time my haflinger kept on bolting to the gate, bucking bronco but she has now settled down really well as almost had her about 5 months.
its all a matter of time and i can't really help you that much but just try lots of different things to try and get to the bottom of the behaviour.

She's just moved home - you gave her some friends and now you are taking them away again, naturally she's upset.

Horses are herd animals and like to be with other horses not kept on their own. She's telling you she wants to get back with the ponies.

I would let her just graze with the ponies for the time being and give her time to settle down. Spend a lot of time doing nice things with her so that she starts to feel happy with you - a bucket of food, a few treats - maybe a bit of grooming just in the field. She'll start to relax and bond with you and her feeling of safety and well-being will come from you as well as her companions.

It's not just a question of kindness and recognizing her needs either - there are safety considerations too, she might injure herself jumping out of fields or you if she is trying to get away from you.

If you can't ride her - could you get a friend to come along with another as a companion? She sounds as though she lacks confidence and this takes time and patience to build up.

Who thinks it is important?



to know how to jump? I don't mean showjumping or any of that but I mean if your horse takes off and is heading for a fence is it not important that you have some knowledge of a safe jumping position to prevent you getting thrown.



Earlier a question was asked that took a previous answer of mine completely out of context and was designed to make me look like a nasty person. As I explained then I was not saying that everyone needs to jump but that for safety reasons it is important to know how to do keep your balance should the horse spook and jump something. 
Here is the link for the question and I would like to point out that I never said her horse would run off simply that it might.
http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...



I think that it is very important to know how to jump or at least how to maintain your balance over a jump. I do not think that everyone needs to jump. Do you think it is important from a safety point of view?

or an ejection seat would work nicely.

yes, it is for safety sake a good ideal to know how to jump and protect yourself from injury...

I believe if you ride horses, you should be trained in everything it can and does entail.  For that reason, I believe in training in multiple disciplines, studying the physics of bits, studying equine anatomy and physiology, and in equine nutrition.  I also don't believe a rider should be allowed on any horse until they understand the effect of any headgear being used on the animal they are riding.

I'll admit that I never thought of that before but you do raise a valid point - if you go out on a horse anything can happen - not necessarily rider error but stupid motorists, kids, dogs whatever so if it's possible then I'd be inclined to agree with you.
On the other hand though, a well balanced rider would probably manage to go with the flow if the worst happened. At the end of the day it is their decision and if they don't want to jump then so be it. 
No I didn't think your answer was bad or nasty but some people are easily offended, try not to be one of them.

I'd have to disagree with your statement. Like said in another post, learning to jump is by far not imperative to your safety. If anything, an emergency dismount would suffice to ensure safety should your mount freak and take off. Further more, horses are flight animals. With apologies to Sally Swift, they are like rivers. They take the path of least resistance. If there is an obstacle they are 100 times more likely to go around it rather than over it. A genuinely spooked horse tends to put escaping as easily as possible a priority over doing it fashionably over a fence.



There are exceptions of course but I definitely wouldn't say that it's worth insisting that all riders learning to jump a horse is a necessary safety precaution. Once again, it doesn't hurt to learn it's just not a dire necessity and definitely not valid way of determining whether one is fit for horse ownership or not.

I understand what your saying, and I agree.  Even if all you do is trail ride or something, it's a good idea to know how to jump, just in case.  Say you were riding on a trail (this is kind of a weird example), and you were going along and found a small log in your path way (but not small enough to step over), you had to get through.  What are you to do?  Well, the only answer I can come up with is to jump it.  Just knowing the basics of jumping is a good idea, knowing how to set your horse up, two-point, etc.  I know people who don't really like jumping, but they know how to do it and can do it if they really have to.  People are going to disagree with me, but honestly, it's a good idea to at least know the basics.  Good question.

Ok, if you and your horse don't practice jumping in the first place, it is highly unlikely that the horse will just go over a fence if they are spooked. They would either stop, or try to find a way around it. Jumping is not exactly natural for horses, they are built for running. And if you are a good rider, you should be able to stop your horse before they go over the fence anyway, and if you aren't able to do that, then chances of you staying on if your horse did jump the fence are extremely slim. even if you had worked on jumping position and such.

In my opinion, I don't think you need to know how to jump over a fence. But I do believe in teaching jumping position in case the scenario you describe does happen. Having a well developed balanced seat should do the rest - all you have to do is have the strength to get into that position and hold on. But that's just my opinion of course :)

i agree with you that people should have a knowledge of how to hold on in a situation like that, but most people dont learn it by their horses jumping a fence, cause some horses when they see a fence, they either turn or just stop suddenly, esp. if they are not jumping horses but just regular trail or pleasure horses



usually when a horse spooks it bolts side ways or straight up (had that happen a few days ago, my horse actually jumped up off its all 4's straight up in to the air)

i dont think you are a know it all for speaking your word about it-- you made a good point, cause people do need to know how to hold on just in case

man ive been reading all the questions and answers in this whole situation and i dont understand why she took your advice so harsh ly i agree that you should be able to maintain your balance so you dont effing hurt yourslef you werent trying to be rude it was misconceived and i dont just think you should be able to jump because im a showjumper and im not saying you should be able to do everything perfectly but its a good precaution if you can stay on in that kind of situation

Im half and half on this question. IF you are a good rider you should already have the balance needed incase your horse does decide to take a leap.Also horses will NOT always jump a fence, they USUALLY dart away from it. Horses a flee animals (as im sure everyone knows) and will take the easiest way of escape. Jumping a fence is not the easiest way to escape the "predator". In all my years of riding I have NEVER come across a horse that will jump a fence when heading towards one. They usually stop at the last minute  and calm down, or continue there marathon, NEVER have a seen one jump a fence.

yeah.  Whether you ride English or Western it is good to know how to jump.  With a runaway it is good to use the let them rise to meet you method because if you hop in two point early and they put on the brakes you'll most likely go over if you aren't trained in jumping.

I ride mostly western now, I did ride English and sometimes still do, But my horse isn't actually trained to jump though I have noticed he himself has perfect form when he jumps.  He'll jump ditches and if trotting in the woods he'll jump logs.

Learning all you can is good



But learning to jump so you can be ready IF the horse spooks and IF he takes a fence is kinda overboard.
 You'd have to be jumping over 4' in order for this to even begin to make sense...
 Perhaps learning to ride well enough to control a spook is more in order. How to stop a bolting horse - sitting a buck / rear - emergency dismount and so on.
 Some horses will bolt right through the fence - how do we prepare for that?



I think you meant well - but it could have fallen on sensitive ears (uh - eyes?)

You can learn balance without jumping! There are so many girls out there that do barrel racdeing or dressage or this and that and have excellent balance! Balance is something the horse already gives you. You see all these handucap kids who pick up horse riding and they get amazing balnance from a walk! You dont NEED to know how to jump.



Ummm.lol It depends who the horse is if hes gonna jump a fence or not. It depends on how high the fence is and the horses will power and height and physical fitness. lol. A horse can do other things when its spooked other than jumping a fence when spooked. Of course! And a horse CAN hesitate to jump a 5 foot fence when spooked.

Even if you're not jumping, it's good to know how to go up into a jumping position (or 2-point). It helps with balance, too. I was jumping for the very first time and forgot to go into position and I fell of. Someone should probably have an instructor or trainer come out and help them if someone is interested or wants to learn how just in case. It can really set you off balance if you don't do it correctly. It's a lot of fun to jump, so I think people should try it if they're interested! YEAH HORSEBACK RIDERS!

It's more important that you can ride safely than to jump.  If you have good  balance and a good seat on the flat, you are going to be fine for that one stray object your horse might jump. 
Those that have an active interest in riding are going to know to lean forward a bit over a jump, even if they have never jumped before.  Those that don't know to lean forward aren't likely to stay on if the horse bolts in the first place.

Is there anymore I can do to help my horse and I jump?



My horse is not so sure footed, when I ride her sometimes she will trip and worst of all she will fall but that’s only happened twice.  Anyway, I have had her checked and there is nothing physically wrong with her but told by my riding instructor that he will manage her shoeing with me and have her toes rolled so she is less likely to trip.  I don’t feel it is my balance putting her off as I am quite a good rider (I think ) I am hoping to do a little S/J competition with her in about a month but have not done much jumping with her because I am always worried she will trip/fall so at the moment I am free lungeing her over trotting poles and jumps X and straight, she can clear them easily she has a reasonably good jump.

Sooo my question is am I doing the right thing and is there anymore I could do to help her/myself for us to be able to do just a clear round in the comp ?

p.s. She is a 10 year old ID x 16h

i think you need to hop on her and get jumping together.  i realise this is a bit unnerving but until you are used to jumping on her and have tried it out then you shouldn't be in a comp.  keep the jumps at quite a low height at first and try to keep her moving with plenty of energy so she is less likely to drag her feet.  Keep your bum in the saddle - don't worry bout riding in a forward posiion until you are sure of her feet and balance.  rolled toe shoes are the best idea.  good luck at the comp.

1st of all I think Smearfactor should set himself alight then the world would be a better place.

How often do you school your horse? Schooling helps balance your horse and gets them listening to your aids more. Perhaps you should have a few lessons with a dressage instructor and go through some legs yielding and shoulders ins to help improve your horse's flexibility, strength and balance. All these eliments improve your horse's ability to jump. You are doing the right thing by taking your horse over trotting poles this will incourage your horse to pick up her hooves (it may be that she is quite lazy?) do you use a schooling whip or spurs? These (if used in the correct way) will encourage your horse to actually 'put the effort' into it! I cant emphasis enough SCOOLOING, SCHOOLING AND MORE SCHOOLING!!! Then when you both are feeling confident enough with your horse's footing then start with a few low cross poles make sure your horse comes in balanced and straight. Make sure your horse has planty of energy behind them. If you can, try placing some jups outside of the arena in a paddock for eg -it may just be that psycologically she doesnt like being in the school and maybe she will have a little more energy if you try juming in a new environment. let me know how you get on! (Dont forget it will take time so be patient)

best of luck ;-)

From what I've heard, what you're doing seems good, working her over jumps on the lunge is good
if she's going well, then maybe you should hop on her and start back at the basics - i know it must be frustrating, but maybe she's just lazy when it gets to the bigger jumps? or perhaps she's just not as sure of herself
if she's just lazy, then i would try using a whip or (if you're up to it) some dummy spurs on her 
is she tripping all the time? as in, when you're doing flatwork or stuff? or just jumping? Doing some basic dressage will help with her balance as well
Hope I've helped!

Tripping is usually a sign of fitness and balance problems. More often in the heavier types. Change the shoes and do more schooling to get her off her forehand and then try trotting over poles raised by a few inches at one end. Alternate the raised ends and increase the distance between the poles a little as she improves in her balance. Grid-work is also a good way to improve her in these areas. Need I add that you need body armour and she needs boots until she strengthens up?

Take your horse right back to basics. get her to walk and trot over jump poles keeping then in a Circle so she has to watch her feet.  do this on the ground and on lead raine and not lung at the time she lifts at the right point tell her "up" (like when you pick her feet out)



then do it on her as she lifts her feet press your legs on at the right time and tell her "up" when you ride her  get her on the bit and collect her up and use x bars change the stride of the bars so they are different. sit CENTRE in the saddle bum tipped slightly forward and back Straight and legs back a little as you come to first jump hold your leg on her sides when she needs to pick up and again tell her "up" she will learn to lift.  you might find your seat is putting her off, and your worry will be felt by her. if this does not work ask someone to get on her and jump her and see if it still happens. if you both have done little jumping the i say go out and jump small logs and the such make it fun for you both as boredom can mess you and your horse up. go to horse and rider online and look up there jump master classes they can help a lot xx

"The show shirt, called a "ratcatcher," is a buttoned shirt with a stand-up mandarin-style collar covered by a separate, matching choker or a stock tie, the final look usually resembling that of a turtleneck. The traditional, classic shirt is white. However, in some places and at some types of competition pastel-colored shirts are popular, coordinated with the colors in the hunt coat. Traditionally shirts were long-sleeved, but today are more often short-sleeved or sleeveless. Stock pins are sometimes worn on the stock tie or choker, although the most recent fashion has been to embroider the rider's initials on the choker.[3]"

Horse & Rider tends to cater more toward the Western dicipline and Horse Illustrated tends to cater more toward the English dicipline.  They both tend to cross reference a little but for the most part that's how they're set up.

How to ask for some bend and softening?



My horse always keeps her head out. I figured it was just my bit, so i got a bitless one. she responds very well to it. i taught my other horse how to bend and soften, but i can't with my new horse. any pointer? thanks guys!



</question>



<additional details>



I have tried figure 8s. my horse is naturally stiff to both sides, because she wasn't handled delicatly in her training. she was trained to jump and do roll back turns.... so if you can help me with losening as well, i really apriciate that!

What I have done for my horses is to teach them to laterally flex from the ground then in the saddle. Once I'm sure they understand the concept, I'll hold the flex at the stand still then move off (at a walk) from the flex into a small circle which I gradually allow to widen. Only allow the arc to widen as you continue to feel the bend.



It's seemed to work for me.



Lateral flexing can help as a stretch to loosen up before working.

It could be that she really doesn't know how or understand what you are asking. It could just take a really long time. Flexing, bending, tiny circles, leg yielding, work work and more work may do the trick. If not to build the muscles you could lunge your horse in side reins so that the horse gets the idea of what frame you want, to get flexion tighten one side a very very tiny bit more. Then when you are riding her try to ask properly without side reins and hope that eventually all the work adds up and she softens and bends!
Good luck!

Get her to do figure eights.  Keep them big to start, then as she loosens up tighten your turns.



Also try:



Before you get on, stand next to her with your back on her side, then pull her nose around toward her butt, hold for a few seconds then slowly let go.  Do both sides, this helps stretch her out.

Well, I don't know how much hay costs today, but when I was at Vet Tech school, we had to take care of 3 horses daily. We fed each horse 2½ flakes of hay plus a cup of oats twice a day. So if you can go to the feed store and find out the bulk prices of these items (and find out how many flakes are in one bale of hay) you should be able to calculate how much it costs per day to feed a horse.

It does work. It's knowing where to rub and exactly how. Clinics in this field will help you better. I think it works along the line of acupuncture points. I have seen acupuncture work wonders on horses. there is an equine vet in my area that does acupunture on horses. If you watch this done, I think you'll understand better. I wish I could be more helpful.
It works by touching the pain spots and spots where the horse holds tension, just like people.

Be very careful here.  Make sure you either build a space that can be used as a quarantine area where you can house new horses before they are tested clear of infections diseases like Coggins (Equine Infectious Anemia); otherwise you could well run the risk of losing all your horses. Unfortunately horses that need rescuing are more likely to have fallen victim to some really nasty conditions.

I think I know just what you mean and I think the fact that you are concerned with this, must mean you are an advanced enough rider to try this. Have you tried draw reins? Make sure to attach the reins to the girth at your horses side rather than under her stomach as some people do. Warm  her  up gradually so she has time to accept the pressure of the draw reins. Then start your canter in a medium circle. Canter a short time then stop, turn 180 degrees to the outside of your circle(on the haunches) and pick up your canter in the other direction. Continue to canter,stop,turn,canter in patient relaxed rythm in the same circle. The first time your horse canters off easily(without lifting up) let her canter straight out of the circle into a long line. Then walk.pet her and relax your reins for a brief walking rest and reward. This may not correct instantly but it will help if you stay with it.

A horse "lifts" into a canter.  The lifting of the front end is how they are supposed to do it.  "Falling" into a canter is what most people spend hours/days/weeks/months training their horses out of!



If the action is exaggerated, only experience, training and practice will make the transition a little smoother.

well during canter, horses strike off with their outside hind leg, this would cause the front to lift up, it wouldn't be possible to get into canter without lifting up.



its probably worse in the arena because she is more collected and therefore has more impulsion coming from the hindquarters. make sure she is well balanced going into canter as this would aid a smoother transition.



is her canter kinda like a rocking horse? v bouncy?



sorry im trying to help but im not really sure of the situation, maybe try getting her to strike off as you go over a pole while doing serpintines where you change direction, this will get her thinking and the bend should help her balance

some horses have a higher and stronger canter stride than others. When they canter they put all their weight in their hind-quarters and push off, lifting up their front. If that's the type of "lifting in the front end" that you mean there is no way to stop her unless you don't canter.
Also for flying lead changes they tend to go up a tad bit further (at least the two that I rode would).

It kind of depends really. Ponies sometimes have to 'jump' into the canter for some extra 'oomph,' because their gaits are generally shorter than horses. However you said it is a horse your riding, so I'm not sure what the problem is really. I would have someone watch you ride, maybe it's something your doing but you do not realize it. Are you really gripping the reins? Some horses like to have their head when they go into the canter. Best of luck. :)

I'm not sure what you mean.. every horse must lift to some extent when picking up a lead or changing lead, especially in flying changes. You can try and smooth this out by sitting deep, using your position and movement to influence the horse, but there will always be some extent of rocking..
sorry if that isnt what you are asking!

it depends why she is lifting up. and do you mean rearing? or just lifting her head out of a contact?
The first thing to do is rule out any physical problem. get her saddle checked by a qualified saddler, and get her back checked by an equine physio, also check that her mouth isn't hurting her by booking a visit from the dentist.
once you have ruled that out, then you can think about what you are asking her to do. Does she just do it when you are schooling her or does she do it when you ask for canter out in the fields?



if she is coming out of your contact (and lifting her head and going against you) then you could try to get her head much lower before you ask for canter, canter a few strides, then back to trot, then set it all up again, just focusing on the upwards transition.



feel free to comment if I've misunderstood what you were asking

One of our ponies used to do this as she struck off in canter:  she almost jumped into the canter just as you describe.  We got over it by giving very strong, clear aids to canter, and did lots of circle work on both reins in the school.  It did not take too long to correct.  She had no problems with her back or teeth, she was just a little inexperienced in the school and was almost asking if it was canter we wanted!  You could try really clear aids for a little while, and lots of transitions, and see if that helps.

it may be that she just isnt calm enough yet and she is acting up. my mare does this quite often. otherwise she may just be off balance. try asking her to go into a canter when her inside hind leg is extended.  try this judt lunging her a first to get a feel of what her body is doing so you can see it from another angle. and then try it on her back. you might find that she still lifts her head and/or shoulders when ur doing the groundwork. that is just her being stubborn. work with her doing transitions to break her of the habit.

Buffy says that all the registries she is familiar with use January 1. I can't disagree because the registries that she is familiar with are the registries I am not familiar with. I am more familiar with the warmblood registries and they use the actual birthday.

All the registries I am familiar with recognize all horse birthdays as January 1st.



For this reason, many performance horse breeders breed to cause a mare to foal as early as possible in the year - because things like racing are separated by the birth date of a horse.  A horse born in July has a disadvantage over a horse born in February in size, maturity and abilities.



Muddington is incorrect - the AQHA (American Quarter Horse Association) recognizes all horses age another year as of january 1st.  Their registration papers may show the date the horse was foaled (born), but they recognize it is a year older on January 1st of each year.  therefore my QH filly was born in June of 2007- January 1st, 2008 she's considered a yearling, January 1st 2009 she's considered a two year old.



The TB and Jockey Club registries are the same as is the Morgan associations.



Now, when you SHOW or put a horse into performance competition, the age may play a part or may not.  Some shows separate competitors into "classes" based upon rider's age and/or experience of rider or horse - for example, a novice class could contain horses of all different ages, the experience showing in that subject matter is what defines the class, not the animal's age.

If I know a horse's b-day, I say their bday is the day they were actually born. If not, you can use Jan 1st or pick a date you like.



But for shows and stuff, they generally use the Jan 1st cutoff (like to determine if a horse is a yearling or a two yr old, etc)

if you are not really experienced then take a more experienced rider. If you haven't been up to see the animal you can not 100% be sure that it really is perfectly healthy!!



Watch closely how horse and owner interact and the the owner ride first, does the horse respect them? is the owner handling the horse poorly? does the owner seem to be avoiding certain things? how does the horse respond to being tack/mounted/ridden?



if possible get the animal vet checked, or ask when it was last vet checked, if it's sitting out in the paddock lord knows what strains and sprains it may have given itself without a rider being there to pick up on them later. You also need to know how long it's been out there, is it going to be really 'fresh' under the saddle. Is the horse prone to any allergies or seasons illnesses (does it get laminities regularly?)



Also ride the horse yourself



Get the animals working history before, whats it's education level? has it been used for hacking or competition. What type of companions has the horse been paddocked with before? Does the horse have any vices?



Also because it's a lease you should make sure you know EXACTLY what you are to be paying for with the horses expenses and what they will seeing as it's still their horse.



hope that helps!

Question about hay prices?



ok so me and my friend were trying to figure out some prices on how much hay would cost a month. every time we try to figure it out it either seems to less or two much. About How many bils do you feed your horse a month and how much does it cost per month and per bail?



so how we figured it was something like this



1 bail= 14 flakes
1 Day= 4-6 Flakes
1 week = about 2-3 Bails
1 Month= 8-12 Bails
1 Bail= $8
1 Month =  $64-$96



does that seem right, or does are numbers seem to low per month



</question>



<additional details>



ok so im buying the hay from the barn i board at becuase we dont have a way to transport hay to the barn if we buaght it some where else. the bales have aproxemently 14 flakes and are $8 a bail.

I don't calculate my bales of hay by the flakes....i do it by the weight. The bales I get are 85 to 95 pounds a peice and I pay $6 a bale. I feed my horses 10 to 15 pounds of hay a day along with their alfalfa pellets.



It seems a lot of people where I live in here in NW corner of Georgia don't even calculate by the weight...but by the bale...shoot, if I did that...I'd get ripped off as some feed places and private sellers are charging $5 a bale for bales that are lucky to weigh 40 pounds...where is the sense in that as a person who buys hay?



In SD I always bought hay by the ton whether it was square bales or round bales. So this by the calculating by the bale or by the flakes on the bale doesn't make any sense. Because say you have 14 flakes on a bale of hay but the bale of hay only weighs 45 pounds...and your horse requires 20 pounds of hay a day. But you are only feeding your horse 2 flakes in the morning and again at night but the flakes only weigh a few pounds...I think those are the type of people who come here with newly purchased horses and say "I just bought this horse and I feed him 2 flakes of hay in the morning and 2 flakes of hay at night and now he's losing weight!"



Don't buy your hay by how many flakes are on it or by the bale...buy hay by the weight. So if your feedstore sells hay at $5 a bale, 50 pounds a bale. Then go to the next place that sells hay and say they also sell thier hay at $5 a bale...but their bales weigh 75 pounds. And lets say they are the same type of hay at the same quality too. So which one is the better deal to you?



Sorry for babbling my way through this...but I just see so many people buying hay by the bale or by the flakes and it just doesn't make sense to me.



Also..this is for Timothy hay that I used for my comparison. It's what I feed here in GA.

The price of hay is different depending what kind it is and what the economy is like. We buy grass hay and it is $11 a bale.



Every horse eats a different amount, too.
I've had horses require a bale a day, while most require 6 flakes. 2 flakes 3 times a day for most our horses.

Here in California, we figure a ton of hay will last a horse about 3 months.  When I say hay, I'm talking about 120 + LB bales of 3 strand alfalfa.  So, it runs a little over 5 bales a month to feed a horse with a ton of hay equaling 16 bales.



If you're feeding other types of hay then you may have to feed more to maintain weight.



BTW a bale of alfalfa hay costs about $17.95 here.

well i have my horse at a boarding ranch but she gets 2 flake a day but she is a 14.2 hand arabian. and each bale is about $15 each so she eats about 1 bale a week and that would be 4 bales a month so time that by $15 and that would be about $60 a month for food. but this is very high quality hay and sense it is high quality she doesn't need as much of it as she would need if it wasn't as high quality. but good luck

My two make it pretty simple. I feed 1 bale a day at 3$ a bale for good quality grass mix. I guess you can call us lucky in Missouri. It got to 5$ a bale last year during the drought. Most guys price gouged though and people refused to pay it. But now were 50 inches above in rain fall this year so the grass grew ALL summer. We got alot of cuttings in and there is a huge surplus. I was paying 2.50 a bale 2 years ago. So my anual cost this year is around a thousand dollars. I buy my hay straight out of the field and buy a year at a time so I never run out.

There are several factors that you did not mention in your question...



In the Rocky Mountains, our winters here are harsh.  I have figured to feed approximately 1/2 a ton per horse per month in hay (alfalfa/grass mix), with a little more on the real cold days (real cold up here is 20 to 40 degrees below zero.  Approximately 2 to 3 flakes per feeding, per horse, twice per day, depending upon the amount of work the horse is doing.



We also feed a sweet feed mix (usually 3 or 4 way with molasses).  During the summer, we cut back on the molasses and just feed straight rolled oats, maybe some corn mixed in.



Another thing you must do is keep fresh water available to the horse at all times.



This is just what we do, but has been working for us for 25 years.

Not sure about the amount of flakes per bale, that can really very.
You might be on the less end of how many a week. It would depend on how the bales were baled, how much they weigh etc... For a price, you could call your local feed store and ask how much it is. Just plan on the price to be higher the farther into winter it gets.
No-one in our area sells hay by weight. Only per bale.

The seller should have a current negative coggins of the horse. Each horse is required to have a current negative coggins every year. [they expire after a year]. A horse is not supposed to go off the property without them. So it should be the seller's responsibility.

It would be the seller's responsibility, but just because a horse has a bit of paper that says it has tested negative; don't be too trusting. Bits of paper can be forged, and there is nothing to say that a horse can't become infected since the test was last done...

typically the seller, and with the new coggins tests they take pictures of the horse and it is on the coggins so not much more of the funny business with swapping them can go on. Coggins is almost non existent anymore but you still need you horse tested regularly

Well depends what you want out of the story, for example if you want a mystery twist to to, simply add a dark mysterious character, snicking around the horses at the show ground, a horse goes missing, the girl investigates, add a twist at the end like the horse having been abused and the groom had taken it and thus the mystery man that the girl had been investigating show up to be nothing but a vet or the show manger.

Help for Halloween costumes for Pony! ?



I would like to enter my pony in a fun show. There is a costume class. I of course will not be riding him as he is 12 hands and I am 5'7''. It needs to be creative, fun, and easy to make. I can to a head piece, hoof covers, full body costume, and neck piece. i was think maybe of him being a groom and I would be a bride. Or maybe he could be the Cowardly Lion and I could be Dorothy. All Ideas welcomed! Remember, original but fun and easy to make.

It is probably because he is hot and itchy.  I do not think it is an affectionate thing.  It needs to be curbed because damage can be done to you or your clothes or tack if it gets caught somewhere and that can be painful and expensive!

It depends.



If it is more like a push, it is a behaviour problem, and he is trying to get you out of his way!



If t more like a soft nuzzle, then it is affectionate.



But don't think it's affectionate, as even though it may be soft, he may still be trying to push you away.

Keep him in a pasture not a stall and tie tarps and such along the pasture fence.  Old jugs, or anything that blows in the wind and preferably makes lots of noise.  Eventually they get used to it.



Other than that....Ride, ride, ride, and then ride some more.  After 1000 trail miles or not much bothers them.

The only thing that will correct a "spooky" horse, is to gain its trust, so that it will trust the rider and take cues from the rider/handler as to whether whatever is scaring it, is something to actually be afraid of or to just tolerate and ignore.



It all takes time, he's only a baby and has a -long- way to go yet.  Be patient and try not to make him face all his fears at once.



Horses are usually happier, and less likely to run, if they are facing whatever is scaring them.

Looking for a tougher/harsher bit than the loose ring snaffle?



I'm asking this on behalf of my friend. She's looking for a slightly harsher bit than the loose ring snaffle (but nothing too hard core or anything). It's not that her horse holds or avoids the bit or anything it's just that she finds that it responds too slow and it's not really putting much force/pressure on his mouth (it's kind of hard to explain).

I highly doubt a harsher bit will help, it will most likely cause more problems.



If the horse has a SOFT mouth, do NOT get a harsher bit, it can ruin the horses mouth and once you start using a harsher bit, it is only a matter of time until it stops working and you need to move to an even harsher bit.



You cannot expect a horse to stop on a dime and, tell your friend to work her horses chest muscles and front end because that is where the 'stopping' power comes from. If they have a strong back end, they most likely will have trouble stopping 'quickly'.



Tell her to get some lessons and learn how to ask for slowing in her seat. She should come into a downward transition with forward momentum and in her body, just think 'walk' or 'trot'. It works 100%. You relax the body and the horse feels it and reacts. If she relaxes, he will. Stay deep and very relaxed.



If it is a concern and she is starting to lose confidence, check the gear. Is the bit the right size for the horse? Is the bit too low in the mouth? Maybe put the bit up one hole, I do this XC to gain better turns as I am 'closer' to his mouth in a way, but I always ask with my seat and legs too. Make sure the horse has a drop noseband or hanovarian of some sorts as this may be the key. If not, and she IS losing confidence, I would suggest her speaking to a knowlegable instructor who knows the horse and can assist.



The Dutch Gag may be something to look at - it is still a snaffle, so you are not destroying the horses mouth, but it has rings attached which you can attach the reins to to create different severitys. It basically rotates the bit at a different angle in the mouth and creates different pressure. There is another bit called the Debauche bit (sorry I could be a little off with the spelling/name) and it has a similar action.



A harsher bit requires experienced, forgiving, soft hands. If your friend does not have those requirements, she should not be getting a harsher bit - sorry but I have seen people destroy horses mouths thinking they need a 'harsher' bit when all they need is a littl education.



Good luck

If she wants a -little- more control, try using a drop nose band with the snaffle, this will make the bit more effective.



A snaffle is usually more than sufficient for most horses. As long as the bit is seated correctly in the mouth; incorrectly seated bits are the source of a lot of problems; there's no reason why the bit shouldn't work perfectly well.



As for responding too slowly, the only way to improve this, without torturing the poor animal and ruining its mouth, is by schooling, schooling and more schooling.



Tell her she's being lazy and to take the time to train her horse properly....

i would suggeest a hanging mouth snaffle which has separate rings for the cheek pieces to go through adding a little bit of levergae and poll pressure to help with braking.  or a dutch gag (or bubble bit).  having it on the snaffle ring will do the same as the hanging cheek but if she needs even more of a pull then she can drop it another ring to add yet more poll pressure.

Perhaps she needs a bit that works in a different manner.  May she can try a Slotted Kimberwicke.  It still has a snaffle mouthpiece but works with a curb chain under the jaw and poll pressure.  It has different slots for different rein positions.  Reinsman makes a very nice one with a sweet iron mouth piece.



You really want to MINIMIZE the pressure on the bars of the mouth not add to it.

1. I prefer Rambo or Bucas(expensive but they last and can take a beating) I stay clear or or the brand Weatherproof, several bad experience with them riping along the seems.



2. I go by the simple rule for ever 5 degree Celsius the temperature drops, add 100grams of insulation to the blanket.
above 15 C (if windy or raining) a simple rain cover, no filling
15-10 C(59-50 F) 100gram
10-5 C(50-41 F) 200gram
5-0 C (41-32 F) 300gram
bellow freezing 400gram



3. I mainly have warmbloods and thoroughbreds, not hardy at all.



4. I live in Denmark, we get it all rain, snow, windy, the lot ^^ I'd say max about -20C



I've never tryed Rhino Wug Turnout blankets, but I'll say rather 5-10cm too big than too small. I did a search on Rhino Wug Turnout and it has a good large tail flap and is waterproof and breathable, which is great. Be careful about high necked blankets, they are great at keep the horse dry and warm but horses with a high head carriage push the blanket back making the front of the blanket too high and rube the horse.

Boot questions....help please?



I'm not talking about dress boots I'm talking about cowboy and cowgirl boots. The ones you use to ride horses and stuff.



I bought a pair and I was wondering is your feet supposed to be moving at all in the boots? Because when my heel goes up I feel my heel go up farther out of the boot(the boot is calf high.



I already took the tags off so I can't return it. Should I get thicker socks or what?

I would imagine that your feet would move some but not as much as you describe.  Try wearing heavier socks.

You should have just enough room so that the boot doesn't rub at the sides of your feet, but not enough that your foot slides easily out. Your boots keep you from falling out of the saddle, which is the purpose of the heel on them.



Really, they should wear and fit just about like any other work boot (they were originally designed to be worn while working -- riding use to be work). A little extra room, for work socks and such. You might think about buying some insoles as well, since most riding boots have crap for cushion in the sole which makes walking in them quite painful after any length of time.

Yeah they sound slightly big, just wear thick socks. While wearing boots your feet should have enough room, but not where they are sliding around every where. Good luck.

Nope they shouldn't move and give you heel blisters.  Try 2 pairs of socks that might do it.  I have had several pairs that have been bigger on me...

A boot that fits properly with maybe a 6 - 10" shaft should allow heel movement but be tight across the arch.  As the boots get broke in, the movement will decrease.



If your heel is coming right up out of the heel cup, the boot is sloppy and the arch isn't tight enough to hold the boot in place, it doesn't fit well.



If the arch is holding fairly tight, the heel only moves maybe a half inch max, it's ok but maybe not perfect.



You can try some thicker socks - my favorites are by Ovation - they're a crew sock about mid-calf with a really thick, really comfy foot bed.  Also popular are Justin Boot socks which are knee high but tend to wear out faster and Dan Post makes "tube" material socks with spandex around the arch and ankle that are knee high and quite thick.



If the heel continues to slip too much though, you'll develop blisters.



Also - think about this - if the footbed in the boots is fairly "hard" rather than soft and cushy without much arch support and you have a good amount of room, you might consider adding gel insoles.  I bought a pair of Harley Davidson boots one time that I liked but they didn't have a very good footbed - I added those insoles and they're now a very comfy pair of boots.  I'm used to Ariat boots which are tops in the way of footbed and overall boot engineering - so any other boot usually feels weird.  I have some on right now in fact that fit me perfectly.  What kind are the ones you have and what "model"?
