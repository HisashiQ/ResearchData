Getting Logbook details changed?



I just bought a new car from a guy who now turns out to be a bit of a rip off merchant. We both signed the logbook for my new car etc, and I have the little slip that you get whilst waiting for the new log book to come through. 
So, my first question is, what happens if he never posts it off? Do I contact the DVLA?

Also, he took my old car and it took him a while to sign the logbook, but eventually did today. the only problem is, he didnt put his name on it. I have the address on it, so what should I do? 
Make a fake name? or just send it off with no name? (If I phone him, I know he isn't going to give me his name as he promised me 2 weeks ago he'd take out and return the stereo from my old car, which he never has - why I don't know, as its unusable as I have the front and the cd changer...)

I don't want to keep the logbook unsent because he's probably going through red lights and allsorts. Will the DVLA transfer ownership with no name?

Thanks

It's not a problem at all.  Firstly, if you are not sure that he is going to send off the log book for your new car, just get a form V62 (application for a registration document) from the post office and send it to Swansea with your V5C/2 (green slip).  You don't have to pay anything and it will generate a log book in your name.

As far as the V5C log book for you old vehicle is concerned, send it to Swansea as it is, doesn't matter if you don't have his name.  The most important thing is that you notify disposal asap.  Once you receive the letter from DVLA stating that they have removed your details as the registered keeper you know that you are no longer legally responsible for the vehicle.

no the DVLA need all the details. It sound like you have been conned, if i where you i would call the DVLA for advice and possibly the police as this could be a case of fraud.

Do this ASAP because anything he does in your old car you are responsible for if the logbook hasn't been changed.

In the case of your new car, you can use the green slip to send off for a replacement logbook at no cost.
Use the link on this page;
http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/Buy...
to download a V62 certificate - Fill it in (you'll need the chassis number off your car) and send it with your green bit. They'll then send you a new logbook.
As for your old car, if you have the address, fill in this chap's details, make up a name (A.Smith will do), and send the blue part off. This notifies the DVLA that the vehicle is no longer your responsibility.
When the new logbook turns up at the bloke's house with the wrong name, it's up to him to correct it with the DVLA.
At least by doing these things, your bit's taken care of.

Q1 no you don't if he doesn't send his part away he will still be the registered keeper so is liable for all speeding, parking or other fines incurred till he does, but i'd give him ample time to do it (e.g 60 days) then contact D.V.L.A



Q2 Give him a call to get his name if  you can't get it phone D.V.L.A and explain to them what has happened and give them the details you have of the guy just to make sure it comes out of your ownership

You DO NOT NEED the letter or number.

They say you do, but all you need is the Licence, If it's a card, then you will have to take the paper counterpart as well. If it's an old fashioned paper licence, then a passport aswell.

Good Luck in your test

Assuming you mean the motorcycle Compulsory Basic Training, it costs between £90 and £150 depending on where you live. It consists of training, not a test, designed to give you a basic standard of safety on the road, enough to allow you to carry on practising un-supervised. Cost should include hire of a bike, helmet and suitable clothing. You will be taught everything you need to know from checking the bike is road-worthy, using stands, pushing, starting and stopping and various riding skills through to an on-road training session lasting at least 2 hours. At the end of the ride your instructor will give you an assessment of your standard and either issue a CBT certificate or invite you to take further training if he/she is not happy you are safe. Most people complete CBT in one day but it is not unusual to have further training, especially if you are a complete beginner with no road experience.

From the Motability website:

"When you visit the dealership you will need to provide the dealer with:



Your driving licence and/or driving licences for any other named drivers. 
Your letter of award entitlement.



Proof of address, such as a recent utility bill.

If it's your first time on the Motability Car Scheme or you are returning to the Scheme after a short break, you will need to complete a CP50 form. Your dealer will provide the form and you will need to get it stamped and safe-dated by the DWP (you can do this at your local Job Centre Plus).



The CP50 confirms you agree for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to pay your mobility allowance directly to Motability. You should give the form back to your dealer when you collect your new car."

You can start driving at 17. You need to apply to the DVLA for your provsional licence, then you can start taking lessons.
I don't know about an age limit on buying a car, but even if you bought one when you were s bit younger you wouldn't be able to drive it until you were 17 and had your provisional license at least.
Car insurance at that age can be pricey, but it will vary from one company to the next and depends also on what type of car you buy, where it will be kept and so on. My first car insurance cost me around £500 I think, but that was over 12 years ago so that's a very rough guide.

You can start driving lessons and take your test when you are 17.

Insurance depends very much on the type of car, what litre it is etc.

you need to be 17 to learn to drive make sure you get your provisional licence from DVLA first! 
Your insurance depends on what car it is not just your age, my first insurance which was last year cost me around £900! 
but you could get a cheaper deal just watch out for scammers like Quinn, -yes their price is initially low for a learner but the excess (which is what you pay if you have an accident) is high and when you pass your test they put the price up by hundreds! 
You can buy a car at any age but i think you need to be 17 for you to be registered as the keeper.

The National Age for driving in the UK is 17, You get your provisional license at 17 and then can take your test when ever you want. As for buying a car you can buy a car at any age so long as you have the money. But there wouldn't really be much point if you couldn't drive it. And insurance is likely to be in the low £1,000s my friend who drives a basic Ford Ka pays something like £1,120. So the prices can get pretty hefty.

in England it's 17 (although I believe 16 if your a carer of a disabled person?) but can apply for your provisional before your 17th.
theory and practical tests when I took them were around £50. driving lessons in my area average £25 an hour. the insurance on my first car which was this year was £1200(i'm 19),but then you have road tax,servicing etc...it wasn't cheap  :(

Well first of all it's an incomplete question because you never mentioned where you live, so it will be hard to get the answer you're really looking for but i will just give you my example. I live in the United States took the driving test when i was 16, and you have to be at least 18 to buy a car from a car store. I can't tell you the exact price for the insurance because it depends on the type of vehicle but Sports cars and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) are among the type of vehicles that probably will cost you more in liability premiums. Some auto insurers rate SUVs differently based on the vehicles' histories of causing more damage to other vehicles when involved in collisions. When i passed my driving test the insurance was high because at that age they consider you as an inexperienced driver but as you grow older and your driving skills are great (very few or no collision) your insurance price drops to a much cheaper price. Well i hope that helped you out a little bit.

You can be 16 to apply for your provisional licence, but must state your 17th as to when the provisional will start.

You can having a driving lesson on your 17th (like I did).

You can take your test, get insurance, buy a car at 17.

The insurance groups that I think you refer to were developed by Norwich Union nearly 20 years ago and they still use them today as a guide.

Other Insurance companies are not obliged to follow them and can use their own rating system to calculate your insurance premium. So some bikes that NU rate as group 4 may be rated as group 3 or 5 by another insurer.

Always shop around for your premium as this is the best way to get the cheapest quote

Look..... insurance companies are not silly. If they see your Nan's details and then yours and the car is a Type R, I think you'll find they'll guess what your game is. If you are down as the second driver but actually you are the only one driving it, you run the real risk of being found out for lying on your application form. If you have an accident and kill someone, you may find you are technically uninsured and, therefor, in major trouble - plus of course there is the small matter of the trouble you may cause to anyone you hit. Oh, and don't forget the trouble you would be getting your Nan into - does she deserve that?

Be sensible and don't put innocent people at risk. If you can't afford the insurance, wait until you can. Sorry to be a bore, but it's just a fact of life you need to face.

If you do this the insurance will be invalid. In effect you are giving the company false information which would entitle them to refuse a claim. For this reason some insurers require details of how much second named drivers will use the car.



I could give you yards of legal. Basically insurance is unique legally, because the company is totally reliant on the customer for info. The law therefore puts the onus on the customer to be totally up front or else.......

No, it is NOT legal.  It is considered insurance fraud.



On your insurance, you are allowed to drive any car, but only for short times.  If you are keeping a car at your house, or keeping it somewhere else but driving it regularly, then it needs to be listed under your insurance policy.



Each state's laws differ on this, but it is going to be illegal one way or another, or else everyone would be doing it.

No registered keeper's signature on V5?



I just bought a car. The man I bought it off of gave me the V5 and said to complete it and post it when I got home. However, now I'm home I see that he wasn't the registered keeper, he bought from a lady, gave her the new keepers' supplement (I presume, because it was missing) and then didn't send it off to change him to the registered keeper. I now can't send the V5 off to put my name on it because I need the signature of the lady who had the car originally, who I've never met.

Again I  have just received speeding ticket  (camera caught me driving at 41mph on a 30 mph road).  I know would give me another 3 points making a total of 6 points.  How can i escape revocation of my full license since it is less than a year I passed the test? Will i be allowed to take the safety awareness course instead of the 3 points?

You got picked up for 2 driving offences in one year ? & you've only just passed your test? 
Sorry, but that's just plain disgusting & i hope they throw the book at you, its people like you make the roads so dangerous. I'm only surprised that they didn't take the Provisional away, at the start.
I have been driving myself for 32 years & only once in all that time have i got any points on my licence.

as you have only passed your test within a year you will probably loose your license.. especially for speeding... it is a serious matter and not a joke.. hope fully you will learn your lesson and dont be so stupid as to do 41 in a 30 mph zone...

You need to go to court to plead your case, so don't accept the fixed penalty ticket.



The Speed Awareness Course is only offered to those caught travelling at 38mph or less in a 30mph zone.

If they don't revoke it more fool them, if you have broken the law and want a loophole to get out of it, spend some hard earned cash on a solicitor. Hopefully they'd still throw the book at you and you'd be down a few hundred quid. Might sound harsh but it was someone like you who killed my best mate 2 years ago, and that b*stard tried to find a loophole after getting points on a prov license and then on a full one, and on trying to get out of a manslaughter charge. rant over as it wont change a thing

Six points will get you right back to beginner status, as you know.  Not all areas do the speed awareness course and then it is only offered  to "minor" transgressors.  You ought to know better, you've not even the "excuse" of complacency.  That's 37% over the limit, you're going to be grounded.

People are saying that you should have noticed the BIG YELLOW speed camera!!!!!  What relevance is that??? Regardless of noticing the speed camera or not - you shouldn't be bloody speeding in a 30mph zone!!  Driving isn't about dodging "hidden" speed cameras, you shouldn't be worried about "hidden" speed cameras because you shouldn't be speeding full stop!!!  My cousin was knocked down and is now disabled because of a speeding idiot, who was doing 38mph on a 30mph road, we were told that if the driver would have stuck to the speed limit then the damage would have been much much less..... speed limits are there for a reason.... they are not there for a bloody laugh... they should take your licence from you for good if you can't even stick to a speed limit!!

The Infamous SORN declaration!!?



I have received an £80.00 'supplement' penalty for "failing to retax or SORN" my vehicle. This is despite sending back the SORN declaration to DVLA six weeks prior stating my vehicle is off the road. They say I should have contacted them after four weeks if I had'nt received an 'acknowledgement letter'. This 'acknowledgement letter'  declares that they have received your notification and everything is ok. 
Wait a minute!!!



I have done as they required! 
"Oh no" they say.  "We have'nt received it, therefore, it is assumed you did'nt send it. In any case, you should have have contacted us after four weeks".



"Is that so?"  says I.



"Yes" says she.  "There is a telephone number on the back of the form that advises you to contact us if you have'nt received the acknowlegement letter".

"Is that the form I sent back to you six weeks ago?" I dared ask.



"Yes" she replied, "But you should have written the number down"



"But I was'nt expecting it to get lost" says I.

"Does'nt matter" she said, "We did'nt receive it and the penalty is computer generated"

"Does the computer know how or why it was lost?, I asked.

"Don't know and it does'nt matter, we did'nt receive it therefore, the £80.00 'supplement' becomes payable!".

"Does Monty Python work in your department?"

A dialling tone followed.

Does anyone else also feel that NOW is a good time to emigrate to a free country?.

Does not help you at moment, but the answer is SORN on line and save the acknowledging email. Alternately, send the form by recorded delivery - costs about a quid including stamp - and keep the PO stamped receipt slip with your car docs.  If they deny receipt you go online to the PO tracking service and they will tell you when delivered and who signed for it.

Ah, the lovely Civil Service . . .  They tried the same thing on me once, it wasn't a SORN notice but something else. However, knowing their reputation for losing things, I'd sent it recorded delivery and was able to prove it. It suddenly was "found" . . . .

I have visions of legions of clerks shredding half their workload so they can go home on time. There must be mountains of waste paper coming out of there daily.

I like the idea of saying you sent the cheque, as far as you were concerned it was settled and why didn't they ring you at the number on the back of the cheque when they didn't receive it?  Nice one, that should give someone pause for thought . . . .

Jesting apart, I ALWAYS keep copies of anything I send to Government Departments, annotated boldly with the date posted and with a "review & chase date".  And hard copies of anything done on line too.

If you find the vehicle that hit yours (paint matches up) then call the police and file a report.

They can get a ticket for leaving the scene of an accident.

If they have insurance, call their company and make a claim for your damages.

If they do not have insurance, you can make the claim under your policy. That is, if you have collision or Uninsured Property Damage coverage on your policy.

If you don't, you can try and work something out with this person to have them pay for the damages.

Best of luck

If the car was parked in a car park then you have a problem as insurance doesnt count on private property. Even if you do find the offending car, how do you know they will not turn the situation around and say that you hit them ?? No witness's either way !!

I think unless you can prove beyond any doubt it was the person you suspect, then I would forget it. If the damage isnt too serious, I would "wipe my mouth" and put it down to the joys of motoring. Annoying as it is. I on one occasion had somebody hit me whilst i was stationary, and drove off. I got their number reported it to the Police who informed me that he thought I`d driven off and he couldnt see me to exchange particulars. They gave me his details in case I wanted to pursue the matter Slight damage, case closed. In many of incidences like this its not worth the effort. If I was the third party in an incident like you`ve described and got a letter from an Insurance company, believe me I would ignore it.

If you don't have a witness to the incident then there's nothing you can do. They may well have paint on their car the same colour as your vehicle but you cannot prove that it is from your vehicle. You can try approaching the person about it but don't hold your breath for the outcome you would like. You could try contacting the police but the first thing they are going to ask is "do you have an independent witness?" Your answer is no so they'll file a report but no action will be taken.

I rather think you're in the UK so it depends if it was on the highway or on a car-park. If it was on a car-park the police will not get involved. If it was on the highway, they've "left the scene of an accident" and the police will get involved.

You'll have a job, I'm afraid, proving which vehicle it was, no matter how strong your suspicions, without witnesses.

thats a bit unfortunate but i think you will find that most car parks have a disclaimer that people park there cars at there own risk to cover them selves for such an accident.but as other people have said if it was on a public highway then thats a different matter as long as you know who hit your car you can go to the police good luck let us know what happens

Insurance will be harder to find for a road legal buggy. It may be cheaper to insure since the buggy cost much less. However, an insurance company might consider this a much higher risk which will increase the rates. I know on a basic car with basic coverage it is pretty inexpensive to insure and most drivers can afford it. If they can't afford insurance then they shouldn't be driving. Really the only way to find out which will be cheaper is to get a few quotes. You can get some Internet quotes for free and it wouldn't take long to see which vehicle would cost more to insure. This will give you a definite answer to your question as well.

Yes, the first respondent gave you the correct order, get your car insured first ( supermarketinsurance.com, gocompare.com etc ) then make a booking with your MOT garage of choice, ensuring that they note your name and car registration details, so that if in the unlikely event you are stopped or noted by the police, you can substantiate your claim and then after a successful MOT, apply for your RFL at a main Post office. You will have fill in one of the standard forms , V5 , V10 or something like that. Post Office staff will tell you which one to complete, plus your  Cert. of Insurance , new MOT, cash or cheque and possibly the Keepers Document.

Most of the above replies already give you the correct order - insure, MOT, tax.

You must get your car insured before you even think about taking it on the road.  This is in case you have an accident (obviously).



If you are uninsured, the victim can sue you personally for damages.  It would be bad enough emotionally for you if you crippled someone for life - think how much worse it would be if they then sued you for maybe millions.  If you just gave their car a glancing blow and caused a couple of hundred quids worth of damage, again, they'd come after you for the money.

If the car then does fail the MOT badly and you decide to keep it off the road again, you can always cancel the insurance and get a refund on the unused portion (read the small print first to make sure that your policy allows for this - although with a new policy, you generally get a 'cooling off' period anyway to give you time to read the it properly).  For the few quid it'll cost, it's not worth going without insurance.

PS The point Moorhengrower makes about booking your car in properly at the MOT station is quite important.  In reality, you are unlikely to be stopped on the way to the test but if you are, you'll be in the clear (otherwise you'll probably be done for driving without proper documentation).

There is no such vehicle as a 125cc moped. The legal definition of a moped specifies that it must be of 50cc or less and designed to have a maximum speed of 50kph. What you are referring to is a motorcycle, whether it is automatic or geared is irrelevant. Cost of insurance varies with age, area, type of licence, cover required etc.etc. I would expect to pay at least £150, but that is a very rough estimate. Go online and type your details into the insurance search sites - moneysupermarket / gocompare and so on.

This one comes up every few weeks.

Provided it's insured, you can drive your car without tax or MOT to and from a pre-booked MOT OR to have work carried out which is essential for the test.

The elected testing station must be within reasonable distance and you must take the most direct route.

As above as long as the MOT is prebooked and it's insured you can drive it there.

However if it fails you can drive it to a place of repair, but taking it home to do repairs is a bit of a grey area.

Also technicaly if it passes the MOT you should leave it at the garage and walk to a post office to buy your tax disc before you drive it on the road.

I agree with those people outraged by the idea of uninsured drivers - but the insurance company cancelled my policy without my knowledge. They did send me a letter, but I was working out of town at the time, and only realised when I was stopped by the police.



Obviously it is my responsibilty to ensure I'm insured, but the company could easily have contacted me by phone or e-mail.

£150 fine (plus costs), and 8 points on a previously clean licence.

Still, better than finding out by being in an accident - and I still applaud the efforts of the police to clamp down on uninsured drivers.

Upon conviction there can be a fine of up to £5,000, between 6-8 penalty points imposed on the licence and the court can impose discretionary driving ban

But this is an incredibly grey area - take legal advice if you are in this situation.

If you are caught in the car withh no insurance, car is impounded and that involves fees of £180 
Then you have points added to your licence, usually 3 but can be more. 
Then there is the court fine which can vary but is usually about £150. 
Finally there will be the difficulty and increased cost of geting future insurance because of your conviction

Hi,

Depends on what you are caught doing.

I am a beleiver in having adaquate car insurance, but I know many just avoid the premium and hope for the best of luck.

If it is just the technicality of "driving whilst uninsured", then a fine of about £100 and 3 points on your licence is usual.

But if you mow down a bus queue whithout insurance, then you will face a jail sentence of perhaps 1yr, a ban from driving for at least 5 yrs, and possible law suits amounting to millions.

I have fully comprehensive policies on the cars, and by shopping around, it is not a bad deal.

If you hit that pedestrian, you might as well leave the country !

it varies but at least three points and the fact that if you hit someone it'll be on your conscience; one of my relatives was hit by an uninsured driver and it's taken away everything- their health and their livelihood. Everyone has to do it so why should the odd few think it's OK???Makes me mad.

Unfortunately, nowhere near enough as the fine or penalty is often much less than the insurance premium,so drivers take a risk! Should be a mandatory 15 year prison sentence for driving without insurance.

It's known as IN10 "Using a vehicle uninsured against third party risks" and gets you 6 - 8 penalty points plus a hefty fine. The courts view this sort of thing in a poor light.

You also run the risk of having the vehicle seized and will have a heck of a job getting insurance at any reasonable price in the future.

Personally, I would buy a second car and arrange the insurance through a local agent. That way you will be able to pick the cover which best suits your parents requirements. Ensure your parents bring their driving licences and insurance documents (to prove they have cover in their home country)

Could you get the insurance and car in your name and then add them to the policy as additional drivers, it may be cheaper as well to take it out with your insurance company it might bring your own down also.

For auto insurance the quick way to get a fantastic quote is do a policy comparison on car policies. Make sure that you compare similar policies with the same deductibles, car type, location, etc so that all options are a good comparison.



What I always recommend is an online comparison quote at http://www.InsureAutoNow.info since they have top name insurers and can give multiple quotes on car insurance polices.

In the UK The Police National Computer (PNC) stores the insurance details on all UK registered vehicles.
It can tell which company insures, what the cover is and who is covered to drive it.
This takes less than 10 seconds to access.
So yes is the answer.
It also shows if the vehicle is an insurance write off, if the vehicle is stolen and if the vehicle is wanted in connection with crime.

The police have access to:-



The DVLA Driver database - for licence checks
The Motor Insurance Database - for insurance checks (company, type of policy, named drivers etc)
The DVLA Road Tax database - to see if it's taxed
The DVLA MOT Database - to check you have one.

They can find out everything they need to know about you and your documentation and WILL HAVE before they stop you.

Simple answer is to remember this when/if you are stopped.

While driving without insurance is perfectly legal, it is not at all the smartest -or safest- thing to do. On the other hand, driving without a license is never legal. Not even on private roads, unless otherwise specified (as on a farm or on a golf course, etc.)

You should check in the state you live, but most likely it is not illegal  unless you are on public roads as laws require finanacial responsibility for vehicle operation. Usually there is insurance on the property that could cover injuries in case of an accident.Check with the land owner.

In the UK?

What are you calling a private road, and do you own the road?

If It's not yours, you are trespassing, and could be prosecuted by the owner.  If it's your own road way or you have the owner's consent, say you're a farmer's son/daughter, and it's your dad's road, then you don't need insurance or a licence, nor do you need an MOT.

Beware though,  you do, by law, have a "duty of care" to protect others on your property, which means if you collide with and/or hurt/harm someone, even a trespasser, you are liable for any costs/court action, I.E. civil claim or accident/injury claim.  Insurance, even for basic public liability is advisable, but not mandatory.

Be very aware of 'green lanes'  These do constitute part of the national highways network, and ALL normal highway rules and regulations DO apply.  If you inadvertently stray onto a 'green lane' you would be in violation of applicable laws, and liable to prosecution.  Do check out where you are going!

I think as long as you have the landowners permission legally you will be fine as it isn't a public highway and therefore the rules of the road don't apply.  Of course you won't be insured if you caused an accident.

I learnt to drive off road (on a country park's car park) in the UK when I was 16. Saved a lot of money on lessons learning how to master the clutch, reversing etc. Passed 1st time at 17 after just 10 proper lessons.  I wasn't insured to drive the car (my Dad's) as I was under 17, but not too much harm I could have caused in the middle of nowhere.

The only way this would be legal is if the road was gated and the public had no access.

Under the Road traffic Act, a road is described as any road to which the public have access and includes bridges over which it passes. The access includes by invitation or inferal, so an industrial estate or supermarket car park also come under the RTA, you need to be fully road legal to drive on them

Private roads are just that - private. As long as 1) the road belongs to you, or 2) you have permission from the road or land-owner, then you can drive anything on it - go-karts, ATV's, etc. Doesnt' matter if it's a full size automobile or not, as long as it's private property, and you have full permission to do so, then it's not illegal to operate equipment normally requiring a license to do so. Otherwise, farmer's children would be in REAL trouble all over the world! LOL. or anyone else for that matter. So go ahead and enjoy it. You're likely not breaking any laws, at least in the USA. Your country may vary...

As above, if the land is yours, or you have the landowner's permission, you can drive whatever you want, however you want, without a licence, insurance, tax or MOT if you wish.
It is irrelevant if there's access onto the land from a public highway, car park, or similar, it's still private land & you can do what you like.

It is OK to drive uninsured on Private roads WITH the owners permission BUT  If you have an accident and cause damage to property or injure another person who is legitimately using the property you will be liable for damages and costs which you will have to pay and could be fairly high.

Everyone wants the cheapest auto insurance. Everyone is constantly looking comparing this auto insurance provider with this one. It's almost like a parlor game, isn't it. I've done it too. If you've ever gotten a speeding ticket or have a young teenager itching to drive that you've just added to your policy or if you've been involved in an accident, it can get more and more expensive, can't it? Auto insurance is too expensive. You're not alone. it's true for almost every American family.You may get your queires answered here,

http://www.best-autoinsurance.we.bs/

The problem for discounts, however, is quality. Many ask is, "Is this cheap auto insurance worth buying? What kind of coverage do I have to sacrifice for a cheaper premium?" What is a small bi-yearly or yearly or monthly bill can become astonishingly high if you cheat on your deductible coverage or coverage amount. You need to therefore really search the different companies for the best, most comprehensive policy. Hope is here. There are good companies out there.

For car insurance the best way to get a very good quote is do a rate comparison on auto policies. Make sure that you pick similar options with the same limits, car type, location, etc so that all options are a good comparison.



What I always recommend is an internet comparison quote at http://www.lowratetoday.com since they have big name insurers and can give several prices on car insurance polices.

Yes, your comprehensive policy should cover driving anywhere in the EU with the same degree of cover - just check your policy wording to be sure.
With a fully comp claim & no other vehicle or personal property involved, it should be reasonably straightforward.

You will need to call at least a dozen insurance brokers to get a decent idea of what it will really cost you.

£1,000 might be the lowest quote, or it might be the highest quote.  There are so many variables when it comes to insurance, it's impossible to give an 'average'.

However, I have always fund Bennett's to be very expensive...

For auto insurance the quick method to get a low quote is do a car policy comparison. Be sure to choose the same coverage amounts, you can get an fast quote to compare against others. Use the same city/state, auto make/model, mileage and driving history to make sure you get accurate comparison. To get easy auto insurance quotes, go to http://www.autoadviceonline.com/Free-Aut... and you can compare the major auto insurance companies.

If it was a hit and run, they will attempt to find out who did it.  If they are unable to, you will be covered only if you have collision coverage.

If you don't, repairs will be paid for by you, and if you car is totaled, you will still have to make the payments you agreed to.

If you do have collision, and the car is considered a total, they will pay fair market value, less your deductible amount.  The payment will go to the finance company.  If the amount they pay covers your balance due, you won't have payments.  If it doesn't, you will be responsible for the difference between the fair market value and what you owed.

No, no one is going to give you money to go buy a new car, that isn't the way it works.

Since you were financed, the chances are you were required to carry full coverage, and you will have collision.  Contact your agent.

please say you reported this to the police and obtained a reference number,your insurer will check,,,injury accident within 24hrs,,non injury anytime but the sooner the better,
you call insurer and tell them,if its at the side of the road they will send "Their"local recovery firm to collect the car and take it to their garage(at insurers expense)they then send out to the garage their own assessor to declare the car a "write off"(that is it will cost more to repair it than the value of the car)there are 2 ways to go from here,they offer you the market value of the car(Do not accept their first offer it will be very low,hold out and argue(you will get a better offer),if someone has run into a car ,front or back its likely the chassis is "crabbed"or bent,(in english it drives sideways and you will need new tyres every six months)no car is ever a write off until You,the owner sign a form saying its a write off or until you sign a garage "release form"it is the insurers job to return the car to you in the same condition as it was before the accident(whatever it costs them)
if you car is classed by you as a "family friend(personally i think a car is a lump of metal)"and cherished then make it clear that you will not sign a release form until the car is back in its original state (if this back into the garage for the next 20 years then so be it,,,also if it is that the reverse is true we will get it back on the road cheaply although it may be unsafe thereafter,
PS if you claim on your insurance they also will try to cancel your no claims bonus at renewal(another reason to report it to the police)dont stand for that either,if the other driver is found and surprisngly has insurance(and his company has a "knock for knock"agreement with yours(they both pay their own clients claims,they will also try to cancel your no claims bonus,)remind them that they work for you not the other way round,
best of luck ,,,bit of a diatribe i know but worth the effort

the insurance company will pay you the amount you "lost".

Before the wreck, you had a car worth $omething.



After the wreck, you have a car worth $alvage.

So, the amount of your loss is $omething minus $alvage.

The insurance company will write a check for $omething (minus your deductible), and they will keep the wrecked car.

The check is made out to You *AND* Finance Company.

You will have to sign the back of the check and send it to Finance Company.

If you owe less than $omething (minus your deductible), Finance Company will send you a check for $theRest.

That's how much you have to buy a new car with.

But, if you owe *MORE* than the $omething (minus your deductible), Finance Company will send you a bill for the difference, which you have to pay immediately.

Some people call that "up side down".  I call it "up 5h!t Creek".

First: Geoff W is a total moron and is giving you bad, bad advice. 
Second: IF you have collision coverage you insurer will send an appraiser to inspect the car and determine if it's a 'total loss' or repairable.
Third: if the car is indeed a total loss you will be offered the 'market value' of the car based on mileage, options and condition. If the car is worth less than what you owe then you will have to make arrangements with the bank to pay off the remainder of the loan, you will have no car and you will have to start over from scratch.
Last: if you are able to pay off the loan and have money left over then you can spend it anyway you like.

My advice to you is to NOT pi**-off the claims adjuster and be combative. give him/her a chance to offer a fair settlement before you start making any demands.

I agree with Cowoby Bill.

Geoff doesn't know how it works here in the u.s.



First off if you live in a state that offers uninsured motorist coverage property damage then they will pay you for your damages.  If not you should carry collision as your vehicle was financed and it will still get paid for.  Either way you will have  to pay your deductible.

The insurance company will inspect your damages and determine if the vehilce is repairable.  If it is not they will make an offer on your vehilce based on the current market value of the vehicle.  This is NOT an NADA or Blue Book Value.  They will take into consideration the year, make, model, condition, mileage, options, tire measurements and all and come up with a value of your vehicle.  When the adjuster calls you with the offer you can go over it with them to make sure they captured everything.  Sometimes an option is overlooked.  They will then state what teh vehicle is worth.  Some companies will negotiate.  Most will not.  They did their research to determine the worth.  You will need to do the same to get them to up it.



They will then contact your lienholder for a pay off of the amount.  If they offer more than what they payoff is then they will pay the liendholder first and anything after that would come to you.  If you owe more than what the vehicle is worth this is consider being "upside down" and you will need to work out what you owe with the lienholder.



Remember an insurance owes  to put you back to preloss condidtion only.  It is not made to be a profit to you.  Most reputable insurance companies are reasonable.  This is where you find out just how good your insurance company is.  It is not your CHOICE whether they repair it or not.  They owe to repair or replace it as THEY seem fit.  It's in the contract.  For instance you wouldn't pay $1000 to repair a tv if it's only worth $500.  It's not different for the insurance company.  Really, we're not such a bad group of people.

Your question appears in the UK & Ireland section, so I'll give you a relevant answer.  If your car is damaged to the extent that your insurance company doesn't consider it appropriate to repair it, either due to the nature of the damage or the repair cost, they will write it off and offer you a "settlement" figure, which will be based on the book value of the car at the time.  If you accept that figure they will send you a cheque and the remains becomes theirs.

That's assuming you have fully comprehensive insurance.  If you don't, you're out on your own.  Your only chance then is if the offender can be traced.

If the car is written off, your insurance company will come out and inspect the car, they will then make you an offer for the car. If you accept this offer they will pay you and the car is then legally theirs. If you wish you can buy back the car and repair it (If it can be made road worthy). I wrote mine off last year, it was inspected and I was paid up within 2 weeks. They paid me more than I was offered on a garage.

No, if you have changed the insurance to your new car then the insurance is no longer valid. Now that things are computerised, it may well alert the DVLA if the car is taxed without valid insurance. Better to give the buyer the money off the car to tax it themselves- they can do this on the day provided they have an insurance cover note and the change of owner slip on the V5.

i am assuming that you have stayed with your old insurance company and just got them to change over your old insurance to the new car..if this is the case then your old insurance certificate is no longer valid even if you still have it and the dates are valid as your insurance company will have cancelled it when your transfered over to your new car. if you use the old certificate then you run the risk of fraud because the dvla have records of all insurance policys and the insurance companys notifiy them when they cancel a policy

You will already have paid the test fee when you booked the test.

Your instructor shouldn't charge an extra premium on the day of your test - He or she will not have to pay any extra insurance or anything like that and should only charge you for the length of the booking at the normal rate.

The booking length will vary depending on how long you drive before the test and how far you are from the test centre.

Normally, anything from 2 to 3 hours would be typical.

They will certainly be prosecuted but you can almost certainly wave goodbye to your £250.00. You could take out a small claim against them but if they canot afford insurance they probably can't afford to pay your excess. The judge may give them stupidly low instalments (possibly as little as £1.00 a month) and it would be more trouble to collect than it would be worth.

I don't understand why proof of insurance cannot be displayed in the wndscreen, like a tax disc.

Yes,by the police and the punishment can vary. Chances are this kind of person has no Tax either, as you need insurance proof to buy a tax disc.
I was hit by an uninsured man before Christmas,didn't stop at a cross roads and hit the side of my car at 30mph full on,as he didn't think the junction lines across the road meant anything,duh!(international driver)
He was prosecuted for no insurance and endangering life.The insurance company can try to recoup the money from any life insurance,pensions, or any other monies they may have and if they do get the monies paid out to you,you get your excess back,this is what happened to me.

They deserve to be jailed but as I suspect most of them are yobs they will get away with the offence and be let off with a caution, depending upon the severity of the accident and whether it was their fault. At least, if they are responsible, they should be fined heavily and made to pay the excess payable payable by the third party.

The Police will fine the other driver for driving without insurance - they'll probably check to see if the vehcile was MOT'd and had road tax, if not, he'll be fined for those too, have penalty points and depending on how harsh they want to be, maybe a driving ban of a few months.  The fine will be paltry though.

Re: your insurance.  Some insurance policies now have the "un-insured driver" clause, I'm with Direct Line and if I get hit by an un-insured, they then chase the other driver for that money so my insurance remains claim free.



Keep all receipts for any out of pocket expenses you may incurr - hire cars, etc - and submit those too.  Maybe Mr Un-insured will learn his lesson when faced with a nice big bill to pay!



If your insurance company is unable to deal with un-insured drivers, take him to the small claims court.

In Calif. the age to begin Driver Ed. is 15 1/2 yrs. for your PERMIT.  You "may' obtain your provisional license at age 16yrs. although many teens (and parents) are taking longer.  The longer you take (AFTER) obtaining your permit, the more practice you'll get.
Be sure you have at least 40 hours of practice driving before taking your drive test at the DMV.

There have been rumours around for as long as I can remember saying the age was going up...certainly back as far as when I was learning to drive nearly 20 years ago!

Don't worry...the Driving Standards Agency who run the driving tests have, this Summer, started a consultation regarding changes to the way learner drivers are taught and tested. This would have been a golden opportunity to increase the age for learning or taking a test but they did not include this in the consultation.

The consultation, like all of these things will take many years to come to fruition and, when it does, will be in a vastly watered-down form. It will mean some significant changes to the test, but even so, they won't be implemented for at least 5 or so years so should not affect her in any way.

I hope that puts your mind at ease.

NO, your daughter can apply before her 17th birthday or her 69th year birthday. It certainly doesn't matter.  As about the rumours that a learner has to be 18 before they have lessons is just that, a rumour. As for the Loch Ness Monster, well I believe there is something there, being Scottish I have to.  Little Green Men from Mars, could be true as well, I'm not a Martian though. Why do people listen to others and start to believe them.  Get her licence and we'll see her on the road soon.

Your best bet is to buy a second hand car that that has already depreciated eg between 4 and 6 years old should be around a third of the new price.  Then you can go for Third Party Fire and Theft which is considerably cheaper than fully comp insurance that you would be forced to take out on a new car.



Obviously, pick a small or compact car that is in insurance bands 1-3 to keep costs down.  One of the factors that determines a car's insurance banding is the cost of repairs and replacement parts.  So the good news is that by picking a low band car, you'll also be keeping your servicing costs down.



Anyway - well done on passing your test and happy motoring.

There's no such thing as cheap insurance if you've just passed your test! I have taught hundreds of people and the cheapest quote ever for an over 25 female was about £700 which may sound a lot but men pay £1200+ for the same car. One mistake a lot of people make is thinking that the value of the car makes any difference, any car up to £30,000 costs the same to insure. The main thing is the engine, if you get a 1.1 or similar then it'll be cheaper but it's quicker to get out and walk.

I'd stick to something below 1.4 and if you havent already then take the pass plus course. A local school should charge no more than £120 for the 6 hours needed and that knocks 35% off your insurance.

Hi there, you are best to look at cars 1.4 litre and under ideally a 1.0 Yaris or 1.2, the more modern cars nowadays are plenty quick enough if that's your concern.  Alternatively you could opt for a Diesel say a Renault Clio DCI - they offer good performance with excellent fuel economy and are low insurance groups you get best of both worlds.

If you don't want to spend a lot on your first car then you could consider a Fiesta or a Micra.

Whatever you decide i wish you all the best : )

Don't worry about it - in reality, the difference between a group 1 or 2 car & a group 10 or 12 car is very little. Just buy what you fancy, as long as it isn't ridiculously expensive to insure. Run a few quotes for various cars through http://www.confused.com , to give an idea of what you'll spend. Your location will have far more bearing on insurance prices than your driving experience.
My nephew had a BMW 318 at 17, cost about £150 more a year than a 1.1 Citroen.

I don't see why not, ... the only thing you might have to do is get the local police to check the VIN # on the dash to get the car registered.

I work for an insurance company and they call this fronting. What most young drivers do is try and insure it under their parents name with say their mum as the main driver to get it cheaper as the mum normally will have no claims discount. If you do try and do it this way be prepared for a lot of probing and questioning. If it is insured incorrectly if their is an accident and a claim needs to be made, if the policy is found to be rated incorrectly they may not pay out on the claim :S Just something to think about but i do know how expensive it is as i am 18 and my insurance is about £150 a month :(

You would be saving thousands to get insured under your parents' or guardians' plan. If they add you to their plan, you get a much lower rate than if you were to be insured entirely on your own with your own car. Teenaged drivers are the worst so they cost a fortune to insure.

You cannot insure the vehicle on your own... period!! You are not 18 years of age and cannot legally enter a contract with an insurance company until you are 18. You will have to insure the vehicle under your parents policy(or gaurdian) but you will be rated as the driver. It's not insurance fraud like the previous answers posted. As long as you are insured on the vehicle as well then you'll be fine

To answer your question. Yes, this can be done and it is not illegal. A minor can be held accountable for an insurance policy as long as a legal guardian/parent signs along with you. The policy will be in your name without a problem. To answer your other question, you can insure a vehicle that is not in your name as well. Now, NOT ALL companies will permit this. But, there are a good amount that do. You must be aware though, that if any loss exceeds the limits purchased on your policy, will promote for the vehicle's owner to be liable for the difference.



If you are in California, I would be able to assist you in a rate and finding the insurance carrier that would benefit you in this situation, if you do not reside in CA. Than, you will want to speak with an independent agent.

You can insure it under your parents policy if you live in their household but the car will have to be registered in their name. The only way to insure it under anyone else's policy is if the car is registered in the policy holders name. Either way you do it you will be saving a lot of money over buying your own policy. The problem with doing what I have stated above is that if you get in an "at fault" accident and do bodily Injury & or Property Damage beyond the limits of the policy, the policy holder will be help liable for the difference. If you have further  questions, send me an email.

The only restriction on you if you do not insure your car is that you cannot drive on public roads - it's that simple. You need valid insurance to obtain a road fund licence - or do you propose to drive without that as well? If this is the case then why not save a bit more money and forget the MOT also? It is almost certain, given the technology available to the police and DVLA, that you will be caught. Your car will be impounded and crushed. You will be fined and your licence endorsed and I for one would have no sympathy with you. Consider also that if you drive without insurance and you are involved in an accident that is not your fault you will not have any claim aginst the other persons insurance since you were driving illegally at the time.

You need a huge deposit with the dept of transport possibly about £!00K If you register the car abroad and do not insure  for driving in UK it you are being irresponsible. Car hire is different but you pay through the rental fee for insurance leasing it is your responsibility to insure and will be part of the contract that you should do so.  Insurance is not particularly for your benefit but to protect those you injure through your own stupidity. Don't tell me you never will do anything stupid on the roads. All of us lapse

You are obliged to pay insurance.  I'm pretty surprised you would even think about not having insurance.  It's totally necessary whether for car repairs after a small accident or to pay medical expenses.  My mum had an accident years ago and a young child was hurt in the crash and was in hospital for almost a year, how would that child's family ever afforded that cost without the person at fault's insurance to cover it?

Driving a moped in Northern Ireland? (United Kingdom)?



I am fifteen years old, and like most fifteen year olds in Britain I am eager to get on the road and be free, I am quite young and I'll admit my knowledge of driving and how everything works is quite limited, so if you could try to imagine me as a martian from outer space and try to explain to me how to get one, some questions I have are as follows;

1. What age must I be to legally drive a Moped on the roads of Britain?
2. What do I need to drive a moped legally on the road, e.g: Tax, insurance and whatever else is needed?
3. Is it worth the expense? 
4. Are they a waste of money?
5. How much will it cost roughly in total for everything to get me set up with a legal moped on the road, e.g; Tax, moped, insurance, petrol etc...

Sorry for these awkward questions, just curious and eager to drive before christmas.

In Britain you can ride a restricted (i.e. slow) 50cc moped at 16. You would need tax and insurance, and if the moped is more than 3 years old, an MOT. You also need a driving licence (provisional I think).



A place near me sells new on the road mopeds for about £3000, and insurance would be a few hundred quid. They are cheap to run, but I felt that with the cost of buying and running a moped it would be better to save for a car. If you are only planning to keep the moped for a year until you can drive a car, that works out at about £300 a month plus petrol (I would guess around 10p a mile?). A bus ticket would be much cheaper than that.

Everyone wants the cheapest auto insurance. Everyone is constantly looking comparing this auto insurance provider with this one. It's almost like a parlor game, isn't it. I've done it too. If you've ever gotten a speeding ticket or have a young teenager itching to drive that you've just added to your policy or if you've been involved in an accident, it can get more and more expensive, can't it? Auto insurance is too expensive. You're not alone. it's true for almost every American family.You may get your queires answered here,

http://www.best-autoinsurance.we.bs/

The problem for discounts, however, is quality. Many ask is, "Is this cheap auto insurance worth buying? What kind of coverage do I have to sacrifice for a cheaper premium?" What is a small bi-yearly or yearly or monthly bill can become astonishingly high if you cheat on your deductible coverage or coverage amount. You need to therefore really search the different companies for the best, most comprehensive policy. Hope is here. There are good companies out there.

Car Insurance Question (sorry I know nothing about cars...)?



Sorry, Im new to all this so excuse the stupid question but Im starting driving lessons soon and am looking to get a car in the new year. Im just wondering HOW OFTEN do you make car insurance payments? As in once a year or is it a monthly thing? I just did one of the online "get a quote" thingys and it said around €350 which sounds grand if its yearly but steep if thats a monthly payment.

you can choose to pay monthly or yearly, 350 will be yearly but with all new drivers your monthly premium will be higher because you have less experience and therefore are a higher risk for accidents etc.  also check out what cover you are provided with is it fully comprehensive where you are covered for almost all eventualities or is it 3rd party where you are covered for less, fully comp is more expensive but you need to know if you are covered for damage to your car or if you hit another car are you covered, phone and talk to an insurance agent they will explain what you need but don't go for the first quote shop around.

You can either pay it as a one off payment or pay it montly, they give you a choice when you phone up.



The 350 will be your yearly amount.

firstly good luck in driving its a great think to pass for your independence.

Insurance can be expensive when 1st passed your test, they take in concideration your age, sex (m/f), address. where you park your car even (garage or drive) this is to assess how much of a risk you are to claiming on your policy.

they can do a one off payment which will be the cheapest if you pay the funds straight away, however most insurance companies will allow monthly (this will cost slightly more) as it puts them out.

Good Luck

You would have to ask them as to make sure of the amount.
Learner insurance can be expensive and this sounds a little cheap for an annual price. You will get the option of monthly with a small charge extra to pay on top for paying monthly but do shop around for the best price.

Car insurance can be paid in one annual lump or monthly. Not all companies though will do the monthly option.

Insurance cost itself depends on a number of factors
how old you are
how long you have been driving
type of car
where you live
what job you do
use of the car
etc etc

I very much doubt that your 350 quote is for a year if you are a new driver as that seems very low.

I have no idea what term your quote would be for but (in the USA and I'm going to assume in the UK too) It is best to pay semiannually or annually.  If you pay monthly, you are actually obtaining a 1 year loan from the insurance company which means if you take out insurance today and tomorrow you total your car, you still have to pay the monthly.premium for the entire year.

For car insurance the quick way to get a fantastic quote is do a rate comparison on car policies. Make sure that you choose similar options with the same deductibles, auto make, location, etc so that all things are a good comparison.



What I usually recommend is an internet comparison quote at http://www.lowratetoday.com since they have lots of insurers and will give several quotes on car insurance polices.

Ok heres one for you, am i right or wrong in thinking this...UK question?



Ok here's the deal, ive just past my driving test last week and my sister bless her has offered to give me her old car as shes just bought a new 1. Its a Hyundai coupe 1998 1.6, gonna cost me 1200 insurance for a first time driver for the year, the car shes wants to give me isnt that great, its had many faults, recently shes spent bout 1200 in the last month fixing it up i.e new cam belt, wheel bearings, new brake pads and disks plus a new spoiler and rear bumper as someone slightly bumped into her at a island and then a new crankshaft sensor also.

Thing is without going in vast vast detail ive saved very hard over the past 2 years to buy my own car and waited for this moment for a long time, not had much help from any1 as the family is in a very messed up situation but ive done this myself with no help and had plans for when i pass, then totally out of the blue she wants to give me this car, that i know has had a fair few repairs as of late. I cannot refuse the car as i do not want to hurt and offend her as i know shes only trying to help me out and maybe feels responsible for things in the past.

NOW the real matter is, as i had planned all this to buy my own car, but now i am obliged to except this from her......can i take the car an leave it in a secure garage without insurance, fix the car up even more and then sell it on for pure profit. in the mean time i can carry on with my plans and get the car i want, a VW Corrado. I MUST BE SEEN IN HER EYES to be driving the Hyundai, this would therefore mean i have to get insurance on both cars.........on a weekly basis can i swap insurance between these cars so when i go to her house im in the hyundai, but for general use i can cruise in my Corrado.........

do you see what i mean, can i swap the insurance between the 2 cars that quickly considering the one im NOT using will be in a secure locked garage when im driving the other..........very complex i know but i dont want to hurt her feelings, im a peace keeper and i dont want her to think im snubbing her help......

I need to be able to swap the insurance very quickly between cars at least for 3 months, the question is.... is that possible, so i do nt have to have 2 insurance policy's on the go at the same time...

i know its crazy but i need views please.....

If you have 2 cars then you have to have 2 Policies, which as a new driver will work out to be very expensive.
The thought behind your sisters gift is very kind, but why not tell her that you have saved up this money for the car of your dreams, and offer to sell the old car for her and she can pocket the money.
Try and appear to be very grateful.
OR you could take your sisters car for a few months to get your confidence up as a new driver and when you feel more confident, then buy the car of your dreams.  You would be gutted to buy your dream car and then lose it in a silly accident.
I was very lucky with my 1st car, my Dad bought it for me and within 2 months I sold the car for a profit and bought something better.

I don't see what your problem is. Accept the car from your sister and drive it for a while until you get used to driving on your own. Continue to save for the car of your dreams, the after a little while sell it, add the money to your savings. You've got more cash and she is not offended. Every one is a winner.

insurance is very expensive for newly passed drivers my dad took out insurance for me on his car for 1 mth and it was double what i pay at the moment on my rover 25 and i have been driving a year ... best to keep it affordable and just be honest .

If it's so important to you not to hurt your sisters feelings,then a compromise might be to apply for a 'd.o.r.n.' certificate. This tells the govt that you have the car but it's being kept securely, off the road. Then tell your sis you wouldn't want to prang her lovely gift,so you're going to get a 'run-about car' to gain experience in,whilst fixing-up the car she's been so good as to present you with into tip-top condition. That way,you get the car you want,keep sis happy,pay just the one ins plan,and if you DO stack your Corrado,you have a spare car. [which you might even grow to like...]  Alternatively,you could be honest...she may even suprise you by admiring and respecting your honesty-and you won't have guilt pangs....??

First of all, congratulations on your pass.



Regarding the Hyundai, I too would be honest about it and tell your sister that you really appreciate her offer but you think it would be too much for you (it could be, actually, the Hyundai Coupe is quite a powerful car for a beginner), so you want to look for a more suitable car for you. Playing swapsies with insurance cover is going to lead to a lot of work, confusion and cost you as well.

Between you and me, could it be that sis is looking at avoiding hassle in trying to get rid of it herself?

As a new driver, you're going to struggle to insure one car, let alone two.

Have you tried getting a quote for the Corrado? I think you may find that you won't get cover. Take your sisters car (the motoring press have always loved them) and build up some experience and no claims discount, then you can go for your dream car.

This question brings up a number of issues:

1.Changing your insurance from car to car isn't an option - The insurance company would charge you for each change normally and I doubt you'd get away with changing that many times.

2.The VW Corrado is in no way a suitable first car - It's too powerful and most insurance companies wouldn't touch you with a bargepole!

3.Likewise, the Hyundai Coupe, although not really a sportscar, is again not the ideal 1st car. I would be concerned about a new driver driving such a car.

My advice would be to say no to your sister's generous offer and buy a more suitable car and run that for a year or so whilst you build up some no claims bonus.

The short answer is no, you cannot transfer an insurance policy between two cars.

This facility is not on offer from any insurance companies in the UK. Each individual car must have it's own policy and it must run annually, not from week to week.

If you don't tell your insurance buffs and your car or stereo get nicked, you will probably lose the dosh that you forked out for it. Most insurance policies cover for standard items in the vehicle. It's worth letting them know, you will probably need to pay a little extra, but it would be worth it to protect your investment. Spare change should cover it, considering that you are happy to spend silly money on a sound system!!

I always think that the calibre of the first new registration car that I see sets the tone for the coming 6 months (used to be the year but time moves on). Unfortunately the first 58 car I saw was a Hyundi so we are in for a $hit time.

I bought a car and the number plate has a england flag on both sides? Before you start yelling it is not meant to be there, it is one of those fancy custom number plates.

How do I get the exact same number plate but normal, if that makes sense?

Car accident yesterday...?



I was driveing up to the shop to get a paper yesterday and on the way back onto our estate i turned round a corner (after looking i might add) and a man in a mercedes swung out of a another road (and as its a new estate the roads are very short) and took my right bumper off (i have a ford ka). When he swung out of the road he did not attempt to go onto his side or slow down but insted took both hands off the wheel and started waveing them at me! my instant reponse to this because he was not slowing down was to slam me brakes on but because the ground was wet the car did not stop imediatly but since i was driving slowly anyway ( i dont have power steering so you have to take corners slower to get the right steering done to get round) that when our cars met mine stopped. This was not the case for the other driver who did not slow or attempt to go on his side of the road but decided keep going and cut the corner (takeing my bumper with him!). We both got out of the cars with out talking and called for help. i was in a bit of a state as i tried to call home which was just round the corner and unable to look at my poor car so i turned round- only to hear the other driver get back in his car, start the engine up, reverse it and strigten up so the cars were no longer touching but looked as thought 'I' had hit him straight on! He then started taking picutres! (Fortunaly we have a whitness who saw this) but when help finaly turned up he is claiming that its is my fault! Can he do this? He showed no remorse at all and i have found out he is being done for froard soon but i am worried he is going to put this all on me because i am the less experienced driver and his car was worse off then mine but that was because he just kept going! Anyone else had a similer experience? What happened to you and what was the out come????

Please answer nicely for my peace of mind as i cant stop thinking and worrying about this. Im going to uni on the 28th and realy cant afford all this panicking let alone to have my car insurance go up or to take this to court!

Jimmy f :- its one of them new estates everyone in England is being made to put up with and move into because they are trying to econimise land use and build as many houses on as possible- So add that to the fact that the palce my dad works is going under due to the recent credit cruch which is effecting everyone no my parents cannot afford to help, nor would i wish them to help because it has nothing to do with them. Grow up.



GOD- He came straight onto the right lane of the road because the road he came out on comes out right near the corner and everyone cuts it and the whitness was someone who was in the house oppisit from were it happened if that helps clear somethings up- also the problem with Dyslexia is that we cant reconise when we have made a mistake and when shown the correct answer i just cant tell which is right or which is wrong to chouse :( I find it best to just leave them because i spell them how they sound so people tend to get the jift :)



Edit- Just found out that the other driver in question owes the goverment £900,000 or will go to jail at the end the month! (A neighbor brought round a news paper clipping to show us) Add this to the fact he is refusing to give us his issurance details i can see things not going wel....

You mentioned a witness, if they saw the accident and verify that it was the others drivers fault then it shouldn't be too much of a problem, but you will need to get a written statement off them. Also make a sketch of the accident scene showing positions of cars etc. as the insurance co. will probably ask for all your evidence if he does not admit liability.

Did you call the police? with both hands off the steering wheel this guy was an accident waiting to happen, and they should have been informed because next time he might kill someone.

You don`t say what side he came from, or if it looks as though you pulled out on him after he moved his car, I would say that if your witness states that he moved the car for the photographs, then the insurance company would be very suspicious of his version of the accident, I am hoping that your witness is an independent one(not a relation), unfortunately, without a proper account of the accident and a diagram, no one can give a guaranteed opinion of the outcome but I hope that you get a favourable result, this man sounds a bit of a bad character.
As for the spelling problem, when you type a letter like this and you make a mistake the spell checker pops up just to the right of where you are typing, the choices are below, choose the one that you think is right and then click "change", this will help in most cases but not all. Good luck.

hier your best route of action is to ring your insurers firstly and log the claim. explain to them that he moved the car before taking the pics. next (and this is the most important bit) go and see the witnesses - get a written statement of each of them with contact tel nos etc as your insurers will need to speak to them. get the statements to your insurers as soon as you can by recorded delivery so they dont get lost in the post. the statements will be the key to this being a fault or non fault claim. any tel calls or letters you have from the other guy or his insurers, redirect them to your insurers to deal with asap with out discussing hte claim with them ok

Okay, don't panic.  Report this to your insurance company and they will take it on for you, it's what you pay them for.  I take it you have his name and address, registration number etc. And ask your witness to write down what he/she saw while it's fresh in the mind.

In Kern County:



"For all traffic citations other than unlicensed driver (VC 12500(a)), if you are unable to appear on the date given on the original citation, you may contact the Clerk's office (via phone or by visiting) to receive a single 30-day extension.

You may not receive a 30-day extension if you have been cited for VC12500(a). (unlicensed driver)."

http://www.kern.courts.ca.gov/traffictic...



In other counties, such as San Luis Obispo  County, you can also request an extension in person at the county courthouses.



Who can sign the citation or Courtesy Bail Notice?

"Authorized representatives include



* Police and California Highway Patrol agencies



* Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)



(for license and registration issues)



* Any Station in California licensed to inspect and certify for the violation.

Many agencies charge $10 to sign the cite; this is different than the $10 required by the court."

http://www.slocourts.ca.gov/traffic/tick...



For some counties, such as Tulare County, the the extension may be as short as 7 days:

Your physical condition has no bearing on your conviction for driving while intoxicated.  You can get it back after two years and gone by, all fines have been paid, and you show proof of insurance.

Check with your regional licensing office, but it requires a form filling in and the transfer fee. Mine was not on retention and it required a valid MOT for the donor vehicle and the transfer fee. It is pretty straight forward.

I think you're almost there. When 'a friend' tries this he usually does it in the wet to aid loss of traction and not stress the wheels so much, gets a bit of speed for momentum and applies hand break a second after initiating turning the steering wheel full lock to the right. This has produced a satisfying 180 though 'my friend' suspects low profile tyres would help.

Just go to your DMV and tell them you lost the original, probably cost you 10-15 bucks.  They will have you fill out a Duplicate Title Form - you do need to know the VIN

well the patrol cars should have their databases all updated anyway showing that it IS registered. plus you have the colored sticker on your plate showing its up to date. so i think your safe. go to dmv.gov if your not sure about the legal ramifications of not actually having it in your car.

Go to your local DMV with proof of ownership like your title or insurance card or maybe an old registration.  You can get a duplicate registration.  I would try to call your DMV to see what information you need to provide them in order to get a duplicate.  Not sure what the cost is, but it won't be what an original would cost!

photocopy everything you send to dvla, make sure you put enough postage on the envelope. They lost all of mine and I had to get duplicates . It all took 10 weeks and cost me nearly £100 with time off work to sort out their mess. Take all the precautions you can, it's safe to assume they are all morons out to cause all the chaos they can.

Lots of thumbs down for the right answers.
As above, fill out application form with passport photo and send off with driving licence and recorded delivery.
Make a copy of the driving licence as for your own.

Agreed, keep copies of everything you send. There's an amazing amount of stuff "not received" at DVLA.  I'd use recorded delivery, too.

They tried it on me, until I pointed out it had been signed for, then they "found it". . .

For car insurance the obvious way to get a very good quote is do a rate comparison on car policies. Make sure that you pick similar options with the same limits, auto type, zip code, etc so that all things are an accurate comparison.



What I always recommend is an online comparison quote at http://www.lowratetoday.com since they have discount insurers and can give multiple prices on car insurance polices.

Hello

If you mean you are starting the insurance in a parents name and they will never use it.
with you as the named driver then you are driving illegally.
And as such if involved in an accident your insurance would be null and void.
The only way to get your quote lower is to agree to a higher access and to drive a lower risk car.

Try using http://www.moneysupermarket.com - they'll search quite a few companies for you, but I would also advise you to search some of them individually as for some reason or another, they don't all show up on these comparison websites.

Everyone wants the cheapest auto insurance. Everyone is constantly looking comparing this auto insurance provider with this one. It's almost like a parlor game, isn't it. I've done it too. If you've ever gotten a speeding ticket or have a young teenager itching to drive that you've just added to your policy or if you've been involved in an accident, it can get more and more expensive, can't it? Auto insurance is too expensive. You're not alone. it's true for almost every American family.You may get your queires answered here,

http://www.best-autoinsurance.we.bs/

The problem for discounts, however, is quality. Many ask is, "Is this cheap auto insurance worth buying? What kind of coverage do I have to sacrifice for a cheaper premium?" What is a small bi-yearly or yearly or monthly bill can become astonishingly high if you cheat on your deductible coverage or coverage amount. You need to therefore really search the different companies for the best, most comprehensive policy. Hope is here. There are good companies out there.

It used to be 3 years where I live, but now when they run your abstract, it shows everything, all the way back to the beginning of when you started driving. I don't think it effects your insurance rate if it is further back than the number of years they ask on their application.

They usually stay on for three years and then will be removed when you send it in.

Your insurance company though may request if you have had any points in the last five years.

I beleive this depends on the state and the violation, but here in California let's say a speeding ticket or failure to stop (something minor) will stay on your record for three years.  Something more serious like a hit and run or a DUI will be there for 7 or maybe even 10 years now.  Good luck and drive safe!

it depends on what state/ country you are in, and what the offense is

Minor offense- Usually it will stay on your driving record for 5 years. It will only risk you losing your license for 3 unless you have other tickets.

Major Offense- 5 years, and will effect your license status for all 5 years.



If you have a commercial drivers license, employers can pull up your driving record for the last 10 years.



These are all for the USA. Hope that helps

The points stay on your licence for 3 years but all insurance companies will note any in the last 5 years and you will still pay a higher premium even if they are over 3 years old. It does not matter what the points are for the same rules still apply!

As well as taking lessons, with a provisional licence I think you can drive with someone aged 21 or over who has had a full licence for more than three years in the passenger seat. At least they were the rules when I got my provisional (6 years ago).

Wel other than use it for the obvious one.....driving, and the other one mentioned above, ID....i can't really think what else you would need a driving licence for - I suppose you could always use it for drawing very short straight lines. or talking of lines - you could use it for taking drugs! Or perhaps use it for flicking little bits of paper at people, or you could use the paper counterpart for a large paper aeroplane? Running out of ideas now as I have never needed to think of another reason to own driving licence - other than to drive!

Vehicle Insurance cancellation fees?



Help! Someone must know the answer! I have telephoned to cancel my  vehicle insurance cover within the 14 days cancellation period and have been told to put it in writing.  I've been told that even though I haven't yet sent the proposal forms back signed, nor  have they sent the full documents out, I am still liable for over £76 in cancellation costs!  I didn't even purchase the vehicle in the end (wouldn't have passed an MOT), so therefore wouldn't have even been a risk for a day! They said they may be able to claim back a couple of the little fees, but definitely not the £50 administration charge. How can this be?

Car declared SORN - how can I tax it again?



I took my car off the road a few weeks ago and declared it SORN as I did not know how long it would be off the road for.  I have found a buyer for it though, and have told her that I will get it taxed for her to collect.

As I am still the registered keeper & have the M.O.T. certificate etc, can I just go ahead to the post office and tax it using a form that can be printed off online?  Will that then eliminate the SORN declaration? or is it more complicated?

Also, the brakes on the car are quite soft - it can be driven, but I'm not sure if the buyer has read the ad properly.  I sold it on e-bay and the car was advertised for "spares or repair" and it was clearly stated that the brakes need bled.  I drove it like this, and it is legal, but the brakes are quite a bit softer than they were previously.

The buyer is travelling around 80 miles to pick the car up and I don't want her to think that I am trying to pull a fast one as I feel that I have advertised it fairly and have noted any imperfections in the vehicle.  Should I re-iterate to her before collection that the brakes are a bit soft? or should I just assume that she has read the ad properly?



</question>



<additional details>



Do you think this would tactfully remind her - without putting her off - if I send her an e-mail - the following:

"As stated in the advert, the brakes need bled, so they might seem a bit soft, but the car is still legal and okay to drive.  I have all the documents etc."



Please note that I have had the brakes looked at by a mechanic - the brake nipples are seized, so he has managed to sort it for the time being, but in order to replace the brake nipples & carry out other repairs, it was going to cost around £300 - hence the reason I am selling as I have spent a great deal on it already.  I have sold it for less than half of what I bought it for, so I feel I have been perfectly fair in advertising for spares/repair and stating what the repairs actually are.

If the car was illegal to drive the way it is, I'm sure the mechanic would have informed me - as then I would have been forced to have the work done there and then, filling his pockets in the meantime, and I would not have been able to drive it home.

Just because a car has an MOT certificate does not mean that it is legal to drive. For example you could get a fine if your tyres are worn even if they were fine on the MOT.

You could go ahead and tax the car yourself, if your insurance is still valid. Or like someone else said, give the buyer a discount for them to sort it out themselves. Just make sure that you complete a receipt with the actual time of the transfer on it, and send the V5 to the DVLA promptly, as if there is a problem with her driving the car essentially illegally (e.g. gets in an accident due to the poor brakes), you don't want the fine to come back to you as the registered keeper at the time.

Is it suicidal to make a car insurance claim if you were driving whilst uninsured?



Firstly I live in the UK. I know this sounds like a stupid question, but I was hit from behind by a motorbike the other day as I was turning right off a main road. He kind of admitted liability as he was coming from behind but we agreed to settle it amicably through our respective insurance companies. It was only when I rang up my insurance company to claim that I found out that they had cancelled my policy because my card was declined(at the time of automatic renewal), and I had been driving uninsured for one month. The reason is I was on automatic renewal but had ordered a new credit card in the new year hence the decline because details changing. The insurance comany had written to say this but I had stupidly not opened these letters assuming that I was automatically covered as in previous years and it was just more junk trying to sell their home insurance.



Now I realise that I am the biggest fool for not realising I was uninsured, but if I approached the 3rd parties insurance comany to claim for my repair would it be an unwise move? My insurance company said approach them direct and they should still pay as it was their drivers fault and I don't have to mention anything about my insurance(or non insurance). However I am anxious that they will find out I was not insured at the time, advise their driver to say it was my fault and that I was an uninsured scumbag and call the police. The police will then come and arrest me, I get sentenced to prison and then have to spend the rest of my unhappy days at the mercy of Bubba, Boggs and his Ugly Sisters. Do you see the quandry I find myself in?

I am surprised that your ins co did not give you a little lee way to contact them with the new payment details. Will they not reinstate the ins now? I pay for my ins monthly, when it runs out on the 3rd of July, it automatically renews, my first direct debit for the new year is therefore 3rd August - a month into the term, but I am still covered for that period.

See what your insurance co is prepared to do because you do not want to find yourself at the mercy of Bubba and his dubious friends!

Do not claim.

Not having insurance is what's called a strict liability offence in law. That means that if you, in fact, have no insurance, regardless of why you don't have it (even if it's not at all your fault for some reason) you are guilty.

That means a compulsory court case and six points on your licence, if it's reported to the police.

If you claim, it's almost certain, in these days of reciprocal insurance arrangements, that the other party's insurance company will find out.

I certainly wouldn't take the risk

EDIT - to clarify comments others have made... the law requires you to give your insurance details to anyone who may 'reasonably require' it. This would obviously include anyone you had been involved in an accident with. Refusing to do so is deemed the same as having no insurance (as with breath tests) - ie 6 points and a fine. 
It's also worth pointing out that the courts also have the power to order that any vehicle which is, or has been, uninsured is seized.

When someone hits you in the rear they are automatically at fault and liable.  I have made a claim in these circumstances where I held the other person responsible and refused to give them my insurance details because I refused to allow them the abilty to claim on my insurance and affect my no claims bonus.  When I reported the accident to my insurance company (obligation) I put 'for informtion purposes only' on my form.  I believe the law 'may' have changed where you cannot withold your insurance details and I don't know if you have already exchanged yours with the motorcyclist.

If they do not have your insurance details, you could try to make a claim and withold your details on the grounds you hold the other person entirely responsible.



And if it doesn't work then just drop the claima dn don't respond anymore.  There is a risk however, because if you are reported to the police they have a database and can tell if a car has insurance on it.  So I'd way up how much the repairs are going to cost against the risk of being caught.  No insurance is 6 points on your license.

Ignorance is no excuse...check a bank statement and you would know...and ins co would have  sent you a letter , so I for one think, muppets  like you need a little stretch inside to refresh your memory on how to insure your motor! millions of us get a new debit or credit card each year, and we somehow manage to quote the 16 digits off the front! dohhhh

as you were not insured at the time of the accident you could face a fine min of £50 and 6 points the courts do not except any excuses. If you are now insured you will still have trouble making a claim as the dates will not be the same and the police can impose a 3 month driving ban. This happend to me not worth the risk. Better to see if the person who hit you will settle privatly.

In English law (and as far as I know, the whole of the UK) you are not required to disclose your insurance details unless either someone is injured or an attending police officer requests it. Neither applied, from what you say. As you have the other party's insurance details, write to them advising that you hold their client to blame and wish to claim against his insurance for your damage.  There is no need for you to provide them with your insurance details.

I take it you've got your cover re-established, You didn't notice that the premium hadn't been taken?  You must be very wealthy . . .

You have committed a serious motoring offence by driving when not insured. 
If the motor cycle insurers become involved, they will know immediately that you were uninsured.
How much damage was sustained by the motor cycle? Is he likely to claim?
I would advise a low profile stance and renew your insurance immediately.

Sorry all, but entidtil has it right.

Because your not insured does not relieve the liable party from any fault and does not make the incident your fault.



Make the claim, you may receive notification that you must prove coverage for some time to come and you may also be ticketed for not having insurance at the time but your not considered at fault for this incident and their responsible for your repairs.

Car Insurance Help!!!?



Had an accident, held at fault and claim put through my insurance.  I would have had three years no claims bonus on renewal but because the accident happened in my third year i am now down to zero no claims bonus. Is this correct?



</question>

What would be benefit of that? Asking for 1 claims bonus will not reduce my car insurance quote?

Hmmm. 
The clue is in the No claims bonus bit. 
Once you have a claim you have no longer got no claims so they don't give you a bonus or a 'no claims' bonus. Ask them for a one claim bonus. It's just like a no claims bonus only for people who have had a claim. Oh and you don't get a bonus

Yes, it's correct.  You get a bonus if you don't have a claim. You had a claim.  The bonus is for three *consecutive* years without a claim, so you have to start back at one.

Yes this is correct. If you have 3 whole years NCB and you have an accident, you will still keep 1 years NCB. But since you had not finished your 3rd year you lose it all. Unless of course you had No claims bonus protection.

For auto insurance the best way to get a good quote is do a rate comparison on car policies. Make certain that you pick similar options with the same deductibles, car type, location, etc so that all things are a good comparison.



What I always recommend is an online comparison quote at http://www.lowratetoday.com since they have top name insurers and can give multiple prices on car insurance polices.

That's the way it works. Why not pay a little extra and get your no claims protected then if you have an accident you lose none of your no claims benefit

You are correct. There will be no bonus. The bonus was to be for three consecutive years. You didn't make it.
