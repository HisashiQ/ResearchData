The key thing is to "cap-off" your smaller speakers, this stops them trying to carry the bass signals that will be handled by your subs.  A capped-off speaker has a small capacitor inserted into the positive lead, which prevents those low-frequency signals reaching it.  As a result, it will be able to handle mid-range and high signals with much greater clarity, and at higher volume.



Look for articles online, you have to get the right value of capacitor - look for something around 150microFarads for your speakers.  The cost will be under 5 pounds, the results will be the best money you EVER spent on your system!

How did we ever manage without them ? it sounds as though you have been seen conming,glass doors and all that stuff.GPS is brilliant to use at sea,but can be a totally useless toy on land.They are fairly good on the open road but no use for directions in cities and towns.They can pinpoint a location but the directions in built up areas cannot be relied on,as you can see by the multitudes of perplexed and lost motorists who use them.As with any electronic guide,it is only nearly as good as the input.

I have to confess that it does sound rather like a faulty unit and if all else fails, I suggest you go back and ask for a refund....

Depending on the type of Sat Nav you have, depends on how they function. However, I have a Tom Tom and usually it hesitates a little at the start page until it sorts out where it's satellite connection is coming from. So, to be certain you are simply not just out of 'range' (for want of a better word) moves some place else and try again.



Did you have instructions with the Sat Nav? This should tell you if you have to do something to enable it to move passed the welcome page.



The other alternative is to marry it to your computer and see if this can download updates to try and sort it out.



I wish you all the luck, but I suggest you take it back, if all else fails.

even though you brought the unit second hand there are still guide lines that the seller has to stick to, one of them is that the item is fit for purpose, which your unit clearly isn't. take it back threaten them with consumer goods act, if they don't offer to repair the unit then take them to a small claims court

What is the best hatchback for a dog in the boot?



I am looking at downsizing my estate car, to a smaller hatchback - the problem with most hatches is that they have a boot lip and my father seems to think that this is a huge issue and can hurt the dog jumping over the lip.

I was looking for maybe a ford focus or a vw golf or something similar - i'd love to hear peoples thoughts who own the vehicles and how they think a dog will get on trying to get into it.

First off Mark you need to stop lying to yourself. Especially since that there is no way on earth nor physics, that bass can shatter any kind of window or glass. Only high pitched freqs can and will shatter glass. Bass will either suck the glass into the car or blow the glass out of the car, but there is no physical way that bass can shatter a window. 
With that said, to blow out glass from an auto mobile it takes more than 2 1500 watt subs. What is the RMS on the subs? Not the peak values, as peak means absolutely nothing, except that your subs are actually around 750 watts rms.
Now for the question at hand: 
The bass will not damage you car, now if it is hitting hard enough to make it feel that it is shaking your entire car, use some dynomat. It will make the bass sound better in your car, and it will stop most of the rattleing. Some other things you can do is, line the back side of your license plate with some sort of foam, you can use that just about anywhere.

You need to get a radio removal tool from halfords or even just your local garage. It looks like two tubes of metal bent into two prongs. You insert that into the holes left by the four screws & use those prongs like handles to pull the stereo out.

Sometimes the charger head that inserts into the socket, the spring contacts are too far back, and won't engage the socket sides properly, Or sometimes the spring-loaded tip won't reach the middle contact. Usually if the lighter works, but accessories don't, its either the cord head design, or the lighter socket is too shallow in design. Only way around that is to get an adapter from the auto parts chain stores, see if one fits better and makes better contact, then plug the cord into that ( it's a 2-into-1 type adapter ). Good luck,

A couple of thoughts: -
1) The cigarette lighter doesn't usually work unless the ignition is switched on
2) The plugs on some of the really cheap leads do not make good contact with the car's cigarette lighter socket. Test with a multi-meter.

On newer cigarette lighter sockets, the positive contact is only on the spring clips that 'grip' the lighter insert, as opposed to the base of the socket being live too - you'll notice that your charger has a pin on the end of the plug to contact with that base, so no live base, no charge. You'll need to install an additional 'accessory socket' or swap your cigarette lighter point for one.

Check the fuse in the charger(s). Or the fuse for the lighter

Another easy mistake is that you haven't pushed the charger home far enough into the lighter.

The cheapest way is to get an airband radio, which can be also used to monitor frequencies used my taxis and maritime vessels as well as air traffic control.

Most emergency services will be moving over to digital radio, which will require much more complex and expensive equipment.

I just bought my sister a Garmin Nuvi 250 which cost about £160.  She finds it really to use.  I would recommend a Garmin over a TomTom as the mapping for Garmin is done by driving all the roads whereas TomTom take their mapping from satellite.  This gives the problem that the TomTom can try to send you the wrong way down a one way street.  The Garmin is less likely to do this.

I agree with kevin and Airforce on this one, with the exception of Kevin adding that you should buy Infinity speakers. If your car can fit 6.5" components I would suggets Elemental Design, they have some that are on pre-production ordering status. Right now you can get them for $185, later on you can pick them up for $315. Get them directly from the makers, that is why they are so cheap. Other wise I would recommend CDT Audio or Cadence Audio. There are the likes of Rainbow as well out there. But Elemental Designs or CDT will be your best bet, and best bang for the buck.
Infinity uses textile dome tweets whcih are very harsh on your ears, CDT, Elemental Designs, Rainbow, and Cadence all use silk dome tweets. Silk is much better, you get warm clear highs from silk, unlike ringing harsh highs from textile and or any metal dome tweets.

mtx are one of the hardest hitting subs around. I'm on my third install and have had mtx subs in last two. you need to amp them up real good. i currently have two alpine amps linked to power a double 2000w rms mtx sub. if you need or want more bass than this you have to go to extremes.

Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do to have it show up on all Cd's.  It is special coding that is included on that CD that will cause the names to show up.  Not all CD labels do this yet.

Saxo Car Stereo Help!!!?



Hi please could someone help me with my car stereo.

I recently purchased a car (Citroen Saxo 1.4 VSX) and after 2 days my cousin recked my stereo. The problem is I do not know whether the problem is with the speakers or the stereo. When I turn on the system I just get a buzzing noise, but sometimes it works fine as long as you do not turn the volume up too much. Surely if he blew all 4 speakers I would always get buzzing, this lead me to thinking the problem lies with the actual head unit. Also when the system is buzzing the backlight behind the display on the stereo flickers. My knowledge of stereos is limited which brought me here. Should I try replacing any of the parts or just revamp the whole system.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You.

No you can't run a sub from the speaker output, at best you'll only get about 50w RMS from it, which is why a sub always requires an amp via phonos.

Have you ever heard of the law of diminishing returns? You spend £20 on a radio and it sounds twice as good as one costing £10. You spend £40  it sounds half as good again. To spend this amount on a sound system for of all things, an Astra is just so you can boast about how much it cost. Even 50 watts is too loud to listen to comfortably. I bet you listen to this thumping over-bassed sound (won't call it music) when the lowest quality components will do. I suppose you will grow up one day and appreciate quality instead of quantity. You really will look a pratt if you go ahead.

You have an aerial; it's built into the window glass.  The vehicle includes a built-in antenna amplifier to compensate for the less sensitive antenna design.  It's possible that your antenna amplifier has failed.  If you have an after-market head unit installed, it may not have been wired correctly to activate the amplifier.

The wattage is the maximum input power they will handle, they will work fine even if you only have a 20watt amp. Don't worry about the amp output power, as long as it doesn't exceed 500watts you'll have no probs. You wouldn't use a 500watt amp at full power because of the distortion that would apply.

Help with car audio for Corsa C?



My current System:

Sharp 6x9 1100 w in the back (brought from ebay running off the stereo)
A broken Mutant Subwoofer 12" 800w with 150w amp in the boot
A new sony 2008 Stereo, dont know the model number but it has 4x 50w output

I now need to buy a new subwoofer (was thinking about the FLI: FT10A TWIN - Twin Active Bass Tube) and im thinking about upgrading the 6x9's as there not very good,
Also i was thinking about changing the door speakers in the side doors (its a 3 door car) but dont know how?

How do i fit door speakers?
Is the FLI: FT10A TWIN - Twin Active Bass Tube any good?
Whats the best 6x9's (do i go with sony as its the same as my head unit?)
What size/make door speakers do i get?

Cheers for any help

<answer>



To fit the door speakers you will need to find out what size the standard speakers are, then you will probably be able to buy direct fit speakers from a manufacturer of your choice, or you can often buy adaptor kits to fit bigger speakers into the mounts in your doors, this is what I have done in my Ford Escort. You will need to remove the door cards or the rear interior trim to fit the speakers. As for the Fli sub, Fli are a top make, I have fitted a Fli Trap 10" active sub in my girlfriends car, along with a set of Fli 6x9" speakers and it sounds amazing, so get the Fli bass tube and some Fli 6x9's!

The problem could be:
you need a new antenna, you need to connect it to the back of the radio(it could have came unplugged), or it could be in the wiring.
Trust me I know about wiring problems. I just recently bought this car, all seemed fine until one day my car wouldn't start, and then I looked at the wiring.

They have wiring kits and installation kits for your at auto parts stores.  The wiring kit will match the wires from you radio to the one in you car.  It will allow you to easily plug the radio in the original connections of the car.  The installation kit will allow to match your radio perfectly with the factory whole in the dash.  It will secure the radio and stop it from moving and make it look professional.  The wiring and installation kit normally cost about $15 a piece or less.  If it's more, go elsewhere.

I have never seen the point of playing music loud in a car , its not safe and very annoying to other drivers, music should be listened to without being deafening . I love all kinds of music and play it all the time when driving but its for my ears only . I often smile to myself when one of these cars pull along side with brain blowing music bellowing out and occupants with dark glasses and spiked hair and think , yes it must be the vibration that's made them look that way .

1 - Check that the speakers are fitted securely.
2 - Check and adjust equipment settings:
Main setting would be Bass, this tends to cause distortion if set too high.
If you like your music loud, try to get an even output by adjusting the Bass, Treble and Volume accordingly. Another cause may be due to the quality of speakers. (You get what you pay for) As a last resort I would bypass the in-dash speakers and go for door speakers as they have a superior effect. Hope I have been of some help.

if you have an aftermarket stereo then the accessory and constant power wire is wired together...if it is an aftermarket,then try running a wire from the red wire on the back of the stereo to the switched lead or to the fuse block...there should be a fuse marked acc or radio.

did you install the stereo yourself? if so you reversed the red and yeallow wires on the back of the deck, basicly you have the yello wire going where the red wire should be going and the red wire is where the yellow wire should be. reverse those wire and it should fix your problem, if it doesnt then let me know and i'll see if i can help more

What most likely happened is you or whoever installed your head unit connected the power to the constant power source (power that controls the clock).  What you want to do is match the same color wires from the head unit to the wire harness.  If it still doesn't work see a professional.

it has a cd changer connection, and it is possible it could be used to control an MP3 player, but i doubt it. I connect using an FM transmitter, but that isnt ideal. I have since converted to another make which takes usb sticks (remotely plugged in in the glove box).

first of all, you should seriously consider getting two separate amps. on for the speakers, and one for the subs. first, the speakers. find a 2 channel amp with enuf power to AT LEAST cover the total rms of your speakers together so 700w. look for a 700w or more 2 channel amp. (why i say "or more" is because the rms is a consistent power rating, if you ever need more power your amp needs to be able to power the speakers.)
as for the sub look for a 300w- max watts(i don't know what model your sub is) amp to power sub. something like,http://www.crutchfield.com/App/Product/I...
i hope this helps.

Which Eclipse car receiver should I get?



I was thinking about a CD4000 or a CD3100. Which one has better sound quality or is there something better? I don't want anything with gps or anything like that. I just care about the sound quality?

</answer from>



<answer>



I owned the cd4000.  The sound quality is amazing.  The 5 volts preout seem to make the amps louder, but that could have just been me.  I would have to say go with the cd4000.  The only thing I don't really like about those models is the knob that you turn to change tracks with.  It is on the other side and it's very loose feeling, so it is easy to skip though 3 tracks by barely bumping it.  There is also not many features that let you customize the sound.  BUT, for sound quality it is very nice and it looks decent to.

Pioneer AVIC-D3 radio reception and subwoofer pulse problem?



Hi I just bought the AVIC-D3 5 days ago and its giving me radio reception and sub woofer pulse problem. By the way this is what I have installed with my AVIC-D3 2 12 inch Kicker L7's with a Hifonics Brutus amp 1600 watts. So my problem is for some reason my radio reception gets really scratchy when my amp turns on and if I disconnect my amp it goes back to stereo quality radio reception. And my second problem is I always hear some pulse noises come from my subwoofers when my AVIC-D3 is turned on and also when it is turned off. Also when I do have some source turned on my system it does not hit properly so what could be the problem?



BTW I posted same question two times on avic411.com but got no answer so I was wondering if you guys or gals can help me out

To figure an estimate, take the sensitivity of the sub and add 3dB for each doubling of power until you reach the full RMS of the sub.



Example:



If the sub is 92dB...



1 watt = 92dB
2 watts = 95dB
4 watts = 98dB
8 watts = 101dB
and so on....



Add 3 more dB for the second sub in the final calculation.



This will only be a general figure as other factors such as cabin gain, damping, internal volume space and port dimensions (to name a few) will affect the overall output.

well depends, some systems can cost you $100, and others $10,000.



The cheaper ones you'll see at flea markets and such, fancy LED lights, glass boxes,etc. Stay away from those.



If you're looking for a decent system under $800ish, go to bestbuy and pick up yourself some rockford fosgate subs or some alpines, those are decent enough.



Now, its necessary to get an amp to wire those subs up to(mono channel). Look for one that matches or is close to your RMS rating on the subs.



For people really to say WOW, NICE SYSTEM. You'll have to do some extra work. For example, switching out the original speakers for some more powerful, cleaner speakers. Then, if youd like, wire those up to another amp(4 channel). This will make your system BUMP.



But with bump, also comes rattling and shaking. If you're pushing out enough power you'll hear all the rattling that goes on in your car. This makes the music sound absolutely horrible, also makes driving alot harder haha.



TO get rid of those rattles, you might want to do some soundproofing, the only setback is the time consumed doing so and that audio soundproofing materials are $$$.



And for installation, heres another issue. Youll have to get an amp kit that can handle all that power. Usually a 4 or 2 or 0 gauge kits are used for subs. 0 gauge being for HIGHLY powered systems. A 0 gauge kit will run you close to $400, but 4 gauge kits will be less than half of that. Then installation, depending on how much you'd like to be installed can be quite pricey, as lots of labour is involved. For basic subs+ amp install, you're looking somewhere around $150.



Hope this helps!



But if you choose to invest some money, im sure it'll be worth your while!

I'm assuming your box is screwed to the car in the trunk.  I don't think it should rust if your trunk is sealed.  If your still concerned I would take out the screws, put a bit of caulk in the hole, screw the screws back in and let it dry.



I caulked around the hole were my amp wire comes through the firewall and it stopped leaking.

Well, you dont necessarily need an amp to run those speakers. You can run them off your stock deck no problem. Now, lets say you got the Alpine type R speakers, now we're talking. Im running a 4 channel amp to my 4 type R speakers pushing 200watts each, and they sound absolutely amazing. The amp I have is the MTX Thunder 4 channel, wired with 0 gauge wiring.



Make the extra investement and go for the Type R's over the inferior Type C's bro

How do i know if its my sub thats blown up, or my amp thats blown up? Its been making a weird noise?



well one day i went to turn on my stereo and the subwoofer started making loud brruurrrppp noise, its kind of loud and you can barely hear the music. So i checked the wireing and it was cool, same as when it worked.



So im confused what happend? Did the amp mess up or the sub is blown? im confused its the first time this happens to me. I mean the there is still power comming from the amp but when it reaches the sub it just comes out as BrrrRruuppP.
what could be going on?

check your RCA's. just because it don't look broke on the outside, doesn't mean it's not broke on the inside. if they are cheap rca cables, they usually break near the neck of the plugs.



if your RCA cables are a good quality brand and you are sure and confident of it being good, try a better grounding. move the amps ground lead to a different location and see if it helps. the woofer making a convulsing burp noise is usually due to a bad ground or signal.

Hook line to other/another speaker see if it is still doing it,if it is it's your amp,if it's not, it's your speaker.you can fix them with( solder, hot glue,adhesives) if you can find what's rattling,or blown,



you might have to re-cone



Try : mat electronics



Why does everybody call a speaker a sub-woofer ? I've all ways known them as 10s,12s,or 15s..

I found the best thing since sliced bread...http://www.crutchfield.com/S-9oDEWuNVIo6...



It's not wireless so there's no interference. Not to be confused with an FM transmitter. Basically it adds an AUX input to ANY radio. No searching for a clean channel.



It feeds your audio signal from a headphone jack ( or RCA cables) by FM modulation, directly into the antenna input on your radio bypassing the antenna when on, allowing the radio to work as normal when off. It comes with an On/Off switch.



This is the answer. Totally versatile.

Not at all! This is strictly for charging an item that has a USB connection cable (like an Ipod). It will charge the battery but it will NOT allow you to listen to the music on your ipod. Buy a fm transmitter or a car stereo that has an Aux In input on the front (then you can run a cable from your ipod to the stereo, and through the stock speakers).

No, that device is only going to charge your Mp3 player.

that is an FM Transmitter, you set it to a specific station, and set your car radio to the same station, and you can listen to whatever is playing through it via your mp3 player.

ok so you say "Accent" as in Hyundai accent?  i hope not, cause they have HORRIBLE beam patterns and you'll blind EVERYONE on the road
if you mean colord lenses, it would be tough to say they are the SAME EXACT color, if they are, then there would be no detraction of light output, BUT if they are slightly off, they will be much less bright

The model number should be printed on the front faceplate.  If the unit is a CD player, the model number will probably start with "DEH".

Try the following:



Press and hold the SOURCE button until the unit shuts off.
Press and hold SOURCE again until the clock appears. With some models you will press and hold the FUNCTION or AUDIO button instead of the SOURCE button.
Press the left or right arrow to select the segment of time you wish to adjust.
Press the up or down arrows to increase or decrease the numbers in the blinking segment.
Once the clock is set correctly, press the SOURCE button to exit.

Daewoo Tosca Audio In From iPod?



I drive a Daewoo Tosca and it has a 2.5mm audio input jack.  I bought an adapter so I could plug my iPod into the adapter and play my music over my cars stereo system.  However, I don't know how to change the audio mode from radio to aux.  When I bring up the different modes on the display monitor, the only selectable modes are Radio and Navigation.  Does anyone know how I can play my iPd through my cars stereo.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rPMYlWGl... This is hands on video support lmao. And this is the audio tech at best buys Geek Squad This will help you out also. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZOd9lqma... Here is the IPOD forum also for this topic. http://forums.ilounge.com/showthread.php... All this should help you. Also youy may need to call your dealer and see if it is compatible with the version of ipod you have. Just because it has the built in adapter dont mean it will play. I have seen alot of forums where all was hooked but still would not play. It depends also on the adapter type. If it is a straight LINE IN or not. But if it is a universal LINE IN then these sites will help you the Geek squad is the best one.

you wont be able to add anyting to it, what you need to do is buy a new muffler, as this is the bit which silencers and the likes are packaged in, install this then the sound will change.

best way to get your car loud is to get a whole catback system. include 2 parts



1 - midpipe
2 - backbox (muffler)



the midpipe usually comes with a box in it, so to get the car really loud u can have one made without a box so the airflow is not silenced. also, the whole 'the bigger the exit pipe, the louder the noise' theory is not true. u just need a really good exhaust. but it depends on what car u have to get the best results. Jap cars have the best variety.



u can go for a whole custom set-up from powerflow (in the UK). they charge £380 for a full catback, but u can pick up ready made ones for u car for about £200 on ebay. maybe not be the most recognised brand, but its a good way to get some noise out of ur car and open the floodgates for modifying!



all the best!

remover the old muffler and install the new one. or just get a cat-back exhaust system with headers.

Actually it isnt the end of the exhaust that makes it loud. All the old throwbacks have headers on the engine. Its also a matter of having a custom exhaust put on the car. Adding a flowmaster will make it louder too.

All you need to do is get a suction pipe or suction tip which are the same thing. They are hard to find, like really hard to find. You will probably have to make one yourself but it sounds really crazy when you are going sort of fast.
