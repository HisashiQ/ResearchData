Can you block an IP address on Yahoo Groups?



I own a yahoo group in which locals can buy, sell, and trade. My site, along with several others which I am aware of, are having the same problem with the same person. She has been banned on all the sites under over 10 different names. She just keeps creating new yahoo names in order to rejoin our groups under a new name. Since we ban the email address and not the IP address, she can indefinitely create new email addresses just to create a headache for the local group owners. It takes us a little while to figure out it is her again, but when she continues posting the same items, at the same price, in the same town, it gives her away.



She is being investigated for a puppy mill type of scheme where is "acquires" dogs in the "rescue" she says she has (not that she is registered as one though) and then breeds and cross-breeds the dogs to attempt to sell the dogs at high prices to unsuspecting buyers. Buyers off the local sites say she won't let you come to her home, but meets you so you don't know where she lives, and sells sick and otherwise unhealthy dogs. Then they can't get back in contact with her after she gets their money. She is a fraud and none of the local owners want her on our sites where she can continue to fraudulantly sell items to our members.



Several local yahoo group owners/moderators have came together on the issue with this person. We have shared all her known email addresses. Is there something we can do with yahoo in order to permanently ban her IP address so we don't have to continue to deal with her? Thank you!

I have posted a topic on the free-cycle group and It doesn't show?



</question>

<answer>



Are you talking about an OFFER or WANTED on a Freecycle(tm) group? If you are, then it's possible that you are on moderated status and your post was not approved or that the moderator has not been to the site yet to attend to the moderated posts. If you are no longer on the moderated setting (the moderator changes this once you have proven that you know the rules) and you have sent an OFFER or WANTED through to the list, then it's a problem either with your email service or with Yahoo. Sometimes it takes Yahoo a while to send messages to the groups. It could also be that you input the wrong email address in the TO: box. Sometimes people misspell Freecycle. In your question you have placed a hyphen. In the International Freecycle group there is no hyphen in the name. This could cause your email to not be sent to the right place. If everything looks good to you, you could always email the owner address for your group and ask them why your post has not made it to the list. The address is the name of the group with a hyphen and the word owner. See example below:
xyzgroup-owner@yahoogroups.com (xyzgroup being a made up name representing your group for example purposes only).
I hope this helps you. Troubleshooting with the owner of your group is always a good start and usually quicker than asking Yahoo.
Have a great recycling day!

Unless it's a very small group, a few leaving shouldn't matter. People get into disputes online, and it's usually nice when they leave with the drama.



If it is small enough that it can't tolerate 3 members leaving, maybe post here about how wonderful a group it is and invite people to join?

Like Zeep (above) said, I wouldn't worry about it. Sometimes it's better if trouble makers leave. As an owner/moderator it's your job to stop things from getting out of control. Step in and ask people to be nice. Have a statement on your homepage that says, "no flaming or name calling or your membership will be put on moderated status or removed from the group." When people start up with arguments, it's best to change everyone to moderated status and put out an ADMIN from yourself telling the group why. Then redirect them to the subject of your group. Don't worry about a few people leaving. As long as your group has keywords which describe what your group is all about, on the homepage, people will find you and join if they have an interest in that. If it's a good group, it will grow. Who wants baddies on their group anyway? If you are aggressive about the group, make up business cards and pass them out to new people you meet, make up flyers and put them in appropriate places in your community. If you are on other groups and the owner says it's okay (always ask first), tell the other members about your group. Put the address of your group in your signature line so whenever you make a post to a group, it shows up under your name in the body of your messages. Soon enough, you'll have more members. Good luck!

If you  start a group it could take about 24 hours to show up on the list. If you join a group  where your membership requires approval by the owner or moderator that could take up to 14 days.

You need to send the help form and Yahoo! will take a look and if they deem it not adult, they'll reset it for you. Include the category you want it in and the URL and title of the group.
