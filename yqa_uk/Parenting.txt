Without even knowing you I know you and your partner are really beautiful people. Also your daughter would without doubt be beautiful too.



Don't waste another moment of your time worrying about this girl who has made such an ugly statement.

It makes my heart drop, thinking you are sad that people notice your 2 nationalities. It is such a wonderful thing you 2 found each other in your life-travels. People will notice. Just try and relax and know you have given your Baby a terrific blend of cultures!!! The best of both worlds I'd say

We Know you're baby isn't what she actually said.
Try and rise above it.



Sure, she may have been ignorant and mean..in which case.. don't hook into her game playing.
Or she may have been ignorant and completely messed up her choice of words. Mongrel dogs are usually much smarter and healthier than purebred and some are very cute and individual. Without realising the hurtful content, by her observing and commenting on your 2 nationalities. She may have been genuine about a compliment, as odd as it came out.
Personally I love mongrels. They often have great personalities!



The word has been ruined by over-use in derogatory slang.



So take the high road.

Do you think words like "smarticals", "funtastic", etc. Confuse our children?



My son - who is only two so I don't think he fully understand yet - is watching The Suite Life with his cousin. I was listening to something they're talking about - on t.v - and one of them keeps saying something about her smarticals - along with numerous words that are just a combination of other words.



Did you think this will confuse children at some point? I know they're more for humor than anything else, but aren't majority of these shows geared towards kids who are 10-14 (give or take).



Do you think the "teachings" of television and movie stars will eventually catch up to our children?



Thanks! Just trying to get a general opinion.

Children learn from their surroundings. If they watch programs that continually misuse the language (I'm sure it happens in others, but it predominantly happens in English), then they will begin to use those words.



Biggest case in point:



Guesstimate - A combination of Guess and Estimate. These terms mean basically the same thing; there is no reason to combine them to create a new word.

i kept a tight reign on the tv before my kids were about 4. i agree with you completely. have you ever noticed parents who continually talk to their children in "baby" or whiny voices-the child is still doing it at 4-5 years?? i see it all the time.



they are too young i think to differentiate between a proper word and a slang word at this age. no big deal when they are older. it is even fun to make up silly words when they are about 5-6 and they understand that it isn't really a word, my kids & i used to do that.



i stuck with only things like sesame street, blues clues, dora etc. even spongebob was okay, because they talked in proper english. im not a prude or anything-i just have had the opportunity to see what it does.



i don't know about anyone else, but i don't want people looking at my child like they are uneducated-and really, that is what is makes them seem like if they aren't taught by us as parents to correct them if needed. nickelodeon is great, don't get me wrong, but there are age appropriate shows for pre-teens and young children both.

not as foolish as boys of the same age. most are good in studies, like to dance and some take interest in playing musical instruments. they like to try fancy costumes like feathered scarf, high heels, make-up etc. Some can be a bit bossy and want to be dominant in their friends group. responsibilities...  studies? they sleep during bedtime. soft toys in their bedrooms. themed bedroom in demand.

The pinata seems to always work at b-day parties.
Also I'll have "door prizes". Years ago I went bought a roll of raffle tickets (the roll is so huge it will last till my grandchildren's parties) and every kid will get 1-3 tickets. I will then have goofy to good prizes to give away. The kids enjoy this because they can walk away with something too. Party stores, Clearance bins, and Dollar Stores are great for this. It's amazing how a child gets excited over a dollar toy.
I just finished a Hanna Montana themed party. All the girls dressed up and then voted who looked the best. Winner got to have the sparkly microphone and a Hanna Montana t-shirt (Walmart and Kohls has all this on Clearance) We also did Karaoke. That was tough, lol! I did a  party for my son, Favorite Super Hero!!
My trick is to start early and plan. The ideas tend to come to you. I've become known for my b-day parties. As the years have gone on I've had zero no-shows, because they're different from the others. Which is great because your child gets the toys, always good.

I guess it would all depend upon at what age they approached me with the information.  If they told me at the age of 6, I would discuss it with them but I wouldn't jump to any conclusions.  If they approached me at the age of 10 I would discuss it with them and really get down to the matter of what they truly mean.  If they were a teenager I would discuss it with them and then tell them my point of view.  But at any age I would always make it known that I love my child unconditionally.  Being gay doesn't banish them from the family.



I think that is such a travesty when a family rejects a family member because of their sexual orientation.

I don't have children yet but I hope to be a supportive parent. We are all human and react to situations differently. I think it will be hard at first because I would be worried. Not about anything religious or being worried about my family and it's reputation. Just worried that my child may become a target of horrible things said and done by others. People adjust and become used to almost everything in life. After that first initial shock and fear recede is what counts. I think I would be loving and supportive. :)

As long as my son is in a safe, happy and loving relationship with a good person that respects and values him, I wouldn't care if his partner was a man or a woman. I honestly don't think anyone in our family, extended family included, would mind if my son was gay. The only thing I don't want for my son, straight or gay, is to engage in casual sex. I hope he values himself more than that and has meaningful, short or long-term relationships.

Do not respond to her sulking or demands.Respond to her without letting her know you are annoyed at all.I found with my kids that what they really want is to know that no matter what,there are boundaries in place(this makes them feel safe) and that even if I don't approve of their behavior,I will always respect them as people.Not responding to her bad behavior,but responding to HER kindly will give her the clear message that she is a person worthy of respect,and SO ARE YOU! After a steady "diet" of this response from you,she will not pull this sort of thing with you anymore.So at least there will be one person in her life affecting her positively! P.S. Miss Prosthetic...I would respectfully suggest that ignoring the child will only make this problem worse.Ignoring the behavior,however is the way to go.So,you just carry on a normal conversation as though she is not sulking,and soon she'll stop.See the difference?

unfortunately it's difficult to give advice how to deal with children because it not easy even if somebody gives you  an idea to put it in practise.... try to talk to her and see if she gives you a good reason why she is always sulking.  I properly haven't given you a good answer but talking always helps. good luck

How to raise confident, resilient and well behaved children?



I always wonder if I would be a different person, more confident and resilient had I been raised a little differently. Over fifty years of child development research shows we may be making a few minor parenting mistakes that could have major impact in how our kids turn out. Here I give 5 major parenting mistakes, their impact, and simple corrections to turn them right. Research shows that using these simples parenting techniques--the right way--can help our children become more resilient and confident, as well as better behaved.

A spoiled child is one who misbehaves in public, cries constantly for his Mothers attention, throws tantrums to get what they want, refuses to mind Mother or Father, and thinks they should have every new toy that comes out and throws a fit til they get it.



People say you can spoil a baby but its been my experience that babies cry less when their needs are met quickly and efficiently.



Excessive holding of baby deters their developement and causes separation anxiety in the child but does not spoil them.

I



I would not try to define "spoiled"...it is too subjective a term. Parents should be looking at how they can socialise their children most appropriately...not trying to make a diagnosis which would only (ultimately)  be diagnosing their own parenting techniques so far...



Also, any diagnosis is  dependent upon the individual kids, and the behaviours exhibited. Every behaviour must be interpreted within the context of its society and family context.



My own personal belief (I am a single mother) is that I must be both kind and authouritarian, within strictly defined limits. I do not punish my child physically through hitting etc. and I do not believe that it is ever necessary...I have been been challenged by my child's behaviour in the past but all behaviours have been able to be resolved successfully without physical punishment. I do believe in consequences...when a child consistently has the (fair) consequences for bad behaviour enforced for them...they learn what society naturally teaches to them eventually...one way or another. Better that they learn it from their parent than from an external source.



Do not make excuses for your child, to make them feel good. If you do that it may make them feel good now...but terrible later, when society teaches them differently (through better or worse). Treat them fairly and consistently, the way that a good and just society would. That way they will learn fast.

To the people who are responding to this question:Whenever I hear the phrase "spoiled child", I wonder if anyone really wants to put that label on a kid? Spoiled means ruined.No matter how badly a person behaves there is always hope that they will turn around eventually.Maybe we should say instead that there's some work to be done here;as soon as a kid hears the label spoiled,they'll start to live up to that name.Just a thought.

Has anyones child made a wonderful piece of artwork?



that is not on paper, but on the floor, wall or door? What did you do about it? Some people frame that piece of wall etc or clean it off, or paint over it? I have some scribble in the toilet on the wall courtesy of my daughter and my son put tinted lip gloss all over the hallway. The scribble will be painted over and I finished removing the lip gloss from the hallway because it would have all kind of things stuck to it within a day, lol.

When my son was a young toddler, he drew a mural of Clifford The Big Red Dog on our brand new wood floors.  He had never used his crayons for evil before, so wouldn't you know he'd do it on the new living room floor.  But hey, it was very good for his age.  He had a big red blob for Clifford, and a brown and green blob for a tree.

My make up is on my bathroom cabinet as we speak.



There is bubbles over the bathroom floor, not to mention the ceiling.



There is a mud sculpture on my front porch



There is beautiful finger art, on my glass sliding doors.



I am not framing it, or keeping any of it. I am just being slack cleaning it.

Our tiled kitchen & living room floors are covered in crayon scribble from my 19 month old son but the scribble (or most of it) on the walls has been cleaned off. His scribble is no masterpiece but I know that when I eventually steam clean the scribble off the floors, the following day it's going to be back there. I know I should take the crayons off him but the scribble on the floor is worth the 10 minutes of peace & quiet I get, lol.

LOL...i'm soooo glad my house isn't the only one with "artwork" everywhere...



dd1 is 2yrs old. she got her 1st set of crayons this past Christmas (18months old). she looooves to color. we have a rule that she can only have one or two crayons at a time b/c she would hide them all throughout the house. and then when i got busy with something (cooking, laundry, etc) she would go to her hiding place and scribble on the walls.



ஐnicole - i know what you mean... what a mess...but such great memories at the same time! i can tell you what was going on with each and every scribble on our walls. there's a wall in our dining room she scribbled on when i was doing laundry. when i came in and caught her, she had the proudest look on her face...she couldn't wait to show me and tell me her little story about it. all her little stories start out "One day...." and the rest is gibberish i can't understand.

Yeah we do here at our home...most of it gets washed off with magic eraser except one wall.



Jasper and Mya got into the markers the one day upstairs in one of the older boy's rooms and decided to draw on the wall in Jasper's bedroom. They covered quite a large area of wall and Jasper climbed his dresser to reach up higher. They have little stick men up there on the wall and a sun and Mya's flowers (scribbles lol) and then a mixture of 23 different colours all swirled and dotted. Yeah...I thought they were playing so nicely and quietly until I realised that something must be wrong for them to be so behaved so I went up there and all I could do was laugh. I still have not washed it off and I never will. I mean what a damn mess they made but it was so precious at the same time. Mya still draw on the walls now and then but I make her clean it herself and she has not done it in a while but Jasper always shows visitors his and Mya's artwork on his wall upstairs.

Just ignore them, try not to hang out with them. Or tell them to stop it, or lie to them, or just say it's private. Or make rude comments about how they must be jealous and should get some of their own.

Any organizations that encourage self-confidence rather than competition in children?



My daughter is only 6 years old and I can't believe how badly she puts herself down everyday.  It really worries me, she has no reason to put herself down, and get's so much praise from her family.  I just don't know what to do.  I want to find an extracurricular activity she can do that will not worsen the problem. I thought about putting her in girl scouts, but I had a really bad experience with girl scouts when I was a kid- having the opposite effect on my self esteem.  I feel like she would freak out if I put her in sports, she is really a sore looser and a little too competitive.  Any ideas?

Cute, unless you do this often?  this is normal for this age to undress themslefs.  my daughter also did it and we always made joke and said that she will properbly be a stripper one day.  but it will stop, dont make a big fuss about it.  she is still small and busy discovering herself and what she can do - like undressing herself.  leave her for a while and explain nicely that you are going to put her close on again. best of luck your trouble only starts now girlfriend.  wait till they are older......

Are you judging yourself on a few isolated incidents or over a long period of time? I know as a mother,I am so much harder on myself than on others. Who says you aren't maternal? Do you have the desire to protect and love your kids? Do you want what's best for them? Are you comparing yourself to other mothers?(That never works!) Please consider these questions before you decide you aren't doing a good job.

Yes, I am. It's funny about the looks thing w/some mothers. I actually put myself together more after I had children. I know they are concious of what I look like and I was a down right slob before. Now, I actually run a brush through my hair and do makeup but I'm not overdone imo. Playgroups can be little microcosms of clicks and I'd just as soon avoid them.

Well, what's maternal?



I have that sixth sense that is such a mystery.  I know when someone is sick, hurt or in fear even if they're not around.  But I don't make Betty Crocker cookies in the kitchen wearing a dress, apron and high heals every day.



I let my kids watch TV, but I don't let them watch inappropriate shows.  I will usually succomb to chicken nuggets for supper if it's going to be a battle, but at least it's not poptarts.



I have woken up in the middle of the night, shoved Mr. Mozz out of the way because I "know" Gina's got a low blood sugar (I'm never wrong, and can't explain it).  Does that make me maternal?  Does the unexplained, out-of-no-where wild blood sugar reading somewhere else negate that?



I would rather jump in puddles with them than read them books.  But we read books.  Where does that put me?



I love to chat with my friends on Y/A, but my kids are fed, happy, homework is done, they're bathed and overall pretty content.  I would think that makes me a good mom, but someone else's definition might challenge that.

What an interesting question.
My first is on her way, so i don't know if i'm maternal yet, i've been told i'm a natural with young kids, so i hope that translates to maternal. I'm sure you are maternal in your own way.



Come to think of it, my mother is a great mum and was very maternal towards me, but i highly doubt she gives off that kind of 'vibe' either.

Yes I will  usually wear my hair" whats left of it" in a clip so its out of my face if Im chasing my girls around having fun and no makeup cant stand the stuff usually. But how does that make me un-maternal. I asked my hubby this before answrering this and he just LHAO and thought it was stupid. Who cares if we the non  so called maternal moms dont fit in with what the so called Maternal moms want we are moms lets be damn proud of it I know I am.

My kids have always passed out on the living room floor as babies. One minute they are playing, the next minute i look over, and their butt is in the air n theyre knocked out. The highchair is another one they love after a good meal. Sean fell asleep just now sitting up in my lap.

Under a bench. She was squirming her way, on her back, underneath a bench. She barely had room, and it was long bench, by a window, where the warm sun was streaming in. After a while, I realized I wasn't earing her little grunts anymore, and when I look, she had fallen asleep.

my daughter was staring at my friends husband and then all of a sudden she closed her eyes and dozed off while sitting up by herself.  It was so funny but I was worried that she would topple over and hit her head on the floor so I rushed to pick her up before she did and there was another time when i had to take my twins to the doctors for their normal checkups and both feel asleep when we got called in after waiting a hour.  The doctor did not want to wake them so I had to rebook to get checked at a later date.

I LOVE this question.



Funny story. When my youngest was 1 year old and my oldest was 5, we passed by a local park Haunted Trail a week before Halloween. My oldest was feeling so brave and BEGGED us to take her. Our youngest was falling asleep in the back. My husband had some ear phones and suggested he could just hold our 1 year old and if she got scared he would just leave. He put the ear phones in her ears and we stood in line. She yanked them out and just watched people for a while- then it was our turn.



Through all the screaming and the chainsaws etc, she slowly just drifted off to sleep. It was actually not that scary (it looked sort of silly- because it was for kids). I still can't believe she was drooling and snoring through the chainsaw noise. We couldn't stop laughing.



Oh yeah- we've never taken her back to any haunted houses, though!

My husband *swears* that our now 18 month old daughter- not the first he's seen, mind you- was sleeping **when she was born**. I laughed at him then, but now that I see how she is about her sleep, I do tend to believe she could, in fact, sleep right through her own birth.



Our oldest used to turn on the shower and fall asleep in there regularly when she was 2-3 years old- now that she is 10 she is still inclined to go relax in a warm bath, and I have to make sure she leaves the door unlocked just in case!

At what age did your child/children have their first birthday party?



My daughter's 3 and we've only ever had a few relatives over for tea on her birthdays so far. I just don't fancy having to do the party thing yet even though sh has plenty of friends we could invite.



My friend's little boy however will be 4 in March and he's had a birthday party every year - never a big budget one but always with 10+ other children in a hall/inside play area.



Obviously it's nothing to do with me about whether he has a party or not but I was just wondering when you gave your child/children their first proper birthday party?

We have celebrated our three children's birth's each year with a birthday party from the age of one year. The first 3-4 years were smaller gatherings of just family & friends and then as they got older, we had bigger parties and invited school friends.

We had a biggish party for his first birthday - i don't think i would bother doing this again for my second child but it was nice anyway and he is my first child so i'll let myself off :-)



Second birthday we went to the Zoo, he loved that and then had some family over in evening for cake!



Third birthday we just had a small gathering of friends and family, maybe about 5ish kids went!



4th birthday we had a big party at home with all his friends from playschool, maybe 15 children ish came!



For hs 5th birthday we are going to invite his school friends for a party at an indoor play area.



All have been low budget so far so i would class his 5th birthday as his first proper party because it's going to cost a lot of money and he will invite most of his class!

I am one of life's people whio dislikes having to do things because others have set a trend - my sister has three children and spends most of her weekends at someone or others party.  You do what you consider right.  But of course you have to consider your child's feelings.  You certainly dont need 10+ children.  Your family tea is just as good.  As for when to give proper party - when the start nursery/school - and only for your child's sake so they are not the only one not having parties.

When my kids were 1 - both of them had family birthday parties at a local park. Maybe 5 or 6 kids (family members) attended and adults. It was very casual- birthday cake, streamers, ice cream, lots of playing and NO game or activity "planning". We just sort of let the parties run their course at that young age. All the kids had great fun and I remember my kids didn't get on the equipment a lot but they did play in the grass with their birthday toys.

When my children were 4 or 5 and had met enough other children that they wanted to play with.I've seen so many parties for young children and babies where the child didn't have any idea what was going on at all,and didn't get any enjoyment from their party.Sometimes when they are too little,it turns out to be more about the parent showing off.So for me,preschool or kindergarten age worked best.

We have four children ages 7, 5, 3, and 16 months.  From their first birthday on, we fix a special meal that we know they will like, as well as a dessert of their choosing (or when too young, we pick something they should like).  Occasionally, birthdays have corresponded to visits from relatives, but that’s it.  We haven’t had parties where we invite friends and such over and are unlikely too.  I’d prefer to arrange get-togethers at non-birthday times when there’s not the gift-giving expectation.  One exception might be a single birthday party that marks some major milestone of entering into young manhood or young womanhood like 13 or so.

It's only done here on the farm, and our Family all bring a plate. It's just nice to have them all there.
We live a distance away from them all, so we all make the effort to get together for Birthdays.

to me bigger parties should be saved for these.......1st birthday, 5th birthday, 10th birthday. 13th birthday, 16th birthday, 18th birthday, 21st birthday and obviously the golden birthday.



1st because its celebrating his/her 1st year of life
5th because now he's/she's a big boy/girl & going to school



10th because he/she made double digits and can truly appreciate the party.
13th because he's/she's now a teen
16th because well, sweet 16
18th because the child is considered an adult in most cases
21st because that's a big mark in a man or womans life
golden birthday because it's just that a golden birthday.

Her first 'friends' party was in second grade-- she never went to daycare  or preschool and there are few kids in our neighborhood, so most of her playmates were relatives, so there never really was a reason for a friends party.

The fact that I pumped exclusively for 5 months, every 3 hours, every day, no matter what, so that I could give my son breast milk.  The breast feeding never worked out due to nipple confusion so I resorted to pumping.  It was one of the hardest (most annoying) things I've ever done in my life.  I have nothing at all against formula, my son has it now and my oldest was formula fed also.  The thing is, I was determined to do it, it was a personal choice I made.  I'll never forget what a pain in the you-know-what it was to do it.  I didn't give up when it would have been so easy to do so.  My determination kept me going and, for that, I am proud.

<question>



Do you know what an ER is for? Do you use it the right way?



My 2 year old daughter has a severe life threatening condition (her pituitary gland does not work at all). She had to go to the ER tonight and people were complaining because she went ahead of their kid who has a cold.



So I would like to know:



1) How many parents out there know what an ER is for?
2) Do you use an ER for the right reasons?
3) How would you deal with some ignorant fool complaining about your child going before them?
4) When your child is really sick (like in danger of their life) how do you not knock some fool out for taking up the hospital and doctors time with something stupid?



OK, I know I am borderline ranting but I really want to know the supposed logic behind using emergency resources for simple things that should go to the doctor in the morning. Any help would be appreciated and I do rate best answers.



</question>



<additional details>



Sorry for complaining but this really bothered me. The ER was full of a lot of "blow off" cases the nurse said. And I'm not happy about the complaints.

An Emergency Room is for emergencies.  Way too many people abuse our Emergency Rooms.  This is not a place to go to for a cold, but a place to go when you CANNOT wait until the next business day for a doctor's office to open.  I see it as abuse when people sleep late or let his or her child stay sick and then wait until midnight to take the child to the ER.  We even had to start rating patients (triage) since most people come into the ER for reasons that a family physician should be visited.



Your child with a life threatening disease should always be taken back first.  Do not let anyone make you feel bad.  You are using the resource in the right way.  HTH

If you tried to tell them, they'd agree with you, then do the exact same thing the next time.

I feel for you. People go to the ER Here for earaches, or a simple cold. Because it's a Saturday or Sunday Night, and they want treatment, so they don't have to wait to go to the doctors on Monday.. Some POOR Woman fell backwards, hit her head, and was bleeding from it, and they made her wait 2 hours!!! My Father in Law couldn't PEE, was in Severe Pain,  and he had to wait 5 hours!! I think every hospital emergency room is completely ridiculous, and I would never go there if it was not absolutely positively necessary. I would tell the "ignorant fool" that your daughter has a life threatening condition, more so than the common cold! And if he can't understand that, then their is something majorly wrong with him. These days you can't get any service if you don't come in by ambulance, dying. It's totally used for the wrong reasons.

I totally agree with you! The last time I went to the ER I had the stomach flu so bad that my body was in so much pain, I had liquids continuously coming out both ends, I was screaming, crying, couldn't sit still. But everyone around me was just sitting there, didn't look like there was anything wrong with them! They were all too busy staring at me!



They ended up having to give me an IV because I was so dehydrated, jello diet and meds.

Some parents don't have health insurance for their kids and going to the ER is the only way they can get health care for them. Others just overreact - does a temp of 104 warrant a trip to the ER? Maybe not... What about if the kid can't keep fluids down and their diaper stays dry for hours and hours?  Probably...  Some parents are just newbies and are trying to do the right thing for their child, just like you are.



If your kid is truly in danger, the triage nurse will prioritize her accordingly.



In other words, chill!

I agree, some people seem to think the E.R. is a doctor's office. I have only been to the E.R. one time in the past year when when I had an asthma attack and my rescue inhaler wasn't helping me at all, the last time I had to take my daughter was a few years ago when she was throwing up and having diarrhea and her doctor was so booked up that she couldn't even be seen that day and I was told to take her there since she was getting dehydrated and weak. I would just ignore the ignorant fools.

Well, technically, hospitals would rather it be called ED (Emergency Department) because it is a department, more than a room.



1. An ER is for life threatening or otherwise serious accidents/injuries.



2. I am an nurse. I have called an ambulance for my child once, which was for respiratory distress.  Otherwise, I use urgent care clinics for the "urgent, but not emergent" things that I can't fix myself and can't get in to see our regular doctor.



3. If said ignorant fool is complaining to me I'll ask them if they'd like directions to the nearest urgent care clinic.  Otherwise, I'll ask them to look up the word "triage" in a dictionary.  If they got majorly in my face, I'd call hospital security.



4. After they look up "triage" in the dictionary, you borrow said dictionary and look up the word "assault".



As to why people use ER/ED as a doctor's office or an urgent care clinic, I think it comes down to convenience and insurance.  The ER can't turn anyone away, regardless of inabilityto pay.  I am hoping that the "Minute Clinics" and other easy-access, low cost clinics will help reduce the burden on the ER/ED staff.  I agree, it's completely out of control.

Well, I agree with you. I have taken my son to the ER once, when he probably didnt need to go, because he was crying incessantly, and I didnt know what was wrong. It turned out to be just a severe ear infection, but just in case I didnt want to wait 2 days(he was born with respiratory distress, and on oxygen). However, if someone who had a child who was seriously ill, I would graciously agree to wait. In fact, I would insist. I dont know why people are so rude, but I hope all is well with your daughter, and that people would understand that sometimes the world doesn't revolve around them.

I've taken my kids to the ER for major asthma attacks where they couldn't breathe well enough to complete a sentence and needed to be put on oxygen, broken bones, and cuts that needed stitches.  Even in the first instance, I went prepared with books and toys for my daughter because scary as her condition was, I knew it was always possible that someone would be even more critical and we might have to wait (though in those cases, we never did, and got ushered ahead of the people who were waiting to be seen for other things).  For the breaks and stitches, I was prepared to camp out for hours -- and did.



But look, most parents are at the ER because their pediatrician suggested it or they are genuinely scared (rightly or wrongly) that there's something desperately wrong with their child.  And a few are there because they lack any health insurance and don't have any primary care doctor for their child.  I don't begrudge any of those people the right to be at the ER.  The ER staff is there to triage and make sure that people get seen in the right order.  (Usually.  A friend of mine went in complaining of desperately bad stomach pain and they told him it wasn't urgent so he needed to wait.  He went back and told them again, and they told him to sit down and be quiet and that he didn't understand the nature of triage.  On his way back to his seat they finally took notice of him when he suddenly passed out from his ruptured appendix.  Sometimes people who don't look like there's anything that wrong with them really do have something that wrong with them.....  It's possible that that kid with the cold at the ER came there after a febrile seizure or who knows what else.  I wouldn't be too quick to assume).



But it sounds like the comments might have seemed personal to you at the hospital.  And I can relate to being mad if someone's suggesting that your very sick daughter doesn't deserve immediate attention.  Hope she's doing better.

Any organizations that encourage self-confidence rather than competition in children?



My daughter is only 6 years old and I can't believe how badly she puts herself down everyday.  It really worries me, she has no reason to put herself down, and get's so much praise from her family.  I just don't know what to do.  I want to find an extracurricular activity she can do that will not worsen the problem. I thought about putting her in girl scouts, but I had a really bad experience with girl scouts when I was a kid- having the opposite effect on my self esteem.  I feel like she would freak out if I put her in sports, she is really a sore looser and a little too competitive.  Any ideas?

Believe it or not, karate classes are great for kids.  It gives them physical movement, respect for themselves and others and focuses on self-discipline.  You may not be comfortable with that for your daughter, Yoga also offers same, and you could possible attend together.  If your area has an Arts Center, they have classes for a nominal fee that will encourage your child's self-expression and creativity.

Id take a look at the praise she's getting.  Use wording like "you should be proud of yourself" versus "Im proud of you" this builds more of an inner confidence versus trying to please someone else.  Also make sure specific things are praised versus "good job"



Then look at what she enjoys doing, and go from their.  If its something like art, just sign up for a simple beading or project class at Michaels.  Or start of with an individual sport, like swimming, where you are trying to beat your own bests.

Girl scouts really is different now, than when I was growing up. I have 2 of my girls in it and they absolutely LOVE it! All the girls are very encouraging of one another and the skills they learn are fantastic! As far as the sports go, I really would just ask her if there is a sport she is interested in. Explain to her that it is about having FUN- find a recreational team, not a competitive one. My girls are in soccer and no, they don't always win but its not a big deal. Both teams celebrate eachother for just playing! They really don't even keep score. Even if she is a sore loser or very competitive, she will learn that its not the end of the world, the more she is exposed to it!

This question just breaks my heart! You must be a good person already if you can even ask this,honey. The best thing I have found is to treat others exactly as you want them to treat you.In every situation that comes along,ask yourself how you would like to be talked to,responded to,helped out,encouraged or corrected.Then, respond that exact way to them. It's a balancing act to treat others well without letting yourself get stepped on, though.So try to treat yourself well,too!

Check with your local utilities companies:  Most have assistance programs for those struggling with their utilities.  Also, check with your local Department of Family and Children's services - food stamps could definitely put some relief on your budget.



Don't be embarrassed to ask for help.  It's not a 'handout' if you actually work (or have worked) and pay (paid) taxes that help support these programs.

How did/do you punish your children when they lie?



Yesterday two glasses got broken in my house, due to my girls kicking a soccer ball in the living room. I have told them several times not to do this. I went to use the restroom, and I heard it happen. My girls are four and six. They quickly went and hid the soccer ball, and when I asked what happened they told me the cat knocked them off the Table lol. I knew this was not true and once they figured that out (after about four more lies) they told me and their father the truth. Now we would not punish for a true accident, but this one could of been avoided by just obeying us, and we do not spank usually unless extreme disrespect or lying is involved. So, they both got to take a trip to the bedroom with their daddy and got spankings. Is spanking the most common way to punish lying? How do you punish lying? Do you think Amanda and Jordan deserved this, it was a small lie but a lie nonetheless?

When i was little, my parents would ask me to stick my tongue out to prove i wasn't lying, as they told me your tongue turned black if you lied. This obviously only works when they are small and know not to just look in the mirror. So at least that way you will know if they are definitely lying or not. But all kids lie, its part of growing up!

It is important to discipline your children when they have done wrong. The type of punishment is merely a parent's choice. The key is when punishing your children the understand the importance of what they have done wrong. Put more emphasis on the misdeed rather than the punishment itself.

First off-remember that really well behaved,well-loved children lie.They usually all try it at one point.Probably spanking isn't the way to go,because the reason children lie in this situation is to avoid punishment-they are afraid.So,if you can teach them that they don't need to be afraid of you and their Dad,they will learn to trust you and come to you with bigger "wrongs" as they grow up.Try having them pay for what they broke,and to give them an example of the harm lies cause.Also-it's hard not to take lying as a personal reflection of your parenting skills.It hurts when they lie to you,until you remember that this is a "teachable moment",and it's how they turn out at the end that matters more than this one incident.What will they take away from this lesson?

When I was a child, we (my six sisters and I) got spanked.  SOmetimes we got beaten, too.  It only encouraged us to become more crafty, (sneaky) and more creative with the lies.  It didn't teach us anything but fear and resentment.



When I was raising my children, I continued with spanking, but MY kids didn't give a darn if they got spanked.  They were determined to do what they wanted regardless of what I said.



Then I got smart.  I realized that if I were to continue with the spankings, and the yelling, my house would be just like the house I grew up in.  Everything always in chaos, somebody always crying, being afraid to come home from school....you get the picture.



So, I tried to 'let the punishment fit the crime'.  If they lied, then both kids lost privileges until the guilty one admitted. (no tattling was allowed).  Then I would sit down and with them and give them punishment options from a list.  They would choose their own punishment, (none of which were pleasant), that usually consisted of chores.



Of course, one time I got fed up and told my kids that we were going to go somewhere really special. I got them all excited and gave a time of the day we were going to do it.  WHen the time came, they were asking why we weren't leaving.... Then I said, "Oh, I'm sorry!  I Lied!"  They got the point.

Get out of here -  we all have Bridget days including your friends! They have the same sort of days you do, it's just that you've never seen them like it. You've seen the pictures they put on the net with celebrities caught on camera without makeup etc. See, no different to us everyday folks either.



Look at it this way if you look as though you've just been through a hedge backwards, then your kiddie has been having a great time!

Its not just you. if you manage to look half descent most days your doing better than me. at 20 all my friends are ALWAYS immaculately dressed with hair and make up perfect and well, i just don't have the time to make myself look like that everyday. I settle for the casual mum look most days. the jeans and a t shirt (probably covered in something that your not too sure what it is) hair tied up or possibly washed and straightened but then held back with clips because just as i was finishing up we had an 'emergency' i had to deal with. make up is something you do for VERY special occasions. and every time i look in the mirror and see the tired face looking back at me i take once glance to the side, see my beautiful daughter (who always looks brilliant) and i think about what a brilliant mum I am and how she doesn't care how i look doing it, and well if other people want to look at me and think im a tramp because i put my daughter before my looks then that's their problem, NOT MINE.

Just wanted some advice from strangers... (really really long)?



I know that Y!A is definitely not the best place to go for advice, but I would like to get a few opinions from outside, ininvolved parties on my situation--to broaden my perspective a bit. I'm 21 years old, almost 22, and 11w2d pregnant. I work full time at a great company, pay all my bills myself, and take care of what needs to be taken care of. I quit smoking and drinking as soon as I learned of the pregnancy, and mostly just go to work and come home to rest. My boyfriend is the opposite. He is not working. Hasn't worked much the whole 3 yrs we've been together. It never bothered me before, I don't mind being the breadwinner usually. But now he has a family to take care of. I can't make the money I am now on maternity leave, and I would like to be part time closer to the end of my pregnancy. He is trying, sort of half-assed to find work, but I guess it's better than nothing. We recently learned we have til the end of the month to find a new place to live (long story), and I'm not sure what to do here. I'm sick of being the only one doing anything--coming home from working a 10 hr day just to hear him complain about how bored he's been all day and then proceed to take my car to stay out with his friends until all hours of the night. But I also don't want to do this alone--I want to have a family. He can be really good to me at time, and he does my laundry, cleans the house, cooks me dinner, etc etc etc--he is sure to tell me I'm beautiful even when I know I look awful. Emotionally, he's a pretty decent boyfriend, mostly. But, also, as I said, he can be very selfish and tends to only want to do what makes him happy--if he wants to go out and get wasted with his buddies and leave me at home all alone, then he will. And he won't see any wrong in it. Anyway, my question is this: when we move out of our place, I have the option to go live with family, which, although is probably more stress than it's worth, is free rent to save money for the baby. But if I do that, my boyfriend isn't even allowed within 10 feet of my house (another long story), so if I choose that option I will be going through this pregnancy alone, and possibly raising my child without a father. And as I said, I want a family. I'm not prepared to do this on my own. So, which is the smarter choice--moving back home, living for free, leaving the boyfriend, and being all alone in an extremely stressful enviroment for my pregnancy OR paying higher rent to stay with the boyfriend and the hope of him someday making a contribution and growing up, all the while scraping money for food, barely getting by, home alone most nights while he's out with his friends?
I'm lost here. Both situations have such strong negatives and positives. If anyone read this whole thing, please let me know what you would do.
Thanks!

I think you know in your heart what the better choice is. Get rid of the stress, go home, save your money, and set up a strong foundation for your baby.



I know you want a family, but there is no such thing as a 'perfect' or 'traditional' family. The best home environment you can give your babe is one of stability. You know he is not going to get his act together anytime soon. If he does decide to get himself together, get a place, and a steady job, let him do it on his own. In the meantime do what is best for yourself & the baby. Be selfish right now. You and your baby deserve the best. Good luck.

i would go live with your family.  just because he's not allowed around that house doesn't mean you can't go see him sometimes.  he might really need the wake up call.



if he sees that you are serious about this and he can't just depend on you for everything it might help him to grow up a little bit.  if he doesn't come around then it's not worth the lifestyle you will have to live in to stay with him.  a child does not need that stress in their life.  good luck with everything.  a lot can change in 9 months!

How about this...move back home UNTIL he can find a job, prove he can keep it, then you guys can get a place together? He may be a great boyfriend emotionally...but there are other areas he needs to improve upon before I'd consider living with him. If he's lazy now what makes you think anything will change when the baby comes....you'll be run down and exhausted and will need the extra help. He needs to find a job to help provide for this child and I don't think you should continue to put a roof over his head until he contributes to the bank account.

I think you definitely have your head screwed on.  I think the most important thing here is for your baby to have both of it's parents.  Your boyfriend does sound like he needs a kick up the butt but he is not a complete a s s.  It sounds like you will be able to make it work.  You must put your foot down with your BF (bring on the water works if you have too).  It is so easy to sit back and relax when you are used to your partner paying the way etc. (when they never complained about it in the past).  The point is now is that your lives have changed BIG TIME and he needs to accept that fact.  You can no longer support the family by yourself and you must put it to your boyfriend that he must find a job or you will consider moving back in with your folks.  Either way, your baby should have the father in it's life.  I wouldn't worry too much about it.  The fact is, he needs to grow up.  At least you have a caring boyfriend (from what you have written), he just needs a kick up the a s s.  Most men do at some point (sorry guys).  If I were you I would have the BIG discussion.  Don't listen to the people on here that will say 'leave him, he sounds like a waster', the most important issue here is that you BOTH have a child and you must work together to make your babies life a happy one.  Believe me, it is very hard to do this, if the parents are separated. KICK HIS A S S!!!

Your boyfriend has already demonstrated to you what he's about.  He's selfish.  He lacks maturity.  If you stay with him, I'm sorry to say, you will be doing it alone anyway.  He's not interested in being a responsible adult.  One of the other answers here said "People generally don't change"...they're absolutely correct.  Your boyfriend is getting a free ride with barely any effort on his part.  Your family has reasons for not wanting him around, and I'd bet they are valid reasons.
Go home to your family.  They love you and have your best interest at heart.  You have the responibility of a child now placed in your hands, you must do what is best for that child!
Best wishes for you, dear.  You've got a difficult situation ahead of you.  Your family can give you the support you both will need.

Move to your home with family and bring up your child in a safe environment. Moving away from your boyfriend will probably coax him to take up some productive work and take up your responsibility. Tell your boyfriend frankly that this is a stop gap arrangement and in heart you want him to work and take care of you.

You are enabling your boyfriend to stay at home and then go with his buddies and leave you alone.  As far as telling you how great you look, is a way of making sure he has a place to live.  I don't know what stress you will have with your family, but you will have just as much stress with your boyfriend. I say move with your family, kick the boyfriend to the curb, and start over. He can still be a father without being with you. He sure isn't a good guy, if he is willing to let you support him and then not stay home and spend time with you. You will not be the first or the last person to raise a child without the other parent. Remember what your child sees, is what he will become, so as soon as the child is born, go back to work, find good daycare and be the best Mom you can. Do not let another man move in with you until you have a ring on your finger, and he has a paycheck to help pay the bills. You will make it and you will be a good Mom. You now have to think of what is best for the child.

I tend to agree with the majority here.  I think you should go back home.  Your BF sounds like he is a lazy bum (sorry) and it doesn't sound like he has any sort of inclination to get a job and be a man.  Think of the arguments down the road about it - is that what you want your child to be around?  Go to your parents, where the baby will be in a loving, safe environment.  If your BF wants you back, he'll get a job and a home and prove that he will be a good companion and daddy.  If he gets his act together, you can move back with him.  But in the meantime, the baby should be your first priority.  Suck it up and go back home!!!

Im so sorry to hear this. So sorry. Even though you've worked hard and paid your bills and youve given up smoking/drinking youre still soooo young. Your message wasnt easy to read so I cant imagine what choices face you now. I think the first step would be to calmly talk to your partner realistically about the options. The most important person in the whole equation is your baby. Babies cost money and you have to sacrifice. Families are there to help and its their duty to be there for you. I dont know why your partner cant step foot near your family but you have to look at the whole situation and not be so naive about things. As great as your boyfriend is emotionally unfortunatly that isnt enough. And as much as you probably dont want to rest...you need to ...and comfortably. You need help....at 21 you cant expect to do it all alone if you have a family to help. Talk to your partner and sugest that you should move back home for a while and try to leave your house to see him and assure him that he will be part of the babies life but he needs to sort himself out because you cant do it alone. If he gets a job Now NOW NOW and sticks with it then you can get a flat together and make it work but it doesnt sound like he is so you have to think whats best. Your boyfriend is so young men dont grown up antil they ar 35!!! and he doesnt sound ready to be a father...does he know what that means?? Why do you think so many kids are messed up today? You have to do the right thing. Go home and see if your boyfriend will change if he does and offers you a better life then move out ...you are an adult. Humans make mistakes but its how we learn from them. Ignorence is making the same mistakes over and over. Also in a relationship there MUST be BALANCE. You must be helping eachother. Good Luck xxxxx Really do whats right but dont stress out because you will harm your baby stay calm and things will get easier. When I was younger I had to move back in with my family after years of living with my boyfriend (my mum isnt easy)...it was such a tough move but I saved money and stayed out of there way as much as I could and got on with things. Just because you move back in with your family to save money doesnt mean you have to loose contact with the father of your child. XXXXXX BIG HUGS XXX The truth is we all build our own destiny and you have to do what right for your child....Theres a film called 'the pursuit of happiness' and shows men what it takes to be a father through all adversities. If I was preganant I know Id do anything for my child ANYTHING to make sure they would be ok and if there was anyone out there hurting there future I wouldnt have allow it. Youre going to be a mother! xxxxxxxxx

Do you parent differently in front of others?



We went to my mother in laws house at the weekend, and my husband commented on how quiet it was there and his mum asked why it was noisy at home.  He said that I am always singing, making stupid noises etc. with our daughter and it occured to me that I am different in the way I parent at home - we have songs for bathtime, for nappy time, for getting dressed etc. but I never do these in front of others - mainly because my singing is so bad!  Haha.  My husband is different too, in that if our daughter has a tantrum at home over nothing, he will leave her to it as long as she is in a safe place but in front of others he will pick her up and try and calm her down.  How about you, do you parent differently in front of others?

Only in front of my mother. She is so unauthoriatative and "gentle" that she has very openly (crying) expressed her distaste in some of my approaches. When my oldest was almost 3, he started grabbing people's glasses off of their faces and I ended up smacking his hand. She cried and of course that made me a mixture of angry/hurt and astonished. I'm not a mean mother but I don't tolerate alot of the things that she would've.

Yes I do.  Mainly bc some of it is silly or weird.  Or things are handled differently bc other people are around.  When he was little and stated a tantrum in a store I took him outside.  At home if he wanted to throw himself around and act silly I let him go.  Mostly just stuff like this.  Also I give him hell under my breath when we are out.  I threaten to take away toys etc but do so more quietly.  I don't scream at him at home but I keep it more discreet when others are around.  Mainly again its not really any ones business but ours.

Well when I pick James up from preschool, I usually just go in a pair of jeans and whatever random shirt i can find to throw on. Sometimes its a sloppy over-sized tee, sometimes its a more fitted, nice blouse.  Whatever the case, I dont dress to impress the other moms.  I try to make myself look nice if I am going somewhere special, but other then that, I dont really care.

Holy old cow- clean and neat is the best I can hope for at this point! More importantly though,from reading your posts on here,I can tell that you need to BE KINDER TO YOURSELF,Girl! It doesn't matter what those other women do.Do what works best for you and your babies. And puhleeeeze give yourself a break- we are all trying to be good moms,and most of the moms I know are doing so much better than they think. My mother was a farm mom,too.I don't have any recollection of what she wore to pick me up from school,I just remember those huge smiles and happy hugs at the end of long,yukky school days...

I live in a predominantly blue-collar community.  If my daughter misses the bus, I throw on a sweatshirt over my jammies, run my fingers thru my hair, and go!



Some other moms are all "done up" and yes, I've received some looks, but I don't care!!!  The funniest is at the beach (I live in a lake community), where some women feel a need to wear all their diamonds and gold.  I suppose they think they look rich, but I think they look ridiculous (who wears all their jewelry to the beach?).  After a day of painting or housecleaning, when I run to the milk store, I just pick up and run and I really don't care who I see!!



I grew up in a very wealthy community, where women had to wear their minks to go to the grocery store.  I found that to be so shallow, that I vowed to never be like that.  Having seen both sides of this coin, I choose to be who I am.  If people don't like it, it's their problem, not mine.  The women in this town have seen me both ways anyway.



Be who you are and to heck with everyone else!!

Ha! I hardly ever dress up for anything! I think I own one pair of pants that are NOT jeans and my best shirts are maternity shirts that I just bought recently. They make them so nice these days. lol But I wear jeans with them. I hate dresses and I don't own any heels.

Stop beating yourself up.. It is a normal feeling not to want to raise a child when you are a teenager.  I love my kids more than anything but I remember thinking the same way when I was your age.  You had no way of understanding fatherly love at that time so stop feeling bad and get glad! :)

You feel that way because you are 16 and now have a lot of responsibility.



You were confused and scared, that's why you even thought about abortion..now that she is here, you realize you love her and feel guilty for thinking that way.



Just know that you never followed through with that choice, so you have nothing to feel guilty about.

You feel guilty. But I will suggest stop looking at the past. You are human and we make mistakes! I'm sure your daughter is lovely. Now is the time to do all you can for your lil one, and make sure that you support the mother as well. Congrats!! I'm very happy for you. And although you are young you made the right choice of keeping the baby instead of turning to abortion. No one looks at a baby and say ' darn, I should of got that abortion'.  Be proud of being a father!

My 6 year old daughter would probably say anything with nuts in it. She's allergic, which makes Halloween a challenge for her. I always buy a bunch of peanut-free treats for her and we swap 1 nut treat for 1 peanut-free treat.

My kids each received a religious tract titled "The Halloween Rescue".  ::sigh::



It was about some poor kid named Adam, whose parents were too cheap to get him a REAL costume (so he had to cut up a sheet to make a ghost costume).  Adam wanted REAL candy for Halloween, instead of apples and such (which aren't safe anyway, right?).  The poor kid had to walk alone through a dark forest, and ended up getting stuck in some briers.  His lazy Dad sends out Adam's brother, Jesse, to find Adam, instead of going out himself, thereby managing to get two sons torn up by brambles (instead of just one).



In the end, poor Adam gets *nothing* for Halloween.  Not even apples.  The moral of the story: We must often travel through the dark and forbidding forest in search of the good stuff, but if we get stuck in a prickly spot we had better hope we have an older brother to get us out of it, or else we're totally screwed.  At least, I think that was the moral of the story.  I'm not quite sure.



Anyhoo, religious tracts don't taste nearly as good as candy.  (o_O)

Hopefully life will ease up a bit soon, and I will return to Y!A to plague everyone again.  For now, I'm off to try and eat a few more religious tracts.  ::lol::

If she asks what you did you say. " I wasn't driving safely, and I could have hurt other people by not being safe"

Tell her the truth-Mom did something wrong and has to have a time-out. She will understand this,and it leaves you with the ability to explain consequences to her. That's valuable!And you are right; you shouldn't listen to anyone lecturing you-we all do stupid things. Reassure her that you'll still love her when she does something wrong,and forgive yourself.too,okay? I always remind myself that "mistake" is a word that can really be interpreted "life lesson".

I think that this may be a very good time to teach responsibility to her, and tell her the truth, but put it in terms that she can relate to.  You don't necessarily have to tell her what you did, but you can say that you did something wrong, and that you are getting punished for it.  Also, make sure she knows you are coming back and that you are not abandoning her, that it's only a temporary situation.  Remember, this could be traumatic for her as well.  Best of luck to you, I hope your 10 days goes by quickly and without incident, and that you never have to end up in this position again, but I think you should be honest with your daughter.

Your daughter is old enough to overhear conversation and understand.  Why take a chance that this will happen and she'll know she was deceived?  Be honest.  That's my advice.  What better opportunity to explain your bad decision and its result?  Mommy made a mistake, she has to suffer the consequences.  You're sorry she has to suffer along with you.  You hope she'll never be as foolish as you have been.  You'll see her soon.  Best wishes.

Tell her the truth. She knows you drink, and this will teach her that you are accountable for your actions. Maybe she will also learn that what you did was wrong, and she will not want to do it when she gets old enough. Maybe you don't want to hear about it, but so what you not only screwed up yourself, but now it effects your Daughter.

Also yesterday I fell over the broom when I was going to the basement.  I moved it but put it on the stairs.  Tripped on it a second time and bashed my forearm on the wall.  And I know have a nice lump under the skin that really hurts.  Then I yell that the broom is trying to kill me.  Sigh that was insult to injury.  Cause now I looked doubly stupid.

Locked my keys inside my office.  Normally this would not be an issue, however the only key that opens my office in the entire building is on my key chain.



After trying to jimmy the door open, I decided to climb through the ceiling (smart move not).  Once I was over my office I tried to remove one of the ceiling tiles.  At that exact moment the tile underneath me gave way.  I fell a good 15 feet and hit the ground hard.  Yet, I did get my keys and made a copy that day  :-)

I was going to replace the bulb in our chandelier (it has these globes that have to be unscrewed). I went to unscrew one and I wasn't holding on to the globe, just the screw in part and of course it came crashing down and I had to order a new one on-line.

Dumbest?? Honey I am seriously the DUMBEST person you'll ever met.



- I went to the shop today, with Hubby & son's. I get out of the car, and started getting the kids out. Hubby walks over and grabs my butt. I went to tell him it wasn't the time or place, then I saw the pad he had in his hands.



- I jammed my finger in the gate to the south paddock. Ripped my middle nail off again. Funnily enough I was telling my 3yo's not to play with it, or it will happen to them, then I go and do it.



- I lectured my Husband a few months ago, telling him not to set the cot up down stairs, because it's too big to fit threw the nursery door. I thought I'd get the other one out of the barn ready to put our youngest in. I set it up in the lounge and had to undo it all, because I couldn't get it out!!



- I don't tolerate running in the house. I often run to the kids if they start the *hurt* cry. I fall over every time.

Monday was my husbands birthday, so I got up early and made cinnamon rolls.  I spent a ton of time making them the way he likes them, and had it planned to come out of the oven right before he had to leave for work so he can take them with him.  When I took them out of the oven I accidentally touched the pan with the hand that wasn't covered, which resulted in the pan of cinnamon rolls to fly across the kitchen, smacking into the back wall.  I wasn't injured (too much), but it did ruin his birthday breakfast.



Yesterday I was leaning in the backseat of the car, putting my daughter in her car seat.  It was really windy and my hair ended up in my face and mouth so I stood up next to the car, whipped my head around trying to move the hair out of my face, and smacked the back of my head on the open door.  I guess it was pretty funny to watch because my 2 year old was laughing!

This is gross, but my family will never let me forget it.  I have a false tooth, it fits over my own tooth and was cemented into place.  This tooth came loose, so whenever I eat, I take the tooth out so I don't accidentally swallow it.  I did this like I always do, placing the tooth on my plate.  I got up the the middle of eating to get a drink, and suddenly my tooth is gone!
I got down on the floor and couldn't find it.  Didn't notice my dog was sitting at the table in my chair.......
Yeah, the dog ate my tooth!!  Needless to say, the next day having to examine the dog poop to find my tooth (with rubber gloves on).  Then having to take it to the dentist to have it autoclaved....but there was NO WAY I was going to put out another $800.00 for a new tooth.

I am having problems with my boyfriend dealing with his ex and their newborn child...?



He and I have been together on and off for three years.  While we were not together, he dated a woman and she got pregnant.  Since then, we are trying to make things work.  Now that their child is born (In July) she using that innocent child against him for everything. (She still wants to be with him and will do anything imagineable to keep us apart.) He signed the birth certificate, but she tells him he can only see his son if he comes and stays with them at her house, tells him if he wants to see him it has to be on her time and when she wants and where, everytime he asks to see him she says no, that she is busy, but when she asks him, if he can't right that minutes she tells him he will never see his son,that he is chosing me over his son (when if he knew he could see him, he would stay at his house and I would let him see his son without me being around, she just calls and wants him to do it RIGHT THEN, usually when she knows we are together.)  He is in a tough position because he really wants to be there for and see his son, so feels like if he has to be around her to see him he will, but I feel it is unacceptable that she has to be there and will not let him see his own son for a couple hours on his own. (He is already a father of two girls, 3 and 4, and he is a great dad, it is not that she has any reason to worry about him with their child, it is that she is using their son to get her way with him.)  What makes things even worse is that he is worried that it is possible the baby could not be his, but she will not get a paternity test and he can not afford one right now...What should we do???  He does not have the money right away to hire a lawyer, and wants to see his son now.  What is a resolution to this?

There is no cure, therefore no speed up process for the cold. Treat the symptoms for better comfort. Hot or very warm drinks no junk food as this ruins the system. Keep warm in a not too dry atmosphere.

If he is feverish, do not bundle him up a lot. Give him a cool, wet wash cloth to put on his forehead because he needs to cool down. Give him some cough medicine for the cough and put some Vick's Vap o Rub on his chest to help him breath easier. Give him lots of fluids like warm tea, orange juice and other juices with vitamin C. Keep him hydrated and cool with a fever.

Question about sons spying?



Hi, I am a mother to a boy who I have recently be catching spying on me in the bedroom and after showers. I'm sure he is just curious and wants to see a female naked.



I just wanted some advice on what to do. Should I confront him about it or just let it go unnoticed. I don't have any problems with showing him my body either. I'd rather him not go online and start looking around.



Any advice you could give would be great.

My family is very open and since we have never made a big deal about it no one cares who happens to be nude or changing. I would say to ask him if he needs anything next time you catch him and see if he has any questions.

It is normal for kids to be curious of the opposite sex. Who better to find out answers from then their parents! I would make it a point to let him know you know he is there. See if he needs something, then mention it is not polite to "spy on" people. Don't make too big a deal out of it.

Seeing you accidentally is one thing-there's no harm in that.But the issue here that needs to be addressed immediately is the spying.It's not only not okay,as an adult he can get into extreme trouble for it. Tell him how serious it is to invade someone's privacy.I explained it to my guys like this-" Watching someone when they don't know it is a form of stealing.What you are taking from them is the sense of feeling safe and free to be alone.It is also a form of lying,as they don't know you are there and in families,we trust each other.I need to trust that you will tell me when you are coming near.Just like you don't want me to watch you in private moments,I don't want you to watch me in private moments." It's so important that you establish boundaries now.He'll thank you later,and so will other people he's around,because boundary issues come up every day.

Depending on how old he is, talk to him that he needs to respect your privacy as you will for him. Then start locking your doors when you undress and shower.

Should we get back together?



we have a daughter together and she is the best thing to ever happen to me. We have been together for 5 yrs and he cheated on me that's why we broke up. he cheated right after i gave birth. He really wants another try but i am not sure if i can trust him or should i give him a chance. I still love him. He and are young but that's not an excuse for cheating. he is over everyday too see our little girl Alexa Jade and he asked me if i will give him a chance to be a family becuase he loves me and was dumb and he admitted he made a mistake. he ended the relationship cause he only wants to be with me and relized what he had done and wants to earn my trust back.

I would suggest that you get therapy- and see where it leads you.  You can forgive him, but remember that trust has to be earned.  For the one that says cheaters are always cheaters- that is not always true. However, be very careful.  You want your man to be there for your daughter, but you also want someone that can be trusted.

I think you should give him another chance but take it slow. Don't jump into anything and don't take him back just for your little girl because you may never be hapy. It may seem selfish but if you two got together and you didn't really want the relationship in the first place, it will be much harder on her if you two split up when she got like 13 years old or something. Do what you think is right and what makes you happy. But I think almost everyone deserves a 2nd chance.

I think you should take him back, but with conditions, and go at the pace you decide. For starters I think the both of you need to see a marraige councellor, so you can learn how to trust one another again. Don't let him move in yet, but date him, let him take you out and woo you, this should be done once a week. After a few months if things are still going well, allow him to move in. Good luck.

Parents...how would handle this situation (a little long)?



Last night i had a 13 year old girl come to me practically in tears because she had a really bad fight with her mom and she was kicked out of the house. The fight was about the girl's sister's boyfriend living there and how he makes her feel uncomfortable (not in a sexual way -- just angry and depressed). She was trying to tell her mom about how him being there affects her but her mom basically said "If you don't like him living here, you can get the hell out."



For some background information. Her sister is 19, almost 20 and her boyfriend is 22 and almost 23. He's been living in their house for a good 3 years and he graduated college a year and a half ago. Her sister is 3 hours away in college but he didn't want to move because he has a good steady job here so her mom, without any consideration for her youngest, said he's more than welcome to stay as long as he needs. For the first 2 and a half years of him living there, while everyone else was gone, he would find the 13 year old and pick on her. Scream in her ear, push her around, hit her...it was just non stop. And her sister and the boyfriend would gang up on her when their mom wasn't there too and end up screaming at her. She would try to tell her mom but her mom would never believe her because she put a lot more effort into believing and respecting her sister and the boyfriend.Finally it got to the point where the 13 year old said she would just go live with her dad (who lives a good 24 hours away - divorced) and her mom didn't want him to have her so she told the boyfriend he was not to interact with her. But it's hardly gone down at all. She's the happiest girl when he's not around but as soon as he walks in the door she deflates kind of. She is to the point of being really depressed and she's always angry and sad when he's around. But her mom would rather kick her out of the house than ask him to move out. And it's not like he doesn't have the money, he gets paid 500 dollars a week from his job so he can afford to get an apartment or house, he's just too d*mn lazy to do the things having one entails.



She wants me to help her figure it our and do something but i honestly don't  know what i can do. I'm only 17 years old and sure, i had a ton of problems with my mom and i moved out at 16 and in with my boyfriend but i would definitely not suggest that to her. Especially at this age. It's tough being out on your own and she won't be able to handle it.



Any suggestions on what i can do for her?



</question>



<additional details>



He can't live with his parents because they treated him very badly also, that's how he ended up at their house in the first place...his parents kicked him out.



And her mom isn't getting anything out of it. She covers all of his expenses...the only he pays for is stuff for his girlfriend, and yes...i'm sure they're not doing anything in a sexual manner.



I can't go to my parents because i'm not in contact with either of them.



And her mom is very back and forth. She kicks her out one minute...but then is asking her her back the next.



She stayed in my apartment last night and her mom has already been calling about when she's coming back and it's only 9:30. I have contacted her dad to let him know what's going on. And he does love her and wanted her to come stay but her mom got custody and hasn't been following visitation orders.

report her mother.....They won't take her away...they will come and look into the way things are at the house.  They will continue to monitor the place and make suggestions on how to change things.



If things don't change or get better for the child they would place her with her father.  I know you said it's not sexual, but it sounds like maybe it is.  These are normal reactions to someone who is being sexually abused....also for her to throw out there it isn't sexual could be a sign it is....not saying it is but there is a chance it really is. Best thing is to get children's services involved.  Best of luck.

She is being abused. He is an adult and she is a child, that is her home.
I hate to say it, but you will need to get another adult involved ( like one of your parents ) they will need to call DSS or Child services to get some action going...
Something is not right there...either the mother likes the extra income or maybe she is doing something else with him? either way something needs to be done.
That child needs a home...please help her as much as you can!

I would talk with her father if the mother is kicking her out of the house i am sure he would not mind her staying with him just make sure he is going to be good to her. the mother does not need to know where the daughter is if she is the one to kick her out the mother might not even care.



Make sure the father gets paper work stating that the mother kicked the child out so he covers his track. other wise that will be a messy business.



Have the girl sit down with a guidance counselor at the school and let them know what is going on in the home.



I know what is like being kicked out of the house by my mother make sure you always have paper work following every incident because you could be caught in the mix of a big debate the mother does not sound very stable so I would not send the girls back.

well it seems that she has no choice but to move out but the question is where. even if cps is called and they remove they will send her to her dads so that is where i would say. i think if it was me i would some how tape what is going on when she isnt around and then goto the mom with the proof. im sure she thinks that the daughter is making it up.  so first get proof and if she still is on thier side then tell her to move with the dad at least till she is 18.

At 13, I assume the girl is enrolled in public school.  You can contact her school and ask to talk to the school social worker.  Once you inform them of the situation, they are legally obligated to look into all allegations of child abuse.  And yes, allowing someone else to hit and torment your child is abuse, as is kicking a 13 year old out of the house (totally illegal!)

My kids have never had a pet frog. We had a frog during the summer months that would come on our porch every few nights to catch bugs, but I think our dog chased it off. They eat bugs and like to be in water sometimes depending on what type of frog it is. Let the frogs stay in your back yard, but roam around freely as they please. Tell your kids the frogs may leave, but that is ok because they do not need to be caged up. It is their nature to go about where ever they feel free to. They like bugs to eat.

I have not - but I would advise you to call a vet or do some searching online to find out what type of frog it is, and then what is required for care.  Is it really a frog or a toad?  Does it need heat or cold?  Does it require a water environment?  What does it eat and how often?



If you do not find out this information, chances are you are just slowing killing an animal.



I think you got 'attacked' because it really isn't a good idea to take an animal from a natural environment and putting it in an unnatural one.  It would be like saying, there is a deer in our yard and we want it to be a pet.

Where I live, to keep on inside you need a reptile licence. It's also illegal to take a wild animal, and domesticate it, unless you have a license to do so. In some places, you can go and catch tadpoles though.



I live on an Island State, and they are super strict what you can, and cannot keep.



Try ringing you local pet store, and finding out first if you do need a license to keep them.
Then hit the books on what to feed them. I've had very interesting pets over the years, and my local pet shop has been very helpful.
You'll also need to set the aquarium up.

We have kept a frog from out side it had gotten hit by a car but was still alive so we helped him get better. It was missing a leg, we kept him in a tank with moss we got from the pet store, not sure what kind of frog you have but most need a humid environment. I would suggest after you get one take it to a pet shop they will set you up with everything you need. The one we had ate pin head crickets and wax worms.

<question>



I am having problems with my boyfriend dealing with his ex and their newborn child...?



He and I have been together on and off for three years.  While we were not together, he dated a woman and she got pregnant.  Since then, we are trying to make things work.  Now that their child is born (In July) she using that innocent child against him for everything. (She still wants to be with him and will do anything imagineable to keep us apart.) He signed the birth certificate, but she tells him he can only see his son if he comes and stays with them at her house, tells him if he wants to see him it has to be on her time and when she wants and where, everytime he asks to see him she says no, that she is busy, but when she asks him, if he can't right that minutes she tells him he will never see his son,that he is chosing me over his son (when if he knew he could see him, he would stay at his house and I would let him see his son without me being around, she just calls and wants him to do it RIGHT THEN, usually when she knows we are together.)  He is in a tough position because he really wants to be there for and see his son, so feels like if he has to be around her to see him he will, but I feel it is unacceptable that she has to be there and will not let him see his own son for a couple hours on his own. (He is already a father of two girls, 3 and 4, and he is a great dad, it is not that she has any reason to worry about him with their child, it is that she is using their son to get her way with him.)  What makes things even worse is that he is worried that it is possible the baby could not be his, but she will not get a paternity test and he can not afford one right now...What should we do???  He does not have the money right away to hire a lawyer, and wants to see his son now.  What is a resolution to this?

Go to family court -  get a court ordered paternity test, and establish formal custody.  If it is that important he will figure out a way to get  a lawyer or even find some agencies that assist people in these situations but cant afford attorneys.

that is really unfair and selfish on her part. but the only thing i can think of is for him to take her to court to get joint custody. the judge will then assign visitation and there is nothing that she can do about it. but just be sure to be there for him. she is doing this on purpose, to test you. at least that is what it seems like to me.

You need to butt out. This is not your issue, it's his. And to save yourself a lot of heartache (kids will and should ALWAYS come before 'just a girlfriend') you should say goodbye to this guy. Not a man, but a guy. A man would have stayed with the mother of his child, and he has THREE children with different women??? No, he's not a man.



You should never think he will leave that woman and their child for you. He won't. Even if you get pregnant. He hasn't stayed with any one woman before, so why would you think you're the "one"? So spare yourself the heartache and say goodbye.

Depending on where you live, you may be able to go directly to the county courthouse and file a petition for visitation without hiring a lawyer (I have a friend who did this in NY and got visitation rights for his son!)  If his name is on the birth certificate, she would have to get a paternity test in order to remove it or to deny him his parental rights.



By the way, the man now has 3 kids and is not married to any of the moms - how could he be a "great dad"?  Great dads don't go around knocking up different women.



What is it that you see in this man?  I think it's time for you to sit down and make a list of your life priorities and goals.  Perhaps a counselor could help you recognize some self - destructive patterns.  This relationship is not going in a healthy direction, and I don't understand why you don't want a better life for yourself.



Not to mention, do you wish to get married and have kids someday?  Do you want to have those kids with someone whose already paying out child support to 3 other kids?  These are difficult questions, but you need to take this into consideration as you move forward.

Well number one-if the baby was just born this summer, I wouldn't let anyone take my child even the father by himself if he hasn't been around. I just would not trust someone with my baby. Especially if she is a new mother. Its still quite a young baby.



Secondly-Is he paying child support..? Since he is on the birth certificate, he should be-there also should be visitation set then. Theres nothing you can do except go to court. If he is on the birth certificate that baby is his-he still has to pay for it, he legally is the parent no matter the dna.



I would just forget about the situation-if you want to be with him, be with him but don't add extra stress to the situation and let him figure it out.



EDIT: You should know how to deal with this a little bit more, since you started dating him when he had a 1 and 2 year old. I'm sure their mother wasn't the most friendliest when their dad decided to date someone else either.

I dont think there is any solution to this. He has got himself in a pickle and your all mixed up in it. His ex is playing control games to get what she wants. He needs to try to be logical about the situation and not allow her to get a hugely negative reaction from him. The best option is to take the chick to court. Get the law to give him visitation rights. I know the world revolves around money that you say he doesn't have, but if this child is really important to him, he will find some cash. Get the dna test done first if that is really questionable. Then apply for rights with the court. And don't go getting knocked up in the mean time girl.

okay....I hate to even say this, because it sounds like you love him very much,and will only defend him....however, to me, a guy who has a 3 and a 4 year old by one person, and a brand new newborn by another, while then being with someone else completely different..is not a "Great Dad." unfortunately...if he doesn't have the money to pay for a lawyer for set custody rights, paternity test, as well as child support, then there is nothing he can do. Word of advice however......he better make sure that if he is paying her any money for the child that he has records of it,or better yet..that he does it through the court..or she could get him for back child pay....even if he did pay her..if there is no proof of it...she can claim he never did, and more than likely..the courts would believe her.



there was something else I wanted to add after reading one of the answers..I totally agree, I'm a mom of two, and I love my husband, and he is the only husband I've had, he is the father of both our children....however, when our babies were born...there was no way in hell that he was taking them anywhere alone when they were first born...in fact, I didn't even go out without them with me until they were past 5 months...and my now 15 month old, has never left my side...we mother are bears when it comes to our young, and we know..no one can do it better than mommy....so I can totally understand her only wanting him to come to her home to see the baby...after all if he can't afford a lawyer..how can he afford to take the baby with him for visits? can he afford a crib? a swing? a baby seat? is his car safe to have a baby in it? can he afford a car seat? a stroller? food? clothes at his own home? because if I was a single mom, and I was raising the baby...before the dad could take him, he would have to show some initiative..a good job, the baby's own room for overnight visits, decorated...to me if a child is going to have two homes....then they should be just that "homes" and what do children have at home? they're own room, usually decorated with they're favorite characters and toys, etc. they have they're own clothes at home, and they're own food at home....these are things that need to be considered. and then of course...if she's breast feeding, thats a whole other ballground. you have to ask yourself this question....what if it were you? a guy starts dating you...gets you pregnant, and says "oh, I'm going back to my ex girlfriend" and then you have to look at your boyfriend...if you had gotten pregnant, and he left you....would you feel confident enough for him to take the baby for visits? lots to consider than just feelings when a child is involved.

He needs to go to court and get an order for child support if he hasn't done so already voluntarily. This will show the court that he is trying to be a responsible father. Once that's done he can go to court to get visitation since he pays child support he now has that right.

He needs to get help from his family. I am sure his Mother would love to be part of the babies life.



The only way to resolve this is through court. He needs to file for custody and try to get some kind of joint custody. Not doing that will cause him to have problems obtaining it later. He needs to be responsible and pay for child support for the baby.



The only way to resolve this, like I said, is through court. The ex-girlfriend is using the baby as manipulation. He needs to sue her for custody, get a DNA test etc. I am almost 100% positive he can get a state represented attorney and not have to pay anything. He will have to pay for the DNA test.



Are you 100% sure she is pregnant and the baby is his? If she is being this manipulative she could be lying. If  he sued her for a paternity test she would HAVE to do it by law. So, it's his best option for that.



There's no way to resolve this except getting the state involved. Sorry to tell you. Don't settle out of court for some arrangement that she is just going to change at any time. Do it the right way for both of your sanity. Ask his mother/father for help. If they can't do it, research your state laws on how to obtain custody/child support.



Good luck

There is no cheap resolution to this situation. What he should do is go to court and request a paternity test. I'm sure the kid is his just based on what you have said so after he finds that out for sure he should request visitation and set up a child support plan through the court so he doesn't keep getting jerked by her.
It would be wise for him to take the initiative by going to court because generally, the court favors the needs of the mother and child over the father. If she beats him to the punch he may not be able to see his son for a long time and still be responsible for child support.
Part of being a good parent is doing the best you can for your child. Tell you boyfriend to get off his bum! Beg, borrow or steal whatever money he needs to hire an attorney and go through the courts. There is no other rational way to deal with an irrational person. Good luck.

go to the county courthouse and file for custody and child support. let the courts decide a reasonable agreement for time well spent with each parent. he'll have to pay about 100 bucks to file in court but you don't need an attorney to do it. it'll take about 2 months for something to go into place. i highly suggest paying the 400 bucks for a DNA test though just to be sure he doesn't start spending time with and paying for a child that isn't his (especially if they weren't exclusive). the judge will most likely do every other weekend with the non custodial parent, and he will have to pay child support. unless of course he's fighting for full custody and in which case HE can ask for child support from her. Just make sure he has an appropraite work schedule, home, income, etc. to prove he's a fit parent. The courts are usually fair in splitting time and then if she doesn't hand the child over, he files contempt charges and the judge will order her to. :) good luck.

Questions for parents that do NOT vaccinate their children?



I asked this last night, but barely got any responses



I'm not putting you down. I respect every mom's decision for what they do for their child. I just have a few questions.



When you were in labor, did you take any pain meds and if you did, which ones?  (The reason I ask is because if you did, you are putting something in your body, while your newborn is still in your belly.  Yes, doctors say that the medicines don't harm the baby, but anti vaccine mom's believe the dr's lie to them about what's in vaccines, what's to say they aren't lying about medicines they give you while in labor?)



If your child gets sick, do you give them antibiotics?
(I've heard the arguement from anti vaccine parents that "there is too much risk" in giving their child vaccines, isn't there just as much risk giving your child antibiotics?  They can have a reaction to the antibiotic just like they can have  a reaction to vaccines.  A child can die from an allergic reaction to antibiotics, do you risk that?  I do vaccinate, but I rarely EVER give antibiotics.  I have seen first hand a severe reaction, my son had one.)



When you are around newborns and children with immune disorders, do you inform the parents that your child has not been vaccinated?
(The reason I ask this is because newborns that have yet to vaccinated are at high risk of contracting the illnesses that are vaccinated againts.  And kids with immune disorders can not get vaccinated and are also at high risk at contracted these illnesses, do you tell the parents?)



Thanks in advance to everyone who gives me real answers and that aren't rude about their answers.



</question>



<additional details>



mom+5-I respect why you did not vaccinate your children, BUT, reality is an unvaccinated child has an extremely high risk of contracting any of the childhood illnesses, whooping cough and measles can kill baby under 3 months old and can kill a child with an immune disorder.  A child is contagious before they show any symptoms.

No, I didn't not have any pain meds when I was in labor.  We only give antibiotics when our children have a bacterial infection.  My oldest, 15, has never been on any kind of antibiotics.  My other 4 have been on them a few times.  We do not immunize because my oldest had an allergic reaction to them when she was a baby.  We have never been around newborns or children with immune disorders but I don't think my kids not having their shots could affect them.  Just because my kids did not have their shot, doesn't mean they carry the disease.  I had shots against measles and I had them so nothing is 100%.  I believe my kids are healthier for not having shots.  Also, I have never believe that dr's are lying about what's in a shot.

My husband is a doctor and he would tell you, there are far more risks if you do not vaccinate your child. There are a few vaccinations that really are no longer necessary. But is the death of one child worth the risk. The material used in all vaccinations is tested and risk free.

I visualize this crazy lady with rollers in her hair, and old tattered night gown and a cigarrette always dangling from her lips!

Something that makes them unhappy and this is their way of "getting back at the world".  Seriously, I find it sad that a thumbs down on a public forum somehow strokes their ego.  It rarely bothers me, so I guess if I can help the greater good by leaving comments that make them want to give me a big 'ol thumbs down, then so be it.

She absolutely freaks at the sight of blood! She has a little cut on her finger and last night, it reopened and started to bleed. Boy, did she freak! I tried to explain to her that everything's okay, it will stop, you just reopened it, don't worry, blah, blah. She just screamed until it stopped! I have no idea why she does this because I am as calm as possible. I try my best not to freak out myself and talk to her in the best soothing voice I can give.

I almost think it's an innate thing that you can't really change.  I have a cousin who always faints at the sight of blood and my husband can't stand to see blood or be in a hospital.  I work in a hospital and spend all day with tubes of blood (I work in the lab).  It has never bothered me.  I think you being calm certainly helps, but I'm not sure what else you could do about it.

If a dog is afraid of something and you pet it and try to calm it down you end up feeding its fear.  At the same time you are saying "don't worry about it, nothing is wrong" your actions are saying there really is something wrong.  I think people are the same way.  If you want her to think there is nothing wrong you have to act like there is nothing wrong.

Just let him wear the crocks.  Pretty soon he'll figure out that his feet are cold and he'll decide shoes and socks are a good idea.  It's not worth fighting about, and it really sucks to start every day off with a battle - I've been there.

First, take away all other options.  Tell him that it's time to say bye-bye to his summer shoes and hello to winter shoes.  Make it fun for him!  Make a game out of it.  Read some wintry stories with him and show him pictures of what people wear during winter and point out why it's different.  Yelling and spanking (hitting) are not good ways to get a child to do anything for you.  Be patient, and think of creative solutions.  Since the school most likely doesn't allow open toed shoes, perhaps get his teacher involved?  If all else fails, seek help from a school counselor or parent support group.



This is an example of your child taking control over you, and you should be the one in control.

Hide the flips flops where he can never find them. Then he going to realize he has nothing to wear.  Tell him that you are the parent and that he has to listen to you and wear those socks and shoes. If he doesn't then send him to bed early. Have him go outside with nothing on his feet and he going to realize it to cold. Maybe after that he going to wear them no matter want.

if he doesnt listen, make him stand outside barefoot in the cold for awhile and he'll realize the purpose of socks. im not saying you have to leave him outside all day in 30 degree wheather, but just for like half an hour on a chilly day. That'll show him!

This could be one of those "suffer the consequences" type of things.  When it is 20 degrees outside and he has to wear those for a long time (like standing at a parade or at a sporting event) he will think next time.  Cold feet never caused anyone to get sick.  I would take a pair of socks and shoes so he can change after he begs and begs to.  Look for him to outgrow this.

First of all, spanking is completely unacceptable for this situation, please don't do it again.



Have you tried bribing him?  If you got really cool looking socks that he picked out and let him pick out shoes and buy them, do you think that would help?



What would happen if you let him wear crocks and his feet got cold?  Would he be able to understand that he needs shoes and socks?  You could try this on a cold day and have shoes and socks with you  for when he begins to feel uncomfortable.



There are no absolute answers, in the end you will find a way to make this work.  I wish you the best of luck with it.

Let him wear sandals.  I'm sure as soon as it gets too cold, and if you're in an area where there will be snow, he'll quickly want socks and shoes.



Kids like to test us.  I have a 6 year old, and feel as though I'm tested with one thing or another on a constant basis.  So, turn the tables.  Give him exactly what he wants.  He wont get hurt from this, just really cold, and will hopefully change his mind.



If that doesn't work, get rid of all the sandals and crocs.  Either he'll wear his shoes or go barefoot.



Good luck.

First of all, never spank your child.  You don't want him to respect you only out of fear, which is what spanking inspires.  This is probably a phase of not wanting to wear socks, but you can fix it.  Set aside a lot of time to do this.  Tell your son that you're going somewhere but that he can only go if he wears shoes and socks.  He will probably fight you in which case put him in a time out for as many minutes as his age, so 4 minutes.  If he sits in his time out quietly and without trying to leave, after it's over go to him, give him a hug, tell him to apologize for yelling at you, and tell him to put on his shoes again.  If he will not put on his shoes the second time repeat the process.  It will be VERY tiring the first few times, but eventually he will get the message that he needs to do what you are asking him.  If he does not sit in his time outs quietly and tries to get up and leave, you need to go get him and put him back, each time you do this tell him you are starting the 4 minutes over again.  Like I said, it will take a while, but it WILL be effective in the end, you just might have to use this form of punishment for a while before your son understands that if he doesn't do what you tell him, he will be put in time outs and then have to do what you say.  But remember to give him a hug when he's done with the time out and have him apologize.  This way you will not leave the fight both feeling horrible.  Hopefully this will help!!!

Try this. Go to the store and pick out like four pairs of shoes that you want him to wear and let him pick which one he likes the most. Most of the time if they have a choice and pick it they will wear it with no fuss because it was there choosing. Hope that helps. ( try some shoes with cartoons or something on them that he likes alot)

Why not just let him wear them until it gets cold. I'm sure when his feet are cold, he'll want to wear other shoes and possibly boots. Most of the time these little battles have to do more with the parents not wanting to lose control. The little ones want to start making their own decisions. So. let him pick out his own clothes, even if they don't match. Let him pick out some socks at the store and maybe he'll be excited to wear them. Let him pick what shoes for now, I don't think it's cold enough that he'll get frostbite. Let go of the control a little and don't lose control of the temper.

As the parent you have to figure out how to get what you want, and make it seem like a good thing to the child. Otherwise they will disobey.
I would start off by telling him in a calm an understanding tone that, he can get sick if he allows his feet to get cold and wet. Point out the things he likes to do, and how he won't be able to do them if he gets sick. You may even compromise a bit and strike a deal that he can wear whatever he wants in the house, but when it is cold outside, or he is going to school, he must wear shoes and socks.



A four year old needs to understand that the parent is in charge, and needs to make sure their child is well looked after. Time outs work well if you stay level headed about it. No screaming! Sit them down in a time out spot, or put the crocs in a time out. Bisobedience gets no reward, and if you allow yourself to cave in, plan for failure. Be consistant in the punishment, and when the time out is done, explain why the punishment was done, and what you expect.

Is it time for a new pediatrician? My oldest was repeatedly getting "strep throat" despite having a very ?



scarlet fever type rash on his thighs (yes it really turned out to be scarlet fever). My youngest has had asthma/allergy issues since a year old and I have practically begged her to spend more time diagnosing him only to end up at urgent care or the ER because I knew he would get worse w/in a matter of hours only to have her dismiss my concerns. An urgent care doctor told me that his adenoids should come out.....she said no but sent me to the ent who immediately said, yes, let's get them out. She's very sweet and my children like her but I feel like she's overlooking some things. My youngest sees an allergy/asthma specialist now. Should I continue taking them to her for the basic illnesses or scratch her completely?

Your number one concern has to be your children and just because she is very sweet, doesn't mean she is a good doctor. I would be looking for someone who is more thorough. I have a friend who took her child to a pediatrician that was not a believer in  prescribing antibiotics and rarely did so. Her one year old baby was running a very high fever and they rushed him to the emergency room. Her doctor was there that night and sent him home without an antibiotic after getting the fever down. She barely got home and the fever spiked again. She rushed him back and again the doctor got the fever down and sent the baby home. On the third trip back he died. An autopsy showed he had a bacteria infection and if the doctor had admitted him into the hospital and started him on the antibiotics there is a chance he would have lived. Of course no one will ever know for certain, but in my opinion, he may have. Don't let this happen to you. If your pediatrician is missing things, this could become serious.

What things are your child(ren) afraid of?



While I was asking my last 2 questions, I realized just how much my daughter is afraid of. She is 3 1/2 years old. She seems to be afraid of blood, water on her face, and recently developed a fear of the dark (she now has to sleep with a soft light on, when she never had to in the past). But, on the other hand, she certainly isn't afraid of climbing or heights, or of falling. She is fearless when it comes to that. lol



What sort of things are your children afraid of? Or are they as brave as can be? lol

I think it depends on the child.  My son is afraid to swim...he's terrified of drowning despite my best efforts to reassure him I'm NOT going to let him drown lol.  But, that's the only thing I can think of.  He never did get afraid of the dark for some reason and I know that's a common fear in children.  When she gets older, I'm sure her fears will lessen.

Many children are afraid of being alone.  Many have common fears: spiders, snakes, things in the dark. But, they won't think a thing about doing double back flips on a trampoline, or things like that.
Do not discount or belittle a child's fears. To them, they are very real. Listen to them talk about their fears.  Help them to understand them.

My 2 1/2 yr old is afraid of my car alarm. Sometimes, he will run outside and won't come back in. He is very strong. So, when we try to get him, he will go limp and try to fall on the floor. He is a big boy, and it's hard to get him to come in. One day when he was doing this, running around the car ( I live in the back house of 3 houses, and my car is right next to my house, not in the street) , I pushed the panic button on my car alarm. He almost fell down from fear and came running so fast into the house. I felt bad, but it was kind of funny. ;)  I swear I'm not a mean mom.

Kids go through stages of being afraid of different things.  I can remember when my daughter (now 35) was terrified of wolves.  She was about 3-4, and was just sure that a wolf would find his way into the house and eat us all up!  I assured her that wolves were just a 'different kind of dog,' and even took her to a wolf shelter where she could interact with them.  She still didn't care for wolves, but her brother, who was a year younger, has always been fascinated by wolves.



But here is a weird one!  My son (now 34) at age 5 was terrified by the ladies at the local Women's Prison.  To get to my MIL's home, we had to drive by the prison.  He would hide on the floor of the car.  Once, there was a highly publicized escape by an inmate, and my son was in a constant state of terror that the lady was going to come and get him.  When he was in college he worked as a meter reader for our local electric utility.  The Women's Prison was on his route.  At 21, he was still fearful of going there!  He preferred to reading the electric meter in the worst drug house in the city to going into the Women's Prison!



My 3 year old granddaughter is afraid of wolves, blood, and loud voices.  She falls apart if someone gets hurt and bleeds!  If she hears raised voices, she is sure that people are 'fighting!'  I guess I need to take her to the wolf shelter to see that the wolves are just a 'different kind of dog'!



My 2 year old granddaughter is only afraid of loud noises and being startled.  A car backfire will send her on a crying jag!



Fortunately, my kids and grandkids have/had no fear of bugs.  We all think bugs are cool!

My son is generally pretty brave. (He's 2.) But recently he has started asking us to turn on the lights so he can go into a room because he's scared. And now he SCREAMS while getting rinsed in the bath because he doesn't like water in his face either. Can't think of any others though. It seems like those 2 are pretty common.

When it comes to my daughter, there's not much I can think of that she's afraid of.  At the moment, since we had Halloween, we found out that she loves to look at and touch the creepy scary masks in the store, but when someone has one on she's deathly afraid of them.  That's about it right now.  She's not afraid of the dark,  I was always silly about thunder and lightning so she wouldn't be afraid of that, etc.  Maybe in the future that will change, but so far we've been very lucky!

<question>



Parents with teens at home?



I moved back home when I found out I was pregnant (at my mom's insistence). I do all the cooking, cleaning, and getting groceries, cleaning supplies, etc for the house and stick to a budget. I occasionally take my sister places so my parents don't have to. My mom "pays" me $20 a week (its really more of an allowance, as I can't work).



What's some extra stuff I can do for them to show them how much I really appreciate everything they've done for me?



</question>



<additional details>



The money really just goes for gas or my cell bill.



Actually I volunteered to do all the stuff around the house. And they weren't happy with the situation, but are REALLY looking forward to meeting their grandson lol. He's also named after my dad and grandfather.



Mom never really has to ask me to do anything, I even fix her lunch at night so she doesn't in the morning.

what you are doing now is really the best thank you that you can do. Also your actions are showing your parents that even though you are having a baby before they may have been ready to be grandparents that you are taking the responsibility serious and that they have raised you well and into a caring adult who knows that nothing in life is free or easy.

well sometimes its not what you do but what you say. most of the time just sitting and really having a good talk about you know everything the baby how they feel about it the budget just talk with them and even if what they say starts to aggravate you just say nothing act like you really appreciate there advice and just make them feel like they have a really great connection with you. (if they dont already)

I did the same thing! I took care of the house-- all of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping, etc. . . . It was the least I could do for my mom and brother. I would think that the only thing you can do is throw in sincere verbal appreciation. I don't think they could expect much more than that. :)

Well they are probably still a little upset about the baby.
but you can maybe get your mom flowers
make your dad coffee.
talk to them about your day.
the little things.



but i think your doing quite enough right now. they need to accept that your pregnant and love you for who you are. not put you to work.

What can i do for my daughter?? how can i be there for her during this horrible time?



My family recently moved from a place we had lived for 16 years....her friend who she lost touch with sort of has developed a type of lympthatic cancer...its not lyphoma but its a type having to do with lymphnodes? We think. Her ex-friends have not really filled her in on everything she knows--
1. She will have 6 months of chemo, and won't be able to go back to school for the rest of the year and will be in the hospital for atleast another 30 days.
2. It should go away and never come back after 6 months.
3.Shes in cook childrens.



I wanted to ask you, so i can comfort my daughter, if this girl will loose her hair due to chemo? and if she will have to repeat the year? and if there is anyway she can send her a card or stuffed animal?



One friend told her that no one had seen her because she just started chemo and she couldn't be around germs, but yet another told her that she had been there everyday that week for moral support since she has had surgies on her legs plently of times.



My daughter is very heartbroken, and i was wondering...can u answer those questions? I am quite clueless when it comes down to all this sort of stuff. I feel bad.

Hi Lauren,



I'd suggest your daughter phones or sends a letter to her friend...Personally, I think at difficult times we all take notice of who takes the time and trouble to get in touch. I'm guessing your daughter's friend would like to hear from her and will appreciate her efforts.



Particularly with things like cancer, some people worry they will say or do the wrong thing and so they stay away or hang back, but that can leave the sick person isolated at a time when the more love and affection around them the better!!



One question is why are they former friends? From what you say it sounds as though your daughter is wanting and trying to keep in touch...perhaps you can help her? You haven't said how far you've moved but it is possible for her to reestablish contact? Letters, phone calls, visits - all good options. Perhaps she could call and ask what her friend is up for? The main thing is to think of her friend's needs.



Please don't feel bad about it - if you're feeling bad you won't have the energy to do anything about it. I don't think anyone's an expert in this stuff but just getting in touch and doing it sensitively is a great thing to do for your daughter and her friend. Trust your instincts.



Good luck!

well the best thing you can do is be there for her and support her all the way through right now it sounds like she needs some comforting so show and give her some comfort and let her know you care for her show her you care. Tell her you will be there with her by her side every step of the way no matter what happens and everything is going to be alright!

My daughter's father and I split up when she was 1 yr. old.  In a lot of ways, it's been much easier on my own.  I don't have someone bitching when I call my mom for advice, I make all the decisions regarding my daughter, I don't have to deal with a partner who you don't know when you can rely on them or not (like when he was supposed to watch our daughter during the day while I worked, but at times when we'd fight he'd take off at night and I never knew if he would be back to watch her in the morning or not - a bunch of B.S. like that...)  I handle it because I'm lucky enough to have a decent job with health insurance, a decent car that I had before my daughter came along, and we have a great babysitter and family who is there for us when we need them.

I got pregnant at 19 and his father and I were very honest about the possibility of us not staying together but we promised that if that happened, we would co-parent to the best of our abilities. Well, it happened.....we just didn't have the same goals and didn't respect each other's way of living. We have now been split up for 6 years and while it wasn't easy at first, we've done a good job of putting our differences behind us and put our son first.

The whole event boggles my mind.

If you're going to say that it's because an african-american was elected I think you need to realize that's probably not a major event to your kids in quite the same way it is to you.



I don't know that politics are any different than when I was a kid except maybe more divisive.  Can you really say the country is more united now than when you were younger?  Before you start basking in the joy of an Obama victory let's just be honest and say it wasn't a landslide in terms of the popular vote.

Your kids will realize it when they are old enough to take history classes.  You were taught about Abraham Lincoln and you realize the importance of his presidency.  You were taught about John F. Kennedy and you know the importance of his presidency and the importance of his subsequent assassination.



If my kids were around the age of 10 and up, I would discuss it somewhat with them but it wouldn't be a big topic unless they wanted to continue it.
It didn't matter who won last night, history would have been made.  On one side there would be the first black president, on the other side there would have been the first female vice president.
Someday, our children will realize it and hopefully they will see more "changes".  Maybe a female president, maybe a minority president, maybe a president that follows through on election promises (had to throw that in!).  Who knows where we will be in 20 or 30 years.

DrChubs, you're a tard. You're just sore because McCain lost, but anywho.. With that being said, yeah-it is a huge deal that a black man won the presidency. I voted for Obama and I didn't do it because he was black, I did it because I agreed with most of his views and opinions. But yes-it's exciting to see someone make history--he is the first black president of the United States of America and that is such a huge accomplishment for him and not just his black supporters, but for our whole country. I think it really does say it doesn't matter the color of your skin-only what's in your heart and what you think is right for America. My daughter isn't old enough to understand politics, but I know when she gets older and starts studying about American History, maybe one day she'll have to do a report about this election and she can come and ask me about it. :)

My son is only 5 months so he has not idea about our world yet...maybe that's a good thing.

Not really.  I went over the election in simple terms for my son, and we had a mock ballot to vote for ice cream flavors so that he'd understand how it works.  But he's 4 years old.  His interests right now are cars, super heroes, and bodily functions.  He knows who Obama and McCain are, but he's too young to get the real significance of the election is.

Im Canadian so its not really like my opinion matters.  But lets hope he doesn't muck the world up as bad as monkey face before him did.  And to me his color makes no difference.  He could be purple for all I care.  I remember when we elected our first woman Prime Minister.  She was about change, but she made a big mess and we never had a woman since.  Of course like Obama she inherited a big mess form a very unpopular previous leader.



So gender or color doesn't really matter.  Obama does have a big mess to fix though eh?  So here's hoping he can pull it off.

Hi there,



I have never, ever heard of this, and i think it is awful, personally, i would never deliberately humiliate and mock my children out in public (especially at your age) simply because they have been naughty. Of course you should be punished if you have done something wrong, but what about grounding you or not allowing you to do something you really want to? Is this a tradition in your family? You could speak to your mum and just explain that you would feel humiliated and embarassed and that instead of correcting your behaviour this will make it worse. I think this is a disgusting way to punish a child.

What should i do please help?



My son is nearly 4 years old and just started nursery in september. He really enjoys it but now for the last week he has been coming home upset and saying a boy keeps hitting, biting and pushing him of bikes etc. It started last week when the teacher got me and said that another boy had bitten him and they had to tell me because it left a big imprint and made his hand bleed. I was willing to let it go as that what kids do and he had been told its wrong. The next day my son came home with a cut ear and he told me the same boy pulled him by the ear. My son is very quiet and didnt tell the teachers but someone else did but they did not tell me. I had to find out off my son. Yesterday he came home with a cut chin where the same boy scratched him apparently he told teacher but they stuill did not inform me. Are they taking this seriously as everyday he comes home with a different mark on his tiny body. This boy is alot bigger than him and he is now scared to go to school. I have informed the teachers but it does not seem to be stopping. What should my next step be, should i approach the mother or should i take him out? My son would never hurt anyone and i would not condone him hitting back what should i do?

You should be going to see the teacher directly and asking her why she is doing nothing concerning this matter. You also need to go above her head and let whoever is in charge that this is unacceptable, and you want it to stop. If need suggest that the parents of the bad child come for a conference with you. This is unacceptable and the teacher should be handling it better.

if its convenient to take him out and enroll him else where I would. But if it isn't i would for sure speak to the mother of the child and the teacher together. If that child doesn't stop he should be kicked out. It isn't fair that your baby is scared to go to school and neither is it fair that you are contemplating whether to take him out or not. The other child is the problem; not your son. Hope i helped and the situation gets resolved quickly.

Where do you live?



In Texas, preschools are held to the same standards as daycares.  This means if they fail to report an incident of injury, regardless of the reason, an inspector comes out and talks to the director.  Serious consequences can occur for the preschool if they fail to take action.



Those preschools that are also part of a school district have the additional protection under the district's anti-bullying policy.  The teacher could acutally lose their job for allowing it to occur.



You really need to tell the teacher that you require an incident report each and every time your child is injured, and that she is to fully look him over before sending him home.  If you find any injuries or he tells you of an incident and you did not recieve a report, that you are going to document it in writing to the principal/director.  At the same time, go over her head and talk to the principal/director, and insist that this bully be removed from the classroom or otherwise be separated from your son or you will be forced to take legal action against them and the other parents for these assaults and emotional trauma.  Tell them in no uncertain terms you are NOT going to switch your child out of his class when he has done nothing wrong.  He's not the problem, the other kid is, and demand to see all documents regarding parental notification to you and the other parents.



If you're in the states, by law, they have to notify you and the other parent each time this happens.  If they have an anti-bullying policy, point this out to them and suggest that if they are not going to follow it, regulators should probably be involved to show them how to implement it.

Do I ask too much of my 13yr old? ?



I am on permanent disability. I developed a blood clot in my thigh when I was pregnant with my 2 1/2 yr old. I am in pain quite a bit as the clot is still there, and my legs swell all of the time. I am not supposed to sit or stand for longer than an hour.
So-
my 13 yr old is very lazy. She comes home from school and sits in front of the tv and watches the food network. I will ask her to change the baby's diaper and keep an eye on him so that I can get a little break. I ask her to help me pick up or go get the load out of the dryer and she gets an attitude. She is supposed to do dishes, but doesn't. If I yell at her or take her phone away, then she is mean to her brother. My house is a complete mess and I am overwhelmed by it because I can't do it on my own.



If I am cleaning my room, or the kitchen, I expect her to at least make sure the baby isn't in playing in the toilet, since all she is doing is sitting on the couch. But I will walk out there, and he will be coloring on the walls, or there will be stuff everywhere. How can I get her to help me more? She does not care about my disability at all, it seems. She is also very rude to me.

Well, the laundry and dishes I agree with. She needs to do some household chores- that is absolutely not too much to ask. Children should start helping out around the house even earlier than that. She needs to adjust the attitude and realise that if she lives and eats in the house, then she needs to help maintain it.



As for watching the baby, I don't think she should have to do that. Just because she is 13 doesn't mean she should become the "in-house babysitter"... I mean, what would you do if she wasn't there? You'd have to hire someone and pay them. Remember that it was your choice to have your child, so it's not her responsibility to care for him. I don't realy blame her from wanting to relax after school and not go straight from schoolwork to babysitting.

Based on what you describe you are not asking too much.  It sounds like some things she takes for granted should be re-framed as privileges.  She likes watching TV?  That privilege is earned by watching her brother while you clean.  She wants to use the phone?  She needs to do the dishes occasionally.  You get the idea.



As for her rudeness, again it comes down to rewards.  Rudeness results in having something of value denied.



It sounds like both of you are having a hard time.  Maybe it would help if she had and/or you saw a therapist?

When kids are that age, they feel tired from a full day of school and all they want to do when they get home is rest and watch tv before they have to start working yet again on homework. Kids are going to complain when they have chores. I remember I would complain and get mad when all I had to do is the dishes. This girl has to not only do the dishes, but help with the laundry, watch her little sibling, and change diapers. It's not your fault that you can't do these things but you need to calmly explain to her that you both need to work together, and whenever you can it would be best to ease up on her workload because after all you are the mother. It's hard for a girl to have so much responsibility at a young age. Coming home from school then helping her mom raise her little brother and doing homework doesn't give her a lot of time to be a kid...
Good luck, I hope my opinion helped.

You have a disability in which you need extra attention. You've got a toddler that needs extra attention. It sounds like your daughter is screaming for attention too. It sounds like she's unhappy and just ignoring your and your toddler. That's her way of asking for attention.
Get someone to watch the young one once a week and try spending some one on one time with her.
She's watching the food network, ask her to look up some recipes on-line and help you cook them. After a few weeks of spending some one on one time with her, tell her how much you love her and how tough things are for you right now. ASK her if she could help you out and tell her thank you when she does.
Treat her like a daughter and not the hired help.... and stop yelling at her. believe it or not talking does more good than yelling.
As for her being rude to you... she's 13.



Good Luck

your 13 year old needs to learn responsibility. I think ever child need to have a choir and if you need help with the baby she should help it is not asking too much of her.



Does your 13 year old socialize maybe if you have her friends come over she will be more likely to listen to you in front of her friends. it sounds like she need to hang out with more people her age or have an after school activity.



I know when my brother was a baby I hated my mother at 13 because all the attention went on the baby and my young sibling and by the time I wanted attention she was too tired for me. maybe if you ask her to do something try to do it with her. try to play a board game or card game with her.

Being at school can be like being at work. When one first gets in the door from work the last thing they can handle is being bombarded with things they have to do. Try having a heart to heart talk with your daughter and come to a compromise. Perhaps you can agree to allow her some down time when she first gets home from school. Give her maybe an hour or an hour and a half to unwind as she pleases. Once the time is up, let her know she has a chore or two to do, but don't overwhelm her. Remember that she also has homework to think about and that's a lot for her. Kids need time to just be kids. All too soon they are no longer a child. Watching her little brother constantly will only make her resent him. She is a child and not a parent. If you ask this of her, then she deserves to be rewarded. Talk about this with her as well. Rewards always work much better than punishments. You could even go so far as setting up a chore chart and giving her a star for every time she does a chore and two stars if she does the chore without complaint. Tell her she needs to earn a minimum of stars per day. Example: if she has 3 chores to do she must earn 3 stars. At the end of the week if she has met the minimum of stars reward her. If she gets an allowance you can give her a few extra dollars, or it could be a new blouse or something she has been wanting. At the end of the month if she has completed her minimum every day, then give her a bigger reward. It doesn't mean it has to be expensive, it just should be something she will want bad enough to work towards it. With my kids it could be something as simple as a special day spent with me. You and her can work out what works best for you. Everyone needs to feel appreciated and a little appreciation goes a long, long way! Also, don't give her too many chores; like I said, she is a kid and it isn't fair to dump all of your responsibilites on her. If you can afford it, consider having someone come in once a week to clean house for you. If not, then ask your doctor to declare you temporarily disabled and look into IHSS if you live in a state that has this program. It is a state program that will pay for someone to come in and clean for you and do chores that you are unable to do for yourself. It is free if you are low income. Best wishes to you!

punishing her will not serve anything good



what other children do in their homes to support their families is completely insignificant



do you understand why?



because each individual is different; each individual have different needs; each individual have different issues goin on in their lives...and that includes your daughter



if she is not giving, she is not capable of giving, because unconditional giving is an act of love



if she is not connected to love, something is blocking her connection...which is most likely an issue or a fear



i understand this is a frustrating situation from your point of view, but you have to change your view of your little princess



there's a reason for everything



the best thing you can do is trying to show her that you love her as her mother, before she blocks you from anger and frustration



try to communicate



if she is not able to give any support, and please understand that it doesn't have to be a matter of physical capacity, do not fire up on her



ask her what is going on in her life and see if there is anything you can do for her to help her lighten up



if that won't do, focus upon getting your support elsewhere



start by playing this out in your mind; visualize it and reach for the feeling place of it



if you can solve your personal issues and let go of your negative thoughts, you will also be able to naturally heal, if that is what you intend...

Here's the thing...Somehow, you have to get your 13 year old daughter to become a contributing member of the household.  I would suggest having an adult talk with her -- no criticism or anger.  Let her know that you really need her help to do certain things -- for example, the laundry, picking up the living room, and setting the table for dinner.



I think that your "scattergun" approach isn't working.  "Watch the baby, if you won't do that, then clean the kitchen, if you won't do that then fix the dinner, if you won't do that then..."  This is not working!



If you have any way of 'rewarding' her for doing her part, that is great!



The secret to success is getting your daughter on 'the same page' as far as contributing to the family.



She has to know that she is really NEEDED, not just 'put upon' to live in the home.



Good luck!

I share the same fantasies! Being able to shower alone & wash  my hair & shave my legs in peace, without my 19 month old pushing me and hitting me, would be heaven. Having a whole day to clean out the kitchen cupboards would be bliss. Waking up naturally instead of to the sound of my 19 month old bellowing & screaming would be unreal. Going out with makeup applied properly, clothes that haven't been stained by grubby little hands and with just a handbag, instead of an over-flowing nappy bag is a fantasy up there with making out with Johnny Depp or Simon Baker...

My daughter's father and I split up when she was 1 yr. old.  In a lot of ways, it's been much easier on my own.  I don't have someone bitching when I call my mom for advice, I make all the decisions regarding my daughter, I don't have to deal with a partner who you don't know when you can rely on them or not (like when he was supposed to watch our daughter during the day while I worked, but at times when we'd fight he'd take off at night and I never knew if he would be back to watch her in the morning or not - a bunch of B.S. like that...)  I handle it because I'm lucky enough to have a decent job with health insurance, a decent car that I had before my daughter came along, and we have a great babysitter and family who is there for us when we need them.

Well, it happened.....we just didn't have the same goals and didn't respect each other's way of living.

Cripes!  Our kids are going to do the same things that we did but only worse!



As a small child, you were probably influenced by the arguing in the home. which made you mean to your younger siblings.



Rule #1:  No arguing in front of the kids!



Rule #2:  Treat your spouse and your kids with respect.  Although my husband and I had not discussed child rearing  prior to our marriage, we were on the same page as to treating the kids with the same respect that we expected from them.  There was rarely a raised voice in the home.  When our kids' friends ate dinner with us, they would comment that "your family treats each other like company!  You are so polite to each other!"



Rule #3:  If your parents don't back you up, who will?



That's all!

Dealing with temper tantrums? ?



I was just curious how other people deal with tantrums? Yesterday my four year old daughter had a bad one while we were at my mother's house. I told her she could not have something and she just had a fit. Kicking, screaming, and yelling. I tried to ignore, but it went on and on. Finally I told her if she did not stop, then she was going to get a spanking. Then she kicked me. I stayed calm, picked her up and took her to the guest room. I gave her four swats on her bare hiney, and surprisingly she calmed down. She sobbed for a minute or two and then it was over. Now usually I only spank for lying or doing something dangerous. However it worked well in this situation. I was just wondering if other people spanked for tantrums or do you use some other method? I usually ignore them, but I may change now

I really don't think spanking is the right thing to do.  The only reason it ever does work is because it makes the child scared of you.  You don't want your daughter scared of you do you?  My parents spanked me and it never really worked unless my dad did it, but it never made us any better...we learned that part ourselves.  I have a son and I always said I would never spank him..and I don't.  He has time-outs in his playpen and that is all it is used for.  (He's 18 months, but has temper tantrums like a 2-3 year old.)  You can do whatever you'd like I just don't think spankings are the way to go.  My son is in time-out for 1 minute for his age.  Try putting her in time-out for 4 minutes, if she gets up keep putting her back until she sits there for her 4 minutes, whether she is screaming or not.  Tell her before why she is going in time-out and remind her after she is done why she had gotten in trouble.  Hope you find something that works, it works fine with my son :)  Good Luck!!

For temper tantrums or ignoring me, I usually use pick them up, carry them to their bedroom, or just the sofa even if I'm at someone elses house. Then I normally put her in on her bed, shut the door and wait outside for three minutes- one for every year of her age. I don't talk to her, don't say anything to her, apart from no. You have to be authoritive for it to work, not saying 'oh, don't do that' but 'no'. If she does it again, she goes in again. I normally only have to do it if she's having a really cranky day otherwise the 'no' works and she stops. It just gives them a while to calm down.



Good luck

i am a mom that believes in spanking.  it has worked for my son.  i only do it when like your daughter, throws major fits.  like you, i tried to ignore him at first but realized he wanted more attention and thats why it would escalate.....when he realized, from then on,  that i was going to give him that kind of attention (spanking), when i warn him now, he usually calms down and we talk about it.  i know most people do not agree with spanking, but if it worked for me and my siblings, then i knew it would work for my son.  my second is on her way and it will be no different, although my son might warn her that mom is not joking.



the one thing people have to remember, is the difference between spanking and a beating.  keep it a quick spanking and its gonna work.

I think you did the right thing.  Yes, I did spank but only swats to get attention and spankings for out deliberate defiance.  When our kids would have a fit and need to cry we would send them to their rooms( even our 2 year old) and tell them that we understood if they were upset and needed to cry but that they were not permitted to cry in a room where other people were and that they needed to go to their room until they felt better.  People always laughed at us for this but it worked and as they grew older, they would run to their room, cry a bit and come out and say, "I'm done now".  We praised them for getting themselves under control and now at 13 and 15 they are mild-mannered kids who know how to control themselves.  I would also deal with the fact that she kicked you.  Make sure she knows that this isnt permissible and that if she is frustrated, she can use other ways to get her anger out.  As a Christian parent, we always prayed after the spanking or incident and asked God to help us behave better in our actions.  That worked well to.  Good luck, it sounds like you have things on the right track.  Oh, as far as ignoring goes, you can do that to a certain extent but I never felt comfortable letting my kids scream it out in front of others.  I never wanted them to feel like they had the power to control the room or the situation.  That's why we sent them to their rooms to have a fit.



Good luck!

For this particular instance I think you handled it fine.  I would never suggest ignoring it completely.  Addressing it and then setting her in a separate room is appropriate.  But when she kicked you, that right there crossed a certain line.  That was an act of deliberate defiance.  If spanking was the best solution and was effective for her, then kudos to you for effectively and calmly handling the situation.



For our two and a half year old, I give him two choices: 1-Keep on having a tantrum and spend time sitting in his room on his bed until he can calm down or 2- Straighten up and behave like the big boy I know he is and we can go back to having fun.  Nine times out of ten, he chooses to straighten up on his own.  We have spanked him for tantrums on certain occasions, but I don't feel that it's always necessary.  I, like you, only tend to give harsh consequences in the event that my son does something to place himself or others in danger or in the event of deliberate defiance.  But like you as well, I'm also seeking out more positive ways to enforce the good behavior and cut back on the unwanted behavior.



In short, you handled it appropriately for your daughter.  Don't second guess yourself.  Be consistent and make your decisions rationally.

im for spanking...i didnt have to do it much with my first one since she was a good toddler, though at age 5 she got a couple and her behaviour straightend right out...
my 19 month old right now is throwing tantrums, throwing herself on the floor screaming when we tell her no, or take something away she isnt to have... i ignore her behaviour too, but she dosnt stop, spanking her does nothing, beleive me, so we have to redirect her behaviour to something she can have, or do...thats what works for her... you have found what works for yours, and you dont need any of us to justify that for you... you know what you are doing, and you know best for your child.

ok couple of things, i have a 27 month old so 2 1/2 ignoring him doesnt work, i spank him usually that doesnt work, not hittinghim makes him not listem..what i sometimes do, if lift them a couple inches off the floor, and i i drop him. not high enough to do anything serious.



i think what you did was a great way to deal with it. sometimes they need that shock to scare them. my mother suggest smacking them when they dont expect it. like kindly pick them up turn them around as if you are going to distract them , and smack them  but not a flat hand like a scoop. like scoop them up so they are scared. it really works they get scared/.



no we dont want them to be scared of us but they need to know we are the boss..

I am a believer that tantrums may be caused by a number of things that the parents are not aware of....It could be that the child is not getting enough sleep, has been getting his/her way by one of the parents after a tantrum and knows that throwing one again will get them what they want.



I know someone who has a child that has wicked tantrums.....this child is allowed to set their own bed time and the dad always has given in when the child cried...the mom did sometimes, but not nearly as much as the dad.  i also believe that the dad went against the mom's wishes (if she said no, he would say yes).  The child is 4 and pretty much unbearable now....they do not know what to do, and I can't tell them either.  This child is very good at my house for the most part, unless the child is very tired.



Good luck!

I just ignore.  I go into another room because generally I get so mad when she has one that I need some time alone too.  My daughter is 2 and she can get pretty violent with me sometimes during her tantrums.  She pulls hair, she hits etc.  But I just say - "Don't hurt mommy" and I just walk away.  I then wait until she is calm.  I give her a big hug and say that it doesn't help things to get so angry.  I tell her being angry is fine, but yelling and hitting is not.  And if she is calm, and if she seems sorry, then we go on to another activity.



But I am not a believer in spanking.  It might work for some people. But when I was spanked as a child, I learned nothing.  All I Iearned was to resent my mother and fear her.

"We can't vote for Obama because he's black"?



My daughter is 6 years old and in first grade.  Last night when I was watching the election she said "I hope McCain wins" (it shocked me bc I hadn't talked politcs with her) so I asked her why, and then she said "Because Obama is black and we don't need a black guy to be president"



Now this really shocked me bc we are not racist by any means and have many friends of all different backgrounds.  So I asked her where she heard that from and she siad "everyone at school was saying it"  So that makes me think these small children are hearing it from their parents.  I talked to my daughter and explained everything to her, but should I say something to the school?

I wouldn't say anything to the school. As long as your daughter understands about racism and all that, there's no need. What parents tell their children is their own business, and I think you could only go to the school about it if there was someone making racist comments normerly or picking on a child of a different race.



Its complicated, but saying that seems different than saying something about someone else being black because it's politics and all that. I think as long as your daughter understands is the main thing, but if she keeps coming out with comments like that then talk to the school and see if they could have a culture day or something along those lines. You could do that now if you felt the need, get school to organise all the children bringing food from other countries and learn something about each country.

Absolutely!!!  Where do you live?  I can't believe a child that young says that. Our 10 year old was the complete opposite, he wanted Obama to win, and was so excited last night when he did win.  You need to explain to your daughter that the only difference between white and black people is the color of the skin.  And tell her that we all bleed red, we all have 2 hands, 2 feet, 2 eyes, 1 heart, you get my point.  That's really sad that she said that.

My daughter (who is black) was first telling me that I should vote for Obama because there has never been a black president.  A few days ago, she said that kids were saying at school that Obama was a bad man who wanted to do bad things for the country.  We corrected her on that, saying that we didn't think that McCain or Obama were bad men who wanted to do bad things for the country.  Both men love this country and want to do good things, they just have different ideas about which is the best thing to do.



I think that kids talk. Some probably get it from their parents, but the internet is also a source.  Ignorance can be spouted off from many different sources.



I don't think I'd bring it up at the school necessarily, unless it continues.  But it's a good opportunity to have a frank and age-appropriate discussion with your daughter.

Wow.  That's a bit surprised, I'll admit.  But like the first poster stated, we do have freedom of speech and the school can't very well suspend all the students who said that.  That being said, believing such a thing is sad.  Race has bearing on one's abilities as a leader anymore than gender or sexual preference does for countless other things including leadership.



Race, religion, sexual orientation and gender shouldn't play the defining role in someone's abilities unless the person lets those things define them and rule their decisions.  I don't mind that we have a mixed race President now, but I'm still a bit skeptical about him.  I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and hope that he does well for our country.



Teach her the correct way of thinking.  Teach her that President Obama (&lt;==wow that looks strange once I type it!) has what he feels is the best interest for our country in mind and to give him a fair chance.  Let her know that her friends at school are not right in their mind set.

i would call the school. i called the school this morning because of this same exact issue. my children are not racist and the majority of our friends are not even white! my children were told by classmates that obama is going to force women to kill their babies, that he is going to steal all the white peoples money and give it to only black people, and is also going to only tax white people. another child at school was told if obama won then he was going to make whites slaves, that child cried and screamed when he heard obama won because he thought it was true.  i have taught my children to be color  blind. i am not even married to a white man so why would they say some crazy crap like that. my girls are 8 and 10 and for that long they had no idea about racism. it's a shame i sent my kids to school to learn this crap. people need to learn that their actions teach their children and their children are talking about it to other kids. our school is working hard right now trying to find the kids saying this junk. it's heartbreaking. to hear my 10 year old say that a person is going to force us to kill our babies about made me throw up. i sure wish i home schooled some days, this past week being one of them.

Yeah, I think you should.  Maybe they would organize a special lesson on accepting people the way they are and talk to the kids about why it's bad to hate people who are different.



We're white, and generally conservative, but voted for Obama.  My son brought up politics at dinner recently, and said he'd vote for Obama because he seems like a nice guy.  How sweet and simple kids think, you know?  We told him both candidates are probably very nice in person, but grown ups vote on issues and who has better ideas on how to run the country.  He said. "Oh, that's kinda boring."  LOL

Sadly, I will tell you my children have heard this repeatedly. They were angry with me and my support for Obama because every-single-one of their friends at school were calling him a terrorist. Peer influence can trump parental influence if they hear it enough. We just continue to teach our girls that everything they hear doesn't mean it's true and just because it's different doesn't mean it's bad.



This morning, I told my girls Obama is our new president. My oldest daughter was upset, at first. I showed her the electoral votes and explained that if Obama was so bad then he would have never got that many votes. Americans are NOT stupid. We didn't chose Obama BECAUSE he is black and people did not vote for McCain because he ISN'T. America chose the president that they feel will take us in a better direction.



Just talk to your daughter. Explain how he won and why he won. Explain how it had nothing to do with the color of his skin, only to do with his popularity and what Americans think he can do for us.



Furthermore, tell her she can not go to school or anywhere and repeat that comment. It will hurt peoples feelings and make people angry with her.

You def need to talk to her about different races and that everyone is equal etc. I myself am having trouble with "friends" of mine in their 20s bashing Obama cause he won. At least your daughter is 6 and can use that as a reason to not know any better. I wouldn't worry too much about it as children are so impressionable and do repeat what the hear. And no, I would not say anything to the school at all. Can't change everyone.

So how about deleting the question and trying again... "Daughter spouting races remarks" or something.



But in any case, unless the school teachers are the ones instigating such talk, what good is saying anything to the school.  The school can't control what the children privately discuss.



Then again, I guess it wouldn't hurt to have a talk with the school principal and ask for his input on the situation.

I know a mother who has a child that she lets her parents raise.  She remarried and has two more children and they live with her.  The oldest son that lives with her parents was actually homeless for awhile and slept out in a car and she still didn't take him home with her.  Her and her husband earn a middle class income and now her son is living with her parents in a nasty home without water or heat.  How can a mother do that?  I don't have children yet but I just can't understand how you can chose which ones you want and don't want.  And I definitely can't understand how a mother can go to sleep at night knowing that her child is in a car or somewhere without water or heat.  This little boy is only five.

That is a good point.  I think the father just sends the check each month and that's it.  I don't even think the little boy would know him if he seen him and the father only lives about an hour away.

If the child is in a bad situation, call child protective services.  CPS will evaluate the situation and place the child in foster care, if necessary.



As for how or why this woman can do this, I have no idea.  But it also begs the question, where's the father?

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE call CPS CAS what ever the child protection agency is in your area or the area of that poor poor child! that's is just so unbelievable sad! I can not believe that a mother would allow her child to live a life like that. In order to not care or push that out of her head she must be mentally unstable, therefore she probably should not be allowed to raise the other two children that are living with her now! Please be a voice for that poor cool little baby! someone needs to care enough to do the right thing for that child! a child of 5 doesn't have a 'voice' so please be the voice for him!!! nothing good will come out of this poor child being raised with no heat or water! If that were you when you were 5 wouldn't you pray someone would save you? bring you to a nice warm place where you can bathe and drink and dress in clean clothes and play with toys? please help this poor child!

What are my options Moms?



My 6 year old son, for safety reasons, can not attend the daycare for before and after school care that he has been at since he was 19 months old. We're going back to the Children's Hospital Trauma Center for additional Counseling. My 5 year old daughter can still attend. I have a niece who is 19 and a stay at home Mom. We're talking about her driving here in the morning, taking the kids to school, picking them up and watching them here at my home until I get home from work. This sounds like it could be a very good thing for all of us, right?



I worry that I'll be removing my daughter from her entire social structure at the daycare, even though she did not act out in an unsafe manor. I'm also worried that I'll be encouraging acting out in an unsafe manor when I have to spend more time with my son because he has acted out = encouraging the negative by more time with me. This is all VERY serious. Suggestions?

I think your daughter will be just fine.  She's a kid and they tend to adapt very well.  Besides, if she's in school the rest of the day, that is really the basis of her social structure.  Not a couple of hours spent at day care.

Kids are pretty resilient.  Your kids need you.  Spending more time with them is never a bad thing and does not reinforce bad behavior.

Wow, tough one.



Is the choice you made (19 year old SAHM) a choice made for financial reasons?  The 1:1 interaction?  Without asking you what your son's situation is (don't want to pry) I'm trying to understand more.  In other words, IS there a daycare setting that WILL work for your son?  Then they get the social interaction they both need, you are right, it's important for development.  At the same time, I don't think it'll stunt either one of your kids not to go to daycare.  Lots of kids don't.  As long as they're not shut in the house all day/week/month, they still have plenty of social opportunities.  They don't need it every day throughout the day.  Dont you think?



As for being her hostage (I don't like it here so I'll just get us kicked out), my son tried this.  I sat with him and said "Understand this.  I get that you don't want before-school daycare.  I get that bigtime.  It's the way it is right now.  Know that if you get us kicked out of Miss Christina's, it doesn't make daycare go away.  It makes us have to find a new one.  Think about what you've got that's great at Miss Christina's (friends your age, she doesn't make you eat vegetables, we went over several of these).  Might not have this at the next one.  Furthermore, you WILL be punished beyond your wildest dreams for deliberate bad behavior."  And poof, it all stopped.

i think your daughter will be fine for one thing... second, i dont see how you spending more time with your son will encourage acting out negativly... i think in all honesty it would have the opposite effect on him.. maybe his acting out was a cry for attention..and you being closer to him will help with a faster recovery along with his councelling..
You are doing the right thing.

Little sisters (6 and 8 years old) are telling stories of what boys do to them at school?



I'm 18 and 3 of my little sisters are 8, "Sarah" and twin 6 yo's, "Sally" and "Sue". they all share a room and i was carrying my youngest brother upstairs to get him cleaned up after a major "accident", and i noticed they all stopped talking as i went by their room. so after i got him cleaned up I kinda dropped in on them and was all "what's up guys" ya know. so they did their little "excuse us for a second" and then quietly debated on if they should tell me. of course by now i wasn't going to leave until i knew. then Sarah went and closed to door and they told me all about these 5th grade boys at their school.



apparently after school a group of 5 older boys gang up on my younger sibs. 2 of them take my 9 and 7 yo bros and get them pre-occupied with something else while the other 3 show my little sisters "boy things". and i didn't get details but from what I gather these boys are dropping their pants, showing my little sisters their private areas, and then trying to get my little sisters to do the same. which they proudly told me they haven't done. but these boys are "nice and cute and not mean, etc."



i was first revolted and disgusted by this. and after i was sworn to secrecy i was going to head strait downstairs to tell my parents. but i don't really know how to tell them. do i say "hey dad, go talk to the girls about boys at school" or do i just say "hey, this is what they told me".



1) my sisters would never trust me again, but right now i don't really care about that
2) my dad would be at the school within' 10 seconds raising hell in the office trying to get these boys expelled, in the middle of the school day



i just don't know how to tell him, or when?
advice on how to approach the subject?

To avoid loosing your sisters trust.  Anonymously, call the school and tell them what you know.  Tell them the names of the boys and girls, (your sisters names). They WILL investigate.  They will get parents involved, but they never have to know that you were the one that told.  You do have to tell someone.  Because this could get worse, if no one gets caught.  Even if, the 8 year old is lying.  Maybe this will teach her that lying can get you in trouble.  If she is telling the truth, then they all need help.

If this is really what happened, then your parents need to know. This is not something that should be tolerated at the school, nor ignored by you. Your sisters are 8 and 6...they will trust you again. You will have to explain to them that this was something that had to be taken care of. And they will probably not share things with you for a while. But in the end, they will know that you will help them in situations they need assistance in. They are not old enough to make the decision themselves. As an adult, you have to make it for them by telling your parents and letting it be handled that way.

You must tell your parents and the school needs to know as well so they can notify the parents of these boys. I am a probation officer and this is actually a criminal act. It's sounds like these boys planned this out because the boys distracted your other siblings and got them away from your sister so they could expose themselves. This kind of behavior could get worse and they could hurt your sisters in the future that could damage them for a lifetime. Their safety is far more important than your fear of your sisters not trusting you ever again. You and your parents will need to explain to them that you did not betray their trust, but rather protected them and kept them safe by telling your parents. This could turn into a dangerous situation if not addressed now.  Go to your parents and let them know you are scared by what your sisters have told you. There is no right way to tell them so just tell them exactly what your sister told you. Good luck and have courage to be a good protective big sister. Keep in mind, contrary to what people think about these boys being "cute and good"...they are not cute or good and that needs to be exposed.

First of all - How old are the older boys?



They are manipulating your sibs and taking advantage of the younger ones and you have no way of knowing if it will escalate,



I vote you tell your sisters why your parents must be told.  Your Dad can deal with the school. Depending on the age of the boys, they may not be  be expelled but they do have to learn that they can not take advantage of vulnerable people.



Perhaps if you point out to your Dad that it will not do your sisters any good to be publicly labeled as victims he will take a more rational approach with the school.

Okay, any incident involving sexual abuse or molestation is obviously a very hot-button issue - just look at all your responses!  However, to all of your answerers, please, just take a moment and put things into perspective.  First of all, if these boys are 5th graders, they are only ten years old, thus it is pretty impossible for them to rape your sisters.  Also, keep in mind that curiosity about the anatomy of the opposite sex is natural and children of this age group (yes, mostly five through ages ten or eleven) have been "playing doctor" for decades.  Now, having said that, obviously, this is not an appropriate activity at all, and must stop immediately.  However, it is important to approach the school calmly and let them know you are concerned about these incidents and would like immediate action taken to ensure it never happens again.  Good luck.

You need to tell your parents immediately, and you need to explain to your sisters that you were not betraying their trust, but protecting them.  This would be a good way to teach them about "good tattling" and "bad tattling", as related to this same thing is the fact that many abusers convince their victims to keep secrets.



If they are lieing, your parents and the school will find out.  That is sad if it is the case, but there would be another good lesson learned here-these kinds of accusations can get people in SERIOUS trouble.



If this is indeed happening, the boys do need to be punished.  It is sexual abuse, and it could very well be a sign that one of them is being abused as well.  This type of behavior tends to escalate, so very soon it could go beyond showing.  Please tell.



If you do not want to tell your parents, tell a counselor at school.  They will get the ball rolling, and your sisters need not know that you are the one who told.



I hope this helps, and wish everyone involved the best.

ok...i had a similar issue with my younger sibling....she didn't quite tell me, i read her diary, and i was outraged. i knew she'd get mad at me at first but i told my mom and we both went to the school. she was pretty upset at first, but she got over it and so will your sisters. you are protecting them from a real danger and when they grow up they'll understand a little better why you did what you did. I'm a mother now and i remember hating my mom and brother for making my life "miserable" but it was for the best whether or not i thought so at the moment; now that i have 2 daughters i see why they chose make certain decisions, whether it was allowing me to talk to a boy or go out with certain people....... I'd say go for it! if its not rue at least they will learn not to lie and even less participate in those type of behaviors with boys at school or anywhere.

This is bigger that you being a tattle-tail. This is a serious issue that your parents need to be made aware of. These little boys need help. What would happen if you didn't tell and then a few years from now you find out that since they didn't get help now they turned into rapists or something? This isn't something to mess around with. Go tell your Mom! Your sisters will get over it. Even if they're mad at you for a week, they'll come around.

Is she yelling because she's upset she's lost her job and is taking it out on the child?



Do they get out of the house and do things?  Story time at the library, playing at the park, playing on the front lawn, getting exercise?



Being active is important.



No I didn't go through that.  I was SO glad that I was finally able to stay home.



I have fun with my kids and am so thankful I've been able to be at home for 13 years now.

It's easier if you willingly become a SAHM. But when you are forced into it like your friend was - it's stressful. You feel like a failure and now, all of the sudden - you are stuck with this little person who constantly requires your attention. Sometimes all you really need is a break to unwind and get your thoughts together. ... Plus, a lot of moms don't want to cry in front of their children. You have this need to relieve some stress, but you can't and this little baby is just sitting there crying, being loud, and it is your job to fix it when you already have enough problems of your own! It's a bit overwhelming.



Don't take me wrong. I love my daughter and cherished our time together when I was a stay at home mom :) But at times, it really is too much. Your life feels so out of control and when you feel motivated to go out and do something about it, you can't because somebody has to be at home with the kid.



I don't think this is a phase. Your friend needs help. It may take a few months for her to get into the new swing of things. It should help a lot if somebody can watch her daughter for a few hours while her husband is out or maybe even for a night. And having a friend to talk to can help too. (I am guessing you are willing, but maybe she isn't ready or maybe she doesn't know it's ok to talk to you.)



If she is looking, I hope your friend can find a new job soon. Even something part time can help out a lot. She probably needs to get out and experience the satisfaction that comes from challenging the adult side of her brain and knowing that she is helping to provide for her family.

I was constantly stressed and having to remind myself to control my emotions when I was unable to find a job. ... I felt so much better when I went back to work part time! (which turned to full time within a year)

Another question for parents about toys?



Hi moms and dads!



Toy question for you...
I'm working on role play items for girls (dresses, kitchens, tea sets etc).
If you buy a premium brand of your child's favorite character (Barbie, Disney, etc) which tend to be more expensive than generic toys, how much character art does you or your child like to see on it? Do you like a lot? A little? Somewhere in the middle?

What are the pro and cons of both? I attended a public school for 13 years (K-12) and to be honest I don't want to send my son there. I was intellectually BORED, especially in high school. I seriously could have gotten my GED at 15 and not missed anything.

There is only one private school in my area, no charter ones.... I mean I still have 5 years before he even starts, but if I decide on a private one I'll start saving now for it.

I think if you are an interactive parent within you child's school and learning process that it doesn't matter private/public.  Each type of schools offer different types of learning and if you are gifted even public schools have great programs - I think the trick is knowing that they are there and using the resources. - Good Guidance Counselors and active parents.

I went to public school in junior high and a private school in high school and the difference is amazing! I will never send my children to a public school. Here is a list of pros and cons I've come up with:



Private
Pros-students get a better education, students get more one on one attention from teachers, students are nicer to one another, less alcohol and drug use from students, looks great on college applications and so many more.
Cons- it's expensive, not as many classes offered



Public pros and cons-basically complete opposite of my list for private.



I strongly recommend sending your children to a private school, if you can afford it then go for it. It is completely worth it. I worked in an elementary private school for three years and I was amazed by the amount of respect those children showed not only their friends but their teachers as well.

There's also Charter schools I go to one.  It's pretty much in between a public and a private school. I enjoy it and it's perfect for me. I know some people that don't like it but if i were you I would look into that because it has better learning and it's not very expensive like a private school is. What state and city do you live in? It could also depend on that.

I went to both private and public schools as a kid and I really prefer private school.  I like the smaller classes, the level of parental involvement, the ability to choose the type of education your child receives.  Do you want a religious school, one focused on the arts, one that more academically competitive.....?  Of course, they can be quite expensive.



You can be very involved in public schools too.  In fact, the teachers NEED much more parental involvement than they get.  And if you do your homework, you can make sure to put your children in the best public schools in your area.  Look for ones with gifted programs for example.  Or consider a charter school which is publicly funded but is run much the same way as a private school.



I think the school experiment is largely what you make it,  But if I could afford it for 5 kids, I would send mine to private school.

I guess it depends on the school's itself.  I will probably send my daughter to public schools because I feel like that is where she will get the best world experience in dealing with real people and real life issues.  Private schools are good for people with lots of money who want to shelter their kids.  However, the thing about no drugs and stuff is complete crap.  I know of a lot of private school kids who can afford better and more quantities of drugs.  I think it all comes down to the parents and the interaction they have with their children.  I know several private school kids who changed to public schools.

My child doesn't act his age?



Yes I have an only child and yes on my part I do spoil him. He has no other sisters or brothers and doesn't play with many children. Granted my child is very smart in his own way and at times you would never think he was 4 because of his verbal skills. But at times he comes off to act under his age. I wanted to know if this has to do with him never going to daycare and not being interactive with other children? Or is this just a mama's boy act? Will this be a problem an set him behind when he finally begins going to school? Will he start acting his age if he were around his age group more often?

If he's never around other children - how do you know he's not acting his age? What are you comparing him too?  Don't worry - they change so much once they hit Kindergarten - 2nd grade - when he starts elementary school and if you then see a problem with him keeping up w/ his peers - that's when you need to worry and ask questions.  Good Luck.

i think you just need to leave him be...if he talks like a baby, say i dont understand baby talk, talk like a big boy...other then that, he is just a little boy still...

Nothing that's her fault.



"She makes us try new food"  "She won't let us run in the house"  "She didn't let us go outside" (it was pouring).  I have a good situation.  She is across the street, has kids the same ages, she's very reasonably priced, and uses a motherly instinct in addition to being a daycare provider.  That's been helpful with boo boos, seeing an illness come on, solving arguements and so on.  It's a godsend with a diabetic.  If Gina looks funny, she'll check her.  (last daycare did NOT ever follow-up with symptoms between checks.  If it wasn't 12:00 they'd just leave her there until they had to check next.  It's why we left.)  My new person also doesn't assume her kids are perfect - you know the type, if there's a problem it must be MY child.  She's not like that; she's objective.

We have had to pay full fees for every single day she has been away.  The only days we don't pay for is two weeks over Christmas while they are shut down.

I don't see any of these as the fault of the daycare center. I think they do an excellent job of taking care of my daughter! I can tell that she feels safe with and loved by the workers. That is the most important part. (well, that and the fact that they actually do go out of their way to keep the kids safe and show they care)



It would be nice if they could help my daughter with her homework so we could have more fun time at home. But honestly - I can't afford to pay the higher rates that I am sure would accompany that service. (since they would obviously have to hire more workers)



There are some kids that are hurting my daughter's self esteem. ... They make comments on her clothes not being nice enough or her taking so long to get a Nintendo DS and then not bringing it with her every day. ... But my kid has to learn to deal with the shallow people in the world at some point.



And when I was a kid, going to the same daycare center that I send my daughter to, we use to go on trips in the summer. Bowling, swimming, etc ... I was a bit disappointed when my daughter didn't get to do stuff like that this summer. But I'm sure they had their reasons. (money being tight, overprotective parents, or simply too many kids that )

I feel really fortunate that I've found such a great daycare for my son.



I really have no serious complaints.



One day, there was a 'substitute' teacher in my son's class and I walked in and heard Katy Perry's "I kissed a girl" song playing... Normally, they are listening to the "Farmer in the Dell" and "Old McDonald", etc... I wasn't too happy about that, but I didn't make a big deal out of it.



Other than that............ Not really anything.  I feel a little bad for my son right now, because he's still in the Newborn/Baby class and he's the oldest one in there... He's 1 year old and the closest other baby in age is like 7 months, so he's always wanting to go play with the big kids.... But they have a rule to not move Babies to the Toddler room until they are walking and he's not walking yet.  But I agree with their rule, so that's just something we are dealing with, LOL

I am just going with the flow. ... Instead of sending my daughter to bed at the new 8, I am putting her to bed at 7 something - moving it a little closer to 8 each night. Last night, she went to bed at 7:40pm. She woke up almost an hour early Monday and about 20 minutes early today. I think she'll be back on track by the end of the week.



Also, for a week or 2 before we "spring forward", I set our alarm clocks a few minutes earlier each day so we get use to the new times before they get here.



We made up for the earlier bed time by doing half of her homework this morning before school.

It depends on your income & how many children you have.  Right now I watch someone who has 4C, & 4C covers 75% of their day car expenses.  Here's an estimate on what your household income needs to be less than in order to qualify for 4C:
Household size 3
annual income $31,765
Household size 4

If it's projectile, call his pedi right right away.  If not, consider what he ate (ie., all junk with no substance-food, or snuck halloween candy in his backpack).  Give him a piece of toast or saltine cracker for a little substance.  It'll alleviate some of that nausea.  Ride that out for an hour or two.  If he doesn't continue to vomit, you might be home free.  If he starts again, with or without a fever, you need to call a pedi (dehydration can land you in the ER).  Stay on top of fluids even if he doesn't feel like drinking (no milk).  Good luck :(

i just took my 6 year old to the doctor yesterday for that exact reason. the doctor perscribed mylanta and told me to feed her crackers, applesauce and gatorade. today she was fine. doctor said a tummy bug was going around. anyway, for 6 years old, you might want to run to the store and buy a bottle of mylanta, and give him 2 tsp every 4 hours. thats what i did, and it worked. for the fever, i gave her tylonol cold, which is for fever, cough, and runny nose. she was all better today. poor little guy. give him hugs for me.

Calling all mothers! Did you have any problems living on the top floor?



My husband & I are moving to a bigger apartment in preparation for our little one. The buildings here are only 2 stories so it isn't very high. The bottom floors are nice as well but they just dont' feel as private or safe but my husband thinks the stairs will be a pain in the butt once the baby comes. Because it's only one flight of stairs I dont' really think it'd be a big deal. Also, the top floor apartment we're looking at is next to the pool & we're wondering if anyone has experienced a lot of noise? We live in New Mexico so 3/4 of the year is pool weather. Any advice would be appreciated!

acts with motherly instincts without a second thought.



I think we are maternal when we act like a mother without a second thought.  A child runs towards the road and 10 women nearby jump up to stop him.  A baby drops his bottle and all women within reach start to bend over to pick it up.



You have a maternal instinct if you act in these ways to any child, yours or somebody else's.

Need Some Advice From All You Mamas Out There!!!?



Well---Saturday I will be 41 weeks pregnant & as of yesterday at my doctors appointment I am 1 cent. dilated,50 % effaced, & -1 station. The doctor asked me if I wanted to be induced this week or give it one more week to see if he makes his own appearance. Now I know labor & timing of the actual labor is unpredictable so I would like to hear some of your experiences(for peace of mind) with being induced just in case the little guy doesn't decide to come on his own!

If your only dialated one and you get induced, you will likely have a c section.  Recovery is worse, breastfeeding is harder, and you may have to have subsequent c sections.  I'd wait another week.  Lots of first babies come at 42 weeks.

He will decide to come on his own, when he is ready. I would give it at least another week then if needed be induced. I was induced with my first, the day after she was due, but because he thought it was her butt he felt instead of the head. After she was born he said she could have waited a couple of weeks to come out. But she was healthy. My other two were natural and they came a week after the due dates.

I was almost 41 weeks when  they finally induced me. My daughter didn't want to come out. When I went to the hospital to be induced I 1 cm dilated and that's it. Nothing else. I went in Monday night at about 7, and by 5:48 Tuesday Night I had my beautiful bundle of joy! I was induced with piticion(SP) and I also had a cervidal(makes your cervix dilate). But I didn't have any pain due to my doctor giving me an epidural 30 min, after they broke my water. I had about 30 min. of contractions and they were really bad, until I got the epidural. If you are really wanting your baby I would say go for it! He is fully developed and everything will be fine. The longer you wait the bigger he will get! Good Luck and Congrats!

I was induced. It had good points and bad points. I really liked knowing when I was going to deliver, I got my hair cut, got a shower, went out to eat with my husband and family that was in town, had everything all packed up, and relaxed until I left for the hospital. That part was great. Actual labor was a nightmare. 17 hours, first epidural failed, second epidural dropped my BP to a dangerous lvl, it wore off at 8 cm. at 9cm my cervix swelled and my body wanted me to push but I couldn't so I spent about an hour trying my hardest not to push (worse part of the whole thing) then I got a fever right before my son was born so he came out with a fever and I didn't get to nurse right away b/c he had to go to the nursery. I did not have to have a c-section, and both me and my son were just fine, so everything ended up great, but if I had the choice again, I don't think I would induce. Either way you choose, you will have your baby soon!!!!



Edit- I was able to nurse later just fine. I was Almost diliated 1cm when they induced, I wasnt even all the way a 1.

I have never been induced and carried my kids 42 and 41 weeks. Both my babies were huge (8 and 10 lbs) and I am little (heaviest weight before pregnancy 125  and always a size 4 or smaller). My best friend was induced and is planning to just let it go this time. It was terrible she said. My mother was induced twice and went natural once. She says that the pain was 10 times worse with the induction.

Unless your baby appears to be getting too big, I'd wait one more week and see how things are going.



I waited until my daughter was 1 week late to be induced. ... I guess the pain levels vary by person. Yes, it hurt, but through most of it I was more "extremely uncomfortable" than hurting.



I never made it past 4 cm and ended up having a c-section. That wasn't as bad as people told me it would be either. (although, i never had a natural birth experience to compare it to) The first 36 hours or so were exhausting. But I only ended up taking like 3 of the pain pills the doctor prescribed me. And those were after dumb moves like trying to get to my bedroom after my cousin left a piece of sheetrock in the doorway.



(I know this may be more info than you asked for. But people made me so scared of pain before my daughter was born! ... I did all that worrying for nothing and would like to help ease the minds of other mothers.)

I was induced with all three, actually with my third my water broke on it's own but I went for the pitocin. My first two labors were great. But my third was really painful. they kept on pumping up the pitocin. but I wasn't progressing that well. But if you are patient enough to wait then wait another week, if not go ahead for it. I have heard lots of stories that the contractions are harder with pitocin, for me that wasn't necessarily true, I think it hurt worse with my third because I was fighting the contractions and not relaxing with them. (yes it's possible). So if you can wait then go ahead, it's very rewarding being able to go into labor by yourself, that is something I was never able to completely do my self and I wish I had been able to.

Are my parents over protective? HELP!! How can I get more freedom?



I am 15 and my sister is 14



They will not allow me and my sister to go to the mall by ourselves, even if we stay together and bring a cellphone.



We are both homeschooled. My parents WILL NOT let me go to public school or anything.



If I want to ride my bike, I only get to ride on the part of the road where my parents can look out the window and see me.



I'm also not allowed to lock or close my room door unless I'm dressing.



Me and my sister are allowed to stay home alone TOGETHER (if that makes any sense) but only if my parents will be gone for a short amount of time, like 20-30 minutes. I am not allowed to stay home alone by myself.



These are only SOME of the things they do.



Are they overprotective?



If so, how can I make them give me some freedom?



I know they do this because they care about me, but I want to be able to look back at my childhood and remember having freedom and fun. I dont want to look back and remember having a boring and sheltered life.



PLEASE HELP!!

I was raised the exact same way (cept there were no cell phones).  Yes it's overprotective.  I have news though, it's not likely to change.  They're not trying to be mean they believe it's the best thing for you.  What I mean is, reasoning with them or changing your behavior isn't likely to change their minds.  You sound like a good kid already.  You are me 20 years later :(  Got to stick it out and keep focus on adulthood.  My problems lasted long after 18 (adult).  It was one of those "as long as you live under my roof" things.  I had a curfew at 22, and they had no problems taking my car keys away or limiting the phone.  I'm really sorry I don't have better news for you.  They're still good people, you wont grow up to hate them.  Resent them maybe, for a while.  But you'll never lose the love you have.  You'll just understand better why they did it, even if it was over the top.

I'd say they are way to over protective!



When I was young my parents let me do anything I wanted basically, they believed that I should learn from my mistakes and find my own way in the world. Im now 23 and have been independant since about the age of 16. I found I grew up really quickly and was really mature by te age of 17. I couldn't wait to move out and go to uni!



I'd say.. talk to them, tell them how you feel and get them to talk to other parents, because their more likely to consider a bit more freedom if all the other parents are like that.



Good luck :)

Well, it does sound like they are slightly overprotective.  It's good that you realize that they are concerned for your safety.  With that said I would sit down with them and try to work out some sort of a plan where you can get a little freedom.  Ask if you and your sister can go to the mall during the day and only for a small amt of time to start out with.  Let them know that you will be going to college in just a few years, so you really want to start to work on gaining a "little" independence.  Always try to find out what they need to feel secure and try to acknowledge that.  Good luck.

None of my kids ever enjoyed playing with their toys as much as they enjoy playing with non-toy items around the house.  A kleenex box (empty), the wipes, pulling the DVDs off the shelves, etc., are all my almost-1-year-olds favorites.  My now 2-year-old has finally really begun to play with cars and trains instead of the above-mentioned items.

My son loved a set of simple wooden blocks - the small cubes that have been around forever.  That and any type of vehicle that has wheels.  Bath toys are also a good gift because they get kind of scungy after awhile and you have to throw away the old ones.

My son loved cars and trucks, he loved spinning the wheels around and around.  that is common in little boys, the love of trucks. Best thing is that there are trucks and cars he got at 1 that he still plays with today.



and mega blocks, your son will son be at the age ( if not now) were he can put them together and start building things.. and that too is something they will use for a long time!

We bought a changing table but ended up making our dining room buffet our changing station since it was on our main floor.



I loved all the items like pack and play, exersaucers, bassinette, bouncy seat, swing... but they are really only useful for a few weeks or couple of months at best.  The pack and play is helpful if you travel.  I had sold all my stuff at a garage sale and then turned up preggo with #3.. so I borrowed all that stuff from other moms and it worked out fine.  Plus, it does make for a 'greener' earth ..

Clothes - especially newborn clothes. He outgrew them so fast and I ended up getting a ton as gifts. Most still had the tags on when he outgrew them.



Swing - He HATED it...but I think he was kind of an exception to the rule. Most babies love them...but I would suggest buying all that kind of stuff used because they use it for such a short amount of time.



Stroller - $300 wasted...its been used twice. But again we might be an exception. I prefer to wear him in a sling. The stroller is just too bulky for me to lug around. If anything I would suggest an umbrella stroller for when baby gets older and a sling or front carrier for when baby is still small.



Diaper Genie - a regular garbage changed daily works just as well and you don't need to keep buying refills.



Receiving blankets - he liked being swaddled for about a day and then I was stuck with dozens of little blankets that I couldn't do anything with.



Newborn shoes - baby doesn't need shoes until they are walking outside. Before that it is just a pain to keep them on and bad for baby's feet.



Pack and Play - we have yet to take ours out of the box and baby is 11 months. We bought it for traveling, but found that when we travel it is easier just to let baby sleep with us.

Yeah there are three things i wished i wouldn't have bought:



1. play pen - my son hated it and i just throw his toys in it and used it as a toy box.. it was a pretty expensive toy box!!! lmfao



2.  bassinet - Not one time did he sleep in it.. but he slept with me also, because i was scared something would happen to him..



3.  so many clothes - he had some many clothes that we bought and everyone else that there was so many outfits with tags still on them.. lol



That is just me though.. you might would love a bassinet (my sister loved hers)  but i had no use for one where my son slept with me when he was a newborn.



----------------



Trust me.. you need a stroller..  not a $300 one like that woman said.. but when you go to the mall or go grocery shopping, you need one!!



and get as many recieving blankets as you can!!  they are mainly used for when your baby spits up and stuff.. and after my son outgrew his, i used them to clean with.. they make great dusting rags.. lol

I wish we didn't get a swing for my daughter. It took up space and was rarely used. Luckily, we got it used from my cousin for $80 instead of spending the whole $200 or whatever it was new.



I also wish I hadn't been in such a hurry to get a playpen. ... I got a pretty cheap, basic one that was barely used. Then my cousin sold me one of those 3 in 1 deals that's a playpen, a changing table, and a bassinet. ... I got a lot of use out of that one! Will definitely save up for a nice playpen the next time around.



My mom spent quite a bit of money on a nice high chair. But once again, it was in the way more than it was used. ... It did come in handy a few times :) But more often I found it easier to strap my kid in her car seat, hold her in my lap, or put her in the travel high chair we had. (it could be strapped to a regular chair or just used on the floor)



Too many pacifiers and too many newborn size diapers! While my daughter did enjoy the pacifiers, I still feel that we got too many before she was born. And she outgrew the newborn size diapers before she used half of 'em.



We really didn't get many (if any) toys before Cheyenne was born. ... Friends and relatives gave us a few small things including a mobile to go over her crib. For toys, I waited until I got to know her and started picking up little things here and there.



While it wasn't a problem for me, you have to be careful if buying used cribs. Make sure they are sturdy and the sides go up and down as they should.



Oh yeah, I did regret the new breast pump (OUCH! That thing hurt - I only used it twice) and I regretted the cheap baby monitor (walky talky like things) that I chose. You should probably look up reviews somewhere like amazon.com before choosing them.

Like the other moms, I did not need so many new clothes or shoes. My baby wore sleepers 95% of the time for the first few months.



Baby towels, they are thin.. I hated them ... a regular towel is thicker and big enough to go around the whole baby.



Play pen, used it maybe 2 times..



any my son did not need a million toys to start...now that he is 3 there is so much stuff he has grown out of...



someone said stroller, I guess that depends on the family, we do not own a car so we walk every wheres and our stroller was used until it died LOL  so if your a mom who likes to walk, even if it is just up and down the road,,,, you will need one.  We did not spend 300$ tho...we spent  around 120$ for a great one from walmart that came with the car seat too.

We actually had two great baby showers and we really didn't have to buy anything.  I did buy a car seat way early in the pregnancy.  The only thing we could have done without was a day/night bottle warmer.  It's good for breast milk fed babies but the microwave was faster at warming the water for his bottles.



Yes I agree buy items used.  As I learned my kid only use certain items for a short while so I started browsing craigslist.org and found tone of items there.  I got my hands on a brand new car seat for my other car for half the price I paid for the first one.



Now that my son is 6 months I wish I purchased a convertible car seat instead of the infant carrier.  It's getting cold here and I got him a coat but he looks stuffed in the carrier and its difficult to buckle him in.  Now I have to either get a convertible car seat so he is comfortable or purchase a bundle me fleece thing so he I don't need to put a coat on him just to go from the house to car then into another building.  If I get the bundle me then I will have to take the carrier out of the car all the time.



I also use non-brand named formula and now walmart/target brand diapers.  I am starting to make my own baby food too so that will save me some money there.



I suggest whatever you buy, keep the receipt.  Your child may never use/wear something so you may want to take it back and get something else.

I didn't really use the boppy pillow or the diaper genie.  I'm a minimalist and I don't really see the point for a lot of the gear that other mothers swear by.



I would rather just wipe the dang grocery cart off than to lug around one of those cloth inserts.



Heck I don't even really use a diaper bag.  I just carry some wipes and a couple of clean diapers in a plastic grocery sack.  That way I even have a way to dispose of the diaper when it's dirty.  My husband calls it the daddy diaper bag.



Baby shoes are silly.  If they don't walk they don't need shoes.

oh you SHOWOFF!  You can't see me but I'm sticking out my tongue at you.  I haven't gotten a single thing.  I am going to shop early this year (my annual announcement that no one takes seriously).  I really mean it this year.  I'll take those recipes.  Evan is a REALLY picky eater.  Is it covered in peanut butter or chocolate?  That's half the battle.

I am actually pretty much done shopping for my daughter.  She's 19 months old and LOVES jumping so we are getting her a mini-trampoline, the kind with the handles.  Other than that, just some small stuff - books, puzzles, and stocking stuffers.



This year will really be her first Christmas eating real food, since last Christmas she was only 8.5 months.

What would you think of your kid of who you've wanted to ruin their present teenage life,..?



,..such as by either verbally abusing them by telling them that they won't amount to anything or calling them stupid, or ruin their chances with getting girls by sending them to military school, or do the same by sending them to a boarding or private school, or whatever mean thing you've done to them in their teenage life,..



NOW, what if years later after they've grown up, they got all the action with women they wanted despite you trying to ruin their chances when they were teens, and they became successful, in fact, they became even more successful than you, and they confront you and remind you of the painful crap that you put them through when they were teenagers and say to you,



"HA, I proved you wrong!"



Would you feel bad about how you treated years ago?
Would you finally have some damn respect for them?

My mom did treat me like that and , while i'm not as old as you, i've proved her wrong in at least 90% of the things she told me i couldn't do. She told me that i wasn't worth anything and that her life would have been better had i been aborted and that no one would want me.



When i tell her all of my accomplishments, and not even in a "ha ha you were wrong, i was right" sort of way...just telling my mom about me, she finds more things that i won't be able to do, more things that are wrong with me. It's non-stop with her. She's very determined to make my life a living hell. Thankfully, her opinions of me stopped mattering when i turned the age of 10.

I'm guessing your parents treated you this way, and you want to confront them?



I would probably feel pretty bad about it if my child confronted me.  But abusive/ controlling parents are usually in denial about the bad things they've done, or they don't realize how much emotional damage they caused.  If their kid came to them and said this, they might just deny they did anything wrong, or get angry.

Um.... well. It seems to me that the parent in this situation just wanted what was best for their child, for them to do well in life.



And if the child becomes successful, then the parent would not feel bad at all. They would be proud of themselves and hopefully their child too.



And if my child was still acting like that later on in life, it would just prove to me that they still hadn't finished growing up, and no, would not cause me to respect them. When they could acknowledge that i was doing my best for them, and that I SUCCEEDED and were grateful for everything i sacrificed FOR THEM then i would be able to start respecting them as an adult.

My father was abusive to me and my siblings and my mother until he moved out when I was 14, he told me that i wasnt pretty and that he would be the only man that would ever WANT to love me, he told me I wasn't smart.



Now I am happily married, have 2 beautiful babys and a third on the way, I graduated a major CA state college with a double major in human sexuality and psychology. And just to throw it in: my children are beautiful because they take after both me and my husband.



I want to tell him he was a terrible father, and that I've over come the obstacles that he has put in my way.  But it is not worth it. he to this day doesnt think he ever did anything wrong, he seems to think he is the perfect father.  And i have just had to accept it.



I think the hardest part is just realizing that you dont want to be like your dad.  You and I both felt like we should rub it in his face, but he will do it to himself, he might never show it.



So in your heart you have to know that you ARE the one that came out on top.

Verbal abuse is never a correct way to get through to a child....but maybe your parents dont know how to express their frustration or concerns because they never had the proper encouragement. I dont think wanting you to go to a private school or military school is so they can "screw up" your chances with girls,maybe they thought,in their own weird way, you weren't emotionally ready or mature to get "all the action" as you put it with young girls. Maybe you should let them know in a non-aggresive way, that alot of things they did hurt you and all you want is for them to realize that your a good person and deserve to be treated better. If you get in their faces they will feel as though you are attacking them and everything you were trying to say will fall on deaf ears. Maybe you should see a therapist and express your feelings to them,and they can help you find a healthy way in confronting your parents...good luck!

sounds like how my parents treated me too



and yes i did prove them wrong but not before it almost shipwrecked my life in what ought to have been my prime-time years



not that my parents will fess up in any way to any mistakes whatsoever



i am 40something and they STILL blame anyone and everyone apart from themselves (and have abused my nephews and nieces in much the same way)



so have not made my parents a part of our lives in anyway - my own kids didn't know they were their grandparents until after they started school as a result and i will never EVER leave my offspring with them under any circumstances whatsoever



with my own offspring - i don't berate them - we have fun (probably more than the average family as i know that his friends LOVE being here cos we joke around so much) and so we have intelligent happy children who enjoy life and enjoy coming home at the end of a school day too

My father, when I was a 14 year old virgin, called me a **** because I had acne. He is a very detached and cold man. At times, he can be nice, though. (weird but true) I haven't seen him for many years and it is me who makes the contact and me who drives the 6 hours to see him. In my opinion, I think that it has to do with many things-



like how the parents were raised
how young they were when they had the child(ren)
was the pregnancy unplanned
etc. etc.
Sometimes, parents may have some resentment for their children. Maybe they grew up too fast and they look at their child as someone they are competing with, instead of someone that should be a role model. Did the parents drink or use drugs? this is a big factor.



I don't think that a child will be sent to military school so that they don't get any "action" . That is, unless the teen were sleeping with multiple partners and was bound to catch a disease or something.



As for the parent feeling bad about the treatment, I would have to say for the most part that even if they did feel bad, they won't admit it. When a parent calls a child stupid, I believe that the moment it comes out of their mouth, they feel bad.



Now, if this child is you or a friend of yours, please just try to move on. I'm sure your parents have.  When you ( or whomever you are talking about) have children of your own, just make sure you treat them different than how you got treated.

If she had diarrhea/vomiting and wasn't eating for a couple of days, and had a decrease in wet diapers.
Fever over 101 for over a couple of days.
Signs of ear infection.
Difficulty breathing not helped by inhaler.
Seizure or rapid, shallow breathing for prolonged period of time (an hour or more with other signs of distress).



And of course any serious injury or accident (serious fall, etc.).  Thankfully, we haven't had to deal with this yet!



I would first try to contact my doctor/nurse practitioner or call TeleHealth (Canada has a phone number where you can speak to a nurse practitioner 24/7 but they usually tell you to go to the hospital unless it's something minor to cover their butts) before going to emerg, but if it was the middle of the night or after hours, I would go to emerg.

It just depends how old the child is. I would go there much quicker with a newborn than with a child of school age.
At 8 months, my son had gastro.  He vomited once in the morning then nothing until late afternoon when he started to vomit 3 times in a row and have diarrhea.  So we went to the ER.
Then at 2 years of age, he had a high fever that lasted 6 hours and he was falling asleep all the time even with paracetamol so I took him to the doctor.

I would say for more than 2 or 3 days. However, if the fever reaches temps of 104 or above you need to take them right away. Kids react different to adults for common colds and tend to vomit, so if this has been going on for a day or two with low temps wait it out. If it lasts longer than that, it could be a bacterial infection and you should take them just to be safe.

Would you ever consider taking in a "friends" kids as foster kids?  How do you think that would work out?



I am slightly considering taking in a 9 yr old boy and a 5 yr old girl as foster kids.  My daughter is 5 and my son is 8, so it would almost be like 2 sets of older twins.  The kids have been pretty good friends for over 5 years & the mom (a friend of my husbands from way back) has got herself into some trouble.  She's on drugs and has not been caring properly for her kids for the past year or more.  She's always dropping them off here and there and disappearing for days or weeks at a time.  She got kicked out of her trailer over a month ago and has been living out of her car & letting her kids stay wherever they can.  Right now they are at their grandparents house, but I don't think that's going to be permanent.  They haven't been in school for over a month & their school keeps calling me asking if I know where the kids are.  I just found out today.  I just don't know how it would be since she is a "friend" of my husband and her brother and my husband are pretty good friends too.  As far as her wanting to come visit them whenever she wanted....being an old friend....how would I set boundaries.  Would you even consider doing something like that?

Wow, good point Katie!!  I'm only slightly considering it??  My husband will probably never go for it anyway.  I just feel so bad for those kids being shifted around & if they came to live with me, at least they would feel comfortable and safe.

I would! But it would have to be done with children's services. They more then likely know your house rules already so it's like you said they have lived in your house.  you have a great heart.  good luck.

i tried caring for 2 of my friends kids,whilst she was in piala unit(drug rehab) and she walked out twice and turned up at my house,the 1st time Family services took her back,the 2nd time Family services took the kids from me,it wasnt working out at all.it also put strain on my relationship after that,cos i didnt want to give up on her,
in the end,i had to step back,i was too emotionally involved.
over here they usually dont let you foster kids if you have kids under 12 yourself.i see where your heart is,check into it more,goodluck..

U need to be the one who contacts the authorities and tell them ur story.. You may or may not be the one who gets to Foster these kids..



Either way.. they will be in better hands..



So once they go to foster care..



U will be at the top of the list.. and you don't have to set any boundaries.. the state does..



so it is not a bad deal if you are financially  able to support these kids.. and I am sure they will be happy sleeping on the floor.. but  unfortunately it does not go that way..
There is much more to it than you think...



There are interviews and inspections.. So I no ur heart is in the right place.. but if you can't do it.. let them go where they will feel loved and safe..



Each child deserves this..

This could be a very touchy situation. I would suggest having a child advocate lawyer draw up the terms. Without that you could have severe legal troubles down the road.
Depending on the state you live in, turning the children over to you without going thru childrens services may not be legal either.



I know in my heart I would try it, but I would cover my bases, and my behind.

well I would consider it, I was a foster parent years ago but it was through the local government agency, wow tough situation........if you were to go to the authorities they might just put the kids with other relatives first and if no one wanted them they would consider you, you and your husband would have to go to some type of classes I think ( my ex wife and I did) and it would be better going through the government as you would not have to shoulder ALL of the financial burdens yourself, and if you were to go through the system and do it they would put rules and restrictions on the parents that would benifit you and the children,good luck I hope it all works out ...........did you do your push ups?

I see Katie's point, but at the same time, I'd rather these kids be exposed to positive role models and family structures/values.  If you've already instilled these things in your own children, healthy discussions about the differences between your family and these kids' ought to keep your own kids from picking up negative behaviors/attitudes.



I had some students in my class one year who were good friends, but one mom didn't like her son going to the other's house b/c she didn't like their family values (or lack thereof, lol).  So instead of letting her son go over there, she was happy to invite her son's friend over to her house.  She liked the idea of him being exposed to their values and knew she could keep an eye on her own son at the same time.



As for the actual undertaking of such a large endeavor, my heart would totally be in the same place yours is in.  I know that if it weren't for my husband and his stubbornness, I would have a house full of foster kids from my school.  I think the kids who are a little older are the ones who are most critical.  They're at the cusp of falling into the same bad lifestyle, and if given the right direction, love, and support, they could change.  Talk with your husband about it, and if he's at least open to the idea, you should call your local DSS and see if they have some information on what foster families should know.  Maybe you could even talk with some other foster families in the area.  I do know from my own experience as a teacher that having the mom come over should be during scheduled visits.  The kids should be in counseling the entire time, at school and with an outside professional.



Best of luck with your decision!

That would be a life changing tough situation, you are going to have to do a lot of talking with your husband and really do what your heart tells you is the right thing to do . As far as the mothers rights are concerned I think the State will help you in all of the legal areas .



Good Luck and no matter what your decision you should be commended for considering this move.

Is my 10 year old son hurting my 9 month old baby? If so, what do I do to protect the baby and my 3 yr. old?



When the baby was 3 months old, I asked the 10 year old to hold him for a second while I made a bottle, the baby cried, my 10 year old shook him. This Mon. night I was putting dinner on the table, and I heard the baby scream, he was bleeding all over, his 2 little teeth had been knocked out. I left him in his playpen, but my 10 year old took him out, and then said that the baby had fallen. I don't believe him. I had to pick my 10 year old up from school that day early because his teacher said she was unable to control him. When I was pregnant with our 3 year old, my oldest child kicked me in the stomach. He has a history of acting out. I need to know what to do for ALL of the children.

VERY Serious and I wonder why you haven't asked his doctor yet.



It could be as simple as he isn't adjusting well or as serious as a neurological problem.



I think you need to talk to the doctor about this before the babies get hurt even more and this drives a wedge in your family.

do not leave the baby with your son(at least not at the moment)
you need top address why he is so angry! .. (consistent parenting is the hardest thing any parent has to learn) time out is needed here def
i once took care of a little buy who acted out like that,, first take a deep breath.. dont allow him to physically hit you... you MUST oput him in time out and be the boss(no physically)
but remove him from the area and try and better his behaviour by only prasing the good things he does..
with phil i used to ignore his bad behavior and when he got bad i would put him in time out.. kids hate the silent traetment.. you may need to seek professional advice here.. where is his anger coming from . is there any violence anywhere?? he needs help, you shouldnt have to be in a place where you fear your son.. He is 10. I have an 11 year old , they are not meant to behave in this way...no not at all...

First off I let me kids know whose boss weather is yelling or an appropriate spanking.  Dont talk around him about how he cant control his temper.  My daughter learned something at school that allowed her to be mad.  I told her if she wanted to see mad to let me know.  You cant stand for it and if you laugh at it or talk about it like it is a symptom  then thats what they think they cant control it.  You have to somehow teach him to control himself and not throw what I call a tantrum.  Is he maybe jealous of the baby that maybe u need to prove to him you love him with some one on one time.  Goodluck

I think you need to become a better parent! sorry but your child learns from you, perhaps your lack of discipline may have something to do it.



Could also be out of attention. Even bad attention is better than no attention. Talk to your kid - he is 10 and you should be able to have a conversation with him. Try to spend alone time with each one during the week. Even if it is a quick drive to the shops and a milkshake or something.



Seems like it is all down to a lack of parenting from you. No offence - but this site isn't called "tip toe around the problem". Sometimes we need someone to come straight out and say it. Also, get help from other people, family, friends, doctors etc.



And also, dont put your 10 year old in those situations - you are asking for trouble. It is like you are giving him a container of fuel and a match and saying "here you go darling".

this is serious, and I would trust my gut that something is going on with your oldest child possibly being abusive to your younger children.  I would start with your 10 yr old's school guidance counselor or psychologist and your children's' doctor.  You will probably need to do some blood work to rule out a chemical imbalance or tests to rule out physical problems that might affect behavior.  Try to think back as to when he started showing signs of violence.  I would also press your doctor for a possible referral to a child psychologist for both private sessions for your 10 yr old and possible family counseling.  Is Dad in the picture?  What relationship do your children have with their Dad?
Hope it works out for you.  Whatever happens, your first priority is to keep the little ones safe.

You need a psychiatrist for your boy, pronto.  The violent behavior is not normal, its more than acting out.



It will also not go away on its own and if you don't do something now, you will have a violent teenager that will be imposible to control.



Do it for him or he'll be spending his life in jail or severely hurting or killing someone.

Help about husband????



I'm at the end of my rope.  It started off with me and my husband arguing because he kept our kids up 1 1/2 hrs past there bed time.  My 2 kids are serverly ADHD with other behavior disorders which makes keeping them on a schedual VERY IMPORTANT.  He wroks 24/7 so I am practically a single mom with them.  I simply told him that he makes my life very hard when he changes there schedual because then it makes them think they can stay up late every night and I am the one who has to deal with the melt downs and not him because he isnt home.  He completly freaked out and told me I was a horribble mom whom my kids feared and would hate me later in life simply because I discipline them, keep them on a schedual and heaven forbid spank them ( a couple of swats with the hand) or take privlages away when they dont obey.  He PASSED OUT on the couch and I mean that literally from having a few drinks but yet I'm I'm the bad guy.  He was screaming about how me and my family were alcoholics because my sister is in college (yes she's gonna drink), and my brother is a VERY sucessful VIP whom likes to party about 3-4 times a year.  ME apparently I'm an alcholic becaue I like to have 1-2 drinks a few time a week (glass of wine with dinner or a couple of beers with the football game)  I dunno what to do I'm so fustrated???

If you don't feel like you're able to talk about it calmly with each other, without it turning into an argument, go to counseling. My parents have one of the most dysfunctional relationships I've ever seen, but when they were in counseling things were a little bit better. Really I would just suggest trying to talk to him, without accusing him of anything, start things with "I" and don't place blame. Know that you aren't a bad mother or an alcoholic, that none of it's true etc. and that he's saying those things because he's angry about something else.

your situation sounds like a serious one; i would try to sitting down with your husband and discussing to him how important your children's schedule is to you, an the two of you can maybe attempt to make some compromises. all children need discipline but some parents don't see eye to eye on how to discipline their children. hopefully your husband will ease up a little bit an understand where your coming from.

I may not be an adult or anything but from a teenagers point of view I think you sound like a good mom you care about your kids and want to raise them right. Believe me you are not the bad guy at all I think you and your husband need to just sit down at one point and talk about everything calmly and collected. Try to come to an agreement on things. And the whole passing out on the couch thing after drinking I think you should watch out for if it happens multiple times because he needs to realize he has a family and that alcohol and working a lot is just going to make times pass by quickly for everyone and he will miss out on your kids lives and yours together. I'm just saying these things I've had experience with a parent who would drink and work alot and it stole a lot of memories from us, just don't let that happen to you guys.

When you spank your kids, spank them once not a couple of taps, when i was younger my mom would spank me shed grab my feet pull them from under me and smack me at least 7 times, what was the result of that a kid at the age of 8 who tried to commit suicide by hanging myself only for my sister to get me down after " the lights went out", i had no friends when i was younger and i told my mom she was a b**** and moved out for 3 months when i was 11, so spank (not repeatedly) and stop with the strict schedule, i hated my mom as a child because of the schedule she had me on, you'll only teach them to fear you, and when they get older they''ll tell you straight up when you go to spank them " if you spank me ill smack you back" or they'll threaten to prosecute you, plus you say he works 24/7, well if he does let him pass out he works hard, take it from me i get up at 6am go to school and go to work right after and work till 12:30am do homework and go to bed, and when my mom says why didnt you clean when shes on her *** watching tv i get pissed but dont yell at her because its disrespectful, but still i hope you got my point, slack and let slack

Take a hard look at yourself. Take a hard look at your situation. Are you happy? Doesnt sound like you are with your situation. Sometimes it is easier to be own your own with two kids than it is to be looking after three (your husband is the 3rd).



He probably has some good points in this argument. This is where you need to sit down and discuss the problem. Why must he work so much??? Surely your lifestyle cant be that important, that you would put it in front of your children.



when a kid grows up, it doesnt remember that it had every toy and the best designer clothes - they remember all the good times they had as a family.



Read this quote on the side of the road "These days we give our kids everything and wonder why they dont turn out like us". So true. Tell your husband to find another job. Simple as that - if he refuses you know deep down in your heart that things cant go on like this and will end in divorce, better do it before the fighting really affects the kids. If he agrees to work less or find another job, then give it a try. Nothing lost, perhaps something gained?

People say mean things when they argue, so don't take his comments personally. As far as your husband goes, I would try to talk to him later on when you're both calmed down.  Gently tell him how you feel and why you are upset.



It sounds like you are so over-burdened with having to take care of the kids all the time that it's taking a serious toll on you emotionally.  Hell, I would have a couple of glasses of wine too!  I would suggest just relaxing and enjoying your kids, even with their difficulties.  I think it's good to have children with ADHD on a good schedule- nothing wrong with that.  But you might feel a lot better if you stopped trying to control some things and just "let it go."



Maybe don't worry about having the house perfectly clean?  When the kids are acting up, instead of letting it turn into a big ordeal, take a time out for yourself and think, "Is it really worth the battle this time, or can I be more flexible with them?"



Also, when your husband is with them, just let them do thier own thing together (besides letting them stay up late).
Kids suffer a great deal when their mom is stressed out, so focus on taking care of yourself whenever you can.

I know everyone hates the self help books but this one really worked for us and my husband even put some effort into reading (well listening to it because I ordered the CD for him to listen to while in drove back and forth to work).  It's called Love & Respect, The Love She Most Desires and The Respects He Desperately Needs by Dr. Emerson Eggerichs.  We have been married for 19 years and I learned things about my husband I never knew.  He also learned about my needs.  You can get it with a work book but we never did the work.  When we both were in the car we would listen to it together and I often found myself asking him....is such and such true for you too?  And he the same.  Also nothings wrong with having drinks but maybe while you guys are working through this you both should pull back.  Drinking intensifies the emotions and things are pulled out of perspective.  If you want to use the book or CD bring it to him in a way that you want to learn more about his needs and it would help if he read or listened to it with you so that he can comment.  Don't throw a marriage away.  It's a lot of work but no one said it would be easy.  Down the road after you've worked through all the ups and downs (trust me there will be more) you will see how each time it gets a little easier and how it all was worth it.

I don't know if you two would consider eliminating alcohol from your lives. It wouldn't hurt. I know people who have major personality changes with just a few drinks. Consider it. There may be less screaming and more patience with the kids. We both come from homes people drank too much and we made a pact early on not to have alcohol be a part of our life.Going to  church or seeing a counselor would help too.

It's obvious he doesn't love you - if he did, he would not think work is more important.
This is verbal abuse and you do NOT have to put up with it. I didn't realise how badly my x treated me until after he left. It was then when I was able to take a step back and realise, hey I AM a good mum!



You are not the bad person here. Sorry to ask, but are you sure your husband isn't cheating on you and using "work" as an excuse?



Like some have already said, it already seems you are a single parent - maybe it's time to actually be one. You can do it, and you are strong enough to do it - stronger than you probably realise. Don't take his bs because all it is is wind!

Do you think government should regulate "kid's meal" content?



i do.
we have one shot to make sure our kids not addicted to fried and unhealthy food at their early age.  i think government should step in and regulate not only the nutrition requirement, the calories, sugar/salt content and how the food is prepared (no fried food) for our kids.
this is one aspect to deal with the growing obesity among our children and when parents have to order for their kids, wouldn't you agree?

I don't think it is the Governments job to regulate what goes into children's foods (unless it's a safety hazard).It is the parent's responsibility to know what goes in their kids.Why should tax payers have to spend money on supporting yet another government "project" just because of some parents negligence?



There is no problem with a kid having a greasy, fatty happy meal ONCE in a while.Some parents just don't understand the importance of controlling every day portions.It's not just with fast food, it's with juice, cookies, chips etc.



When I was visiting my cousin, her 3 year old daughter consumed one jug of juice in two days.It is people like her that are contributing to the "obesity" epidemic.



My kid eats mostly organic foods.He does get junk once in a while, but that's about it.



I see what you are trying to say, but there are alternatives.

unnecessary and doesn't begin to address the problem.  most kids are eating food prepared at home most of the time.  the odd meal out isn't really even the issue.  unless you're going to send the police to everybody's kitchen it's not going to help.



would you seriously ban kids from ever eating anything with salt or sugar or anything fried? why not do the same for adults while you're at it? i'm pretty into the healthy eating thing, but i don't think taking my kids out for burgers and fries once a month is really going to hurt anything at all.

The parents have 100% control of what they feed their kids. You don't have to take them to McDonalds for a kids meal. You can take them to a vegetable stir-fry restaurant and order off the kids menu. You could get them the broccoli and rice meal. If the kids do beg and cry for McDonalds you can say NO since you are in charge, or you can get them a grilled chicken sandwich and some apple slices...

To parents who'd ever lost a child, had anyone ever told you that your loss was "easier" than theirs?



First of all, I'm sorry for your loss, and I'm sorry if I remind you of that now.
But I've had people actually saying things like, "Your loss is nothing compared to (someone else), because of (this and that)."
They think that losing a child at younger age is "easier" than older, or when the child had been ill, it's "easier" because you are prepared, compare to those who had accidents, etc.



Personally, I don't see the difference. You lost a loved one, you grieve.
I don't think it's appropriate to tell someone that their loss was an "easy" one.
What do you think?

OMGosh.  I can not believe someone said those things to you.  My heart goes out to you for losing a child.  I think that a parent having to bury a child is the absolute worst thing in the world.  If you lost a child during your pregnancy (I have), or you lost your child when they were 80.  Every parent grieves the same.  Regardless of how you lose your child, every parent will hurt the same.  There is no situation that is "easier" when it comes to losing a child.

Yes I have heard that. I have had several miscarriages. I have never had to actually bury a child. I think to me anyway that might be a bit more difficult. I never heard the heartbeat of those babies and never got to see their little faces. I know that it is a very hard thing to lose a child no matter what stage of life. I would never tell anyone that their loss was easier because I know the pain. But to see your child and then see it gone, I can't imagine going through that. I hope I never have to.

although I've never lost a child, I could never imagine comparing that to somebody else's  you cannot measure sorrow or loss. That's like saying bc a woman was a month farther in her pregnancy and lost the baby, that her loss and grief was greater than somebody else who was pregnant but a few weeks behind and also lost her baby.

My son was three weeks past his 6th birthday when he died after battling leukaemia for 7 months.



People said all sorts of stupid, thoughtless and sometimes quite nasty things to me during his illness and since his death.



One example was while we were in hospital.  The grandparents of a 6 week old who was having treatment at the same times as James said to me, 'It's easier for you because you have got to know your child and spent time with him.  We have hardly got to know Ellie'.



Ellie had one of the commonest types of leukaemia with a success rate of survival at 80%.  James had JMML with a survival prognosis of less than 50%.



I have also had all the 'God needed him' and 'he is in a better place' comments (I need him more than God and there is no better place for my son to be than with me)



I think the worst one was 'Well at least you still have Erin'. (Oh goody, I still have one child left, better not complain)



James died in January 2004.  Even after nearly 5 years I'm still grieving.  You don't get 'over it', you just find ways to 'deal with it' day to day.

I've never lost a child that was already born but my husband and I are desperate for a baby and have suffered four miscarriage...when we were in the hospital loosing the third baby I was whacked in a room on the maternity ward so I could hear happy new parents coming and going with their babies and I was dealt with by a heavily pregnant nurse. She looked me in the eye while I was crying and said "It's not so bad, you're young." I'm sure she was only trying to comfort me but I was tempted to punch her in the stomach and then scream "How do you like it? Don't worry you'll get another chance to make a new one!" (I feel awful about that now...)

i have not, my husband has. he did not lose his son to death his son was kidnapped at the age of 2.it is a little different though he was kidnapped by his mom. he came home to find a note on his door a few days after Thanksgiving saying his son and her were "getting lost" and he will never know him. she wanted to get back together he refused they had been broken up for a long time but the second we got married she flipped out and went crazy funny how she never cared when we were dating or moved in together we still had him 5 days a week. and people have told him things like "at least he is still alive" and "it could be worse, he could be dead". his baby boy will turn 4 in March and he has not seen him since. no one knows where they are or how his son is doing. he and his son were very very close and it has been so hard on him. i know it is better then him dying but he has had zero contact and zero knowing of him. to me that is pretty much the same.
when you lose someone you lose them. there is no better or worse. and personally i think losing a child to kidnapping or death it is the worst loss in the world. sick or not they are gone. and age would never matter it is all the same - the loss of your baby. sorry for your loss

I think one thing you do need to remember is that nobody's perfect. No, it's not remotely appropriate to tell someone that their loss was an "easy" one. But, when you're in that situation, you don't know what to say to a grieving parent, and you are desperately trying to say the right thing, it's dead easy for something to come out appallingly wrong. How _do_ you try to comfort someone in that sort of situation? I don't know. But I can easily imagine someone trying to gently help someone to see that their life isn't all bad, that maybe some of the things that happened were as good as they could have been in the situation, and it coming out horribly wrong.



And I'm sorry for anyone who's been in this situation too. I just know how often I open my mouth even in everyday situations and what comes out has a secondary meaning which is nothing like what I'd intended the person I was talking to to get from it.

Hello to all parents of school age children--have  you ever felt overwhelmed by the demands of your dog?



I am asking this in the parenting section because I recently asked the same Q. in the Pets &gt; dogs section and they raked me over the coals!!(I feel most of then were not parents of HUMAN children who said nasty things!)Anyway,we adopted a 7 month old puppy 6 weeks ago.He's a Lab mix,and I knew he'd be a challenge...I just did not realize how all consuming caring for him would be.I have 4 kids--3 are teens and my youngest is a mildly autistic 9 year old boy.I purposely waited to even adopt a dog until my children were much older,so that I would be able to take care of the pet,get help from them,etc..This pup barks so much,needs so much attention,etc...that I am really worn out.The barking also REALLY bothers my special needs son.My next door neighbor used to be a dog trainer and has been helping,but the pup is feisty!!
I was wondering if any parents out there ever felt similarly after bringing a dog into the home.
There are days when I think that 're-homing' him may be what is best...but I know my children would be very,very sad if that happened.(Especially my 13 year old son,who is most attached to the pup.)
Thanks in advance for any advice.

Oh yes, they do rake you over the coals on that section.



I'd adopted a dog just this past March, well after being trained with getting outside 'to pee etc, I felt I shouldn't complain to much but no matter what I did He wouldn't' stop attacking my eldest.



the biting on her face was the last straw and that's when I said--ok, I just can't handle this- Felt bad, and asked for advice on here about it but man I was massacred.



Dogs are a lot of work and as pups are worse than kids in my opinion and just not for some people.



You need to do a serious evaluation of how you all feel about it and then if the pup is happy. I know ours went to a better home, he just wasn't for us.

I always see mother pushing babies in pushchairs with a dog in tow being dragged along and think "who's sorry now".  Certainly the dog is.



If the dog doesn't fit your family, re home it and get a cat.  You should always put your children's needs first.

I am a retired dog trainer a mother and now a grandmother.So lets start by saying I think its great that you are even concerned about this dog with such a full house hold.What I suggest is getting your 13 year old into dog training classes so he can better learn how to handle this dog correctly and take some of the burden off you and in the mean time it will be a good life lesson for your 13 year old and it will help the dog to better understand his place in this family.This can be done,it just takes a little organizing and sharing of the duties.

My 5 year old daughter would love a dog but I understand the commitment they are and I am not prepared to make it.  Along with the fact that I am in rental housing so not possible.  I am one of those people who can't stand dog dirt on the pavement but yet know I couldn't poop and scoop so wouldn't take the responsiblity.  If you are prepared to take that responsibility and continue then I think pets are very important to children.  They teach responsibility and they provide comfort and a confidante to them.  This will be very important to your 13 year old.



As for your 9 year old I can understand your upset that it is upsetting him.  Can you find a way to cope?  What does you dog handling neighbour say - do they think things will improve and if so how much and how soon?  There is the problem that if you get rid of the dog because of your 9 year old your 13 year old may end up resenting you and the 9 year old.



A lab is a working dog so because of that is hard work but can be well trained I would have thought.  I would talk to your neighbour more and try and persevere but I understand how stressed you must be.



Personally I like cats - but that is not much help to you is it - LOL.  Keep going if you are following the training it is possible to get a obedient well behaved dog and a loving pet for your children.



Good luck!

I got my puppy at 4 months and really that first 12 months was just about surviving. Re housing is not really fair on the dog. You are already at least it's 2 home. What you may have is a dog who needs more company, As we speak I have my friends 10 month old lab running around the back yard with my dog. I am off to work soon and my friend is at work. So it works for both of us. They keep each other company and wear each other out. My dog has settled so much since we started doing this. It has been over a week since I got him (things got a bit hectic and it was due to rain. i won't get him in the rain as he gets all wet, dirty and stinky then I have to put him in the car to take home lol) and my dogs behaviour has gotton a bit baughty again. I just went and got this other dog and I know she will be more settled.



I am not saying to buy another dog but do you have a friend with a similar age dog that could "come to play'? The barking could be a bored thing (does he get walked enough?) or it could be a stress thing. Talk to your vet on options. I would never ever use the electric shock collar but there is one that the dog wears and when he barks it gives out a spray of some natural scent that dogs don't like. It does not hurt them (unlike the electric one , which the owners should be made wear for a day, if they use them) but discourages barking. Labs are puppies for the first couple of years so he will settle. Continue with the training and work out a roster for your kids to take him for a run morning and night. This will help wear him out.
Good luck, it will improve.

What “nasty” things might they have said? I have a feeling it was more like “Why did you get a puppy when you don’t have time to deal with one?” Puppies are full-time jobs in themselves. Like little kids, they need a ton of discipline. An adult  shelter dog would have been a far better choice in your situation.



Get your dog in obedience school if you’re not familiar with basic training techniques. If your kids want to keep the dog so bad, make that dog their responsibility. They need to learn the training techniques and use them, and they need to be walking him DAILY. One of the biggest mistakes dog owners make is that they fail to realize the value of exercise. It’s not optional if you want a happy, well behaved pet.

you might need to re-home him. i would do some research. some dogs are more dependent on humans than others, hence the consistant barking, hyperness etc.



i have had all sorts of dogs-boxers, labs rotweillers, sharpeis etc. they are all sweet and i loved them, but the best type i had was a boxer. the lab that i had, was very hyper,and alot of them are known to bark. if you have already taken measures for professional training (if you can afford it-it is ridiculous expensive!) you might have to look into a different type of pet. a lizard, cat, gerbil & hampsters, even exotic. dogs are high maintenence, period. i haven't had a dog in 5 years due to that. i want one bad, and i know my kids will love it, but if i can't give the dog what he needs, then there is no reason for him to be there.. your idea of an older dog might work also. they are already trained and if you get the right breed, very adaptable.



you have to look at your autisitc sons needs too-if the barking bothers him to the point that he reacts about it, that is bad news. i am familiar with autistic children and i see where you are coming from. a more docile and calm pet might be the answer for him. the kids may be attached, but you are the adult and the boss. you need to do what is best for your family and the dog. not just the kids' upset when you give the dog up.they will get over it, and it might be better to plan a day to give the dog up and get another type of pet.

Okay, let's put this in perspective.  You have FOUR children, one with special needs.  I think you are perfectly capable of handling a dog!  I know it is frustrating, I know it can wear on your patience, but if you give it time and don't give up, you will really be rewarded for it!



We got a dog many years ago- she was the most difficult dog I had ever been around.  I wanted to take her back to the pound.  It took over 8 months, but eventually she got better and now she's great.



I don't have kids yet (i'm 38 weeks pregnant) and I have 2 dogs.  I know it is going to be difficult, but they are a part of the family.



I say give it some time, keep working with your trainer and learn to laugh about how difficult it can be.  Dogs are great companions!

I don't know your age [and I don't] but I can understand your parents concerns. You are their little girl, and one's love for  their child can be seen as if their being mean but their not. It's just love.



And for the boyfriend you have now or want to have, can still be a boyfriend,  You don't have to let your parents know exactly how you feel about, except that he is a really good frien and leave it at that. And don't worry about your ex.

Have you tried the ignore technique? just ignore what she says and does because she might be just trying to get your attention. But it will have to be the other way around if she's jealous of the brother. You'll have to try to give her more attention. try both. first try more attention and if don't work try the ignore. For the ignore technique, try to keep her brother away from her.

You are allowing her to be the leader. you need to step up and show some real leadership. It sounds silly but I watch Cesar Milan's "The Dog Whisperer" and it has actually helped me understand the psychology of a pack (family) more. I know the show is about dogs, but read between the lines and the same applies for parenting.



Exercise, Discipline and then Affection. She sounds like she has too much energy, not enough discipline and far too much affection.



By saying this, my kids still get heaps of hugs and kisses - but only when appropriate and when they have "earnt" them. It works for me. If I tell my 5 year old daughter to do something - she does it no questions asked. She knows the reward is a big cuddle and kiss which is better than saying "here you go darling, have your t.v back now".

I'm getting my husband a new car this year he needs one I have the only good working car in the house. but since you got him a car and a watch last year I would take him on a vacation have someone watch your daughter for you if you need to or bring her with you. what types of hobbies does he have, does he play sports? go with what he likes his favorite sports teams and things like that. my husband has his ear pierced so I'm buying him a new earring. my husband also likes model air planes so I'm getting him some that you have to put together and paint. he is going to love it, good luck and don't listen to the haters.

Your first selection or both in the same dress.  The first selection the same but a little different but with the solid colored shirts does not clash.  The second selection, the plaid skirt on the one outfit and the plaid shirt on the other outfit are different and clash. The dress is really pretty and would be really cute if they matched.  So I pick either the first, if you want a more casual picture or the dress for both if you want a more formal picture.  Hope that helps!

Here we go folks --- just who is --- ?



So, the greatest questions in history have included:



1) Who shot JR?



2) Who pushed Tom King out of the Window?



3) Who was Victoria Fowler's Father?



4) What happened to The Mary Celeste?



5) Who is 'The Stig?'



All these questions pale to insignificance as I ask my ACTUAL QUESTION ---



Just who IS the 'Thumbs Down Gnome?'

4.  I heard this theory:  Some of the sailors were swimming in the sea near the ship (repairing the ship?) when a shark attacked one.  His screams attracted the other shipmates, and they ran to the side, and leaned on the railings.  One was faulty and snapped, sending everyone into the water to be eaten by the sharks.  (Well, it's a theory.)

Well you pose a great question. Im actually on that situation... we're canadians and my oldest daughter is attending a french immersion school she's in SK but she wont have any English teaching till grade 2!



We speak English at home and she writes in English and think in English but her reading skills have slowed down dramatically. Last year she was able to do a great amount of reading and now this year she's even having trouble reading "easy " words.



So Im not sure, I guess it takes some time for the kids to live in tha bilingual world for a bit, till they learn how to fully separate one language from the other. But it will take time, and I dont think they're confused, my daughter certainly isnt, she's just paying much more attention to one language than the other, for a while.

Babies will learn both languages as it is natural to them, if they are around both.
The same way a child learns english, they will learn spanish.
It just comes easy to them as their brains are developing.



My son goes to a home daycare, where they caretakers only speak spanish, so he is talked to, read to, sung to, in spanish all day long.
And then while I am with him, I can only speak english so I speak in all english.
He will learn both and speak both.

This is a question only a monoglot could ask.



Don't underestimate a child's capacity to understand his or her environment. Kids pick up things quickly. They are the epitome of near-total ignorance, but near-infinite intelligence. By that, I mean they might have the answers right off the tops of their heads, but whatever info you throw at them will get absorbed and processed until it's eventually understood.



I wouldn't throw differential equations at the kid, but i wouldn't hesitate to try to immerse him or her in more than one language.



Children put the use of language into context, meaning if they see one group of people, they figure out that they use this particular language (i.e., English). But if they recognize a certain other group of people, like relatives, they know to use thier other language.



English wasn't spoken in my home -- my parents wanted to make damn sure I was bilingual. I started out learning English from the TV. Learned the rest -- and used it -- at school. But once I got home, I had to switch lingos.



And guess what! I was never confused. I might also add that I grew to be more adept in English than many of my solely-Anglophonic peers.



Anyway, what I'd recommend is immersion. The kid will pick up the local language from his or her environment. You provide the rest of the language-building instruction.

I have Swiss friends who had this situation. They speak German and English. When they came to stay near us for a period of time, they were in an all English environment but spoke German in their home.



Their kids were just at learning to speak age and ended up learning to speak English because of playing with the English kids. Yet they were also learning German at home and understood it. The parents noticed that when the kids were in 'play mode' they spoke English as this is the context they learned it in.



When they moved back to Switzerland, they ended up in an exclusively French speaking community. They didn't want the kids to lose the English, so they decided to alternate the languages they spoke daily. One day they spoke English, the next they spoke German.



Then they also started sitting down and teaching their kids French and taking them to the park often so they can play with French speaking kids.



There were moments where the kids would speak sentences with some English and some German, but as they learn the language better they will learn to separate them. I think the key is to 'isolate' only one language for a small period of time. I imagine if you speak 3 sentences to them in three different languages, it will take them much longer to learn the difference.



Kids pick up things shockingly fast though! Not sure if that helped :o)

Good question...I asked my pediatrician that same question...we pierced my daughters ears at 4 months. The Dr told me about 3-9 months is normal. The earlier the better as they cannot pull at them as much and when they are older...its like they have always been there...less risk for infection.etc..

i got my daughters when she was about 4 months. but one feel out we took the other out and they closed (we could not find the one that fell out) if we do not do it again soon it will be whenever she asks. i think it is cute it is not that big of a responsibility and it does not look to grown up. so if she was 6 or 7 or even younger and wanted them i would get them. but that is it until she is at least 14.

<question>



What is wrong with my daughter?



She's 18 months, she's not walking but she will crawl over to me and grab onto somthing pulling herself onto her knees and either rock or bounce like that or put one foot flat on the floor (like she's about to propose) but nothing more, she's not trying to pull up to stand.  She will stand if you hold her hands or her torso and she will take a couple of steps towards you, lately when I stand her up on the seat next to me on the bus she has started to move her feet into a more comfortable position. She should be walking at 18 months, surely - I know her daddy's side of the family were all late walkers between 18 months to 2 years and she's very tall, but I was 11 months when i was walking.



She only says two words, mamma and Dadda. She's only just come out of the cooing and screeching stage to start 'babbling' but she doesn't know the words for anything, even though I've spent hour upon hour with her showing her things and saying 'ball', 'nose' 'teddy' 'dolly' etc.  And she doesn't make the connection for anything, like if I ask her 'where's your nose?' and point at her nose and then mine, she doesn't point at her nose, even though I've been doing that for months.



She will finger feed but she will only put a loaded spoon in her mouth if I load it and give it to her.



She doesn't point at things she wants, she doesnt hand things to me. She doesn't make the sign for 'all done' even though I've been doing that for months. She's never waved goodbye, even though we do it every day when dropping her off at nursery and picking her up.



The other day, she was playing with her giraffe, it's a thing with a hole in the top that you drop a brick through and it then sings a little song as the brick comes out, so whe was putting the bricks in the hole waiting for them to come out then clapping when the music came on, so sometimes she does things and really surprises me.



I went to a party at the weekend for Hallowe'en, and it really brought it home to me, the other children who are around the same age, where walking, talking (the odd word, but still) pointing at things and handing things to their parents.  They all looked 18 months old, and Heidi looked like she was 12 months old.



I can't sleep properly worrying and I'm not eating because of it, we're gonig to the doctors on Thursday, but I'm scared to death she's got autism or has learning difficulties, or god forbid something really serious.



Has anyone else experienced their children being really late starters? If so can you share your experiences.

Since you're seeing the doctor that's the main thing, and I don't feel the least bit comfortable making remarks on this question.  Still, I can imagine how worried you are.



If her father didn't walk until 18 months that's something to keep in mind.  As far as speech goes, many toddlers don't say much of anything until they're two or so, and then they just start talking.



I do know a little girl who was kind of an across-the-board late-bloomer, as her mother was; and the doctor referred the mother to a therapist who would show her how to do exercises with the little girl to encourage her development.



Don't forget, too, she could have something like a couple of different things (a late-blooming father and something like a hearing problem, for example).



I saw a program on identifying Autism in one-year-old babies, and it was showing how the babies did not make much eye contact or otherwise seem tuned in to their mothers (at least to the degree that non-Autistic babies were).  If, by any chance, your little girl had even mild Autism getting it diagnosed early is important, because children who are diagnosed early can be treated quite successfully.  That's something to keep in mind too.



It is said that Mozart didn't talk until he was four years old, and I think something similar is said about Einstein.  Also, on www.askdrsears.com (a reputable child development site) it is mentioned that early walking isn't necessarily a sign of a child's being particularly (in their words) "thoughtful" (they are being polite).  So, between all those things, walking late is not necessarily a sign of limited intellectual capacity.



Try to keep in mind that if she has some developmental delay that needs addressing she'll be getting the help she needs.  There's a good chance, though, she's just not in a hurry to do some things.  Try to relax.  If it turns out to be something to address you'll address it.  That's what parents do.



Sincerest best wishes that there's no problems (or only minor ones if there are any).

Yes, different kids develop at different speeds. And, Yes again you should love her unconditionally.
But, be sure to bring her for regular check-ups and jabs. No harm in seeing the doctor occasionally.

hi,



Do not worry, just give her some time. Kids develop at different "speeds" so she might be a slow starter but "accelerate" later on.



Do not worry, take it easy and relax.



She is and will be OK.

My daughter was a late starter when it came to walking and my Nephew was the same as well, where as my friends son was walking before one, everyone is different.  As for the talking don't worry too much it seems like aes till they start talking but once they start it happens really quickly, it's the getting them to stop that is the problem.
I am not going to tell you not to worry that would be pointless (although you shouldn't) because you will do it any way good luck everything will be fine I am sure.

I'm glad you're taking her to the doctors - there might be nothing wrong.  But you need your mind set at rest.
If it helps, my kids were all "precocious" - and it's not made a blind bit of difference.  They're all in their teens now, and average.  So early starters aren't an indication that they're anything special!

Why are people so scared that everything might be autism and please so not think i am being rude there is so much more to autism than you state here, Thomas pictured left was diagnosed with severe autism at 3 he had no speech even at three didn't even try to talk or play or interact with anyone, Please stop worrying about 'what might be' you need to just continue talking to her singing and just enjoying her while shes so young, she is only 18 months x

HI - my youngest was much 'slower' than all the other children his age he didnt walk until he was 23 months or talk til 3 but he is absolutely fine. Your daughter sounds normal to me. I also have one with autism but he was lining things up and screaming his head off for years before he talked! Have a chat with your health visitor but try not to compare your child with others- shes very young and it sounds like your a lovely mum.

I know.



My son, James, was diagnosed with Juvenile Mylomonocytic Leukaemia when he was five and a half years old.



He had a BMT in November 2003 but it failed and he died January 15th 2004 shortly after his 6th birthday and 4 weeks after the birth of his new baby sister.



Nobody will understand what you are going through and keeping a blog is an excellent idea.  I always thought of it as a way of 'downloading my brain' as there was such a mess of thoughts and emotions in there.



I have a website for James but tend not to post the link to it publicly.  Shockingly there are a lot of nasty people in the world who take pleasure in being abusive to families in crisis.  I will send you the link privately though.

No boys in the house alone behind closed doors.
No smoking in my house (and if your cloths smell of smoke, you wash them).
No going over the limit on cell phone expenses (if I'm paying the cell phone bill).
No driving under the influence, or you loose the car (assuming I'm the legal owner).



Otherwise, at 19, they are an adult.  You can mostly only hope that you've raised them well.  Beyond that, at that age, the only athority you realistically have over them is what behaviors are and are not tollerated under your roof.

For me it would greatly depend on my child.  Was she in school?  Did she have a job?  Was she lazy and just want to be supported?  I would not allow my child to live with me if they weren't going to school or had a job.



If she had a job and/or was in school, I wouldn't really care about her curfew as long as her grades were high and/or she was helping with housework, bills, etc.  She's an adult.



Boys-I'm not sure I would like boys coming over but I wouldn't mind as long as they behaved.  She still is living under my roof.



Clothes, makeup, internet, myspace- that is all her business as long as I'm not buying it for her and she's safe on the internet.



Driving- is also her perogative if she has her own car and insurance.  If I was paying for it, that would be a bit different but I woudln't pay for it unless she was in school full time (same with clothes, makeup, internet).



cell phone and texting- is also her business if I'm not paying the bill.

Hands off-- and her out of the house.  She's 19 for crying out loud.  I moved out at 18 and have been much better off. I had a curfew that I picked because I had work in the morning.  I dealt with the other gender on my own terms, bought my own clothes on my own budget, had to pay for my own Internet, car, phone, etc.



If they were 17, that's another matter, but 19, she can move out.

Curfew. I must say where and like long I go away.  At the weekend or better if I freely would have is it equal like long or whether I would remain spend the night.  Yet if I would have at the next day vocational school, or works must should I already to a sensible time home be.  It is more an Genetelmans Agriment than a Rule, but i am fair (and have self discipline) so my Parents are to.



Boys. I have a Boyfriend, i sleep by me and i by him. No Rules. My Mum have a talking about Pregnancy and prevention for a couple of years and i start prevention with 15.



Clothes. Yes, sometimes i must say to my Dad that what he will dress is an no go.



Make up. It is my thing



Myspace: Here my Parents teach me about Dangers in Internet. It is a Rule in our house not give any Private Information or Pics or clips to Stranges.



Internet. Just the same. In earlier years i have timelimits to use the PC. I can sit longer now when i want but mostly i do it not.



Driving. I MUST ask my Parents when i want there car. That is a rule they i never will broke (oh oh)



Cell phone & texting. We have a Flatrate so it is not a big Problem. But yes my Parents and Siblings want use the Phone to so i must be fair *laugh*

Boys: Date respectable boys and be discreet



Clothes: do your own washing, keep them in your room, and if she's paying, buy whatever she likes



Make Up: she's an adult she can where what she wants but i would give her tips especially if she prefered the inch thick foundation look (YUCK!)



Internet: keep under the limit and don't interfere with other people especialyl if others need it for work/school

I have had teenagers and it is quite hard.  They must fit in with the family's needs - I did insist that their behaviour at night was sensible - no noise, etc.
Otherwise at 19 they should be able to be in control of their own lives, to a certain extent.
I won't have boys/girls staying over - sorry, that is so disrespectful.  My two teenagers were boys, so their clothes weren't a problem.  My girl seem to be quite sedate in their clothes at the moment, hopefully at 19 they won't look like tarts.  (They're 16 and 13.)
Texting, etc - if they pay for it, it's their lives.

Kids TV not Beneficial?!?



Well, I just wanted your opinions on Kids TV, Good or Bad?



As I live in a top floor flat with my 2 year old and unless my partner is home we dont get out much because I have alot of trouble with my back and the stairs, so we spend alot of the day watching the Cbeebies channel. All I hear from parents is how bad kids TV is nowadays and how kids should be outside not watching TV. (Which we would given the chance!!) But I have found this channel to be extremely good! Everyday my little girl is speaking more and more and its all what she has learnt from watching the shows. (Some like the green balloon club and the pop shop thing are just awful) But most are great. She was counting to ten (With my help) before she was 2, she knows the difference in colours and can speak them, She knows a variety of animals and their calls, she is starting to sign with justin, She is telling the presenters what they are going to do before they do it lol And she only turned 2 at the weekend! It may just be me being biased but I honestly think this channel has made her the way she is along with my encouragement.

Do you feel marriage and becoming parents have to be a package deal?



Im just wondering how many people believe in "first comes love, then comes marriage, and then comes a baby carriage"? And if so, does marriage actually guarantee an ideal parenting/upbringing situation for a child? How do you guys feel?

i believe a stable relationship with the parents is what is needed first, not necessarily marriage. i got pregnant at 19 years old, with my boyfriend of 2 years. we got married directly after, becuase it was the "right" thing to do. we divorced a year later-we weren't ready. i think it depends on the people in question, completly. i am now re-married ( @29) and my hubby and i have our hard times, but we were ready and we can face all we need to together.



just becuase you are married doesn't mean it is the best enviroment for the child. i have met & admired many single parents (myself among them) and i will continue to. in fact, i think from my expirience, it is worse to be married have a kid and divorce, than it would be to have a child and wait a little . im not saying i think everyone should get pregnant and then get married, it just depends on the parties involved. alot of people, my self included, need to get their heads on straight before they make huge decisions.
i think the worse thing for a kid to deal with is his parents fighting over financial, general dicsipline & upbringing, and petty crap that could have been avoided. that is never an enviroment for a child-
i do agree with proud texas mommy, getting married before you have children but not because you are having children. it would be ideal if there were no mistakes, but there are. even the precious, loving kind of mistakes that you never regret.

good points have been brought out on this question that are greatly appreciated, ex. marriage does not guarantee longevity, how divorce affects children, and marriage not equaling good parents. Also, marriage does show commitment, makes it harder to walk away & sets a potential positive ex for kids

I feel that it does have to be a packaged deal.  That is the way God intended it to be, so that is the way I believe it should be.  Love, marriage/sex, then children.



If the marriage is a healthy one, then it will ensure a healthy upbringing for the child(ren).  I strongly believe marriages would be healthy if people followed the traditional save sex for marriage and then marry before children.  This is the most effective way, in my opinion, to secure a loving stable relationship therefore you can raise a stable, healthy family.

Stable relationships don't have to include marriage.Hell, my mom's friend and her boyfriend have been dating for thirty years and are still going strong without marriage (now they are getting married for legal issues because he is having health issues)



My child is a perfectly content and intelligent child.Me and my fiancee had him when we were 16.We didn't plan on getting married right away.We knew that if we were going to be together, marriage wasn't necessary right away.We will eventually, but it's not our main goal.



If you think about it, marriage is nothing but a legalized ceremony.Of course it's a great thing, but me and my fiancee made a commitment when we became parents.



But that's just my opinion.

I definitely don't believe you have to be married to have children. My husband and I weren't married when we conceived. We weren't married when our son was born either. We actually decided to get married and did when our son was 8 months old. Being married isn't a guarantee that you'll be a good parent or that you child will have the ideal upbringing. The only thing that decides that is the choices we make as parents.

No, I don't think that is true.  Just because you are married doesn't automatically mean you have to procreate, nor does it mean that you are ready or able to have a child.  Though, I do believe in waiting until marriage before sleeping together/having children, but that's my personal belief.
I've been married 8 months and have no plans on having a child any time soon, if at all.  I love children, but do not have that overwhelming desire to have my own.

I think that it would be best for you to be married to your BF or GF before starting a family together. I feel that way, because it shows a sense of commitment from both parts. Saying that they are in it together and for the long run. If you just have kids, the BF can leave at any time and so could the GF there is nothing really tying them down, they are not really in any kind of committed relationship.
And I don't see any reason why if you want to start a family, why you wouldn't get married. I would question why the person doesn't want to ask you to marry them. And I am speaking more for those BF and GF who are together and are trying to have a baby. It's different if the girl just gets knocked up on accident.

I agree with the others, you need a loving and stable relationship but that does not always include legal marriage. My partner and I are not married but have a wonderful relationship that many of my married friends envy.



Marriages split up just as often and just as fast as other couples, only difference is the price tag. If my partner decided to leave tomorrow he will be gone.. I won't have to pay someone thousands of dollars to have him out of my life.



We do have kids together, but we have a separate parenting contract taking care of them.... it is actually better than a marriage certificate because  child support and custody and all those issues have already been agreed upon...



we chose not to marry because I am a status native canadian woman who has a legal right to live and work here...if I marry an american I have to give that up. and I rather not give up my native status so if we choice to move to canada and live there we can.... and we hope to retire there..

Too many times people are looking at your son because he's cute, and adorable, and then they look up at the parent slightly embarrassed because it's sort of taboo to show interest in someone else's child, even innocent interest.  Are you sure they're not looking at your son?



I can't guess your age, because I'm terrible at that.  :P  But to me, if someone looks too young to be a little kid's mom I assume they're an aunt, a sister, or something like that.  Are you sure they're judging you?  I  mean... like did you do a Jedi mind trick on them to find out?



Joking aside, don't judge other people.  They might be glaring at you for a number of reasons, or they might be just making eye contact because of how beautiful your son is.  Sure, there's the odd one who might be looking at you and thinking "OMG she's too YOUNG to have a child!" but... teens in general are pretty self-conscious, and I don't think you're being stared at because of your age as much as you think you are.



You're probably being stared at because you're beautiful, your son is beautiful, when you're with him the love the two of you are sharing and such is beautiful, and it's wonderful to look at something beautiful.

There are medical conditions that can cause teenagers and even adults to wet the bed.  Please don't threaten to put nappies on your teenage daughter.  Speak to her and try to find out if she's not waking up, not making it to the toilet in time, etc.
If it sounds genuinely accidental (which I suspect it is) you need to visit the doctor.



I started wetting the bed at 10, when I never had as a younger child.  My parents initially put it down to the death of my grandmother, turns out I had raging Diabetes.  Please get your daughter checked out.

Assuming you mean 15 months and not years.  She probably is reverting because of the new baby, not uncommon.  My daughter I had her help with caring for her new baby brother, feed him, help change him etc..  15 months and nighttime trained, wow.  My daughter was about 2 when she decided to stop wearing diapers to bed.  Only problem was that she hadn't figured out the pooping and the potty.  She had waited each day to have a bowel movement in her diaper at bedtime.  The problem was when she stopped wearing diapers, she stopped pooping.  She literally screamed, she was scared to go.  My recommendation is to make sure they are comfortable going both pee and poop before night time training.

Hi Young OLD Maa,
You have a new born in your life after 15 years it self is a satisfying you but not your adolescent kid.
She must have undergone Mental ragging by self or Friends, suggesting her Emotional Mind that MoM is no longer belongs exclusively to her. She may not be nursing hatred with new born but definitely sporting inferiority complex and Bed Wetting at age 15 is



physical response, quite naturally.
I suggest as Follows:
1] Do not get Panicky for there is nothing Wrong with your daughter
2] Do not seek counselling Or trumpet your Problem to others in presence of your 15 daughter
3] Just do a good mother's Job to change Bed covers and her clothes
without murmur and resentment and Do Not Resort to Diaper usage
4] OFFER LOVE to 15Daughter as if nothing is wrong with her, reassuring her that she becomes your trusted lieutenant in serving the new born.
5] try to see if you get as much freedom with Child in care of 15daughter, and see her love expanding from minute to minute and Bed wetting stops sooner than you expect Naturally.

Bed wetting can be divided into two main types:



Primary Nocturnal Enuresis - which refers to persistent involuntary nighttime urination where the child has never had a dry night.



Secondary Nocturnal Enuresis - which refers to an onset of nighttime bed wetting after a dry period of at least six months.



Three of the most common reasons for primary nocturnal enuresis are:



Genetic predisposition - 75% of children who wet the bed have parents who had the same problem as a child.



Deep sleeping - studies suggest that children who wet the bed are very hard to wake up and have a hard time waking to an alarm clock.



Reduced production of vasopressin - an anti-diuretic hormone that directs the kidney to concentrate the body's urine so your bladder doesn't overfill.
Two of the most common reasons for secondary nocturnal enuresis are:



Urinary tract infection.



Stressful situations at home or school. A bed wetting preteen is not lazy. They are not undisciplined. They have a problem and will need the help of a physician. Even though most preteens will grow out of this condition in time, it will benefit your child to get this help, as during this time their self-esteem is being affected.



Tips



Don't make a big deal out of a wet bed. Show your preteen how to strip the sheets and do a load of wash.



Never punish your preteen for wetting the bed.



If you were a bed wetter, share your experiences with your preteen.



Keep this between your preteen and yourself. Sharing this problem with other family members or friends will only serve to embarrass your preteen.



Find positive things to focus your conversations on. Don't let the only communication you have with your preteenager be about bed wetting.

15 months or 15 years, if she is 15 months old, it is totally normal for some babies to regress, especially if they were too young to start in the first place.



if she is 15 years old, then this is something new entirely, and although it would be psychological, she is too old for diapers (and specially made ones for adults are veyr expensive)  I would buy a protective sheet for under her bed linen, and ask her to clean her own bed from now on, as you have enough on your plate, if it continues, I would take her to see a doctor, as it could be something she cannot control

I'm not sure what age she is but if she is 3 or under this is normal especially that she has a new baby in the family. Don't threaten her . Tell her gently mummy thinks it's a good idea that you wear a diaper in bed . she will be feeling left out as she will no longer get all the attention. Don't forget to give her some special time.

Why can't there be room for two women in your daughter's lives?



I am dating this really great guy, and have been for a little over two years. It is not my fault that him and the mother of his daughters aren't together. It is not my fault that he never married her, and is going to marry me. It is not my fault that she is a crazy psycho b***h and that is the reason they are no longer together (a fact I have never spoken out loud, but I really would love to) And more importantly it is not my fault that their daughters love me, and I love them. So why am I the home wrecking b***h? I didn't break up a family, it was broken before I met him.



Maybe I don't understand because I don't have children of my own. But why isn't there room for two strong women in their daughters lives? Why does their bio mom have to do everything in her power to try to make life miserable, and why does she have to make her daughters feel like they have to choose between us. Any single parents have any advice for me?



</question>



<additional details>



I guess what I am looking for is advice from single moms...how would you feel if your ex moved on and was happy and you were still single and unhappy...I think that is what this is stemming from. She wants him to be as miserable as her.

I think your fiance should have a talk with his ex. If he is happy with you and has moved on with his life by choosing a life with you, then his ex should accept that and do the same. If their children love you and accept you, then she should just let it be. Children can love more than one person. You didn't break them up, they were broken up before you came into the picture.

OMG that is the worst thing a parent can do to a child obviously she is bent about the fact that he is moving on with someone else.  You should do like my friend did and document pretty much everything on a daily basis for future reference if you two should decide to get full custody of the kids if you don't have it now.  There is plenty of room for you in their lives just try to be upbeat about the whole situation.  Maybe the three of you need to see a mediator to work all this out.  Explain to psycho that $hit happens and this is the way it's gonna be.

WELL YOU HAVE A PROBLEM TO SOLVE unless you reword your question as: Why can't you be The Mother to two daughters not born to you?
My opinion is :
1. Continue to win love of your ' Friend's Daughters' as if you are their True Mother.
2. Change your Mind Set with a FIRM STAND that you are not affected



with whatever unpleasantness you have narrated.



Say as often



[ loudly to all those around, concerned or just Present, and to your Emotional Mind] :



I note the unpleasant situation, words or action by Other Woman



but I choose to ignore for



IT DOES NOT Make you BITTER or UNHAPPY. It is O.K.with You!
3. Do not try to Compromise or cajole the other woman and Point (2)



repeated often will take care sooner than later.

you cant understand that the mothers children prefer you makes her mad??? even if she has done whatever to cause it, of course its still going to make her mad. her being miserable is her problem. concentrate on yourself, always make sure you never slate the mother and the kids here, always suggest they visit their mother (if thats applicable) dont give her an oppurtunity to talk about you.

Parents with teens??? Help please?



I posted this earlier and everyone thought she was depressed. She's not. I added details too.



My parents have always had trouble getting my younger sister to do anything (clean her room, clean anything in the house, keep her clothes washed, showered, etc). Nothing they do has helped. Bribing, grounding, NOTHING helps. She has no job, no car, and uses my dad's cell phone sometimes. She's the complete opposite of me and my older sister. She has talked to a psychologist AND school counselors and is NOT depressed at ALL. She doesn't care about going anywhere, has friends, and is socially ok (not popular, but not a "freak")



She's a high school senior, and has a huge project (research paper, so many hours with a mentor, so many hours community service, and a project). The dead line was next Friday (they supposedly extended it). However, she has done nothing but the paper so far. If she doesn't pass this, she does NOT graduate.



They've done everything they can think of to get her to do it. She knows if she doesn't do it, Mom will make her repeat her senior year (no GED). She STILL won't get off her butt and do it. She claims if they stay on her case about doing it she doesn't want to do it even more (stupid, I know) but if they DON'T stay on her, she won't do ANYTHING...



Like I said, grounding doesn't work. What would you do if this was YOUR teen? Any and all suggestions are appreciated



No smart as$ comments about me being pregnant and not married, they asked me to put this on here.

Sometimes, you have to just let them learn their lesson the hard way.  That means that she will probably repeat senior year.  Nagging her repeatedly does no good, just makes them dig in that much deeper. Try not just grounding, but absolutely not letting her do anything, no tv, ipod, computer, etc., Make her life so boring that she will do just about anything to get her life back.  The parents have to be the parents and mean what they say and say what they mean.  It won't be easy, and hopefully, she will come around.

Why don't you just ask her how to make her do it?



If she doesn't do it, she'll take the year over again. She'll hate it and probably get a wake-up call. Some kids just aren't cut out for school or responsibility.

I agree with WVPV07. She sounds old enough that she needs to learn some stuff for herself, if she has to repeat senior year then so be it. I also agree that they could become more restrictive on stuff to force her into doing her work.

Well, as a youngest child, I think I can say, she knows how to work you all.  We youngest children can watch what works and what doesn't work for our older siblings and can really work our parents.



For Example: My parents gave all my older siblings (7 of them) a hard time about getting a driver's license.  Then when they got licensed they had to run errands for my parents every day to be allowed to use the car.  So when I was old enough to drive, I announced I didn't want a license, while joining several after school clubs and making my mom drive me around 7 days a week.  She had to BEG me to get my license.  I never was asked to run an errand.  I never had to pay for my gas. I saw the mistakes my older siblings made and used the opposite approach. It's called manipulation.



And your sister knows how to manipulate.  She's not doing anything because she simply doesn't want to.  She knows she has a free ride at home, meals and board.  Instead of threatening to make her repeat a grade, a better threat would be to kick her out of the house so she HAS to support herself. If she has a deadline of when the free room and board ends, she may be motivated to be able to support herself by that deadline.



As her sister, however, it's out of your hands.  You can't do anything but sit back and watch.  Actually you might learn a few things from her.  But this is your parent's problem.  And your sister already knows what they'll put up with.  She's probably very happy being an underacheiver.  Good luck with that.

Do you think this is wrong of me?



I have a 17 month old little girl who of course I think is one of the prettiest little girls around. I tell her about 6 times a day how pretty she is and how smart she is and I was wondering if you think this is over the top and I might be doing more damage than good. I know it's good to tell your child positive things but I just can't help myself telling her all the time that she's so smart and pretty but I was thinking the other day that maybe this will turn her into a snob or something when she is older coz she will think she is better than everyone else and I don't want her to think this. Do you think Im going over the top by telling her a few times a day or do you think Im doing good.

Things that change when you have a baby?



I found this a few minutes ago, please feel free to comment or add or disagree:



1. You finally stop to smell the roses, because your baby is in your arms.
2. Where you once believed you were fearless, you now find yourself afraid.
3. The sacrifices you thought you made to have a child no longer seem like sacrifices.
4. You respect your body ... finally.
5. You respect your parents and love them in a new way.
6. You find that your baby's pain feels much worse than your own.
7. You believe once again in the things you believed in as a child.
8. You lose touch with the people in your life whom you should have banished years ago.
9. Your heart breaks much more easily.
10. You think of someone else 234,836,178,976 times a day.
11. Every day is a surprise.
12. Bodily functions are no longer repulsive. In fact, they please you. (Hooray for poop!)
13. You look at your baby in the mirror instead of yourself.
14. You become a morning person.
15. Your love becomes limitless, a superhuman power.
16. You discover how much there is to say about one tooth.
17. You finally realize that true joy doesn't come from material wealth.
18. You now know where the sun comes from.
19. You'd rather buy a plastic tricycle than those shoes that you've been dying to have.
20. You realize that although sticky, lollipops have magical powers.
21. You don't mind going to bed at 9 p.m. on Friday night.
22. Silence? What's that?
23. You realize that the 15 pounds you can't seem to get rid of are totally worth having.
24. You discover an inner strength you never thought you had.
25. You no longer rely on a clock — your baby now sets your schedule.
26. You give parents with a screaming child an 'I-know-the-feeling' look instead of a 'Can't-they-shut-him-up?' one.
27. Your dog — who used to be your 'baby' — becomes just a dog.
28. You take the time for one more hug and kiss even if it means you'll be late.
29. You learn that taking a shower is a luxury.
30. You realize that you can love a complete stranger.
31. You find yourself wanting to make this world a better place.



32. If you didn’t believe in love at first sight before, now you do!

As long as it was in a larger group, safe neighborhood, not too much traffic, and they were mature enough I would say about 5th or 6th grade. There are so many neighbors that hang around, I wouldn't be too worried.

I personally think when you are old enough to go alone you are too old to trick or treat. I would say 14 in a decent neighborhood, but I'm not crazy about it. I personally don't like walking alone after dark in any city. Just because you live in an area where houses are over 4000 sq ft doesn't mean there aren't psychos in your area, you know?

In my town (which I grew up in) I would let my children go trick or treating in a group when they are ten to twelve, depending on their maturity level. I don't think I would let them go trick or treating alone, first because it's not as safe, although my town is very safe and I wouldn't be worried to have them go out on a normal day, but I wouldn't want anything to happen with teenagers acting crazy, and secondly, because it's not as fun.



If they were alone I would want them to be at least thirteen. If I let my own children go in a group I would want the oldest to be at least twelve and the youngest to be at least eight.



Sorry, it's hard to give one age because there are so many factors to go with it. But I'll say ten with a group and thirteen alone.

I think that it would probably vary with each child. 8 or 9 if they were going in a group, you knew most of the people in the neighborhood, and there would be like an older sibling along. 10 or 11 if it was in a group (w/o a chaperone) and make sure it's at least a group of 3 or 4 or more.

I think it depends on what kind of area you live in.  If you live in an area low in violence and they are going in a group,probably around 11 or 12,depending on the child's maturity level.  If they are going alone in a low-violence area,i would say 13 or 14,again depending on the individual child's maturity level.  If you live in a large city,i would say group only until the child is 17 or 18(if they are still trick or treating at that age),starting around age 15. If they are trick  or treating in an area you are not very familiar with,i would go with the same as living in a large city.

I would never allow my child to trick or treat alone. Regardless of age, people are safer in groups. I have drilled that into my kids' heads all of their lives.



I went with my kids until they turned 11. After that, they always went out in groups. I would never have had it any other way. It's just not safe to be anywhere alone these days.
Good luck on the report.

When my son gets too big to go without me or my husband with him then he is too big to go trick or treat. It isn't safe to let a child run around at night, door to door, alone.

As far as I remember, the brain does grow in size, but more importantly it acquires additional 'connectors' as you gain knowledge.
These connectors form mainly in early childhood and continue to grow and be built up on throughout adulthood.

It grows in size as you grow up.



It also develops in capacity as you age.



Despite what MADD and other ill-informed purveyors of pseudoscience will tell you, your brain does not continue to significantly develop into your late 20s. In fact your mental facilities - including reflexes and the ability to heal injury to your brain - peak somewhere around 17, and it's mostly downhill from there. "Development" in the form of the continued accruing of experience and memories continues into old age.

In order to pass through the birth canal an infant is born with an underdeveloped brain.  The most startling growth occurs in the first few years, but there are stages throughout life in which the brain will expand slightly.  Most of these stages occur before age 35, but studies have shown increases in the fifth and sixth decade as well.  Unlike the other organs in the body, the brain cannot replace lost cells, so expansion is the only option it has.

O.K., from doing actual research in the past I know this as a fact. First of all, know your brain doesn't grow wrinkles from gaining knowledge. Your brain grows in size, yet your brain cells always remain the same. When you're born you have 50,000 (I think) Brain cells, you never get any more. It is simply the way you choose to use your memory, you may lose brain cells which is why you forget things. Your brain cells will grow back when your young, but takes longer when you get older. You do learn more when your a child, but old dogs can learn new tricks, it is simply harder. To answer your question, you brain does grow in size to become proportionate to your body. It does not simply grow because you get smarter.

and when you are born your brain is smooth
when you start to contain information your brain forms "wrinkles"

No, you only pay for what she has done.  I think she has to get a self certification or doctors note if she wants some sort of benefit from the government for the days she is going to have away from work.  I think the ball is in her court to sort this out and she can ask the local council who she is registered with about the legalities or the CAB.



p.s.  Can the local council give you a number of a childminder that can take your daughter on for just these days?  Would you be okay with that and most of all will your daughter?  For a one off is your work place okay with her coming with you?

i would say not, you should check your contract with her, my childminder expected payment if the kids didn't go because of  their or my sickness but not if it was her reasons.This also applied to holidays, we agreed she had certain paid holidays.



If your minder cancels you either have to take time off work, not always an option or pay someone else, so it is unfair to pasy her as well.

If the contract says that you pay her a rate, which includes several "sick days" then yes, you pay.
If not, then no, as she did not provide the service and you were not the one to cancel.

no you dont have to pay, and you shouldnt if she is ill either! thats not your problem if she is ill or cant look after your child. id get that changed in the contract, you should only pay for when she looks after your child.

Parents having trouble with teen?



My parents have always had trouble getting my younger sister to do anything (clean her room, clean anything in the house, keep her clothes washed, showered, etc). Nothing they do has helped. Bribing, grounding, NOTHING helps. She has no job, no car, and uses my dad's cell phone sometimes. She's the complete opposite of me and my older sister.



She's a high school senior, and has a huge project (research paper, so many hours with a mentor, so many hours community service, and a project). The dead line was next Friday (they supposedly extended it). However, she has done nothing but the paper so far. If she doesn't pass this, she does NOT graduate.



They've done everything they can think of to get her to do it. She knows if she doesn't do it, Mom will make her repeat her senior year (no GED). She STILL won't get off her butt and do it. She claims if they stay on her case about doing it she doesn't want to do it even more (stupid, I know) but if they DON'T stay on her, she won't do ANYTHING...



Like I said, grounding doesn't work. What would you do if this was YOUR teen? Any and all suggestions are appreciated.



</question>



<additional details>



She's not depressed or any other mental problems, just lazy and unmotivated...



She's always either at school or at home. Never WANTS to go anywhere.

You say she isn't depressed but this isn't the behavior of someone who is healthy mentally. How is she doing socially? If she never goes anywhere, does this mean she doesn't have any friends. I think she needs to be evaluated by a professional. Otherwise, the only thing you really can do is let her fail. She'll have to learn by getting the consequences.

Kids TV not Beneficial?!?



Well, I just wanted your opinions on Kids TV, Good or Bad?



As I live in a top floor flat with my 2 year old and unless my partner is home we dont get out much because I have alot of trouble with my back and the stairs, so we spend alot of the day watching the Cbeebies channel. All I hear from parents is how bad kids TV is nowadays and how kids should be outside not watching TV. (Which we would given the chance!!) But I have found this channel to be extremely good! Everyday my little girl is speaking more and more and its all what she has learnt from watching the shows. (Some like the green balloon club and the pop shop thing are just awful) But most are great. She was counting to ten (With my help) before she was 2, she knows the difference in colours and can speak them, She knows a variety of animals and their calls, she is starting to sign with justin, She is telling the presenters what they are going to do before they do it lol And she only turned 2 at the weekend! It may just be me being biased but I honestly think this channel has made her the way she is along with my encouragement.



</question>



<additional details>



Oh yes, she has plenty of toys and books (Loves her books! Lol) and we love to do things together with them since we dont have much else to do right now. =)



Im glad I have found some people that do not have the 'Television is bad' attitude, thank you for your answers, I shall let it go to voting for the best answer as they are all interesting =)

I think when people are talking about tv shows being bad for children they are speaking maybe of cartoons such as spiderman, barbie etc, uneducational 'fun' programmes. At least thats what I think. A moderate amount of tv shows such as numberjacks, shiny show etc, are beneficial to children and entertaining. But there has to be a balance too, because a child also needs plenty of physical activity such as going outside to the park, or playing action songs with you. So yes the tv is great but not all day long!

It depends on the show (or channel)
I normally let my kids watch some of the shows on Nick Jr because they are educational and encourage learning.
One of my kids had to be on serious meds for febrile convulsions - the meds make the child "slow". She also had slight brain damage.
She was given a Dora The Explorer doll that talks and sings in both spanish and english (it also lights up lol). This encouraged her to talk, whereas nothing else did beforehand.
Now if it wasn't for the show Dora The Explorer, this particular doll would not have existed and I don't know what I would have done to help my daughter speak.
It's done her the world of good, not harm
Those shows I let them watch encourage them to count, spell and awareness of the world around them.

I don't think there is any harm in children's television - most of them are made with education in mind - although some are probably more educational than others. I think all of them stimulate the child to one extent or another though.



I would just make sure (and you're probably already doing this) that she has some books, toys etc., around her as well so that television isn't her only form of education.



So, I would say it's a good thing when mixed with other forms of stimulation too.

If a child is left in front of the tv all day with no interaction from you then it would be detrimental, but with interaction, motivation and collaboration with an adult as you are doing it can be very informative and educational. Even things like Spiderman as the other poster mentioned COULD be used for education IF the supervising adult interacts and uses it in the right way for example right & wrong, helping others, etc. Obviously more educational shows are better than Spiderman but if that is the only way to get a child to contribute and involved ( i have had Professional experience of this!) and the adult uses it in the right way it could help.



The way you are using it is great, hope your back improves x

It is all about how you use kid's TV.



If you watch it WITH your children, and interact with them and talk to them about what they have seen, it is a really useful tool for learning and I think for bonding with your child as you have a shared interest and can talk about the characters, etc.



If you just plonk your kids in front of the telly and leave them to their own devices it is not good.



My daughter who is now nearly 4 is a very bright child and I thank CBeebies for some of that as it has exposed us to things that I would not have known about, all the craft type things on the making programmes, the signing with Justin, all of it basically.

at the end of the day, if you think its helping your daughter then dont listen to what others say!!!  I understand how hard it can be getting out...I also have bad back problems and for a while we were also in a unit, so as long as its not on all the day long ans your lil one is enjoying books and other toys then i see no harm in it!!!



my lil 17 month old is very active and we now have a backyard that he runs wild in, but when he is just too tired from running around he sits witha  book and watched transformers the movie....I know its sounds very insane, but its the only thing that will calm him down for 20 minutes before his nap in the day!!!  so be grateful your little one like the educational ones....my lil guy is obssesed with cras and tucks but he enjoys elmo and the night garden as well....i say anything in moderation for kids is fine!!  i dont want my kids ignorant in this world!!!  you are doing a great job and she sounds intelligent and i think her programs are beneficial to her!!  good luck

Way too early! The best thing about Christmas is having to wait for it. The money-grabbing retailers have brought it to us earlier and earlier each year; some stores put up their decorations in September now. They're just trying to make sure that every moment in the year is presented to us as a spending opportunity (witness the growth of 'festivals' like Halloween and Father's Day).



Take your daughter out and have her awestruck by the colours of autumn leaves, for example, (or equivalent - I don't know where you live). She'll be bored of Christmas decorations by Christmas which will spoil everything.



Don't put anything up before December 1st - three weeks before is plenty.

My son is not my hubby's biological child. My son is 10 now. I waited to have another child because I was afraid of this, my daughter 5 months old. Anyway, my hubby is just as great with our daughter as he was with our son and he has not changed how he is with our son or how he feels about him. He loves him just as much as his daughter. I think it is all in how much a person can handle the situation, and my Lovely husband has been wonderful with both kids. I am very lucky!

do you mean your mother is raising him?

if your mom is raising him, you should take the time to look for another job so that you can work and raise your child.  people take their children to day care all the time and its normal, so there is nothing wrong with your mom helping (not raising)  i just think parents not grandparents should raise their children.

That doesn't make you a bad mum, loads of parents do this, it's necessary to make ends meet.

You are being responsible by working to give the little one a better future and showing him that he needs to work to get anywhere (ok, maybe a little young now but the effect on him in later years will be beneficial), and you care enough to worry about the situation; sounds to me like you're doing just fine.  It's not like you've left him with a stranger either, don't fret, just keep doing your best and show him lots of love and teach him right from wrong; that's all we as parents can do.

I couldn't imagine being that far away from a baby so tiny, I would re-train if I had to so that I could work locally, leaving baby with Grandma for day care is one thing.

Do you mean 1) your mum is minding him or 2) bringing him up

if its the 1st then no your not a bad mum, your mum isn't a stranger so she is perfect to mind your child

if its the 2nd and you have abandoned him for work then yes you are

EDIT

OMG just read your additional details...........800 miles away from your son all because you cant find a good nursery, you need to get your priorities right
Get back to your son and find a different job, one that allows you to act up to your responsibilities

Do you mean you left him for the day with your mother?  If so, then you're not a bad mother.  If you mean that your mother is raising him, then it's really time to look for a different job.  Plenty of people have jobs and still raise their own children; I'm sure you can do it as well.

Two questions about talking to my dad...please help?



Ok well this is sort of complicated but I'll put it as simply as I can. I'm English and I have just moved to USA to live with my Dad about three months ago. I never knew him before this, he used to pay my boarding school fees but that was it. But he stopped paying and because my mum didn't want me at home all year she said my dad had to take me instead.



My dad doesn't like the way I speak and he gets really annoyed about it because English words don't have the same meaning as American words, like I call my evening meal tea and he calls it dinner. He doesn't like my accent either and when people ask him if I'm British he denies it. He wants me to say I'm American but I'm not. He gets really mad when use  English slang and he is always trying to get me to speak like an American. How can I tell him to stop without offending him? I can't change the way I speak, it's just part of me.



My second question is how do I get him to stop spanking me, I'm really uncomfortable with him doing it. My mum never used to hit me. The first time he did it I thought he was bluffing until he took his belt off and put me over his knee. It hurt and I barely know the guy really. I'm 14 and please don't suggest I hit him back like my friends have, I'm seriously short for my age and he is huge. I'm 4”3 and he's 6”4. I told my mum and she says it's up to my dad how he wants to deal with me.  Any ideas?



</question>



<additional details>



for you information, my mum is working class and yes i was from the north, Newcaslte. That's why he hates the accent

About the hitting i am so sorry i think you should go to your room or a restroom everytime he starts getting mad and no never hit him back because after all he is your dad and thats disrespectful just talk to him in a nice way and tell him that he has never been there and you feel like he has no right to hit you to please stop and that you wanna get to know hium and spend more time as father and son

I would get away from your dad! He sounds terrible. And the spanking thing HAS to stop.
 You need to explain to him that you aren't going to change the way you speak. You are English so you are going to speak differently. He sounds kind of prejudiced and embarrassed because you aren't "American" like he is.

Okay, this is way too big of a problem to be handled here.  If you can't convince him that the two of you need counseling, then there are going to be some serious issues.  Basically, for 14 years, you were an expense, not a child of his.  Sorry, but, that's pretty much it.  And now, you have added extra expense and time to his life.  Unexpectedly.  But, this is not your fault.  Your mother never should have sent you to him.  But, now that you are there and need to get help.  Spanking a 14 year old is totally unacceptable.  Your mother's response is just as bad.

It sounds to me like your dad is a jerk. I would politely inform him that at your age spanking is unacceptable and there are other ways to discipline you without him hitting you. You are who you are and you can't change that. If your dad continues doing what he is your only other options are to go back to your mom or report him for child abuse. Either way you need to do something. Good luck.

Try not to use you slang around him. Personally i think the English way of talking is very cool. If you can't not use your slang try explaining to him that you are trying your best to talk like an "American". As far as spanking goes dont hit him back that will prob make him more mad. But try talking to him about it making you uncomfortable. Tell him you would much rather be punished by not having tv or something like that. Good luck

You shouldn't change just because your father is upset with who you have grown up to be. Your accent, your vocab, your particular quirks- its who you are and if it makes your father uncomfortable then thats a shame because you are his son and he should love you unconditionally. As for being spanked at 14, I think thats much too old for physical punishment. It doesn't sound like he is very reasonable and if you can, I'd try to move in with your mother or another relative. If he cares about you, he will be willing to sit with you and talk about your differences but if he adamantly denies your heritage and hits you, it doesn't sound like a healthy environment for a young man. He might just not know how to be a positive part of your life and you may have to just live with that, sad as it is. If you can, try to find a better situation for yourself but let your father know that you want to have a relationship with him because he is your blood. If he can't, its his loss.

oo sounds like your in a tough situation. especially since your so young.

firstly about your accent, I would just tell him that you have lived in England for 14 years and are therefore going to have an english accent and use english slang. I would just humour him and tell him that you will pick american words and slang eventually but your used to english words and slang.

if I were you about the hitting I would just say to him that you don't like it and it upsets you, say your a teenager and growing and would prefer he talk to you when you have done something wrong or to upset him rather than using force.

also does your dad have a partner at all? if he does it might help talking to them they could maybe make your dad see sense. I hope it all works out for you.

in most states in the usa it would be illegal to spank at all let alone with a belt...but i am sure you dont want to call the police on your father so tell that to your mom. also, try to talk to you dad about how new this all is to you and let him know your really do want to be like him but you grew up away from him. let him know that you are like him in many ways but you grew up across the world. you didnt make that choice. they did so why is he punishing you for it? and be willing to compromise. maybe take a language or speach class to show you are willing to try to be more like him.

tell an adult or counciler he's hitting you and have him sit down ina controlled enviorment and tell him that he hurts you mentally and physically. tell him that you just want to be treated like a human being. because we all are. no matter what country or language you speak. tell him that you're trying really hard, and that it's annoying when he denys the truth, that its just who you are and if he doesn't like it, then obviously doesn't love you enough. its up to you if you want to try to fit in.
p.s. english accents are cute. don't worry to much about it. just work on the slang a little and whatever you improve will hopefully impress him. also, they have teachers in this country that help you lose your accent, but like I said, it's up to you if you want to fit in. :)

Wow I'm so sorry. It sounds like your dad is a real jerk. Did you try explaining to him that you are english and that it really is a part of you? You shouldn't get spanked after a certain age. 14 is just to old. I kind of know how you feel. My step-dad would literally flip out and beat me for something small like i couldn't pour my milk. but he stopped spanking me. Tell your dad how he makes you feel. If he gets offanded and spanks you again I;d suggest getting out of the house like to hang out with friends, after school sports and clubs. If that doesn't work, call child services. I'm really sorry

I hope I helped.



Good luck

Your story made me so sad.  You need to find the equivalent of the nspcc over there.  Child Welfare League of America? just in case you need some adult support.



I would recommend trying to talk these things through with your dad.

If this continues you need to ask your mum if you can return home.  Tell her that you haven't settled and you are living with a stranger who has low tolerance of you.  Your mum cannot absolve all responsibility for you.

Please don't let this continue.  He has no right to abuse you in this way.

Oh boy. That is a lot to deal with. Culture shock plus a brand new, strict, intolerant father... I think the best way to deal with this is to talk to your school counselor. They will be able to help you sort out a lot of the feelings you're having and advise you about how to make this transition a little easier. Maybe they will even have some advice about how to handle your father' s negativity and intolerance. You sound like a sweet kid and he sounds totally unprepared for fatherhood. Maybe the counselor will also know of some resources where your father could get some parenting advice. It's worth a try.

Sit him down when he is in a pleasant mood. Tell him the you are english and it feels like he is ashamed of you when he denies it and that you will try to fit in without changing yourself.

With the spanking thing I do have to agree with your mom because it is his choice but you can say that you feel uncomfortable because you barely know him and your not used to it. Ask him to do anything else or list examples of things he can do instead.
If your dad gets mad and hits you for real to the point of child abuse take it up with your mom that its becoming serious. If she doesn't listen i reccomend you take it up with the local authorities.
Remember this is akward for your dad too so try your best to go along with his ways and try to spend quality time with him. Become friends and maybe that will be the answer to the problems.

I wish you the best of luck. Welcome to America.

Depends on the job.  I mean, a retail position at pregnancy or maternaty store would LOVE it because you would be able to talk new parents into what they 'need'.

Bottom line though, any professional high stress job is going to see it as a negative.  It is illegal to discriminate, and they would never openly admit it, but having children can be a negative in the work force.  Mainly because your kids are Always going to come first, if you are a good parent.  These companies want to be your number 1 commitment.

I depends on the employer.

I part-own a business, and am a Mum. My work partner, is a Dad, and he is also a Grandfather. We both have very high family values.
We both understand that kids come before anything. We don't discriminate, and to be honest we both are more likely to hire a family oriented person. We pride ourselves on our business and all staff, are family. 
I don't work in the field you have chosen, and to be honest I am unsure how they work. But for us, it's important for our staff, to be friendly with our clients, and we have a LOT of children coming into our workplace. So being *child-friendly* knowing how to communicate with young children, is a definite advantage, for us.

I personally think if people do judge parents who have young children, are missing out on a lot of potential. We have a couple of Mums who work part-time on reception, and they are FANTASTIC.
They are willing to learn, tuned in, and don't crack under stress.
It is discrimination to not hire someone because they have young children, but I don't think you can prove that's why *you* aren't hired.

Good and bad.



You will have to take time off work to tend to your kids, and you won't be able to work as much as someone without kids. That's just obvious. 
But you do have the experience of having children, which is great, and the ability to deal with that stress, which is always good.

I'd say make sure that you have someone, or someway, of dealing with the children that doesn't involve you leaving the workplace.



I wouldn't employ someone if they had multiple children, and no help. If anything happened, and it happens a lot in minor ways, you'd have to leave. As an employer, that would irritate me obviously.



Make sure that you can prove to your employer that unless anything major happens, you'll be at work. You need to have someone else able to deal with the scratches, headaches, and lost my pencil case and won't stop cryings.

First control how long and with whose children you are interacting with.  A friend who has two children ages 5 and 18 months would be best.



You learn about children by observing them, so I would just sit quietly.  Let them come to you. The older one may have questions, or want you to do something like read a book with her.  the little one will find things to do.  PUT your purse in another room, have mom bring some of the child's toys along.



They like music.  ask mom to bring their favorite music and you can all sing.  It is fun. But you have relax and have fun too.  The kids can tell if you like them.  if you stiff and uncomfortable make the visit short.  fifteen to twenty minutes at a time until you can tolerate more.



Some people are just not Kid people.  Nothing bad in that.  IF you cannot feel comfortable with kids now, don't fret over it.  Try it again in six months or a year.  People change.

Hire an agency to do it for you that will have this guy come in again, he does not have to take it though, if you really didn't have sex with anyone at all other than this one person thats what I would do. You can challange anything and no the tests are not wrong but suprise there is something called " Human Error " and the person at the test area or someone could have screwed it up, so before judging someone try to give a better option people!



So yeah, demand another test and if its wrong the second time, I would just move on and let it be.



The Child Support Agency lost my paperwork twice, screwed up everything and I had to call and hound them until something got done, they don't like their jobs and they damn sure don't do them well. I can say there is a 95% chance one of those idiots messed it up if your not lying. Why would you anyways.. thats something silly to lie about you can't fool yourself right?



Maury by the way deals with money hungry ghetto sluts and they don't say " Hes the only person I slept with" they guess not one of those people on there has said " Just one person" its " Well he look like my baby so he da baby daddy ok, I slept with him AROUND the time I got pregnant"

thank you for your answer, and to everyone else these tests are 99% accurate, so if they gave perfect results it would be 100% accurate. I know the truth, why would i lie? i want the truth for my daughter not myself , plus im not a idiot i know who i slept with

Well, if a DNA test proved he wasn't the father, then you need to accept the fact that he is not the father. Those things are more than 99% correct. You can't fake or lie about DNA.

If you want the truth for your daughter, you better start thinking hard about who else you were with. Or you could just let it be and let her step-dad continue to be the dad you wish for her.

You can request another DNA test if you suspect that there was an error in the analysis.

But clearly, you DON'T know "one million %" that he is the father of your daughter, otherwise the DNA test would have been returned as a positive match.

You sound like one of the women on the "Maury" show who SWEAR up to 500% or 1000% that this man is the father of her child. When the paternity test proves them wrong on national television, they SWEAR that it's a mistake or run from the stage embarrassed and ashamed at how promiscuous they were proven to be.

I don't know if there is a way you can make him take another test. He's already been court ordered to take one and was found to not be the father. Those tests are accurate. There are no false negatives in DNA testing. There must have been someone else 6 years ago that you're forgetting. Good luck.

Those DNA tests are 99% accurate. They get false POSITIVES but not false negatives.

No, he's not the father.  Those tests are over 99% accurate, and they are only wrong in the case of false positives.  Get over it and move on.  Then, rack your brain to figure out who the true father is.  There has to be another man back in there somewhere.  If you want the truth for your daughter, then start being honest.

Girl, you need to accept the DNA test and move on and leave the guy alone.  Those DNA tests don't lie.  It's not like a lie detector test which can have false negatives.

You should focus more on finding her REAL father if it means that much to you.

You messed up with sleeping with people you allegedly don't even remember sleeping with (or you're just so ashamed that you choose to not admit it).  That's bad.  And you will pay dearly if and when your daughter starts asking who her daddy is.  What are you going to lie to her and tell her the guy that was found to NOT be her father, really is??

Get a grip girl.  Move on.

<question>



What can entertain a 7 year old and 4 year old? Need Help - also got a 5 week old baby!?



Some of you may know, but my husband was in a previous relationship and got divorced, he had had two children, but his ex - wife has been gambling and so the children have moved in with us. Jake is 7 and Lily is 4, they are my step children by the way but i love them like i love my child who is 5 weeks and 3 days old.

My daughter Ella is 5 weeks and 3 days and taking up quite alot of my time at the moment with feeds ( my husband is out on call - he is a surgen and been out since 3 with a number of emergencies.) it isn't an ideal situation but i am left with with all 3!



Just wondering if you guys have any ideas - that can entertain Jake and Lily. Nothing to big because Ella is going to wake up in the next half hour so she will be needing a feed and i am still breastfeeding and not feeling to well today so i cant be too energetic.
Thanks! Liv

first congratulations on ella and lots of respect for your concern for your step children.there are lots of things you can do with children to keep them occupied without resorting to t.v. or computer games,but you could always keep them as last resort.first you must find out what the children like,are they the sporty type,the creative type or the academic.the answer can make a difference to how you occupy the children.if the weather is nice you could go to the play park or for a nice nature walk.all children will appreciate the fresh air and it might recharge your batteries also.if it`a rainy day you could do jig-saw puzzles or board games like memory.how about when ella is sleeping having a baking session together.most children like that.or do something with crafts or painting,maybe they can paint a picture to send to their mother.i`m sure the children are missing her and this way it shows the kids you are not trying to take the place of their real mother.could only strenghen the relationship between all concerned.try to get them involved with ella so no  jealousy can come between them.if you live not so far away from where the children were living with their mother invite some of the children`s friends round to play.maybe then later to give you a break they could go round to play with their friends.try to involve them so much in your daily routine so they don`t feel left out and that they don`t feel they have lost their father to your daughter.at the same time let them go at their own pace don`t forget they are going through a lot at the moment.their mother is no longer the main person in their life,that`s a big upheaval.they also have anew sister which can course all sorts of emotions in their mind.they will be very uncertain and be doing their best not to show it.have patiance with them,allow them to go at their own pace.try not to but to much pressure on them or yourself.things take time.i wish you every luck.don`t give up and always look on the bright side.

The obvious answer is a DVD if you need time with the baby. Otherwise, get them painting (put down newspaper!) or cooking, if it's daytime where you are (I'm assuming it is as they aren't in bed) send them to play in the garden.
Get them to help you with the baby, make a card for daddy - or mummy.

Have you any cards? Dominoes? Games? Get them to plant some seeds? You could read to them whilst baby is feeding.

Don't forget that children don't need entertaining all the time. they need free time to play. Put some blankets over some chairs to make a den - or get a big old box in and let them run wild with their imaginations.

Good luck. I'm sure you won't need it.

Play doh!! Or baking cakes-you can get one of those easy sets from the shops that have all the ingredients in little packs all ready to make!! From my experience(i'm a registered childminder) kids of any age will be kept busy for hours with either of these.In your situation play doh is probably the best as you wouldn't need to be that involved.

It does not matter how old she is to baptise her.
They tend to do them on a sunday during church time.
If you are not religious and do not want her to be baptised is it really essential for a school, my little boy is not baptised yet he has just been accepted for a church school, as it is the closet school to us.

When to go back to work after having kids?



I'm talking full time here. I will be graduating in 2 or 3 years, so my youngest child will be 2 or 3 years old and the oldest will be in school already. Is it unfair to the youngest child if they have to go to daycare when the oldest child had the full 5 years at home with me? 5 years seems like a very long time for me to wait to work, I want to work and I have already been at home nearly 3 years... What do you think?

I don't think it's unfair to the younger child, I'm sure when the time comes and you have found a nice, safe place for your child to go to daycare with you should not feel guilty.



As long as you spend quality time with them when you are home (after work) they'll still feel all the love you have for them whether you're at home or at work.

I think that you should do what you want...But i think also that your child will not notice the difference he/she may miss you a lot but they will also make friends and be able to have fun with other children who also go to daycare!

And just think of all the toys and clothes and gifts you can buy for your precious babies with the money you make! If you have been able to survive off one wage for 3 years so far and you are only going back to work for you then the money you can make can go to your children, maybe for a holiday or presents or savings for them!!!

But only you can make the right decision =)

I dont think its unfair for your youngest child to go to daycare if you need to go to work. So long as you are making enough money to pay for the childcare and save for your beach house too :)



For me, I will be going back to work when my daughter is seven months old. I need to go back to work to pay our morgage. I have family close by so she wont be in daycare at all for a while. My mum works part time so she will have her a few days a week and my husband works includes weekends so he has a day off during the week. my job is full time 730 am to 3pm monday to friday. So I will still get the whole afternoon with my little girl. Plus its local so I can drop by and breastfeed on my lunch break.

You do what you gotta do. It is your choice, and at this age, your child will be fine whatever you choose even if at first he/she doesn't like it.  It always gets some getting used to.  I think with your first you will always want to spend more time with them because you don't want to miss something, and it is your first time.  I know I didn't work for the first almost 3 years of my first son's life.  They are 23 months apart exactly.  My other son was a few months shy of 1 year and I had felt guilty getting a job and leaving him.  I felt like I was neglecting my younger son but he was fine.  I only worked for a couple of months though, because my older son would only go to the potty for me.  Go figure.  Now they are 4 and 5 and I work again and I have since the end of March.  At first, they didn't understand why and they were a little upset because I work third and they didn't see me as much.  We explained that I worked to pay the bills and buy them stuff and that worked for the older kid, but he was kinda sexist.  He thought only men should work even though we explained that grandma worked.  I think it was just because mom was working.



My other son was quite upset.  He grew more clingy to Daddy and wanted me when I was home, but it was okay.  They had never been to school, but now that my oldest is in Kindergarten and my youngest is in preschool, it makes it easier.  They are happier now.  I am not sure that it makes a difference.  I hope this helps and good luck.  Let me know what you decide.

Can you afford to not work?  Why have the children if you're not going to raise them?  They may not remember it all at this age.  But they will not be the same as if you raised them.  I guess if that mansion on the beach is more important to you than raising your own children, then go for it.  Otherwise, stop making babies you can't raise yourself.  They are not trophies.

your question didn't have a lot of details.What do you want to do?One thing that is very fulfilling for both you and the children you want to work with is a speech,occupational,developmental,physic... all of them work with children who have special needs and are disabled.You do however need college classes and diplomas for all of them.Or if you wanna just get a taste of it to see if it is right for you try your local park district and special recreation services department,you could be a coach or a camp helper or something with people with these types of disabilities.Good luck.

It depends on how you mean you want to work with them.  You can probably start immediately as a volunteer in your community.  If you mean you want to teach them, you'll need a master's degree.
By the way, Down Syndrome and autism are two entirely different diagnoses that can't be lumped together.  I highly suggest researching both of them before trying to work with people who have such diagnoses.

They are 2 different diagnosis but children can have both.  what you can do now is a paraprofessional also called an aid provided you don't have a record, and have a H.S. diploma.  You could shadow 1 student also.  Also you could work at a respite care, afterschool care program right now.  Suggest for finding what is local to you is going on your states autism chapter website.  There will be lots of info there, so start calling places.

How late do you allow visitors stay when you have small children?



My hubby and I just had our first child; she's 5 weeks old.  While she is still too young to be expected to be on a sleep schedule, I want to create a routine for going to bed as soon as possible.  We have family that likes to come over at 8 or 9 and stay until 11.  While they are quiet (ish), they all have to hold the baby and kiss her goodbye which wakes her up.  Inevitably, after we've had guests that late, we have a very rough night and morning.  Plus, we can't go to bed early either and catch up on sleep.  I was thinking 8:30pm would be a decent visit cutoff time and would allow us to bath her, feed her, and create a calmer environment for her to sleep in.  Does that seem too strict or early?  I need some outside perspective on this.  Thanks.



</question>



<additional details>



These family members are coming specifically to visit the baby this late.  If we tell them they can't hold her because she's asleep, they won't want to come.  They see the baby for at least 4-5 hours on the weekend each week anyway.  I don't think they'll be baby deprived.  :)

I don't have a cut off time if the company is quiet. However I do not allow them to play and kiss and hold him and get him all excited. I put him down to sleep at the same time (most of the time) every night and I don't allow anyone to interact with him after that.

EDIT:
if they are coming specific for the baby then they should have more consideration then that. but 8:30 is very reasonable. More reasonable then I would be.

Thanks.  We tried letting this bunch of the family visit after bedtime and they ended up being very loud.  My goal is to encourage them to visit earlier during the weekdays at least.  They all finish work up by 3pm each day anyway so I don't know why they come so late.

I totally understand where you are coming from! I think 8:30 is perfect. 
My daughter is now 10 months old and for as long as I could remember we start her bedtime routine at 8:30. In which time we give her a bottle, a bath, a story, and then off for to bed for her. Then Mommy and Daddy get some alone time!



I think 8:30 is a perfect time! It is not strict or too early at all!! If you ask me, it is rude of visitors to stay so late! 
GoodLuck

I think 830 is an acceptable time to end visitation. It's a great idea to create a nightly routine in a settled environment, you obviously know that this will instill a long term routing which will help your baby sleep better at night, get to sleep easily, and eventually be a more stable individual. Great job, mom.

If your baby is only 5 weeks old they are being rude for staying so late in my opinion. Just let them know you are working very hard on getting her on a set schedule and need the them to leave by your designated time so all of you can get rest. I don't see anything wrong with it at all.

While I do understand your point and frustration, I am not so happy with the cutoff time. Are you going to tell them not to come over to see the little cutie? How will they take that? Will you, in the longer run, be affecting your daughter's relationship with her relatives negatively? Think about it...

Just explain that you love the company but you are trying to get her on a schedule so when she is awake they can visit with her but when it's time for her to go to bed, its time for them to say goodbye to her but not to you. They are welcome to stay but not to wake her when she's been put down. It's simple, and I'm sure your family and friends will understand.

When my daughter was a newborn, we never let anyone stay past 9, cause that's when my husband and I needed to go to bed to feel halfway refreshed in the morning! She's 1 now and usually goes to bed around 7 or 8, so we haven't really had anyone over recently. I don't want her sleep to be disturbed because of people we have over, plus I know she won't sleep if she knows people are out here cause she'll feel like she's missing out on something. Not only that, but once she goes to bed is my only time for me! So I treasure that.

You should do whatever you feel is best suited to you.
I would never allow anyone to lift or disturb mine if they were sleeping.
It just upsets them.
I also tried to get them used to noise by having music playing or the TV on which did work.
I would just emphasise with the family not to disturb her sleep.

Children under 10 or so should go to bed much earlier. 8:30-9pm should be a late bedtime, not time to start getting ready for bed. Be strict with your rules for guests. Tell them to say goodnight to your baby and put her to bed. Period. They do not get to break the rules just because they think they can be quiet. Your the parents and that is the rule. If people need to be gone before you can put her to bed, then select an earlier time that people need to leave by so that you can get her to bed at a decent hour. Baby comes first, not guests. Your on the right track, just remember that you are the boss now. Everyone comes second to your baby. Congratulations on your baby girl!

That sounds reasonable. Just tell everyone what time they are expected to leave before they even come over, that way they will know ahead of time, and about 15 minutes before it's time tell them it's time for the baby's bath so they will start heading for the door.

As a parent and a grandmother I have to say you are on the right track with your thinking.

However, I would move the time up to 7:30 for ending visiting hours.  The reason why is because as your child gets older you will want her used to being in her bed between the hours of 8 and 8:30 p.m.

You will want your quality time with your child as well as a family.  You will also want to get all of your feeding and bath done before bed time and have quality time to read to your child or just hold the child for that one on one bonding before the child goes to sleep.

Eventually you will want and actually can't wait for your child's bed time so you can have quality time of your own and have private time with your mate especially if your time is already on a schedule due to working or going to college.

You are a family now and are now in the phase of parenting and its time to change your path and make plans to secure your bonds of just the three of you and it is hard at first to divide up your time but your child is more important and the child and your self need all the rest you can get now because when the child is old enough, you will find your time limited and it will seem there is not enough time to get everything done.

It's ok to have family and friends around, however, those who care about your family need to realize that you have a family now and a new life to lead.  They will understand and won't get their feelings hurt because they know that you are only thinking of the child.

I would let everyone know your schedule for visiting hours so no ones feelings get hurt.  That way they can plan in advance and you can be prepared for their visit and the baby will be a wake.

Also, you may want to limit the number of visits especially since your child is such a young age.  Little babies can catch everything because their amune system is not as strong as ours.  So make sure they all wash their hands before handleing the baby and make sure no one holds your child or gets near him/her that is feeling sickly.

I'm not saying put a bubble around your child, I am saying take the percautionary measures to protect your child.

Best of luck and congrats on your new arrival.

I had massive problems with getting my 3 month old son to sleep.  He would just lie awake and cry for hours, then when he finally went to sleep he would wake every hour or two hours through the night and cry again!  Talk about pulling our hair out .... we were absolutely desperate for sleep!

It was a baby sleep audio program recommended by a friend that finally saved us. We followed the advice and began by creating a baby sleep routine which included bathtime, dimming of the lights, putting Paul into his crib, final nappy change and then lullabies. We also made recommended changes to his naps during the day and used some of the other recommended techniques. Within two weeks he was sleeping through the night most nights with just the odd night where he would just wake once!



Definitely start by creating a good baby sleep routine though and you could find that solves most of your baby sleep problems.

Good luck!

Not at all. From day one I had my son on a "schedule". I couldn't control my sons crying, feeding schedule but I could give him scheduled baths, scheduled "play times and daily scheduled walks. At 8pm(I coslept for the first 7 months of my sons life) I would take my son into bed, lay with him until he slept. Now at 8pm he goes to bed on the dot in his crib.



It is not rude to ask vistors to leave but you could still have people over late at night once your schedule gets aligned and your baby sleeps through the night. Especially if you have the baby schedulized.



I found my schedule helped promote an active social life, I could plan baby free social time with friends knowing I could enjoy my time because I KNEW my baby was okay.

If they come over at 8 p.m., then a 1/2 hour visit isn't worth it.



Is this a daily thing, once a week?  She's only 5 weeks old and the baby is still very new to everyone.  Try to stick it out for a bit longer.

Next time they come over at 8 p.m., then at 9 p.m. say "I have to go give the baby a bath and ready for bed.  The last few times she's gone to bed late and it screws up her and my sleep schedule for the night, and she was really cranky the next day."  Go give her a bath, and if they are still there, come out and have them kiss the baby goodnight and go do the rest.

After a few times of this - maybe up the time each time, they will start to figure out (hopefully), that the baby needs to go to sleep a certain time.

What do you think of a mother bleaching her kids skin?



I was just watching a clip from TODAY with Tyra Banks and there were these little boys (black) and their mother would bleach their skin every morning.  She said she couldn't get through to the mother, I think that is sad.  My son is black and I would NEVER do that.  His father is very dark and I look like the babysitter next to my son, but I would never.

It's incredibly sad, but that is the truth. Even in the 50's and 60's, lighter black people had much less discrimination than darker black people.

I think the mother is misguided, but like all mothers, she's trying to do the best for her children.



Society says light is better, so she wants them lighter.

People should work towards a society where people don't even notice.



My ex GF was black, from Haiti, and we went to a trip to america. I have never been so ashamed to be human.

It is very sad.  But whats worse, is the way these people have been treated just because they are black.  I mean, if people thought blacks were just as good as whites, would this be happening?  THis isnt that the parents think black skin is bad, its the response from the outside world treating the parents like crap simply because of their color.  They think that they are making things better for their kids.  Its sad that society has given people these feelsing.

They don't literally pour or place (chlorine) bleach on the skin.  There are products readily available that help lighten your skin.  Generally these things are used to even out skin tone, because of possible scarring, freckles, etc.



I couldn't imagine bleaching my kids, but like someone else said... (in lots of countries, not just America), lighter skin is seen as better.  The closer to white you are the better you are.

Isn't it a trip how that is?

omg, those poor children, im sure being rubbed down with bleach everyday would not be good for their health, my god, it would burn like a bi*ch, (sorry i don't usually swear). i think its incredibly sad that their own mother is trying to teach them that they need to change and that they aren't good enough how they are. that's awful. all children need to be taught that they are loved, valued, wanted and special, regardless of your skin colour. i guess in her own mind she thinks she is doing right by them, but god damn, some one needs to talk some sense into that woman. would rubbing your self down with bleach even work? i cant imagine putting my kids through that every morning. what a sad world we live in when mothers think they have to do that to their children so they can be accepted and get ahead in the world.

Parents: Am I too young to consider having sex?



I'm 17 years old and I am still a virgin.  My boyfriend and I have been together for two years now and we plan on marrying in the future.  We have seriously discussed having sex but I am not sure that we are ready.  I've always been raised to believe sex is for marriage, but it's such a strong temptation.  Should we continue to wait?

Given the fact that you are still unsure about it, I would say wait.  Think about all the possible outcomes.  Pregnancy, STDs, heart break, or even guilt over having sex.  If you both truly love one another then you both can wait for marriage.  I can think of no better gift than to give yourselves to each other on your wedding night.  Stand out from the crowd.  Wait and I'm sure you won't regret it :)

Temptation is strong I know this from personal experience.  Both my husband and I maintained our virginity until we were married.  Boy was it difficult!  But we are glad we waited.  I believe you can.  True love waits.  It shows you both have the self control that far too many lack.

If you aren't 100% sure you are ready, don't do it. If you do it before you are completely ready you will regret it, trust me. Wait until you are married if that is what you believe in. If you don't believe that, wait until you are ABSOLUTELY sure you are ready. When you do decide to, make sure you have started birth control, and take it properly.

That's a call for you to make, a majority of parents will tell you that you're NEVER ready.

If you are unsure if you are ready then yes, you should continue to wait. There will always be temptation, no matter how long you have been together, but imagine how much better it will be to have waited until marriage or until you are absolutely sure you want to. There are other ways to be intimate with each other without being sexual with each other.

As long as there are doubts, you are not ready.

I think you know the answers to your own question.
If you are planning on marrying soon, then wait a bit longer, it will only make your realtionship stronger, take pride in knowing you were able to resist the temptation together as a couple. Strong relationships have a strong foundation...finish building it together. It is a temptation...but you can do it you have already come this far!
Good Luck

Like everyone else said:
If you aren't ready, don't do it.

But when you are, don't take birth control
It can seriously mess you up
It can mess up your menstrual cycle and make you infertile or
at least make it a lot harder to have kids when you want them

So, I would wait for marriage,
but if you think you're ready, go ahead,
but don't take birth control.

No one out here can answer this question for you hun but I think if you have already waited that long and you really think you will marry him then why not have something so precious to share with him on your wedding night? If you two do decide to have sex though just make sure you are responsible and use protection, and make sure that nothing and no one is pressuring you either way this is a decision the two of you have to decide if it's right or not

Are you married now?  No. Then you should not be having sex, age out of the equation.  Be stronger than the temptation and wait.  It is possible.  People used to do it all the time and it was the norm.  I don't know why society started to think that the norm is to have sex before marriage.  They forget the emotional consequences of having sex outside of a committed relationship (committed in that you have committed to spend the rest of your lives together) where real love, the deep real love where respect is at the forefront, not sex, rules the relationship.



You will be much happier with yourself if you wait.  Why do you think mental disease is so rampant in society now?  Much of it has to do with giving yourself so fully to someone before the appropriate time.  Go ahead and thumbs down me, but it's the truth.  People are blinded by their own carnality.

If you are still questioning it then you should wait. If he is going to marry you, what difference does it make if you wait a few more days, months, even years. You do not have to have sex with someone to show love. You will know when the time is right. And if you are asking "how will I know?", The answer is when you completely quit doubting it.

keep on waiting and when you think you can't wait any longer....keep waiting some more.  I was 2 months shy of turning 17 when my boyfriend and I had sex.  Now I am 23 and we are happily married.  At the moment we had sex for the first time,I thought I was ready, but really I should have waited.  Giving up your virginity is something you can never get back and change.  Keep it for the perfect moment (your wedding night or when he pops the question, etc.)



One easy question to ask yourself if you feel tempted is, Am I ready to have a baby? ; )
You already know that if he loves YOU which he probably does, he will wait too : )

it is understand able to want to have sex, with someone you love and known for years

i can relate. I'm 18 a virgin with a bf of 8 months, i want to have sex with him so bad, i researched on all the birth control we could use and where too. but the risk of getting pregnant keeps me at bay.

because we all know even with protection there is still a risk of something happening.

i say talk it over with him, what birth control both will use, ask question about if you both are 100% ready mentally, physically, and emotionally.

i decide to wait until we are living together which can be 3 to 8 years from now. (both college students)

Don't make him go if he really doesn't want to. He's only 5 and it's a bit young to be forced to do something you don't like any more.
But it's worth trying to find out if it's the kick boxing he doesn't like or someone who is at the same class - or even the instructor.
My kids tried all sorts of things out and gave them all up one by one to try out something new but they had a great time trying different activities and it all added to their experience.
Good luck.

Don't force him to do something he doesn't want to do. If he doesn't then it is a waste of money. Take him out if that is what he wants.



But make sure he knows that if you take him out, it is going to be harder for him to convince you to join something else he wants to do in the future. If he wants to join something that will cost you money, you better make sure he knows he needs to stick with it.

He is only 5.  He has the attention span of a puppy.  He probably is bored with it and wants to bounce on to another activity.  It is only a half an hour a week.  I think the you should keep him in the class, so that he learns that when you choose something that costs money, you can't just drop out and leave.  It will help teach him to follow through.  I wouldn't enroll him in any more classes like that, though, untill he is older, 8 or 9, and really wants to do it for himself, not because he thinks it looks cool.

He's 5, he is trying out sports and may get bored easily with it....just don't force him to go. Ask him if he has any interest for other sports and if he wants to try them out and ask them if he can participate for 2-3 lessons to see if he really likes it. But make sure he really likes that sport and if he is willingly to do that sport for more than 6 months before you buy him all the stuff he needs for that sport.

My daughter overseas?



I am working overseas and my 16 year old daughter wants to come live with me as my Xwife says she does not want her anymore. We have talked about this for a while but in the middle of divorce the lawyers have recommended against it. AT 16 she can get her own passport in Canada and she is very very eagar to come live with me. We have a good relationship, always have, what should I do??

Is your daughter coming to you for the right reasons, is the ex-wife strick,or daughter not liking the rules and she feels daddy would be easier. 16 is not a good age for any parent, they feel grown up and start getting into things that you might not agree with, she has to sort her relationship with her mother before she can move on as she will regret it later. I can see that she would like a move,but what about schooling,some places finish at 16 ( England )and others at 18 ( US ), you must take all this on board when deciding what is best for everyone.



Think this, what rules would you lay down and would she want to go back to her mother if she doesn't agree with your rules. are you ready for a terrible teenager if things head that way..

It's awesome that you have a good relationship now, but that doesn't mean that you will continue to have one when she is living in a strange place away from her mom who "doesn't want her anymore" and the pain of this all settles in. I had an amazing relationship with my dad my entire life - I seriously thought he was just so freaking cool - UNTIL I chose to move in with him at 14 instead of moving with my mom & stepdad overseas. The dynamics of our relationship completely changed when he went from being the fun weekend dad to the primary parent who suddenly enforced curfews & got on my case about things. I was very close to my mom (still am, she rocks), and I missed her so much it was literally a physical pain. Even if your daughter isn't close to her mom, chances are she will begin to miss her. It's just the way humans are wired.

I would very strongly recommend that you have your daughter see a therapist for a little while so that she can have a totally neutral adult to talk everything through with, to be a soundboard, and support her. It would be almost impossible to be completely honest with either of you about her feelings without worrying it would hurt you or something, and this is way, way, way too much to put on her shoulders. There is just so much going on - the divorce, issues with her mom, the idea of moving to a new country at 16, the middle of high school & an awful time to try to break into a new social circle, worrying about how that might affect college..... Yowsas. My parents had me see one to help make the decision, and had wanted me to keep seeing her  after the move, but I had too many things going on & didn't have the time. I really regret not making the time because it would have been incredibly beneficial to have talked things through, to have expressed everything instead of bottling it up or acting it out.



I also think a therapist would be helpful for her because I cannot imagine a deeper cut than having your mom not want you anymore. Just reading those words made me wince because I would be beyond devastated if my mom felt that way about me. It would be acutely, unbearably painful, a deep betrayal, & I'd probably self-destruct.



My parents divorced when I was really young, and have always been on great terms (not once have they ever bashed one another in front of me or pulled me into drama), but I've witnessed the turmoil my friends have gone through during divorce, and it's awful. Teenagers need to feel like we have some control over our lives, and the reason so many girls (so, so many, seriously) cut, sleep around, 420, or are Ana / Mia is because it gives her complete control when there is chaos spinning around them, and because they need to distract themselves from the emotional pain with physical pain. Parents are almost always clueless about all this.

Focus on her emotional health and well being rather than the legalities. Understand that however stressful the divorce is on you, it's even more stressful for her. Please don't ever badmouth her mom in front of her (not saying you do, but UGH my best friend's parents do all the time & it's so infuriating). Let her vent if she wants, but don't ever talk about her mom in a negative way, no matter what she's done, because your daughter still loves her despite whatever she says to the contrary & will be hurt.



I don't know why the lawyers don't want her to go with you to Canada, but I wouldn't share any of that with her. Deal with that with your lawyer and ex-wife.



Sorry this is so long & raw. I just came across this question randomly & felt compelled to answer because I think dads, even the best of intentioned & awesome ones, can be really out of touch sometimes about what it's really like to be a teenage girl & I wanted to give you an honest perspective.



Best of luck to you both.

Advice needed from single mums please ?



My sister is a single mum who has a 6yr old boy(only child). 
She never told his dad that she was pregnant and therefore he doesn't know about him(very short relationship). 
Lately he has been asking more and more about who his dad is, why hasn't he got a dad and so on.
Just looking for a bit of advice on what to say to him from someone who has been in the same or similar predicament or has knowledge in this area.
Thanks a lot.

My best friend is also a single mom, and although it is a little different as far as he knows about her little girl, but he hasn't made any kind of attempt to see her. so therefore she has decided to tell her daughter that she and him just didn't work out, that it isn't her fault that he isn't here, and its his loss, not yours, and therefore he isn't around. i would suggest to your sister that she tell him the truth, and that his dad can't be there. but that it isn't his fault, but that no matter what that his mom will be there. good luck with it.

It really isn't a subject you should broach with him. He obviously has his own suspecions. He will confront your sister at some point, at that time she will have to make a choice. Whatever her choice is(tell him the truth about paternity or not), you as her sister should support her choice enough to not tell him on your own. 
She would be immature to not devulge the truth too him but she could have her own reasoning.

Please find that boy father. It is not his fault that mommy and daddy didn't work and he deserves to know his father. If the father is tripping go online and order a home paternity test for like $100 and send it in and get the results back in like a week.. I had to do it that way. But if the mom cant handle it then she really needs to find the father and let them meet besides it is not right to keep a child from their father because she was pissed it didn't work out. Really I believe there is nothing you can say to the your nephew to make him stop asking at that age because he see that's everyone else have a father and he wants one to. Best of luck

Would you consider that some teenagers in today's society are ungrateful?



Back when my dad was a teenager (late 60s, early 70s), he took his punishment without complaint.



When I was a teenager, I hardly ever got into trouble but I never told my parents, "that is so not fair" when I got grounded.  I never whined to my parents to buy me designer clothing (interestingly enough, my mom thinks I dress too frumpy now but that's a different story).



Nowadays, you see kids as young as 11 or 12 begging for a cellphone (I was happy to get a pager at 16).



When they screw up and get grounded, they'd cry "that is so not fair" because they wouldn't be able to text or email or call their friends to hear the latest gossip because they were out too late at night.



I've heard of this show on MTV called "My Super Sweet 16" where stupid parents waste their hard-earned money to give their kids expensive crap that they really don't need.  When I was 16, I had a dinner party at a local Mexican restaurant and that was it (I didn't have a lot of friends then).



Do you think that some teenagers (I'm not saying all kids, just some) act too whiny and ungrateful?  If you have teenagers, what do you teach them about being grateful and obedient?

I would agree with you on most of your points.  The only reason I wouldn't fully agree is that I have a hard time blaming them completely for their behavior.



I'm only 23, but when I was a kid, I felt very much the same.  Looking back, I was so very ungrateful for all my parents gave me.  Now that I've grown up, I realize that they were actually quite generous, and that life at home was good!



That said, we are now in an age we are given instant gratification for almost anything.  Anymore, it's not enough to call a friend's house and leave a message on their answering machine (who has those anymore anyways, right?).  We don't just wait patiently.  We can text them, e-mail them, page them... there are many more possibilities for instant gratification in our relationships than there were even ten years ago.



I think perhaps because of this instant gratification in many aspects, thanks to the Internet, teens today are used to getting or knowing what they want immediately in many areas... and they think it ought to be the same at home.  The media also portrays the rich teens on TV because it encourages them to aspire for wealth, and motivates teens to acquire expensive computers, clothes, phones... you name it!  Kids don't understand that not every cute blonde teenager in California gets a $10,000 birthday party.



If we'd kept limits on the Internet and TV when it had first come about, this might never have happened.  But on the other hand, everyone would agree that the Internet is probably the innovation of our time...  I guess that it is going to be a challenge for me, when I become a parent, to come up with innovative ways to teach my children about what life is really about.  Think of it as blazing a trail to a new way of parenthood!  :)

I see a lot of ungrateful teens but it stems from their parents.  If you spoil and let your kids get away with things then they grow up the same way.



I have 4 kids (14, 10, 3, 1) and none of them run the show in my house and neither do their friends.  They've always known I'm the boss and there are consequences to their actions.  Those kids on those tv shows were obviously always given what they want.



When my eldest daughter was about 8, I was getting my nails done and she was sitting nearby watching me.  As my nails were drying, some richy prissy lady said "is that your daughter" and I said "yes", she continued to say "she's being really good over there, you should get her something for being so good."  I quickly responded to "Are you serious?  I'm not giving her a gift for being good, she's supposed to behave without a prize.  She'd get a foot in her butt if she doesn't behave."



Same thing with chores, I don't pay my kids to do household chores.  It's their responsibility.  I do give allowances but they have to earn it.  I've heard kids tell their parents "I'll take the garbage out only if you pay me?", that made my mouth drop when the mom gave him $5.  And this lady wondered why she had no control of her son.



I know there is always that small exception of an out of control kid where the parents did everything right but the kid just came out that way but it is always usually the parents and spoiling a child is one of the worst things you can do if you don't want to create a monster.

I think it has to do a lot with where you grow up and who you grow up with. From a young age my parents taught me the value of a dollar and how far I could stretch it.



I know a lot of people my age (19) who are the same way as me. However I also know some people my age who are so immature about things like that, that they actually seem so much younger than me.



I also think it's the parents fault that teens are this whiny and ungrateful. If the parents keep giving in without putting their foot down, then their teen is just going to keep being whiny and ungrateful.

My mom's generation was considered lost, the gyrating-hips-Elvis/Beatles/drugs/free love/pregnant-teen/Me generation.



My generation was the oversexed/Madonna/drug-using-Hard-Rocker... generation.



Both of our generations supposedly represented disrespectful, ungrateful, irresponsible teens who had



My mom was doing some on my great-grandmother, who was born in 1894. While looking for her birth record in the paper she noticed a news store about how terrible teenagers were, how they were using drugs, were disrespectful whiners and OMG they would be the youth who would be running the country eventually.



Go back to the ancient Greek times and you will find writings of the ancient philosophers that complain about the disrespectful, uncaring, greedy and generally useless youth.



No, nothing has changed. Every generation makes this kind of complaint about the next generation(s). The older you get the better your generation was.

How funny... We seem to be the about the same age.  I bet we could talk about this subject for a while.



I'm a teacher at a private middle school.  It seems to me that there are quite a few teenagers that can't appreciate what they have and don't realize how privileged they are.  Every child in my 8th grade homeroom has a cell phone.  The all shop at Hollister and Abercrombie (it seems exclusively).  And sadly, I hear the way a lot of them talk to their parents.  Its shameful.



There are some really great kids out there too!  So I have hope.



I tell my children that I don't own a new car or the best clothes or live in a huge house but I've never been happier in my life.  They look at me like i have 5 heads.  Hahaha.  It's true though, and I wish they could appreciate it.

Also, seeing a few episodes of super sweet 16 makes me sick, imagine being so selfish and self absorbed when there are 16 year old thai prostitutes working for 4 dollars an hour but your parents get you a silver mercedes instead of a black.

"My Super Sweet Sixteen" isn't a very good example of all teens. Those girls are like that because their parents let them be like that.



I don't think it's that teens nowadays are naturally ungrateful, rather it's their parents not teaching them to be grateful. Being a teen myself, my parents taught me to appreciate what I have, even if it's not a lot. I'm astonished when I hear girls whine about not being able to go tan because they failed or call their parents inappropriate names because they wouldn't let them hang out with their friends.



So please don't put all the blame on the teens, the soft and passive parents have a lot to do with it too.

Yeah I've seen my share of that in my high school, although I'm not saying I'm perfect by any stretch.



We've had several guests to our school from places where people live much harder lives, things like Invisible Children and refugees from all around. Sometimes just hearing their stories (or watching movies in some cases) does have an impact... I think a number of us honestly do walk out of there and feel like our own rebellious attitudes and superficial needs are a bit ridiculous...



I don't really think I can give any great suggestions... Luckily I have tended to notice that many of my peers have matured now that college is around the corner...



Just wanted to share some thoughts. :)

<question>



Some boys I knew back in elementary school?



I really don't know where to put this but I am just so thrown right now.  These two boys I went to school with a while ago committed murder.  They put a ladder to the window and looked inside to see the poor woman was sleeping, but they armed themselves anyway.



One brought a rifle and the other brought a metal bat. They cut the screen on her window, snuck in, unplugged all the phone jacks in the house, cut the power in the home.  The woman woke up during the burglary and they beat her to death, all because they wanted her damn xbox(yes i know she was old, she had grandchildren who liked to play it) and now people are sticking up for them.



It's sickening, really. The aunt of one of the kids said 'our town is a prejudice one, and these kids are going to be made to look like monsters because they killed a white woman'- what does race have to do with anything?! they killed a woman for her xbox, they ARE monsters!



Oh and another person said 'You people don't understand the whole situation. Before you judge someone you should know all the facts. Yes, it's a shame that this had to happen, but none of you know what the circumstances where that lead them to commit this crime. I'm not saying it's right by any means, but they both had rough lives in the little time they have been on this earth. So think about that before you say anything. This could be your family member some day. Also to everyone who says they should rot in prison..........just remeber they are still children. If your going to blame anyone blame the mothers. Just because they aren't showing emotions doesn't mean they don't regret what has happened.'



...what the HELL does that have to do with anything?  "oh my mom doesnt pay attention to me..i think ill kill the neighbor"..what!  They're 14 and 15..they knew what they were doing, being children doesn't make it any better. Parenting has nothing to do with how they acted, even if your parent never tells you killing is wrong, it's common sense!  I hope they both get sent to prison and are beaten, so they can see how they like it :(



God, I cried when I heard about this.  Does anyone agree that this is messed up? Or does anyone side with the kids families? Would you honestly say that the parents are at fault for this?



I'm sorry this was so long :/

Every morning is a battle with her first its the sleeves on her school uniform cardigan they have to be just above her wrists or she has a fit then her shoes must be pulled so tight they leave marks on her feet we are often late for school as she has to stop many times and pull them tight on the way. She doesn't sleep very well either and a few times Ive gone to the toilet early hours of the morning and found her wide awake playing with her barbies.She is a very emotional child and always wants lots of kisses and hugs which I give her but she is constantly crying. She always says that I love her brother more than her which isn't the case and I always make sure we spend time just us two going to the cinema or shopping I just don't know what to do for the best when I drop her off to school in the mornings I think that god for that Im physically and emotionally exhausted.

Ask the school what she's like there... does she have similar behaviours there?
If she does, explain your concerns and ask for them to get the Educational Psychologist involved.



Also get your GP involved to see if there's another problem.



She may just be an emotional child, but better to get it checked out.
Also before you go to the GP make a list of all the "odd" things you experience with her, like the sleeves and shoes etc.



Good luck

Hi there,  i understand this must be so hard for you to see your daughter in this way - my niece had a similar OCD, she HAD to have her socks on perfectly, the front had to be exactly pulled across her toes and she wouldn't put her shoes on until they were - used to drive my sister mad as she'd spend over 15 mins every morning before school, trying to get her socks right, then she had to put her shoes on really carefully so the socks didn't move into the wrong place!



My niece just eventually grew out of this, it lasted a good 5 months though! We think back now and realise it was around the exact time she was having problems with her dad, she must have been worried/stressed/anxious about what was happening and so used the "sock" obsession to take her mind off of it!



This sounds like what is happening with your daughter, talk to her and find out what is worrying her - maybe her brother is being a typical mean big brother telling her that you love him more than her (i'm not saying this is the case, but it's just an example) she may be worried or upset that it's the truth, so she's developed an obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to take her mind off of it - so she can think about her cardigan and shoes, rather than what is upsetting her!



You can either talk and try to find out what's wrong, then try to fix it - or wait for her to grow out of it and realise for herself there is nothing to worry about, it's up to you!



I hope you mange to find out whats wrong and i hope i've helped!

She may be cranky in the morning because she doesn't get enough sleep. It's a cycle where she sleeps late, wakes up early, groggy all day. Suggest you modify her sleep habits by:



1) Get HER lots of physical exercise after school. This will be good for her and tire out for the day.



2) Diet- Have dinner earlier and regularly at the same time so her food digests well. No late night snacks, which can energize her at night.



3) No mentally intensive activity before bed- (no video games, movies, etc)



4) Sleep earlier.



5) Have a calm light chat with her before bed...let her speak her mind and express her concerns. Try to understand her problems and talk until she falls asleep. Something must be bothering her, so see if you can find out what that is.



Good luck.

There's no harm in seeking some expert advice via your GP, but it sounds like she's a very intelligent child - not many 6 year olds would compare the love given to her, compared to what she perceives her siblings getting; this could explain why she's so sensitive. She probably has a very active brain and finds it hard to switch off at night, spending time thinking about things when other children of that age would just go to sleep. One of the above answers is good in suggeting a very relaxed wind down to bed time, including a good story which will hopefully occupy her brain instead of all her personal thoughts.
In some ways she reminds me of my son at that age - he hated labels in clothes, we had to cut them out. He was also very aware of his socks not being straight (said it felt wrong) and his sleeves being the same length.He was very sensitive too. If it's any consolation, he grew out of it and is now a normal - but intelligent and still sensitive - 21 year old.
But if it really is worrying you, do ask to see a child psychologist, or whatever your doctor advises.

do not blame yourself not all problems relate to the child's environment.
keep reassuring her but see a doctor.

I think you need to speak to her teacher and find out if this behaviour is happening at school too.  To me it sounds as though she may have some form of OCD with the socks and the cardigan thing.  I suggest you have a chat with your GP too, because they may be able to help with behavioural therapies.  Behavioural Therapists sound scary, but my sister is having problems with her son at the moment, and he's being assessed, and they've been great.  Basically they help by observing the way children play and using games to sort the problems out.  If she is constantly crying have you asked her why?  Maybe she is being bullied at school, or maybe she is a little jealous of her brother, especially if your son is at home with you all day while she is at school.



Good luck anyway

Could a family member be molesting my children?



I have 2 children 8 &4 boy & girl. My brother lives with my parents and has trouble making friends. He is not mature for his age of 25 and is very aggressive toward others. The only thing I have seen is he constantly tickles my children on there high inner thigh and it makes me uncomfortable. He constantly makes fun of my son and has him upstairs in his room playing video games. I check on them constantly but, I have never seen anything else of concern.

<question>



I shoved my mom and was going to hit her?



My mom is a single mother. It's just her, my older brother who is about to turn 19, me 16 and my 15 year old brother.
My brothers always follow the rules and stuff, I'm a bit more of a handful for my mom.
My mom and I got into a screaming match Monday morning, and I left, went to school and didn't get home until about 9:00 p.m. that caused another screaming match, she said I was grounded. Tuesday I didn't get home until about 7:30 p.m. and she was totally ticked off because I was supposed to be grounded. So that caused yet another screaming match. I went to leave, and my mom grabbed my arm, I turned around and shoved her to the ground and was going to start fighting her.



My brother (the soon to be 19 year old) interviened.
He and I then started getting into a shouting match, I pushed him.
And then he grabbed me and put me down on the floor over his knee and starting spanking me. He's never done that before. He was yelling how sick and tired he was over me never listening and being disrespectful and disobedient.
When he was done, he made me apologize to our mom.
And now he's saying he's taking over parenting responsibilities, and my mom agrees!!!!!
She's going to allow him to discipline me if I get out of line.
I was going to go to a party tomorrow night, but now I don't think I can because I'm afraid my brother might spank me again, what should I do?
Is it legal for my brother to do that? Should I call the police?

I think you have a very unique opportunity ahead of you. You seem to get upset easily and can even be irrational at times, but you're capable of recognizing your situation for what it is. A lot of people would have left several details out of the story that you did just to get people on their side, but you were very honest and open even though a lot of people will bash you for it.



You might be upset at the way things are turning out for you right now, and I know you don't like the idea of your brother disciplining you, but I think it will be beneficial for you in the long run. You might not realize it now, but the way you are acting right now is affecting your future. If you continue to act unruly and even start getting violent, your personality will gradually shift to accommodate that. Eventually, you will become someone that you don't want to be. You will realize one day that you are unhappy with who you've become and you'll want to change. Which is good, but it will be much harder for you to change then.



If you go with the flow now and put forth a genuine effort to try doing a few things differently, I think you'll find that your attitude will gradually adjust to be happy with it. Try to reestablish your relationship with your mother. You might even get to the point that you see her as a friend. Good luck.

Call the police, and they will laugh at you and say you should listen to your mom. I would've slammed your a@@ to the ground, and dragged you into your room by your hair if you ever laid a hand on me.
You need to grow up, and be more respectful.

no you should not call the police. They should call the police because of you! You need some counseling or something. It's perfectly fine for your brother to be taking up the parenting. There's no law against it. You could try to legally emancipate yourself but that would be useless because your mom is doing nothing wrong.

Are you a girl or a boy? If you are a boy and you tried to hit a woman you are pathetic. IF you're a girl you should really try to mind your mother. She works hard to take care of you and you just disrespecting her is not cool. I understand why your brother intervened.

Usually, brothers and sisters fight, so I would most definetly not call the police, because they police will take you, not him.  Ask him if you can go.  Tell him you will change and be back by you curfee (if you have one.)  That is my advice.

If you call the police, you will be locked up in a youth detention center because they can't control you. That is what they do with unruly kids. You need to make more effort to stay in line. Then you wont have to worry about a spanking.

Wow Wow and Wow  first you shouldn't have disobeyed yur mom, but your mom was kind of unfair though she has the right to punish you. on the other hand your own brother has no control over you and you shouldn't listen to him or obey him an any way he's only 3 years older than you big wup

Definitely not normal but there may be some health problems with these children that means that nappies are the only option. Most uk nurseries (kindergartens) for children aged 3-5 don't accept children unless they are reliably clean and dry but if they take a special needs child (downs syndrome etc) they will make allowances.

you should not judge unless you know why they are wearing them. They most likely have some medical condition that stops them from being trained. A 5 year old would not be wearing a nappy for no reason. Where I am a child has to be toilet trained to go to 3 year old kinder. The fact that the nurse is changing them says they have problems. Many Autistic kids train very late. Don't judge till you know the facts

That is not normal! They must have overindulgent parents who tell them "it's ok" everytime they go in their pants, so there's no incentive to use the toilet. That's disgusting.



To Rachel's answer above me: Of course if someone is going to change them it would be the nurse, who else??? You cannot expect a teacher to do that! I can just see it now... a teacher telling a class of 5 yr olds to wait for the lesson because she has to clean up a pooh (while the other kids run around unsupervised and start hitting each other - NOT what we teachers go to college for 5 years for!!



Here in the U.S. children must be toilet trained to enroll in Kindergarten.

You'll likely never convince him to have kids.  You married him knowing he didn't want any and for the last 12+ years, neither did you.  All you can do is tell him exactly how you feel and why you want to have kids now.



If you still want them and he still doesn't, there may be some serious soul-searching in store for you to decide which you want more, your husband or children.  If it's children, you will likely have to do it on your own or with a new partner.



Tricking your husband into parenthood is definitely a bad idea.  Don't start sabotaging condoms or diaphragms, creating that kind of deceit will definitely send you careening into divorce court.



Best of luck to you!

My husband decided that the two (school-age nowe) children we have are enough and that we were not going to have any more.  I don't know if he ever really wanted kids because we never discussed whether or not to have kids--I just ended up pregnant the first time and we did plan the second.  Despite wanting more, I recently came to a place of acceptance.  He is a writer and I work outside the home, so I realized that it was unfair of me to ask him to have to care for an additional child, an infant to boot.  We don't make enough to justify paying daycare fees.  I'm also over thirty.  We're done with the baby stage and are looking forward to the next phase.  I sent all the baby stuff I was hanging onto to Goodwill.  A couple months later, I find out I'm pregnant.  Telling him was difficult, but I knew he wasn't going to leave me or make me abort.



That said, I don't recommend "accidentally" getting pregnant.  I'm one of the "lucky ones", as they say.  Unless you know how your husband really feels, you could find yourself having to choose between him and your child.  That being said, if having a child is that important to you, you may have to try to find someone else to have a child with or have a child on your own.

What a tough position you are in, but you can not hold it against him, you knew what you were getting when you married him. I do not say this to be cruel, but so that you do not blame him. You can't convince people to make such life altering decisions.



It would be great if he were to say yes, but even if he does at this point I think down the road he will struggle & it will show in your marriage. My philosophy is one NO & 1 YES = a NO. When it comes to an innocent child both people must be on board.



I think you need to decide what you want more at this point: a child or your husband.

This is a tough one! My husband didn't kids either and it really devastated me. He always wanted a vasectomy. One day I got pregnant, and now he's the most doting father. I don't want to tell you to try to get pregnant anyway, only because it is a little dishonest... but accidents happen!



You've been married a long time. You adore him. If having a child means so much to you, perhaps he would at least consider talking about it with a counselor or mediator so that you can work something out. Wanting a vasectomy and wanting a child are two very different things.



Good luck, I know how hard it is to be in this position. Somehow things just have a way of working themselves out. Stay positive!

You don't. He signed on for this marriage feeling that you were in total agreement on this subject. Then you changed your mind. If it becomes a really big issue, I'm sorry to say, you might have to go find somebody that wants to have kids and make them your new husband. DO NOT do anything crazy like poking holes in condoms or "forgetting" to take your pills. That kind of **** will cause more trouble than it's worth.

Just a thought, but if you have to "convince" him, he may end up becoming resentful toward that child &/ you.  Just as, now that you've changed your mind about children, you may become resentful towards him if he decides to stick to your original agreement.  You've got yourself a tough one.
Good Luck

Well if it was discussed before getting married and he wants a vasectomy.... then he is not having kids.  You should just collect your loses and move on to someone who does want kids.  If you are really serious about wanting kids, then you need to find a man who wants them with you, its something you will regret later in life if not.

He probably thinks that you are going through a phase and it will pass. I think you should just keep talking to him about. Be open and calm and explain WHY you want to have a child. Explain how important is to you. Tell him that you think it will bring you two closer.



Just keep talking to him (but try not to nag). I strongly disagree with the idea of "tricking" him into it because then he would always be resentful and it would surely wreck your relationship.

such things can lead to the downfall of relationships. Let him get use to it, find a friend who has a baby and offer to take care of it with your husband. Try to show him how great it can be to have a baby. This is the best tip i can offer you.

What do I do about this guy, I need help I don't really know what I should do? ?



So I'm 14 and in grade 9. Like 10 months ago someone lets call "bob"found me over facebook, because we turned out to be in the same grade 2 class years ago, and he told me I was his first crush! After a few weeks of chatting on msn, he comes to visit me at my school (this is when I was in grade 8 and he was in grade 9) and he looked obviously so different, in a real good way. The thing I like about him is that he is real physically strong, loves going to the gym and is real muscular, but hes SO sensitive and emotional and no other guys would ever tell me what he tells me. We talk almost everyday on msn, alot of times I have problems or issues and he always helps me out and gives me all this advice, he listens so well and is just so mature in the way he talks. Then about 2 weeks ago he came to watch my basketball game because i was playing the girls team at his school! He looked so much bigger then the last time I saw him.



Then a week ago he sends me this huge long message on hotmail, that was like a page and I was speachless, all this stuff he told me about how he likes me, always has and couldn't believe we knew eachother in grade 2, and how he wants to spend all the time he possibly can with me in person, so we can get to know eachother personally instead of talking online all the time. I told him how much of a sweetheart he was. Then a few days ago he phones me and tells me why he wrote all that, and how he really wants to spend time with me and do things together in person, and that maybe if we both felt the same way we can be more than just friends. He asked if next weekend if I would like to start there, and go out with him.



I real real shy on the phone though, I never talked to him over the phone before, always used to online. Theres so many other guys in my school in my grade who like me too though, but 'bob" just seems so much more emotional, more mature and seems to express how he likes me and the other kids in my class just say "ur hot" or "whistle" and are so immature and won't tell me anything about how they really are. Some of them are cute too though, but I think bob is totally crazy for me and I think hes totaly different.



Should I go out with him next weekend? Would you give him a chance if you were me, what would you think of him? Please help I just seem so shy to talk to him, and he says I can phone him any hour of any day, he said he would answer any time no matter what.

Maybe because you come on here talking about your mom "dissing" you which is too immature to be taken seriously. If you think your mother is abusing you, contact a school counselor or Child Protective Services. Are you sure foster care is better than your mother? And by the way, throwing ketchup around in McDonalds is not exactly the most grown up thing you could have done. Seriously. If you want to be treated like an adult, ACT LIKE ONE!

actually.. your acts of throwing around ketchup.. depending on your age.. and i'm guessing your over 13.. as the rules say.. is vandalism or disorderly conduct.. maybe both, and punishable by law.  while your actions were illegal.. i think your mother's were immoral.



two wrongs don't make a right.. she needs to learn to grow up herself.  both of you need a swift kick in the boot.



you are in public.  act human and considerate of others, including your family.  treat others how you wish your most precious ones to be treated.  and how you wish to be treated when you are the most vulnerable.

When kids are very young, it's almost impossible.  They are going to be jealous of each other, what friends have and they don't, when one gets to go somewhere that another doesn't, etc.  My two used to be maddening with this.



"You never do ____ with me"
"She never gets in trouble for ___"
"You don't like me as much as ___"
"___'s mom lets them do ___"
"___ got a ___ for their birthday, why can't I"



These are just a few from the list of things I've heard from mine.  All you can do is teach them that everyone isn't the same and everyone doesn't have the same things.  Of course, you should treat your children equally and not favor one over the other.  That's not going to keep them from accusing you of favoritism at some point, though.  When they're being unreasonable with their statements, tell them they're being unreasonable.  At some point, a switch turns and they begin to understand it all a little better.  There's just that period of time in which they're so focused on themselves that they don't realize it all very well.  I've seen a big change in my two with regard to this type of thing as they get older.  They're 10 and 12 now, and I rarely hear things like this from them any more.

tbh, you really can't no matter how you raise them. since every child is unique, one may require more attention than the other. the child can't help but be jealous. also it is an age issue. your 17 might be able to go out alone, but then your 13 year old will ask, why s/he can't do it and you say that s/he isn't old enough and the kid gets jealous. all children are jealous, it's kinda a natural thing, but it is the way that they act on their jealousy! to work with that, then teach them good morals and the love of God.

Well Bub, firstly and most importantly like all of them said was to treat them equally, love and respect. But everything lies within the basic concept of how they are raised, some families for instance have up to threee four kids, one gets something and the rest dont. Yet you may find instances where the others understand, and not beg or plead to get what the other got. it all lies withing raising your kids, values, morals, and affection, one can say treat them equally, yes it helps, but are you really raising them in understanding that concept.

<question>



Some boys I knew back in elementary school?



I really don't know where to put this but I am just so thrown right now.  These two boys I went to school with a while ago committed murder.  They put a ladder to the window and looked inside to see the poor woman was sleeping, but they armed themselves anyway.



One brought a rifle and the other brought a metal bat. They cut the screen on her window, snuck in, unplugged all the phone jacks in the house, cut the power in the home.  The woman woke up during the burglary and they beat her to death, all because they wanted her damn xbox(yes i know she was old, she had grandchildren who liked to play it) and now people are sticking up for them.



It's sickening, really. The aunt of one of the kids said 'our town is a prejudice one, and these kids are going to be made to look like monsters because they killed a white woman'- what does race have to do with anything?! they killed a woman for her xbox, they ARE monsters!



Oh and another person said 'You people don't understand the whole situation. Before you judge someone you should know all the facts. Yes, it's a shame that this had to happen, but none of you know what the circumstances where that lead them to commit this crime. I'm not saying it's right by any means, but they both had rough lives in the little time they have been on this earth. So think about that before you say anything. This could be your family member some day. Also to everyone who says they should rot in prison..........just remeber they are still children. If your going to blame anyone blame the mothers. Just because they aren't showing emotions doesn't mean they don't regret what has happened.'



...what the HELL does that have to do with anything?  "oh my mom doesnt pay attention to me..i think ill kill the neighbor"..what!  They're 14 and 15..they knew what they were doing, being children doesn't make it any better. Parenting has nothing to do with how they acted, even if your parent never tells you killing is wrong, it's common sense!  I hope they both get sent to prison and are beaten, so they can see how they like it :(



God, I cried when I heard about this.  Does anyone agree that this is messed up? Or does anyone side with the kids families? Would you honestly say that the parents are at fault for this?



I'm sorry this was so long :/

Society, like it or not is a really messed up place to be in. Even if they are children, they knew what they were doing is wrong. I mean, they brought weapons with them to harm someone. You don't bring a rifle and a bat to someones house just for fun unless you're planning to shoot some animals and fend off the kill from other animals with the bat.



Basically, they came in knowing what they were doing or going to do. They knew that they wanted to rob the old woman of her xbox and they also knew that they were going to kill her if she tried to stop them. They basically robbed and killed someone for a stupid xbox. I really hope they will get the full punishment from the court. People like that do not deserve to be out in the public. They are still young and they still commited such a horrible crime, think of what they will do when they get older with more temptations in the future.

<question>



Who is the father of this child?



My brother was sleeping with a girl between roughly August 5th and August 25th. She turned out to be a nasty piece of work and he ended their brief encounter when she punched him in the face for asking him to leave the house. She hounded him with texts for a while after. He shortly after met a girl he fell in love with and is engaged. Late September the previous girl announces shes is pregnant. She had been known to say she wanted to break up the relationship my brother had so it was not believed. She gave birth May 6th. She has now contacted CSA and applied for DNA, the letter states she had her period early August and found out she was pregnant end of August. Isn't that too soon to tell as she wouldn't have missed a period. Would she go to the CSA if she wasn't 100% sure? What lengths would someone go to to cause trouble? Does it sound like its his baby? Thank you in advance.



</question>



<additional details>



Thank you for all answers so far, after reading some, can i just add, my brother was told by this girl that she was taking the contraceptive pill, he is not an idiot, just niave and unhappy at the time. Also, the woman in question already had four children with three different men and on benefits, my brother is a good hardworking man who just met the wrong person and is suffering the consequences of a potential cash cow mother!



Oh and '6 DAYS TILL' ... What because my brother was lonely and slept with someone who seduced him then treated him like crap then he meets a girl he loves... yea what a man whore!! Get a life, a brain and a sense of reality you idiot!

My husband has gone through similar crap with a psychotic woman before we met. Since that time she has caused nothing but problems for us. I have a permanent restraining order against the loon because she has tried everything to break us up. We have been married for 8 years now. We also got full custody because she would do anything for attention and she did a lot of things that were endangering their child just to get his attention.
So my point, yes some crazy people would go to CSA even if they didn't know for sure. The only way to know is do the paternity test. If he is the father that is probably a good thing for the child. If his new relationship is strong enough they will be fine. I wouldn't give any thought to when she claimed to of had her period because it is not verifiable.

Regardless if she is lying or not, your brother should take the paternity test to settle this once and for all. (if he isn't the father) They probably will not test until after the baby is born.



If he is, then good luck to him because it sounds like she might be one to play head games.

Also, make SURE it is a court ordered test and he goes through the courts.She may try to trick him by doing private paternity testing.

The period she had in early August could have been her period... she could be the type that runs her cycle like clockwork and knows when something isn't right.

1- your brother was stupid. Just because she said she was on the pill he should still have used a condom. There are also the risks of STDs' and a condom is the only thing that will help protect against them as well as pregnancy.



2- your brother had the choice to sleep with this girl. She did not seduce him or force him to sleep with her. He chose to do it. I have 3 older brothers myself and have never known them to just jump into bed with someone because they were lonely, then blame her.



3- He could very well be the father. She must be pretty certain otherwise she probably would not bother claiming csa and going for the DNA test



4- If he is the father she has every right to claim maintenance off him. It takes 2 to tango and unless he was willing and insisting upon wearing a condom then the risk of this happening was high. He will have to face up to his responsabilities and be a dad if he is the father



The only wronged one in this is that baby. All we have heard from you is your poor brother. What about this poor baby who sounds unwanted. Lets hope if your brother is the father then he can be man enough to be a proper daddy,

<question>



As a Mum, do you think this is an unreasonable thing to say/do to my sons Dad?



My little boy's Dad is notoriously uncaring and terrible at keeping to contact arrangements. He hasn't seen him for 2 weeks now, and has no intention of doing so. He has missed 75% of contact, and chosen other things over seeing his son constantly.



I've now reached the end of my tether - he has changed him number, and the one number I do have he refuses to answer. I've been trying to get him to stick to a routine and he won't.



After trying to contact him for a week, I really cannot be doing with this anymore. For my son's sake - he needs stability that he just doesn't get from his Dad.



I want to tell him (via text so at least he has no choice but to hear me out) that if he doesn't contact me by tomorrow night to arrange to see the little one at the weekend then I will assume that he doesn't want to see him anymore - based on this and his past behaviour and therefore if he wants to make that decision, it's fine by me, but that has to be his FINAL decision. No second chances, no going back, and he won't be able to see him again until Finn is at an age where he can choose to see him.



Do you think that sending this message would be unreasonable?



</question>



<additional details>



I don't want to cut him out at all - I want HIM to make a decision now, not when little one understands (he's 18 months now). I'm hoping it will give him a kick up the bum more than anything else.

Not unreasonable but not the right thing to do I don't think. You can send the text by all means, it might get it "off your chest" so to speak  but I would hold back, you are angry, rightly so but the child's father does have access rights unless a court decides otherwise, you can't assume that by ignoring your text that is the end of the matter.



I would just back off, see how things go. Let him contact you if he wants to see the child. Try not to burden your son with details or criticise his Dad in front of him, just say "Daddy is busy but he'll try to come another day" if he asks where he is. Kids are adaptable.



Keep note of all the information you have told us, dates he let you down, the fact he can't be contacted etc. Go and see a solicitor and ask for advice.



My ex (my kids' Dad) was fairly useless too, he kept letting me down not collecting them, showing up late, never showed up for parents evenings at school, that sort of thing. Pretty much the same scenario as you, but he was still their Dad, they didn't choose him I did.

Don't text!



You have no way of being sure that he has received and read a text. Write a letter and send it recorded delivery or registered post, that way he has to sign for it and you will know for definite that he has received it. You would actually be better off having a solicitor send the letter.
Your son needs stability and he may at a later date decide he wants to see his dad so don't 'bad mouth' his dad, just love your son and look after him.

I do not think this is an unreasonable thing to do. All I have to say is if this is how you feel and if you have a court order with joint custody then you need to get sole custody. Cause if you have joint custody in 10 years your living your life with your son the father can walk right back into your lives like nothing and their is nothing you can do about it. I know this by experience and trust in me it sucks. So if he really doesn't want to be a part of your sons life then do what you can to keep him out. Good luck and God Bless :)

YES!! That is a very unreasonable thing to do. You are now putting your son in the middle. Something the counselors tell you not to do. That sounds very controlling on your part. I am sure you are sick of his behavior. But the only behavior you can change unfortunately is your own.



When the mother bans visitation for any reason...SHE turns into "the bad guy" for the rest of her kids life. I say let HIM be the "bad guy"...he seems to do it so well.



What I would do is just be calm. That will tick him off to no end anyway...(he wants to use you as the big biotch, so that he can weasel out of seeing his kid....the blame game...). What I would do...is get a fresh calendar. Write in when he is SUPPOSED to see Finn. Then if he does....pencil it in...like how long what they did, where they went, ect. Do not tell him that you are doing this. (but something like this could be a very accurate record in court). Your child will undoubtedly have issues in the future with his dad. Then you can just hand him all the many calendars and be totally out of it. ere is the evidence dude. Whatever your dad is telling you...is it in there? Let him be the judge. You are no longer the bad uy.



In the meantime...just take time and connect with your son. And try not to be too biter. Kids can sense that. Let dad e accountable for what dad does...and you be accountable for what you do.

While I understand your anger, if he has visitation rights, you'll likely run into trouble attempting to enforce your decision.



I think you should just kick back and let him be the Peter Pan Man that he is, and hope that he grows up before his son does.



In the meantime, try to find other GOOD male role models for your son, even if they are only people in the news.  You won't need to find sports figures, or typical celebrity types, he'll find them on his own - I'm referring to men who are doing, or have done, positive things in the world.



That way he'll at least have an inkling as to what his potential could be, as well as how a real man behaves.

I dont think thats unreasonable at all.  You dont say how old your son is, but your right, he needs stability, and if he is at an age where he knows that daddy isn't coming to see him when he should then this could cause all manner of confusing feelings for your son.  He may feel unloved, rejected and hurt and you dont want that.  I think that he's had his chances, and if he has chosen not to take them thats his own fault.  It may sound cruel to stop him seeing his son, but your doing it with your sons best interests at heart.

Not at all - your child needs people in his life to be consistent. His dad should either be a father or not, there's no in-between when it comes to parenting.
I have a similar situation with my mum - she's a part-time mother to my younger sisters (in their early teens), and as far as i'm concerned, if she can't even be arsed to send them a birthday card, she has no right to demand time with them.

No, I don't think this is unreasonable at all. Your little boy is your first and only priority and deserves better than this. You've done your best. Actions speak louder than words and with his father's actions it's plain to see he doesn't want to know. Cut this man out of your lives and the two of you can go forward and make a clean break for yourselves.
Don't ever feel guilty and good luck.

I think you'd feel dreadful if he said 'okay, no more contact' Why push him? Perhaps he needs time to realise what hes missing. Why not phrase it in a more compassionate way? "I'm sure you have your reasons for this, why can't we talk about it to try to make the best solution for all of us and the right foundation for our son' type of thing



Try and step back - look at the message from his view point - wouldn't he think you were keen to get rid of him? Would he need any more reason to just leave? Once you close a door it can be difficult to open it again

Kat, I have not had to do what you need to do, but I can tell you my mum went through this with me and my dad.  He became the big bad dad and I had no feelings or respect for him.  My mum was the be all and end all for me.



This is how Finn will feel if his dad cuts all ties with him, and he won't always be a little boy.  One day he will be grown up, a son who is a man to be proud of and with a family of his own.  So tell that to his dad too.



You have loads of good advice here, go with your own feelings for your son, but take the advice of putting anything written into a proper letter and get professional advice if you need it.  This is a very big decision and I can very well understand your reasons for wanting to sort this out in a way that will benefit Finn, and ultimately everyone else. xx

No it's not unreasonable. He's had his chances and he's blown all of them. Your son is quite young isn't he? How on earth can you explain to him that daddy can't be bothered to see him? You can't. Limit his impact on your son's life. Not having daddy around will give him more stability than empty promises from his dad.

No I think you are absolutely correct. You are doing your job as a parent by looking out for your child, and doing what is best for him. I'm glad that you are willing to let your child choose when he is old enough. Many moms in your situation may not allow that, good for you. It is so heartbreaking to watch a child sit and wait for someone who does not show up. Good luck to you and your little one I hope this situation works out.

I know this is tough--but for the sake of your kid you need to bend over backwards to see that he is in the picture. It is a responsibility you should not have to bear---but in the end you have to. If not, someday it will result in unwarranted resentment of your son in favor of this lout. It is just possible if, despite your efforts to facilitate it, this guy keeps ignoring your son, and on his own he will figure out exactly what this poor excuse of a father is all about.

That is completely unfair as a father. People like him make fathers like me (divorced with daughter) look bad.
But you don't want a father who is a bad influence spending time with your son, as he might think that it is ok to do this and maybe worse. So it is probably better that he is out of your sons life.

yeah that's a little harsh. I would try and be a little more patient with him, but at the same time you not having anyway to get ahold of him is completely ridiculous. What if something bad were to happen? I'd say you need to sit down and have a talk with him...2 weeks isn't such a long time, honestly. Most parent's (not the custodial one obviously)only see their child every other weekend anyhow. There is quite obviously more to the situation than what you can and have said here, and i'm sensing alot of hurt feelings between the both of you. Try not to let YOUR feelings about this guy affect you opinions on him as a father. And hopefully he wont't let his feelings toward YOU affect how and when he sees his son. Your baby is young yet, he wont remember any of this. Best to get things worked out now, before he CAN remember it and suffers some sort of psychological damage.



Have a talk with him, see what he says. Take it from there. Best not to just freak out or give an ultiamtum b/c that will only push him farther away, and that is the truth i promise you.

I don't think there is a right answer to this. Either way your son is going to get hurt. I have 32 yrs of experience of an off again/on again dad. My mom tried to pressure him to see me but it did nothing. However, absence of a father is just as painful as an unstable father. If you lay the "final" word down then what if the father decides that he was wrong to stay away, are you still going to keep him away? I am very sorry that you are having to make this impossible decision. Contact a lawyer and find out what you and your son's rights are for custody.

I really want to take my husband away for the weekend as a birthday treat....only problem is we would have to bring my 4 yr old and 6 month old as we dont have anyone to look after them for a whole weekend...I was thinking about bringing our 13 yr old neice too (who is very sensible and grown up for her age)....so she could babysit the kids one night for us to go out for a meal and meet up with some friends for drinks??...I heard it is illegal for under 16's to be left to babysit??...is that true??

Nope it is not illegal. There is no set age, but i think 14 is generally the cut off for most people.



If she is sensible then i would say go for it. However think about an emergency situation. Maybe ask another family member to be the emergency contact, in case she needs the help of an adult. Or maybe inform a trustworthy neighbour?

So if you think she is responsible enough, you can make her baby-sit. I have no idea if that is illegal. But I did that once and I'm under 13/ under 16. I don't really think that I'm that responsible. Well, tell her that her friends can come over if they act responsible enough and if they don't mess up the place. They could come over. so your niece will have a little company. And she won't get bored. Or if that doesn't work, hire a new babysitter. If it's out of time already, you could just take her: your niece.

Yes and for good reason. You should not let a 13yo look after your children. Do you think she is mature enough to seek the approperiate help if something were to happen to your children? What if she falls asleep and something happens to your children.

it is illegal for a  13 yr old to babysit if you think you can trust her then go ahead  but if it was me i would make sure she had a mobile phone number to contact in case of emergencies and make sure it is on at all times or try and see if the place you are going to has a babysitting service

Leaving your 6 month old with a 13 year old? I hope your weekend away is worth it....get ready for abuse from all sides lady.



I'm 19 and I wouldn't like to be left the responsibility of looking after a 6 month old. Maturity has nothing to do with it. Anything can happen and she will have to live with it for the rest of her life if it does. My mum looked after a baby for a neighbour when she was 22, the baby dies of cot death, my mum still blames herself. How can you do that to a 13 year old?

On a technical note, under 16 is illegal.



If something unfortunate happened, eg, freak storm, house struck by lightning, fire, gas leak, stuff like that, which are unpredictable and almost unpreventable, then not only would the 13-year old not be responsible for any injuries your children may suffer, if she herslf gets hurt, her parents or the police may press charges against you.



But in the end, you and your husband will need to make a judgment call on it.

i used to babysit my mums friends kids at 13, they were a bit older than your 2 children tho.



i think it depends on whether you trust your babysitter & her maturity level.



tho with your youngest being only 6 months would your neice know what to do if things went wrong??



would she be able to cope with 2 children?

If it is family there is no legal age - although you ave to be sure they are mature enough and able to cope. It is difficult to say as some 13 year olds are more mature than some 16/17 year olds. Check this site out.

I think if it were me I would prefer to have her babysit at home whilst we went out for a meal.  My reason is that at home she has access to people she knows if she needs help, your house is more familiar to her and obviously your children.



I haven't heard that it is illegal for under-16s to babysit but if you leave your children in the care of someone under 16 then you are still legally responsible for them.  That means that if something were to happen to them you would be prosecuted for neglect.  If you have her babysit at home she will be able to call her Mum or one of your neighbours if she needs some extra help.



Lots of people heven't noticed that you are suggesting taking your neice with you and have her babysit for ONE EVENING whilst you go out for a meal.  I had a second thought that if you really want the trip away why not have the meal in the hotel restaurant - you will still be in the building and can pop back upstairs to the room to check everyone is OK.

These are Absolutely wonderful for a new baby and mum and can be written from baby to Mummy, which is beautiful - there are a variety of different poems and verses too so there will always be something to suit everyone.  You can get these from ebay if you look for the user ID eternal_elegance_1.

You could maybe help her out by buying a moses basket or something like that.  Even if she finds out the sex it is better to buy it in a neutral colour so that she can use it again if she has any more babies.
Another great present I have seen is the baby hand and feet casting kits.  I think they are about £30 online and make a great momento to keep forever.

I think at this stage it would be good to begin by stocking up on the things that are going to be used all the time like baby wipes, nappy cream, nappies, bottles, muslin wraps, crib sheets...etc. These items don't need to be specifically pink..or blue! You could even help out getting things for mum as I'm sure she will need maternity pads, breast pump, nursing pads, nipple cream...etc. Congrats on your upcoming grandparenthood :)

If there is a specific place you want her to go you shouldput her name down now.  However, when she is about two the local council will send you a form to fill out with your choices.
Where I live in UK, children are able to go to nursery from the age of three this is usually only for about three hours a day unless you pay for them to go to a private nursery and then start real school aged four.  The school day usually starts at 9 and finishes between three and half past.

Daycare is available for kids whose parents need or want it even from infancy.



In the U.S., preschool generally starts at age 3 or 4 and kindergarten starts at age 5.  In some places where good preschools are in high demand, it's wise to look into preschools a good year (and in some cases more than that) before your child would enroll.



Number of hours vary wildly by preschool.  They run the gamut from full-day, 5-day-a-week preschools to half-day, twice-a-week programs, with lots of options in between.

Preschool is optional.
If you so choose to send your kids to preschool for some early learning and socialization then they can usually start at 3, or you could choose to send them at 4.



Typically, depending on the preschool or early learning center they may just be early socialization skills that your child will be learning, which is great for them! Some schools, teach some letters and numbers, writing their name, and many do more than that. You just have to research what you are looking for when the time comes.



I personally started looking about 6 months beforehand.



Grade school typically starts when your child is 5 or turning 5 by a certain date in that calendar school.



What the date is will be determined by the state in which you live.



The time in which they are school also depends on your district.
For example my kids start at 7:55 and go to 3:15, my friends start at 8:30 and go until 3:40.



For kindergarten (1st year) they may have either a half day or a full day, depending on what your chosen school offers.



I'd say you have a little while to think about it all ;)

Here is Western Australia kids can start school at 4. They MUST turn 4 by June 30 of the year starting Kindy. If you have a July child they will have to wait a year longer. Some schools do offer 3 year old kindy which is suited for the kids born after July.



The first 2 terms Kindy has 4 half days. From 08.30 - 11.15 or from 12.15 - 3pm (2 morning and 2 afternoons). Then from 3rd term they go 2 full days.



Pre-Primary onwards is 5 full days from approx. 08.45 - 3pm



But it all depends on the school and state.

Where I live (Quebec) kids must turn 5 by October 1 to be enrolled in Kindergarten.  If you want your child registered younger than that they have to go through an evaluation and meet certain requirements.  Then they will repeat Kindergarten until they are "of age" because they must turn 6 by Oct 1 in order to advance to grade 1.  Kindergarten is a regular school day (8:30am - 3pm), 5 days a week.  They also go on the same buses as not only the grade 6 students at the same school, but since we're in a rural area the high school students up to grade 11 -- when they graduate) are on the same bus as well.



Some provinces have Jr K and Sr K.  They are usually half days, every day.  Kindergarten students have their own bus.



In Quebec, there is a pre-K program that is not mandatory, it's half a day, 5 days a week or every second day depending on the school board.  You have to pay for it, but children can start at 3 years old as long as they're out of diapers and buses are not available.



Children and babies can be in daycare starting at any age, depending on the facility.  Some of them are very structured, like a school, but it's a daycare.  Calling them schools, to me, is wishing your kids will grow up faster than nature will age them...and they grow up too fast to begin with.



So as you can see, it all varies greatly by where you live.  Which you don't mention.

Are you in the UK?



If so there's a date by which you have to apply, if I remember right it's in the autumn before your child would start school, so she'd be three and a bit. It's illegal for state schools to favour kids who are put on the list early, all kids who are registered by this date are treated equally.



No, kids don't go to school at 3. They generally go the September after they are 4, so some kids will be just 4 and some will be nearly 5 - and the younger ones will often go for half a day until they are 5 or nearly 5. But you might want to look around for a playgroup for her, many kids start playgroup at 2 1/2.

New Yorkers and car seats???



I do not live in NY city. My question is, if so many of you rely upon public transportation such as cabs and the subway, how do you transport your children? Do you drag around a car seat or are there ones available for you to use on the public transportation? Or is this just a misconception and you all have your own cars?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I don't live in NYC but we visit there sometimes with our kids.  On the subway or bus, you wouldn't bring a carseat.  In a cab, we, at least, would bring the carseat.  It's easy for infants if they have those carriers that are both carseats and things that snap into the strollers.

(9-12 and 9-13) and my last baby was 10-5...your daughter just carries deep in her pelvis...at some point her uterus will rise up high enough for the top of the uterus (fundus) to fall forward and she will go from not showing much at all to showing ALOT...after all the baby is only 8-9 oz in weight and 6" long right now...it is not unusual for your daughter NOT to show at this point, especially with a First baby...she will.

Some people just carry babies in a different way.  When my stepmum had my brother a lot of people thought she had miscarried because she didn't have a bump and was still in a size 10.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with him he was a 7 pounder born.  Just tell her to be glad - no stretchmarks.  Also 19 weeks is not that late, she will probably get a slight bump towards the end

Well, I don't think a family of 4 is big.  But, I grew up in a family of four and it was "typical" by all means.  I have 2 of my own children, 2 step children, and I'm pregnant again. So, that will make 7 in the family.



I'm looking forward to a large family, but also worried about being able to take care of everyone in today's economy.

It's awesome!



My hubby and I always talked about raising a large family.
We now have 5 kids and may possibly be adding one more (we shall see, my period is due today but I have been having the feelings). This would be our last if I am so pregnant.



Anyhow, for me, raising healthy, happy, loving and well adjusted kids is one of the most rewarding things.



You truly get back what you put in and the love we fell is amazing.



It's a lot of work for sure, but so worth it.
My kids are all 7 and under right now and they are so close. It's a great thing to watch the relationships build between them and watch the bonds that they have.
Now that I have a couple in school, I see that the younger ones miss them when they are gone.



For our family personally, it is also important to have some one on one time with each of the kids on a regular basis too. We go out for mommy time and daddy time and have one on one, hot chocolate date or the bookstore, or shopping, you get the idea.



Good luck!

I would tell my 19 year old son and his 17 year old girlfriend that it's time to sit down and have a long talk. I would insist upon a sit-down, with adults.  If there is a compelling reason that the girl's mother should not be told of this, I would want to know why.  I would want to be absolutely sure that this girl was not being pressured or coerced into an abortion and that she understands that there are other options.



Mostly, I'd want to make sure that they understood they were not alone in this and that I would be able and willing to offer support.



ETA: I don't like the no-consent laws for minors having abortions.  Take the controversy out of it, abortion is a surgical procedure with the same risks as any other surgical procedure.  How can the parents of this girl be aware of possible post-surgical complications, possibly life threatening complications, if they don't know there was a surgical procedure performed in the first place?

I would keep quite. 1. Your son will probally be very very angry... and so will his girlfriend. 2. It is there baby and they are the ones who have to make this choice.



I would just sit them down and make sure that aborting it is really what they want to do. It's easy to jump to that conclusion for an easy way out, but after you do it, there is alot of regret. I don't know how you personally feel about the situation but i would tell your son that he's an adult now and he needs to step up! Good luck!



I'd also like to add that i dont know what state you are in but in the state of TX a minor has to have there parent there to sign for the abortion. So, she might have to end up telling them herself.

The parents should be told; for reasons of emotional and physical support. Losing a baby, especially by choice, can be very hard on the mother, and even the father of the infant. Sure there may be some discomfort, but at this point, the health of the one carrying the baby should be the up-most importance.

I think that the mother has a right to know what is going on with her daughter.  Maybe that is why they told you about it-so you could be the one to say something to her mother because she is too afraid to.  Since there was a pregnancy the girl should really tell her mother about the things that are going on and possibly be put on better birth control in the future.

If the tables were turned would you want to know? The thing that makes it tough that you really have to think about is that she is a minor - I don't know what the laws are in your state, but I know there are states where he could be charged with rape and do jail time - not to mention having to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. Would her mom do that to him?

If they are aborting because they are young then that is a stupid reason. They made their bed now they need to lay in it. I think you as their father should have a serious sit down with them. Yes i would tell her mother. She is young enough to REGRET doing this. If thats the only reason then she needs to talk to a counsler about it.

Joshua,



You should let your parents know about this.  You are depriving yourself of sleep and help.  Your parents love you and want you to be healthy and happy.  In the mean time, do not drink caffeine. Caffeine causes your kidneys to expel most of the fluid that passes through them, causing you to have to go to the bathroom more often. Do not drink anything at all a couple of hours before bedtime. Please talk to your parents.

He tickles them, so obviously he's a pedo.



No, i wouldn't worry.... everyone is so paranoid these days. He's not mature, so, not a lot of men are at that age!!



Some boys just don't have many friends, he might not be that social. There's nothing wrong with that.



He's probably just enjoying the kids, he loves them.



He's your brother FFS!!



If you haven't seen anything to worry about, then what are you worrying about. Let them enjoy their relatives.

If you any doubts whatsoever about what your brother's intentions are towards your kids then I think you must do something rather than nothing, even if it alienates your brother. Have you talked to your mother about this? Maybe she could shed some light. In the meantime I would start to try to keep your kids further away from your brother without making it obvious why you are doing this.



I would certainly stamp on your brother making fun of your son. This could damage him for life. Perhaps you could use this as the reason for keeping your brother and your kids apart.

Your children are the most important thing to you so go with your gut instinct and try to not leave them alone with him. Even if you are wrong which would be the best outcome at least you can sleep easy if you are right you will never live with yourself if you don't take control now.

if you were not worried you would not be asking on yahoo.  the tickling would make me feel uncomfortable too, it is a strange place to tickle.  speak to your children ask how they feel around their uncle. if he is making fun of your son, is your son unhappy about this.
it is one of those questions do i ignore or do something now before it is too late.
how do the rest of the family feel, your parents, your children's father.

Talk to your kids and make sure they know about good touches and bad touches, and ones that make them feel uncomfortable.  Let everyone in your family know you're doing this, but not because you suspect something might be going on...because it's a conversation every parent should have with their children.



People who know your kids are educated on the subject are less likely to molest them.  Having the talk with your kids opens the lines of communication and will make them more comfortable going to you should something ever happen (God forbid).



You don't have just your brother to be concerned about.  It's not being paranoid, it's being prepared.  Crap happens like this all the time, from people you would least expect.

You're Un-comfortable...THAT is enough for me. A mother's Intuition should ALWAYS be followed. Even IF he is not outright molesting Right NOT, SOMETHING is TELLING you to watch out,Something in your GUT is TELLING you to feel Un-easy. Yes do talk to your kids.But keep the questions simple..such as..."Do you like playing with Uncle So and So?"  Do you like going to Visit Him?  Is he nice to you?  Get a general feeling for what is going on. BUT as far as I am concerned I PERSONALLY would FOLLOW my MOTHERERLY  INSTINCTS and Keep the kids away unless supervised at ALL TIMES!

hes probably only tickling them there because he can see thats where it tickles the most....he makes fun of your son to upset him then takes him to his room to play games probably as a way of saying sorry... this could all be very innocent as you have said he is very immature for his age....



however..... if your gut instinct is telling you otherwise then you must act on it in the only way you can .. and that is to very carefully chat with your children about what is exceptable and what is not when adults.. regardless of whether they are family or not.. touch them... talk to them or ask them to do things...



when i was 9 a family friend started playing cards with me and my sister when we were at his house and my mom thought nothing of it..he was very good with kids and she would check on us all the time....he new this and bided his time.... gained her trust.... but slowly and over a period of time those games of snap turned into strip snap.. and whenever we lost we had to take an item of clothing off.. he did the same so as far as we were concerned it was a game... it wasnt till my mom came in and saw me and my sister in just our knickers and him in his pants that we reolised it was wrong... he never touched us tho... but who knows if my mom hadnt came back early what could have happened.. it took him a month or two to develop the game and im sure he would have waited another month or two to go to the next level.... people like that dont rush in... they manipulate.. gain trust and only when they are certain they have the innocents in a position where they wont say anything do they do something...



i wouldnt advise mentioning this to your brother as he will become angry with you and then you will never no... the key here is to be vigilant and instill in your children what is not exceptable.. and that if anyone ...anyone at all regardless of who they are .. does or says or asks anything of them that requires anything other than normal play that they should tell you straight away....



your youngest is only 4... but even at that age they will understand...



my kids were told younger than that...and theyve never forgotton...



good luck ...

You just need to talk to your kids.  There is a lot of paranoia around these days and so a lot of men are even scared to talk to kids.  It may be completely innocent and just that he is able to connect better with kids than adults.
If it is really worrying you then suggest that they play video games in the living room, make it so it seems you want everyone to join in.
Hope everything is ok

I had very bad feelings about this when I read "he constantly tickles my children on there high inner thigh" because when I was around 9 that was exactly what happened to me.  I was molested by my great grandfather who lived so far away we rarely got to see him.  I was sitting in the living room alone with him watching TV and that is exactly how it started.  My mom had looked in on us and all she saw was me giggling  when it first started. He was very old and I wasn't sure  what was happening at first....but soon his fingers were places they shouldn't have been.  I finally squirmed away from him and ran to mom, but I never said a word until a few years later. I wasn't sure about what had happened and felt very uncomfortable and confused.  I also was afraid of saying a bad thing about my Great Grandpa.



It came out in the family a few years later, that some of the grandkids who lived near him were much more seriously molested. There was a huge scandal as it unfolded and more and more children had been effected on various levels.  I was young enough that I really wasn't sure what it meant or if he had just " accidentally" touched me  wrong .



Some instinct sparked  your concerns here ... so I would certainly be on the alert.  I would make a rule that your son was not allowed up in the room alone with him. Maybe ask him if the " tickling " makes him feel uncomfortable? Hopefully everything is fine but the similarities worry me here and it is much better to be safe than sorry.



On a side note:  I have one friend who was molested by her father years ago and it too started with tickling.  Tickling is such a fun happy  innocent seeming thing but apparently it can often be used as a gateway for this type of thing.

FIRST of all you must stop the tickling on the inner thighs. Not normal or necessary and if it makes you uncomfortable then you feel the same way. Just sit him down and tell him you do not agree that where he is touching your child and you wish him to stop. Anytime you feel that your child may be in a situation like this then you must get the child away from the temptation and only then will you have protected a child from the possibility. But get rid of the source and you will be able to relax. Always go with your gut. It's usually right.

If you want to join the yes. It will be a future you are building for your family. The corps offer so many rewarding careers and even though you would be away and it will be hard, you are doing it for yourself and your family. I think it teaches you how to deal with all types of circumstances in life and teaches responsibility. But you have to be the one to decide whats best for you and your family. I say go for it. You'll be a better man.

If you do sign, then MAKE SURE you take full use of them paying for schooling! To ensure that you have a good job after you are finished! Too many of the people don't take use of that, and then get stuck in low paying jobs post military. To my knowledge they will allow you to go to school for anything you want at little to no cost!



Another tip I have heard from people that we knew that went in...list your deployment preferences in the order you DON'T want to go!



Most times if you put your least preferred place last, that's where they send you for some reason. (don't know how true that actually is, but it's what we've been told.)



Make sure that the babies mom has a good support system for when you'd be away, or live on base together.



My best friends husband signed on with the Air Force last year, and only got a $1500 sign on....so if your only doing it for the money...don't let the recruiters b/s you saying you'll get a $20k sign on. If it isn't in writing, don't believe it.



I can't really think of much else right off the top of my head. It's your choice. Just know that you will likely be sent over to Afghanistan, because it seems like the troops are going to be there for quite a few more years.

I'm sorry, but it's her choice. There is not a whole lot you can do if she doesn't want the child.
Maybe talk to her about giving you custody, but you should also be the one responsible for ALL of the medical expenses until the child is born and is in your custody.
When it comes right down to it, it's her choice, and you need to be there for her. Unplanned pregnancies are hard, and having an abortion is even harder. She will need your help to get through this difficult time.

Haha, nooo!!! I've been buying my son's birthday and Christmas presents since about April lol, I'm almost done now! His birthday (1st) is only 3 days after Christmas day, and I'm not the richest of people, and I figured with all the other presents I'll be buying family and friends at the time, I'm not going to be able to afford to give him a great xmas and bday if I do it all in one go at the time! Plus it's fun, seeing things I want throughout the year and buying it with a valid excuse! And you hardly notice the cost, when it's just £30 here and £30 there! I'll probably do so in future years, but it'll be more tricky in future I guess - this year I just have them stacked in the corner of my bedroom - in future years I'll probably have to do a better job of hiding them than that when he knows what presents are lol!

I don't think it is too soon for shopping since it is for your daughters.  I would shop later for things that might have to be returned for sizes.  Some stores have very short return times.  I haven't starting christmas shopping yet, but I have been getting ideas of what to buy people.

Hey,
I am a mom of a two year old little girl and I have almost all of her shopping done for Christmas already. I am pregnant with twins and my delivery date is Dec.14th so I figured that I won't have time once the babies come. So I have pretty much all our shopping done except for my husband.

No, it's not too soon! :) You're smart to do that! We always make the mistake of waiting until the last minute and spend a ton of money all at once, and every year think, 'next year we'll do this sooner.' So, it's smart financially to space things out.

New Yorkers and car seats???



I do not live in NY city. My question is, if so many of you rely upon public transportation such as cabs and the subway, how do you transport your children? Do you drag around a car seat or are there ones available for you to use on the public transportation? Or is this just a misconception and you all have your own cars?

I don't live in NYC but we visit there sometimes with our kids (and we sometimes take public transportation with the kids in our own area, as well).  On the subway or bus, you wouldn't bring a carseat.  In a cab, we, at least, would bring the carseat.  It's easy for infants if they have those carriers that are both carseats and things that snap into the strollers.

What should I do about the welfare of my children?



I have separated from my children's father for now 4 1/2 years. We have no parenting order or custody order in place. He has the children every second weekend and a couple of weeks in the christmas holidays. He smokes quite a bit of pot and he has a bad temper, and I try to avoid heavy arguments as much as I can as it makes me quite anxious. My daughter is now 10 and she is starting to click on what he is doing? He now wants to have access to the kids a few nights a week extra, but personally I don't want him to as it does disrupt the girls schooling and other commitments we have. Im also worried about the welfare of my second daughter as she was diagnosed with mild anxiety and I have gone to the ends of the earth to help her through this. Their father doesn't know about this, as he doesn't believe their is anything wrong with her, and has never really supported me.



I want to know what are my rights as a parent to protect the well being of my children? Who would be the best people to talk to regarding this matter?
If anyone could help me, it would be appreciated...

You need to get a custody order in place.  Without one then either parent has just as much of a right as the other parent as far as seeing the kids and spending time with the kids.
Contact a lawyer to get the ball rolling.  If you can't afford a lawyer then call your local court and see how they can assist you in this matter.

You really do have to get the entire situation legalized. You can go to court and get the custody worked out. If you are really worried about the enviroment they are being subjected too, you may want to fight for supervised visits.

The first thing I would do is report the pot smoking to the police and then you will have had evidence of child endangerment. That's if you cannot Communicate to your ex you do not want him to do this around the children. Second find a family councilor and discuss the issues and let them help you take the custody issues and concerns to court. That is the only way you can make sure your children are protected. If your daughter is showing signs of anxiety then you need to dig to find the cause and it just may be that the passing back and forth is the cause. Children need stability and it sounds like your family is out of whack. You need support and allowing more of the same would be child abuse. You will be allowing him to disrupt their lives even more so just so no, then explain why. Pot smoking shouldn't be done anywhere around your children.

for manslaughter and child neglect, yes. murder, no. I know she's already filled with guilt, and definately mourns, so it's not like she was trying to find a way to get rid of her daughter, so I do feel bad for her. I'm sure she feels the genuine sorrow of the loss of a child but much much worse bc it was her doing, but I don't think that should get her out of legal punishment. the point is, she accidentally killed her daughter and that's manslaughter as well as neglect bc she left a 2 year-old in a car.
also, I wonder, if this was somebody else's child and not hers, she would probably be charged with neglect/manslaughter?
also, part of me cant help but sorta wonder if she did it "on purpose" bc in a way, her speech seems contrived.

It's really easy to sit in judgment of this woman when you're looking at the situation from the outside.  The fact is that none of us really has any idea what was going on with her at the moment.  Stress, lack of sleep, who knows... tons of things could have been going on.  I surely hope that some of you people who are so ready to condemn this woman are the perfect parents that those ivory towers you're sitting on would paint you to be.  God forbid something should ever happen to one of your children on your watch.  I don't give the woman all the pity that some do, but common sense says that tragic things happen every day and they're not always intentional.  This comes down to intent.  Did the woman intend to neglect or kill her child?  I'm betting that the answer is no.

Yes it is more common in boys. Assuming that you are restricting his fluids after say 6pm, have you also tried taking him to the bathroom about midnight or whenever you go to bed? He will hardly wake up at all and should be dry the rest of the night.

my sister used to wet her bed until about age 12.  She just slept so soundly her body never woke up to pee.  It wasn't every night, but if she had a late night snack (including drink) it always happened.  Best advice is what others said, restrict the drinks after dinner and maybe wake him up mid-night.  But seriously, 5 years old is still really young.  He should grow out of it.

my doctors said not to worry until age 6.. for a girl.  right.. sure.. you don't worry cause i've enough for both of us..



they had me use a jar.. with a rubber band.  have him pee in the jar.. mark it with the band.  during the day..have him practice holding in his pee a bit longer than normal.  after a week.. repeat the jar.. mark the difference in how much he can hold.. this proves to him that he can do it.



sometimes.. remember.. this is an emotional thing.. not a physical.  maybe you an think of talking to the school and see about counseling.. there might be something going on that they can find out that no way on earth he would tell you.. many things can make him that emotional.  he's young and can't process things well.. he's no experience to draw off of, and may be shy to ask for assistance.



don't worry too much.. but find ways to work it.. get the help you need.  maybe going to a urologist or pediatrician instead of a pcp for the entire family can help, if that is the doc you are talking to...

So you think you know more than the doctor. Yes it is very common and I can tell you from experience. He will grow out of it and there is nothing you can do until he is around 7. That is the age that they start to intervene. My daughter was given the mat and bell around that age to train.

My 5yr old does the same thing. Her doctor told me that it could be that her bladder only holds a certain amount of cc's. Her bladder might fill faster than most people. I was recommended to get a bed wetting alarm. It is kinda of neat one part of it connects to the the child's underpants and the other part is on her arm. When the child starts getting moist down there the alarms goes off so that the child can wake up and use the restroom.

What is your teenagers money situation?



I'm just curious...



First of all, how old is your teenager?
Does your teenager have a job? Is it part-time or have they left school and working full-time?
Do they get pocket money? If so, how much?
What do they have to pay for and what do you pay for? For example do you buy their food but they must pay for any recreational activities like going to the movies?
Does your teenager have to pay rent/contribute money to the household (aimed more so at older kids)?



Both parents OR teenagers can answer. Thank you.

I'm sixteen... I had two jobs this summer, one paying $10.75/hour, the other $8.00 + nightly tips. I still work at the second one. My pocket money comes from tips, but I occasionally take money out of the bank. I have a debit card (best invention EVER). I buy food, gas, and pretty much everything else for myself except for school stuff and sports and sometimes clothes. I pay for six-monthly car insurance too. I don't directly contribute to the household, but save money by paying for myself most of the time.

1. I'm 14 turning 15 soon
2. Not old enough for a job, but a babysit and petsit some weekends.
3. Not pocket money, allowance. For actually doing chores, my homework, and going to school.
4. A parent is expected to love, feed, and house their child, and then have them get an education in some way. My mother buys meals, but I buy recreational stuff, as well as sugary treats and magazines and such.
5. As of right now, any and all of my allowance goes to getting my dog spayed, which I guess could be selfless in that way. I also usually purchase paper products and milk, which we both use.

Help on child abuse with a mean ungrateful mother?



Hey I need your advice I want to report my mother to social services for child abuse for saying untrue things about me. I threw ketchup around in McDonalds and it got on some people’s clothes and this ladies coach purse. My mom saw what I did wigged out and diss me in there called me a baby told me I need maybe go back to wearing diapers again and sit in a high chair wearing a bib. can I bring her up on charges for saying that to me? In the car ride home shes being sarcastic with me telling me if i have a choice if i want huggies or pampers when she goes shopping at wallmart. Its just no fair why is mothers so mean It has to be a girl thing with her. I know im 16 years old but i have more legal rights then my mother on this im sure of it. Even the charges dont stick it would make her treat me better in the future by not calling me a baby right? Its not fair she had no right to friggen do that to me

Get over it, Ed.  As far as I know you've been asking this same question for at least 6 months.  If an incident like this has left you scarred enough to continue hanging on to it then I recommend that you ask your mom for therapy for Christmas.  Good luck to you, but know that this is getting old.  You're making a mockery of the idea of child abuse.  That's a tragic thing for you to do since there are children in this world who are truly being harmed by their parents.  Try to find a new line to ruffle everyone's feathers with.

This has to be a joke. If you waste the valuable time of social workers and Child Protective Services with this crap you should get abused for real. I would wait to call protective services when you Mother beats you so hard you have marks for days, or when she molests you, or if she begins to be truly verbally abusive. To echo an above sentiment, grow up.

Why were you throwing around ketchup at 16!  Babies do do that.  She didn't hit you or abuse you.  If you try to bring her up on charges they will laugh at you unless you lie.

if she didn't hit you then the abuse part isn't going to work. but that doesn't sound too much like verbal abuse either. and if you try to do that it may just cause more problems with her.

<question>



Do you think that violence in a toddler can be the result of parental break-up?



My little one is hitting and pushing at the moment, he's only 19 months and I'm a bit concerned that he may be a bit confused about me and his Daddy not being together anymore and not knowing how to express it. I've tried to explain to him that Me and Daddy love him, but that we just don't live together anymore, but I'm not sure if he understands.



His Dad is a bit crap to be honest, and doesn't see him much at all, this week he saw him for all of an hour, and when I asked wee man if he wanted to see Daddy he said no. Not sure if he even meant that. I do feel that he's frustrated and maybe taking it out on me through playing up, is there anything else I can do to try and help him come to terms with it?



</question>



<additional details>



OK me reading that back makes it sound like I'm being unfair in asking him - I said just because Daddy was coming that day and I thought he'd like to know lol. I never ever let him hear anything about what I think about Daddy because my relationship with him is totally irrelevant to baby's relationship with him.

This behavior is perfectly normal at his age.  My son is 16 months old & he's starting to hit now.  Just tell him no whenever he hits and he'll gradually pick up on it and stop.



What you can do



•  Establish rules, but keep them simple and limit yourself to a few — a toddler isn't capable of keeping track of more than a few basic expectations. Make your enforcement of household rules consistent.



•  Maintain a sense of humor. Remember that your toddler is a work in progress and you can't expect him to always act the way you want him to.



•  Spanking does not teach children anything but fear, and that aggression is a way to solve problems.



•  You must find ways of setting limits (and use your words) to assure him that even when he is doing something you don't want him to do you still love and accept him. You can kindly and firmly stop him from hurting himself or someone else by saying, "No, I can't let you do that," and remove him physically from the area, and then reassure him that you love him.

Definitely going to have an effect on him, and if he's too young to put those thoughts into words he'llbe lashing out anyway he can.

Dead beat dad may be the one bringing it on, but it is normal at that age for kids to start acting up! They don't teach you that "terrible twos" can come before and last for years! Even though you both are going through a hard time cause of dad, you still need to show him who's boss or it will just get worse!

i dont think that him being so young understands the dynamics of a relationship. he doesnt get that 2 people get together, fall in love, and together forever with lots of babies - therefore he doesnt understand that sometimes this fairytale goes wrong and parents break up.



the acting out however, could very well be down to the father and his lack of prescence in his life. can someone take your other little boy, so you and him can just have him and mummy time, do something he likes, make him see that although daddy comes and goes, mummys are ALWAYS there - they never go away.



id also speak to his dad, and tell him if he cant commit to seeing his son, you wont allow him to play with his emotions and you will be cutting contact all together.

Kids that young pick up on tension and general unhappiness.



He's not going to understand that concept of you loving him but not his dad right now. That'll be a few more years!



And then of course he's entering that age where he wants to be autonomous but everyone starts telling him no.



The best way of dealing with him right now is to keep all fights and stress away from him and just be patient and gentle.

I think he is very "depressed" (sad) about the whole situation. Did it just happen? And if he starts noticing his dad not wanting to be around even when he "can" be around but he has stuff to do or is busy or whatever, he obviously doesnt want to see him much, but your son is probably very upset and the violence cound be a result but it also cound have been from him Watching some type of violence happeneing in his early years. If that sorta thing happened?, But it also could be from his father not seeing him or being around especially if he's Used to him being around. i sortof have the same problem so.. i know how you feel. And i have learned that he has to be be taught that its not right. And the father needs a good talking to also. But sometimes that doesnt work. Anyways i wish i could help you more but thats all i can say. Good luck with everything.

Hi, I am so shocked about some of these answers.  Any child no matter what age goes through a mourning process when someone that has always been around is all of a sudden not there anymore.  I agree that your 19 month old is doing age appropriate stuff but don't neglect the issue about Dad not being around anymore.  I would do Play Therapy with him.  Make two houses out of boxes and decorate them inside.  Explain to him through play that daddy lives in that house and mommy lives in this house.  Point out specific stuff that features in your different houses.  Example : Daddy's got a dog, Mommy's got a swing.  Do it once and leave it for a few days.  He might even ask you to play with the houses.  Good Luck!

Your son isn't even two years old yet.  He's not being violent, he's being a growing boy--garrulous, squirmy, etc.  Just like baby animals play-fight, baby humans do as well.  Perhaps you should get him some physically interactive toys, such as a bouncy castle or a bop-clown.

I don't think he could possibly understand your explanations.  But you could be conveying tensions to him, which confuse him.
People underestimate the effect the stress they pass on to a child.  And of course, you naturally would be upset and tense.
On the other hand, many kids do push and hit, just because they are at that age - going on for the "terrible twos".

What's your opinion on the whole Santa Claus deal?



I think it's kind of mean.  I mean kids get all excited year after year for Christmas Eve because that's when Santa delivers presents and sooner or later someone breaks the truth to them and it's like "oh".  I found out in 4th grade.  I asked my Mom if Santa was real and she was like "what do you think?".  Then she said that it's his spirit that we're celebrating and yeah.  I felt kind of foolish and let down.  I don't think I'm going to "lie" to my kids about the whole thing.  What's your opinion on it though?  Thanksss!!!

No, I think it's part of them getting older and testing boundries. It's called the terrible twos! My parents were strict, and me and my brothers all respected our parents, and did as we were told. But each one of us went through the temper tantrum stage. I remember my youngest brother... phew. Haha. Some kids might not - it depends on their personality too. But I'd say the majority of kids definitely have them.



You need to ignore them generally. If you hiss and tell them to be quiet, they'll just get worse. Often walking away shocks them in shutting up - but be prepared! After doing this a few times they'll clue onto the fact that you will come back! Teach him/her that it's no acceptable, but they'll just grow out of it. If they're attacking and biting, you'll want to stop that. But the screams, red face and throwing themselves on the floor in the middle of your weekly shop/coffee with friends is pretty standard.

As much as I expect the sun to rise from the East!  My son does not have many tantrums but he's had some.  He's generally very happy but I really don't know what I have done to get there!  I know I talk a lot and explain a lot in terms of actions and consequences but that's it I think.



I like the answer from Sparrow.  Oh so true!  I put it down to emotional neglect in childhood.

Yes I expect 99% of toddlers to have temper tantrums I don't believe there is a way you can go around it and if you have that 1% of toddlers who don't throw tantrums consider yourself lucky and let us in on the secret lol j/p.



No it is a normal stage toddlers go through. And here is a article saying why they throw these fits

Well if you are happy with him stayin up late then thats fine.



But it sounds like you have a problem so the only thing to do is have a bedtime routine, bath, story and bed, and be consistent with it. A normal bedtime would be around 7.30 - 8pm. I understand he doesnt get to see his Daddy very much but I'm sure he has days off and you need your evening times to relax!

Your toddler will sleep better and longer if he goes to bed earlier. If his dad wants to spend more time with his son, they should do it in the morning rather than at night. This is more about the health of your child. Read The No-Cry Sleep Solution.

My husband works late hours too so until they started school this year their actual bedtime was 1-2am and then they slept until like noon...it worked for us because I stayed home with them, they still got the same amount of sleep as anyone else just on diff hours that worked for our family so they could have dinner with daddy everynight and spend time with him.  Now that the oldest started kindergarten and middle started preschool this year they go to bed by 9pm an are up around 8-9am (afternoon prek and kindergarten) butwe did it by moving bedtime up by about 30min everynight to get them used to it

My husband works nights, so my 2 yr old and i try to stay on his schedule to spend time with him, i am a stay at home mom so the being up late doesn't affect me, but my daughter goes to bed around 11pm, and we get up at 10am, have lunch and all with my hubby, He has to nap so we nap with him from 12 or 1 in the afternoon, and then she sleeps til 4 in the afternoon, we do this this way for now, but when she starts preschool i'll have to have her in bed by at least 8pm. But of coarse alot of people will probably tell you a child being up late isn't good, but with my experience as long as they're sleeping good hrs. at night and have a good nap, i think they're fine, i mean some of us have to do what we have to in order for our kids to see their dads that work weird hrs!

MOMS-What could be causing this.?



my daughter has been constipated she sometimes will go a few days without eating but one meal a day and she doesnt finish that.It gets so bad when she "goes" she sweats and turns red her skin gets all blotchy today her BM was like the size of my fist so of course she was crying in pain and could barley stand up I had to help her to pass it and she was bleeding and there was blood in her stool which was rock hard she was pushing so hard she kept leaking somethin shes six.this used to happen when she was a baby where her bm was to hard and large for her to pass she would tear and i would have to help her.suppositories are more painful to give because its already impacted.apple and prune juice don't help thats what doc's say to give. what could be causing this to start happenin again?she eats healthy drinks water i know it's kinda gross to be askin about but i hate to see her in so much pain just tryin to go to the bathroom and the blood scares her.

That's def not normal I would take her to the dr again, something has to be going on.  Maybe she has an allergy to something, I know my oldest couldn't have lactose for awhile because he would get really constipated.  I really don't know but I would have it checked again, ad if your pediatrician doesn't give you some answers get 2nd opinion.  For her not to eat for days because of it can't possibly be healthy.  I hope you figure out whats going on

If you're sure it's not a diet issue, you could try talking to a chiropractor. If her lower back is out of kilter, the nerves to her bowels might be squashed, in which case nothing will work properly. Only 10% of a nerve has pain receptors, so it's possible to be out of alignment and not feel it.

Looking for advice, when is the right time?



My boyfriend and I are in college right now. He is in the Pre-med program and I am studying to become a nurse. we have been dating for almost 3 years, and know that we are getting married and spending our lives together.
The thing of it is, we are having such a hard time deciding what to do as far as our future. yes, we know we have time. we have no intentions of rushing into anything. But it is always nice to have an idea, and we have none.
I want to stay home after I have children. And he agrees. But i want to  work a couple of years to pay off student loans and help build up our financial status.
He will also be in med school for quite a while, he won't be an official doctor until he is around 32. and I want to have 2 or 3 kids that are pretty spread out in age. His grandparents had his mom when they were in medschool and that worked for them, and they are really pressuring us to have children, as they feel they are getting old and want great grand children.



My question is, When do all of you think we should start trying? I know it is a personal matter and in the end it is up to my boyfriend and I and our families, I just want some different opinions. Did anyone experience anything like this? I want children more then anything  I don't know how long I can wait.



</question>



<additional details>



**Also- There are certain health issues I have that I would need to clear up hopefully as early as 2 years before I even start trying, which is another reason I feel the need to know.
I just can't stop dreaming of the day I will have children, how can I make this feeling go away and find patience until the time is right?
I am an aunt to the 3 most adorable children in the world and that surely doesn't help!



I am fully aware that being an aunt is nothing like being a mother. But I feel that being a mother is my calling, it is something I have dreamed of all my life. I know we need money, but I never said it would be easy.



Having all the money in the world stillwouldnt make parenting easy, and I know we need money before we have our kids.



I suppose I shouldn't have asked this quesiton on here as none of you know me or my boyfriend or our circumstances personally.



Bottom line, I do not want patronizing answers. Just helpful and concerning. I am not an idiot that is trying to jump into pregnancy. Just wondering with my future HUSBAND so tied up in med school (though I WILL be working as a nurse while he is in med shcool) when the best time would be.

Firstly, do not feel rushed into having kids because of your family. That is a bad reason to have kids.



If you've got health issues you need to deal with, deal with them now, so that in two years time, you will be physically ready to have kids. This will also give you time to finish your degree, and possibly work for a bit. And then you can revisit the situation then.



If you know you want kids, then get your health in order ASAP so that when you're really ready, you can just go for it!! :D I wish i had been able to lose a bit more weight before i got pregnant, as well as get a little fitter.



Edit: Dude, you're being a bit harsh on me here!! I wasn't being patronizing... or anything. I think my answer was good. Get your health under control, get more college under your belt and see if you're ready when your body is ready.

Kids aren't adorable when you can't afford them.  It's rather like living in a house you really can't afford.  The house is wonderful, but the responsibilities of it make it way less fun that you thought it would be.  And after awhile you wonder, "Why didn't we wait to buy this????"



Pay off your loans, get your finances in order, get your degree, and then follow the four rules my mom hammered into me beginning at age ll.



1. The most important decision you will ever make is who you marry. Choose with your head as well as your heart.
2. Have no children until your bond is strong, and have no more than you yourself can support. You may just have to
3. At any and all costs finish your education to qualify for those high paying jobs. It is likely that you will work sometime during your marriage, probably for decades…. Get paid for it. And remember, your kids and your education are forever…. Husbands, lovers and promises are not!!
4. Have a stash of cash no one knows about even if you are sure you will never need it. You absolutely will, and the more the better.



And being an aunt is far different than the 24/7 of parenthood,  hon, waaayyyy different.  Children change your relationship forever.  Get some counseling before you jump in.  You want to be the best parents on the planet, and it won't be that way if you think is has no problems......



Truly there is nothing more beautiful than two mature, educated, prepared adults awaiting their child.  And surely nothing closer to hell on this planet that a child plopped into your cozy relationship and you had no idea how  crowded three really were.



You are in lala land if you think parenting is all a bed of flowers.



Ignore the 13 year olds who write on here hon.... Get educated, and get prepared, so you can enjoy being a parent.

ok well firstly u definitely shudnt rush into anything! Listen to ure heart and it will tell u wen the right time comes. Secondly, ull have to have a talk with ure spouse and decide together how to work it out. Also to ensure a secure and comfortable future for your children perhaps you should work a little at first in order to be financially able to support them when they come around. Also talk to your family perhaps mother or father who have more experience and ask for their opinions! Then look deep within ureself and consider the pros and cons of having them sooner or later. Think about the things u would be missing and besides since u r young u have plenty of time. I suggest, since parenting is SUCH a big responisibility, to take some more time to gain more experiences perhaps with ure neices and finish ure education or u mite be regreting not having finished it later on when u need to find a job to support the family (desperate times call for desperate measures). Therefore i suggest be practical, realistic, wait awhile because nothing bad can come of that and hopefully later ure heart will tell u wen the time is right! Good lukk and best wishes ^^

listen, once you have kids you will be tied down to them and it will be hard to make it financially if your future husband is still in school.  I'm speaking from experience.  If you have health issues you should probably wait at least two years after you get married to start trying.  Make sure he can support you financially before you have them....you know i didnt plan either one of my kids and we are still working towards our bachelor's degrees living at my in-law's house it's a hard road.  Kids are great, but make sure you are financially stable.



Oh PS--I work as a caregiver only two days a week and make pretty good money and stay at home with the kids for the rest of the week.  Nurses can work schedules like that.  There is no reason why you can't work if  you can get child care for two days.  You spend most of your time with the kids and you get the break you need from them working a couple days

It freaks me out a little, when people buy them and put them on the wall, but they don't know the child.
I wouldn't say they were horrible, because all children are beautiful in their own way. But personally I don't really want a child I don't know on my wall.



I have pictures of my son's dressed up and posed. That take pride in my photo wall. Andrew & I both have a key chain with the photo's in them too.



I have to agree with the spontaneous photo's though. I have a HUGE wall full of photo's and my favourites are the spontaneous ones.
I have one of my 3yo boys hugging, after they spilt flower on themselves. They didn't know I got it, but it's a great photo.

I only like the Anne Geddes photos of the newborns that are naked and all rolled up in a ball on some cute background.  There's nothing unnatural about a newborn baby all curled up,  no matter what props you have in the picture.  However, the more frufy (sp?) ones of older babies are a little annoying.  As far as posed pics of the kids, yes, I have one taken of them every year until school and then they get a school picture done every year, and that is what I have on the wall.  And hey, some of those fake smiles sure make me laugh because they're so darn cute!

Most of the time I do not like 'posed' pictures, the caught off guard ones are way better and the kids don't get that fake smile, however when my daughter was about 1 1/2 she had a Glamour Shot made that was a close up of her face and she started to cry a little bit bc we had put her down to take the picture and it actually turned out amazing, it was done in black and white except her blue eyes showed and you could see her little eyes glossy from the beginning tears, I still have it hung on the wall.

I think that there should be a mix of both kinds of pictures. Growing up my mom only dressed me in huge dresses with lace and other frills... and always had posed pictures. I don't really have any pictures of me doing anything... I do have tons of memories doing things as a child, but I guess we were always too busy for pictures when we were doing something fun. I want my kids to have professional pictures to look at as well as thousands of pictures of us doing things as a family. I don't necessarily think they are horrible, but I think that people should try to "capture moments in time" too..... I think those mean the most. Hope this helps.

You know I just took my daughter last month for her pictures and brought outfits and used a ton of props and the most gourgeous picture we have of her that day was a random shot the photogragher took when she was sitting looking at her lap and picked up the edge of her dress, it looks so adorable and frilly but soo natural and so far that's the only one I've framed and hung up.

Our family sometimes does the "photoshoot" thing with the younger kids - well, because, in my opinion, multiples make the posed ones cuter :) My dad does them,  because he took a photo course in university, with his professional camera, and they look really cute. We just got one of the twins - it's adorable !! I wish I was allowed to post it online :)



But I agree about the costumes, we just do color schemes, like orange and black. Some are over the top !

Help with my niece and nephew!family advice?



I have been taking care of my 3 year old nephew and my 2 year old niece for the last 2 years,my sister sarah left them with me when my nephew was 13 mos and my niece was 6 days old,she decided she didn't want to be a mom.I have not heard from her at all since she left,no letters,no calls-nothing.I have been thinking and i decided that i might adopt them,i have gardianship of them but its not the same,my family is torn by this descision,my parents are against it,and my seven brother's and sisters have mixed feelings.None of them have heard from our sister and no one knows where she is or if she even alive.The kids call me mommy and my boyfriend daddy,there own dads are unknown.I love my sister but i deeply love my niece and nephew and i think that 2 years is a long enough time for my sister to come back for them if she wanted.My parents and siblings don't want to care for the kids-my parents for health reasons and my siblings have either kids of their own or just don't want the responsibility of them,although they love them.what would you do in this situation?should i wait or adopt them?

You are a wonderful sister. If your sister comes back and has her life together, then she should have a second chance with her children. But stay close by. I would also contact a lawyer or legal counsel just to find out what chances you have of getting them if she comes back and doesn't have her life together. You didn't mention any drugs or anything. Some people just are not ready to be parents and are afraid to mess their kids up. They need to come back when they are more mature.



You have been taking care of these babies as your own. You have been their mother and are and should be very protective of them. You should definitely adopt them if your sister hasn't come back for them by now.  You obviously love them and family is the best way. You can share the good stories with them about your sister, and make them feel like they will always be loved.

know this is a silly question, but does the influenza virus stick to clothing?



I asked this and put it in a category that only got one answer, so I'm asking again... Just a concerned Mom... I got jeans from eBay in the mail today and it came from someone who had the flu and I forgot and touched them... I just don't want to bring it in our household. I have the clothing in the washer on sanitize. Please don't say I'm stupid for asking because some viruses can stick to clothing...  I stupidly tried them on too, I totally forgot she had told me she had the flu and that was the reason for the delay in shipment.  Somebody please ease my mind!!

Always remember that no matter where you go there's viruses everywhere.  On your shopping cart, public toilets, door handles, someone sneezing next to you, but if you keep the simple rule of washing your hands throughout the day you will be safe most of the time.  Hope the jeans look cool!

The flu is usually transmitted by saliva, mucus, or airborn bacteria.  Bacteria lasts longer on a hard surface than it does on clothing.  You should always wash clothes that you buy from people who previously owned them before you wear them, but if they were shipped to you, the bacteria on the jeans will not have survived the trip.  This isn't a stupid question, but you're overreacting a tad. Just wash the jeans and you'll be fine.

Not a stupid question at all!  Yes it can be transfered on clothing if the clothing has been sneezed, coughed on or had any other bodily fluids on it.



HOWEVER, you are washing them and as long as you washed up right after touching them, you should have nothing to worry about.  You should be fine, even after you have tried them on.  Viruses generally last a couple of days on surfaces.  Just wash up and use hand sanitizer.  I'm sure you'll be ok.  What's to say that some one in Wal-Mart didn't have the flu and sneezed on the new shirt you just bought or tried on?  As long as you wash up and wash the clothes, you should be fine.

Do you think that I deserved a spanking!?!?!?



ok well after school today i was in a real bad mood and i got home and i was lying on the couch for like a hour watching tv until my mom come home from work and then right away shes like its your turn to wash and put away the dishes and i was still lying on the couch and im like mom ill do it later im not in a good mood ok? She said she gonna give me the count to 3 to get my butt of the couch and come into the kiten and im like NO MOM ILL DO IT WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT because i was real tired and she then got mad and told me theres gonna be trouble if you dont move it now and you also need to have your bath before dinner time and I told her to to quiet a little because i cant hear my show, and i said i dont feel like having a bath today im not dirty and i cant stand how u always check to see if i washed my hair its none of ur business. so she started getting real mad and grabbed me and i tried to resist but she put me over her lap pulled my jeans down and left my boxers on and she spanked me TEN times REAL HARD and i was just bout crying cuz she hit real hard then i had to go to my room and then 10 minutes later she made me have a bath and then came in and forced me to let her wash my hair because she said i was being rude and snappy.



sersiously, im 14 and this is what my mom did. I don't really think I deserved that, I can see maybe grounding for a day but not spanking or anything else. Do you think this is fair? I honestly would think more than 90% of parents would think this was not a good punishment

it probably stopped because all the money issues and the economy issues.more people are being forced to stay home. but if it helps one thing i really look for is at least 4 good references. i like 4 because people could get their friends or whoever to be a reference so 4 is a little more likely to be legit

What to do with a child who is starting to become out of control?



My daughter is almost 7 years old. She does really good in school, she is an excellent reader, I am so proud of her. But when she comes home from school, or just at home in general she likes to hit her younger brothers who are 2 years old and younger. She is lying about hitting them, until I raise my voice and then she finally admits what she did. And then sometimes she goes back and forth between telling stories that I don't know what the truth is. I do firmly believe in discipline. I have taken her toys/video games away.. that doesn't work. I have put her in "time out" in the corner.. that doesn't work. I have taken treats away (lollipops, ice cream etc.).. that doesn't work. She has been on punishment so many times its like its not enough anymore. I have taken away TV time, everything and nothing is working, she still wants to hit them, and tell lies. Today she pushed the baby down as he was crawling and made his lip bleed, and then 2 minutes later she hits her other brother in the stomach. Sometimes I feel like maybe she is jealous because she was "the baby" for a long time. But I just don't know what to do anymore, shes becoming out of control and I'm at my wits end!

Sometimes when we think our kids are getting out fo control it´s us parents who need to change. Taking everything away from her won´t do much because she´ll always find something else to do. At this age kids are so creative that not watching TV will only give her ideas to do something else. If she can´t have ice cream she´ll replace it with some cookie. So I believe in your case, you should spend some time with her alone. For example, take her out once a week for two hours, just the two of you, whether it is for errands and stop by ice cream and talk with her, just be with her alone, away from the other babies. Try to share moments with her as the "older" ones in the house, give her chores only she can do because she´s the oldest. Make her feel important because she´s older than the other two and talk to her as to how important it is for you to have her as your oldest child.  She needs to feel important and appreciated by being the older one.
If she was alone for a long time, she´s definitely jelous and that´s why she´s acting like this. You can talk to her teacher and ask her to help in the sense of talking to her about taking care of her siblings and how important it is to be the older sister. Focus on her age to make her feel special and constantly comment on things that you wouldn´t be able to do without her, and how happy you are that she´s there to help you.

is it feasible to get her into some kind of activity after school? Ballet, gymnastics, karate, something? she might feel less jealous and less likely to act out if she has something all of her own that she doesn't have to share with her brothers. and if it doesn't work, it will at least give you a break from being the after school referee for a couple hours a week.

Your daughter is def jealous of your other kids.  Now I see you tried everything but nothing has worked.  Now I know many people will disagree with me and even get mad at my response, but the way to stop this punishment is to spank your daughter when you catch her in the act.  Now I am not saying abuse her, but to lightly spank her on the bottom when you catch her in the act.  Our son had the same issue with our daughter and when a friend suggested spanking we seen after 3 weeks of the spankings she stop the jealous behavior.

I know this will sound weird but you need to reward her. She is trying to get attention from you because you have two younger children who are taking most of the attention. I say you should sit down with her and have a talk. Tell her that you understand why she is doing what she is doing even though it is completely wrong. Make a night for just you and her to spend time together. For example, friday nights go out to dinner with her and take her to the mall or a movie. If you don't have some one to babysit go to nannies4hire.com it is a great site to find a babysitter. Warn your daughter however, that if she keeps misbehaving she will not get those special you and her nights. Once she values them she will stop being angry with her little brothers. Also, have her help with the brothers more so she feels a part of it.

maybe something is bothering her and she doesn't know how to express herself. sit her down and talk with her to see what's bothering her. i think she's not used to the fact that she is no longer the "baby" of the family or maybe she wishes you could spend some time with her. you could do activities with her like making her favorite snack, braiding or painting her nails, watching cute movies, etc.



i don't think she means to hurt your other children but she's just confused on how to get you to pay attention with her. don't yell at her. instead, hug her and tell how much you love her but that she needs to express herself in a positive way

i think your motherly instinct is right. make some mum and daughter time where its just you and her. even if its half and hour. she sound s frustrated  and may feel you have no time for her and bad attention is better than none. talk to her tell her you love her and give her resposibilities like jobs that help and make her the big sister. show her how being the big sister is something great and how much they will idolize her. and stick to the time outs.

I hate the thought of spanking a child. But more I hate the thought of an out of control child. She'll suffer for her actions later down the road. Sometimes as parents we have to do things we don't want to do. That includes a spanking when needed. She's young and she needs correction in perhaps the only way she'll understand that you mean business. Hitting her little brothers is unacceptable behavior and if everything else you've tried has failed you may need to resort to spanking to get her to behave. A spanking can get the message across, I don't think you need to use a belt.

Would you discipline a child that you didn't know?



I work at a clothes store and sometimes I have some awful kids running through it, lol. I have kids screaming and running and knocking things off the shelves and pulling clothes off of the hangers. I had one kid today fall off of a display and hit his head on the floor.



Would you be upset if someone asked your child to be quiet, or to "not do that" ? Sometimes I even wanna tell them I'm going to give you a time out, lol. I never would, I know that's too far. But I think some parents I think have it in their head that "its her job to clean up" and don't pay attention. But I saw today that not paying attention can be dangerous.
Sooo, would you be upset if someone else tried to discipline your child?

If my child was acting like that and taking things off hangers and running around then no. As long as someone asks in a nice tone, firm is okay, but not screaming. Sometimes parents don't always see everything. If you just explain that they can get hurt or hurt someone else or that when they take the clothes off the hangers they are making them dirty. No one wants to buy dirty clothes.

You should foresee and prevent dangerous situations and in such cases it is perfectly fine to intervene when wild children are involved.



Don't ever touch them though, ask them as nicely as you can, but yes you should protect your business from hazardous liabilities and customers from unsafe conditions--that should be your voiced concern if the parent raises hell.

I would not be mad at all, if my child was doing something wrong.  And if my child broke something in the store or made a mess, I would make them clean up the mess.  Your job is to sell clothes, not clean up after kids that have parents that can't watch them. Actually to protect the company you work for, you should say something to the parents.  I've done it at parks, if I see a child doing something that can hurt themselves or others, I do say something.

I would ask the kids to politely calm down, be careful, not do the things they're doing, of coarse some parent will be upset seeing another person correct their child, but your company would be liable if the kids hurt themselves and of coarse a parent would then complain and all.



But i def. would. In situations like that you just have to take initiative especially if parents are not!

You do need a solicitor! You can usually get a free initial appointment and find out more there! It could take months, but they usually initiate contact sooner than that, it just takes that long to finalise the order!



You may have a problem if your name is not on the birth certificate and if she denies your paternity! This would mean paying for a DNA test before you could have any contact at all!

I know it's good to tell your child positive things but I just can't help myself telling her all the time that she's so smart and pretty but I was thinking the other day that maybe this will turn her into a snob or something when she is older coz she will think she is better than everyone else and I don't want her to think this. Do you think Im going over the top by telling her a few times a day or do you think Im doing good.

She's 17 month old so it's perfectly normal.. However, as she gets older maybe spread the "good feelings" around so she notices the beauty in other things and in other people.  We always tell our two young boys- that other people are pretty/beautiful.  They understand- and it's funny when we introduce them to other toddlers they say "oh look at the cute baby or girl"



Just be more aware of it as she grows and blossoms into a young adult.. Of course she'll be beautiful but, don't let it go to her head!

I think it's great that you praise her. It's helping her to have confidence in her abilities. I have praised all three of my children (the oldest 21) often and no ill effects have come of it. One decision I diid make though, was with society so obsessed with looks, if I praised their beauty, or handsomeness, I praised ten other things (brains, humour, kindness etc..). The oldest child is a very balanced adult now. Praise away!!!

its all about balance - telling her she is pretty /clever when she has done something is fine, but not all the time for no reason, as soon it will mean nothing and you will have to do/say even more to have the same effect on her.



a friends sister was spoilt so much whilst growing up! told she was the best, the prettiest, always got what she wanted, screamed and shouted if she didn't get what she wanted. etc and they are having so much trouble now with her now shes 15 and wants to do everything and have everything, have her bf over, shes acting like a 25yr old but with the immaturity of a 15yr old!....



its good to encourage your child without a doubt, telling them they are good/ clever/ pretty when its earned and appropriate. but its all about balance like I said above, and its also good to tell them when there wrong and got things wrong, so they are aware its not all positive etc.



you don't want her to be deluded and go to school and fail at an exam or test and not be able to deal with these feelings of failure, one of my old school friends ended up having anorexia as she couldn't cope with the pressure of school/uni and not always being the a student.
