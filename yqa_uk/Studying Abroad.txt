If you want to be a cook of Japanese food, of course, it would be a great idea. But why not get your education in the Western hemisphere, and then open up a restaurant in, say, Kyoto? That way, you would have good job opportunities there - because, let's be honest, the Japanese simply make the best Japanese chefs :)

The Prize Cat by E.J. Pratt?



Read this short poem



Pure blood, domestic, guaranteed,
Soft-mannered, musical in purr,
The ribbon had declared the breed,
Gentility was in the fur.



Such feline culture in the gads*
No anger ever arched her back -
What distance since those velvet pads
Departed from the leopard's track!



And when I mused how Time had thinned
The jungle strains within the cells,
How human hands had disciplined
Those prowling optic parallels;



I saw the generations pass
Along the reflex of a spring,
A bird had rustled in the grass,
The tab had caught it on the wing:
Behind the leap so furtive-wild
Was such ignition in the gleam,
I thought an Abyssinian child
Had cried out in the whitethroat's scream.



(1937)



Now, Briefly research an event that happened in history—something that changed the shape of the world afterwards. An example could be one of the following: the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, 9/11, Hitler's German army invading Poland, the death of Arch-Duke Ferdinand, women getting the vote, the sinking of the Titanic, Hurricane Katrina.



Then, like Pratt, equate the major players to this event to animals or objects in nature. If the cat is Italy and the whitethroat is Ethiopia, what might the U.S. be, and how might you represent the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?



Now, write a short lyric poem that equates the actions of the animals to the people and events in history. The poem should be approximately 3-4 stanzas in length. Use Pratt's poem as inspiration.



Then in 2-3 sentences, explain what historical event you were depicting and how the animals and their characteristics represent this event.

the 3 golden rules to language - read it, speak it, listen to it. so read atleast a book a week. it can be a romance or even archie comics, but read! dont be afraid to speak english. if u make a mistake, someone will correct you. and you will learn. watch a lot of english movies and TV programmes. it will help you get used to the different accents, and also help you learn contemporary lingo.

Totti#1 is absolutely right. Practice, practice, practice. Listen to English language radio and TV stations; read as much English as you can and speak to native speakers of English as often as you can.



Ask the people with whom you are talking to correct you if you make big errors.



In your question, you need a "to" between have and study in your first sentence, and "English" is capitalized. Other than that, your English is pretty good here. Keep at it.

It usually helps to immerse yourself in a language. You might want to go abroad for a semester, or maybe during the summer, to some English-speaking place. I have also found that listening to English-language audio books is a great way of improving your speaking skills, because you automatically pick up phrases along the way. Of course, practising is key. Find someone who speaks English very well, and converse with them in English only. Read a lot in English, watch all your DVDs (and I mean ALL) in English - even listen to the news in English. If you put yourself into a virtually English surrounding, you will notice that you'll suddenly start thinking in English, which is key to being able to speak freely.



Good luck!

Go to a country where English is the native language (America, Australia, Great Britain, or Canada.) You could get a job there as an interpreter or teacher of your native language.



If you cannot do that, try to go to an English corner. Are there any native English speakers in your city? Ask them if they would be willing to help you with your English. Offer to pay them to tutor you or you could teach them your native language in exchange for them teaching you English.

Is a gap year a good idea and what should I do?



I would like to carry on to university after this year of college, but still have a thousand ideas of what i want to do (well not 1000 but...)



Is it a good idea to apply for the year after and take a gap year?



If so what should I do?



I want to study German and Dutch ideally, but the university i'll apply for doesn't do dutch so...
What would I plan and arrange to do in Germany or somewhere else? How can i make use of a gap year basically?



any help needed!

I'd apply now, but defer a year and take the year out.  I've just finished uni and i'm doing it now...there are companies who specialise in gap year, placements and areas to visit etc.



Google it and i'm sure you'll find some forums where you can see what other people have done, you might see something which will appeal to you?



Good luck!!

I've taken a gap year and going to university so yes you can do that, check out some stuff on camp america and ccusa.com theres some good stuff you can do in your gap year.
If your studying german then why don't you look into the courses at university some of them you can do a year abroad and that!

PLEASE HELP!!! What can I do???



Hi, my name is Jorge and I'm 18 years old.
I want to live in England, get a college (I want to study tourism) and I want to get a job to pay my studies and everything else like a flat for example.
I dunno what to do, I mean, I don't know how hard it would be to find a college there (taking in count that I don't have much money to pay an expensive college), I dunno if I could get a job there... What can I do? PLEASE, HELP.
All I've got are agencies that send ppl to study a year there, but I don't want to study a year, I want to live there. And they're kinda expensive, tho. :S
By the way, I'm from Mexico.

Thx for taking your time and read this. :)

It really isn't hard to get into university, as long as you don't apply for a prestigious one. Although I'm not sure if it's the same for international students. But it is hard to get a job, even crappy ones because of the rising cost of living. Employers are not as willing to take on staff, although it is true that if you really do want a job, it is possible to find one, it's just that people are too lazy and it's far to easy to apply for job seekers allowance.

International student have to pay around £8000 for a course at university, while UK students have to pay around £3500. Although there is funding available. And student accommodation is around £60-£80 a week. So there's is no way that it would be possible to get a job to pay for all of this, so you would need to get a loan & grants etc. The average UK student is left with around £17,000 of debt when leaving university.

ucas.com is where you find information about courses for university.

I also wouldn't suggest studying in London as the cost of living there is a lot more expensive than in the North.

If it's what you really want, then I'd go for it! You don't want to look back in 10 years time and regret that you didn't go for it.

Good luck, and I hope i've been some help!

Education is the way for people to go forward. So you have the option to study further in Chemistry - Masters & PhD. This will open your field to go for Teaching & Research jobs. 2nd option - Chemists are badly required for jobs in Petrochemical, Pharmaceutical & Food Technology Industries, the job in this area is neither boring nor uneventful, all are testing and research work.
The choice is yours & best wishes.

Hairdressing is normally done at FE (further education) colleges. This is a problem for you because in order to get a student visa you normally need to be doing an HE (higher education) course i.e. a degree or HND.



Assuming you get a visa:

The course is the same whichever college you go to so you should decide what where you want to live. London is expensive but you will have easy access to the US embassy and other US students.

Personally if I was going to study abroad i'd want to go sight seeing at the weekends so I'd pick somewhere either central or with good rail and  air links.

Ask yourself how you would feel if you were the only American in a town. Whether you like cities or more rural areas. Do you have any hobbies such as surfing? In which case you might want to base yourself near the sea.

Once you know the kind of area you want to be in ask a more specific question about where you want to be.

It really depends if you enjoy big cities, or quieter places. Most towns and cities have colleges where you can study hairdressing, probably be best to visit before you come to a decision.

Avoid London, the people there are unsociable elitists.
Go west or north, they are much more friendly in those areas.
Hairdressing does not pay very much here, you will be hard pressed to make a living wage, try another subject to study. 
Good luck!

Canada is Good choice for study but make sure you are able to pay  all Financial Aids offered by college or university. I know an agent which can help you to obtain study visa. You can call him or email your all questions and you will get reply soon. You can find university or college your self by searching online to google. just try it Hop it helps.

Can Someone Please Help? American if poss ?



Hi. Can anyone  help me please. Mainly Americans if poss..I am from Scotland and studying health and social care at college and I was planning on doing the same next year but at higher level. But next year my family is moving to Texas. The only thing in my way of moving is I don’t want to disrupted my education at college as I was planning on going to uni after my higher level course. Does anyone  know what I should do? How do I find out about courses and stuff over there, which college or if college is the right thing .Who can I speak to? I really need to know this year. How do I go about looking for things to get the right answers? What I would  like to know is, is there a similar course and education lever as here over in Texas? I would like to be a nurse and I wanted to go to uni here but if my families moving then I might have to cont my edu intexas. Any ideas? Thanks

I'd try for the internet.  Fist search for American collages and check out the websites (the collages official site preferably).  Find one that fits in with what you want to study and get hold of a department head and ask them questions.  I'm still in high school (junior) but my mom wants me to find a collage now so I'm looking up collages this way.

I would first print out a list of all of the courses & there descriptions that you have already taken in Scotland, then contact the registrar's office at the university in Texas.  Depending on the university, you should be able to find out what classes are transferable and which ones aren't depending upon the course level and course description.  You're best bet is contact the Texas university's registrar's office and they would be able to give you a definite answer.  Be aware that you may not be able to carry over all of your credits and this could add on more time towards obtaining your degree.  Hope this helps and Good Luck!!!

You'll want to get your transcripts from your current college apostilled in accordance with the Hague Convention to be sure that they will be recognized here.  I'm not sure how to go about that in Scotland, but here you have to get a notorized copy of the transcript from the registrar's office and take it to the secretary of state's office to have it sealed (apostilled).
Find out what area of Texas your family will be moving to, and search online for nearby colleges and universities.  Then check those to see if they have nursing programs or something that is similar to what you're studying now.  Check this website for a list of schools and admissions requirements: http://www.window.state.tx.us/scholars/s...
Don't worry too much about the admissions requirements.  I would talk to the admissions office directly when you find a college you like because your situation is somewhat unique and you are already a college student.
Also, just a heads up, in the states we say college when referring to any school above highschool (12th grade), it's a general term.  I believe you're currently attending what would be considered a junior college or a community college (2 year program).

Good luck!  You're in for quite a change of scenery!

GUM TREE è un ottimo sito per trovare lavoro.
se vuoi un consiglio:prova a cercare lavoro come au pair:per il primo periodo è ottimo.vivere con una famiglia inglese ti aiuterà ad abituare l' orecchio alla lingua.avrai tempo libero per frequentare corsi(anche universitari....quando migliorerai l' inglese, però) ..e amici, ed eventualmente per arrotondare con altri lavoretti.
risolvi in un solo momento il problema di trovar lavoro, alloggio, conoscere persone fidate che possano darti una mano nei problemi quotidiani....e se non altro (di solito)i pasti caldi quotidiani sono garantiti.
se poi il tuo obiettivo è guadagnare bene.........altro discorso.

buona fortuna!!!!

Will it be possible for me to get a scholarship to finsih my studies in Canada?



I've started A-levels and I'm taking Biology, English, Business studies and Sociology. I planning to move to Canada next year to finish my studies there... The person i'll be living with isn't a relation, although I do have relations in Canada. They won't be able to sponsor me and I won't be allowed to study there as I'm the UK.



Is there a chance that i'll be able to get a scholarship? Lets say if I got 4 A's at at AS level. I'm an average student and I will have to work extremely hard to get those grades but I'm very, very determined.



Is there a chance??

Go to this web-site

academic_student_visa_canada.asp
It may provide you with more information but as far as I know to get a student Visa you are not required to be sponsored by a relative.  In addition, check the websites of the schools in the area of Canada that you will be living.
However, I hope you money as the tuition for foreign students is considerably higher and scholarships usually are not available, but again, that depends on the university.

You will need good GCSE results to then go on to take A levels.

You will need good A level results to be considered for the better universities

It seems these days that all kids want to go to Uni, this isn't always necessary. Find the profession you like and see if you can get a job at 16 or 18, try and learn on the job, you earn money as well and any decent employer will organise college day release courses to further your education.

I am a Chartered Accountant and I started work at 16 and did day release college for 6 years, earning good pay all the time and never once stepped foot in a University.

You can go straight to work after GCSE's but in order to go to uni you must do A levels or equivalent, they are stepping stones, in order to further your education. You would probably be unlikely to succeed at degree level without studying A levels anyway as they are the next step.

Some people can do an A level together with their GCSEs if they are a boff, but usually you do your GCSEs in years 10 and 11 and then you go on to study for your A levels at Sixth Form College. You can't go to University straight after you've finished school, you have to wait until you've done your A levels.
It's a bit confusing but I hope you get it...

I thought you can only work 20 hours on a student visa in the uk. Im not sure if they have anyway of knowing how many hours you work or if they will ask you to present wage slips. If your working 40 hours i think your visa may be refused it will be worth checking the visa website just to make sure

If you are in a student visa, you are only allowed to work for 20 hours in a week, this will reflect to your bank account and pay slips when it will be check by the case worker and believe me they will, however if you work to a job that has something to do with your studies, then you can work 40 hours in a week as these additional 20 hours will be included as your on job training as a part of your study. For example, if you are studying to NVQ courses in care, then yes! you can work 40 hours a week providing that the additional 20 hours is your on job training and you should be working in a nursing home or in  care home. 
hope this will help you.

Getting letter from the university wouldn't be a problem. Your bank statements would tell your story. Well you have a point when you mentioned slowing down now, because they ask for last three months statements. It could save you, but let me mention here that your NI number will speak about taxation and wages also. You must slow down at least and try your luck.

Student budget.. moving to France.. healthy food.. Help!?



Hi there

I am moving to France on thursday for 6 months and want to be a bit healthier!  I am possibnly going to buy a bike but the thing I am most worried about is the food.
My boyfriend and I spend 10-15 pound a day on food because we tend to just buy a meal at a time every day and I know this is an expensive way to do things and this wont work with my student budget in france!
Do you have any tips on how to shop cheaply and what would be good, healthy, filling, student food that is popular in France?
When I lived in halls in my first yr I lived on Pot Noodles and Beans and I am sure they are not available in France :OD

Thanks :O)

I heard that there are some good markets in France... Also, you can have really nice healthy meals in a restaurant for a good price.

French don't do as much oily foods as you see in UK, people in general are great cooks.

The maor supermarket chain in France is Carrefour. It is just like going to Tesco, but with some slightly different foods on sale. Most branches have a "British food" aisle with some basic British staples like baked beans, HP sauce etc in there.

French food is quite healthy and not too different from what you can get here. You like chips? So but potatoes, they sell them in France! You like fish and chips? So buy a fish and make some batter.

Most of the things on the butcher stand are available in the UK, though in France you may find some added extras you don't get here, like cheval (horse meat).

Get what you can at the local market my weight as you need it if you can, as there is always a danger pre-packed food gets wasted and thrown away.

PS if you are a vegetarian who buys pre-packed vegetarian food, France does not cater for you! Take some good recipes with you and cook it yourself.

Your education is not even the equivalent of high school graduation in the US or A-levels in the UK.  You have the equivalent of junior high (9th grade) plus a vocational school for 2 years.  Academically, not even 11th grade (US) or O-level examinations (UK).  Your Indian "qualifications" don't count for much of anything in UK.



You might have enough vocational education to do some low-level technician jobs.  You will have to prove what, specifically, you are able to do.

Hi there,



My answer probably won't be of much use, because I went abroad to Australia to study :)



But anyway, here is my personal list of unsorted ideas:
- Homesickness is an issue, and if you tend to be homesick, it will be a big one. The US isn't just round the corner, and you can't go home for the weekend. Make sure that you are busy the first few weeks.



- Be open minded. I know that Australians are generally open minded and can easily adapt to new cultures, which is important. So I guess this won't be much of an issue.
- Get a credit card. As soon as you can, open a bank account in the US, and get a credit card. You'll need it to cover for times during which you'll be on a budget.
- Try to get a scholarship. Studying is ridiculously expensive these days, and you wouldn't want to pay for things that a scholarship could cover, right?
- Look into accommodation options soon. Many places available to students will already be taken way before semester starts. Also make sure that you have a place to sleep for the first few days when you can go looking at places yourself.
- Get overseas health cover. I expect you'll need it to enroll anyway, but it is always good to have it in case you get sick.
- Take copies of every important document with you. The originals should be in your hand luggage, the copies in your suitcase (that covers: passport, birth certificate, vaccination card, certificate of enrollment, documentation of any scholarship you may have been awarded, and of course a list with all important telephone numbers).
- Take a mobile phone with you. Get a replacement card as soon as possible, you'll need it for your job search and housing issues.



- Have at least $2000 in your bank account for emergencies. (Not to be spent along the way, of course, but for real emergencies.)
- Consider getting an international driving license. It can come in really handy.



But back to more important issues. Applying is easy. Most colleges have their own website, and there you can usually find a section called "international students". From there, they will guide you through the application process. Same goes for the visa. Go to the website of the US embassy (http://canberra.usembassy.gov/consular/v... and check what you need to apply for a visa. Follow the steps described, and voilà, there's your visa.



Applying for scholarships works along the same lines. Find a scholarship offer, complete the steps necessary to apply and hope for the best. Oh, hang on, now I remember. About six months prior to my departure, I had this enormous folder that I carried everywhere, containing all the to-do-lists and necessary documents to complete the next step, information leaflets, checklists... you name it. It really helped me to stay on top of things. Every night, I went through the folder and made a list of the steps that were to be completed the next day.



Oh, and before I submit this: You should get passport photos. Lots of them. You'll need them for almost everything. I was close to driving my photographer insane when I kept reappearing with the same request around ten times...



Good luck with everything!!

That depends on your concept of time. If we're talking daytime, that is different for each person. I, for example, study most effectively between 11 pm and 3 am. That is also when I write my best assignments. My friend is at her working peak between 8 am and 12 am, when I am totally absent-minded. Studies have shown that as a general rule, the best time to study is the late afternoon.



If we're talking about lifetime, however, it's different. The younger you are, the easier it will be to learn new things. Children aren't compared to knowledge sponges without a reason - they literally soak up knowledge. Older people have more trouble remembering things. Therefore, studying is most effective in your younger years, and shouldn't be delayed for too long.
