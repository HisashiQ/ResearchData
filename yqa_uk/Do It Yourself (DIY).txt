How much would it cost to purchase a small pane of glass?



Can you give me rough estimate of the cost of purchasing a thin pane of glass with the proportions of 14inches by 18 inches? I would be doing the window replacement work myself, so I just need the glass.

many thanks.

I paid $10 for one 12 x 35. I guess it'd be somewhere near that. The best thing to do is call a glass cutting company and price it. We have two here and their prices are drastically different.

I would say 7 to 10 bucks and if you can find a small shop sometimes they'll sell it cheaper if you are paying cash or if they can cut the piece from a scrap left over from a bigger job.

Two Nuns were getting undressed in their room, when there was a Knock on the door.
One of them said "Who is it"
To which a voice from behind the Door said,  "Blind Man".
So the first Nun says...... "we might as well let him in if he wont see anything hadnt we"?
The second Nun agreed and opened the Door for the Man.

The man walked into the room with a look of surprise in his Eyes and said "Nice T!ts sister.......... Now where do you want these Blinds" ?

yeah there are two effective ways to sound proof your garage. No1:dot & dab the walls with gyproc soundboard (least effective but easiest & cheapest option) No:2 Fix the walls at 600mm centres with gypliner metal stud system, insulate with kingspan then tack with either standard plasterboard or soundboard for max effect. (for this system don"t expect much change from £1000 maybe more). For max soundproofing you would need to install a personel door (if one doesn"t already exist) and then stud, insulate & tack  the up & over door.(much more money). If you are fussy about the finish of your walls you will need to tape & joint them and decorate. (more money). Please note that this does not include the ceiling! That could also need tacking & insulating, if not already done. (more money!) Also your personel door would have to be double glazed (more money!)



Effecting all of the above should make your garage about as sound proof as possible apart from installing an airlock door! (joke) This is an opinion from a dryliner/carpenter. There may be other methods that I am unaware of. All of the above I would estimate at about £2000-2500, not including an airlock door of course! Keep on practising those drums cos you need to earn the money to pay for your garage.

You need an in-line dimmer switch (usually touch controlled these days) - you can probably get it from B&Q

Simply disconnect the standard flip switch and replace it with the dimmer. Do not use these switches with low energy or flourescent bulbs.

your first step is to go to a hardware supply and see what's available. How the dimmer is installed depends on what you purchase. If possible, take the lamp with you. The cord switch should come off easily. Chances are you'll find a dimmer that plugs into the wall and the lamp will plug into it.

They make sockets that are dimmable. Or buy a cord with a built in dimmer. Both availible thru better lighting stores or possibly hardware stores. Don't use a flourescent unless it is a dimmable one.

Those money that you have, take it & BUY your self a HUOSE, & not a house that only you alone occupied, because it will be your first & only building SO you get one that some body can occupied one part of it so that you can have some body to help with your Mortgage, or even the light, or some thing, like that for at least the first 2 yrs. then you can do any thing you want to do with it because it is yours, but you are very STUPIED to be buying some ones house for them & improving it for them, that is crazy,silly & STUPID.I hope you will listen to me & change your mind.

Easiest way it to use a screw up plastic 1.5 fitting as it will fit the solvent weld and pushfit pipes.  Available at all DIY stores.  Put a biot of washing up liquid on the tapered rubber ring seal before you tighten it up, and make sure the ring is the right way round (taper facing into the joint).  Hand tioght is fine - no need for tools.

UK extension leads safe to use?



I have seen some cheap extension leads on ebay UK. Should I be checking for any sort of electrical safety stamp on these before using them?



</question>



<additional details>



I didn't realise it was meant to be 13 amps in total! In that case what is the point in having so many sockets? I don't think I have many appliances requiring extension cables that aren't 13 amps.



Sorry, I'm getting confused. The amps on my plugs say 13a. But I guess this is just the fuse? If so, how would I find out the amps of each individual item?

Look for the British Standard Kite Mark. Extention leads are safe if used correctly, many people misunderstand how they should be used, say for instance you have an extention lead with one socket, you can plug up to 13 amps in it, if it has 2 sockets, you can only plug into it a total of 13amps, so if you put in one 13 amp appliance, you can't put another appliance in it at the same time, but you can put 2 5 amp or one 5 amp and one 3 amp appliance in it at the same time. /same goes for a 4 socket one. Still only a total of 13 amps. Many people think that on these extention leads you can plug in as many appliances as there are sockets, but going over the 13 amp total there is a danger of fire.



also as long as they have a British Standard Kite Mark on it, it is classed as safe. Although more expensive, one with a surge protector is better still as it protects your appliances against power surges.

Should be fine, just don't use it in the bath. Worst case senario, everyone in your family dies in an electrical fire caused from the faulty extension cable. Best case senario... you get a cheap extention cable that works, saving you a few pounds.

I think from your supplementary comments you dont understand the difference between volts amps and watts.
13A is the Maximum current you can draw from a single plug in lead regardless of the number of things plugged into it.  That is a lot of power - over 2000 watts as someone else said.  Most lights computers TVs etc draw very little.  Look on the back and find a W or Watts rating.  A 250 Watt applicance will draw 1 Amp, so you could have 13 of them and not blow the fuse. Heating uses much more - fan heaters may be 3000W or 3KW which will draw 12 Amps.  All of them will be 240Volts in the UK, and that does not change with different appliances.

If you are dry laying them then just compact gravel into the soil, just don't go more then a couple of courses high or take a rototiller through the bed. If you are laying them with mortar then pour a 12" wide by 6" thick concrete footer under them. I would put at least 2 rods of re-bar in the concrete to hold it all together since you are above frost level and freezing will heave the ground up and crack the footer (that is why I say 6" rather then 4" because it is much stronger and will "float" better). If you live in the south just compact the soil and pour 4"

Be careful not to use snips as the material will crack around the cuts and could shatter. Use either a fine bladed hand saw which will take time to cut. Do not push the saw as this could cause the cracking again. Let the saw do the work with just a gentle pressure. The blade should be thin similar to a junior hacksaw. You can use a power jig saw but the same rules apply. little pressure and let the saw move forward slowly. With the power saw be sure to have the material held down around the cutting area. Alternatively by the flat plastic twin wall material and this is a little easier to work with and will last for far longer as the corrugated material becomes brittle after a relatively short time. I have done perhaps 50 garage and car port roofs over my working life.

Look for a 'glass shop' in your area. they can cut glass to most any size.



Take a piece of the broken glass with you so they can determine the thickness.  If you do not have any of the glass left, take the table.
Use the Yellow Pages to locate a shop.

OK first of all it's a water heater, not a hot water heater. You can purchase water heater blankets as mentioned above. Also consider lowering the temp slightly. Thirdly, consider covering the hot water pipes that are exposed to cold with foam insulation. It comes in pre-cut lengths that are split down the length and are easy to install.

The blanket is the way to go with your existing water heater but there is a more efficient way to go if you don't use hot water very often. An "on demand hot water heater" fueled by propane. It only heats the water when you use it so it's not constantly reheating the water when you aren't using it.

How do I install heat shield strips.  ?



I have these two metal strips that are about 3" by 33".I think they are heat shields for the two cabinets sitting next to my range.  The strips are about an inch less than the full length of the vertical frame of the cabinet.  Do I just screw these strips onto the side of the vertical frame?

If your tank is leaking into the bowl, you're right in assuming it's just a leaky stopper. You can pick up a new one at any Lowe's, Home Depot, and probably pretty much any hardware store. They sell just stoppers, but also kits that include other parts. At most, you're out about $10.

I've found the red rubber stoppers work fine. If it isn't the same shape, that's ok, as long as it makes a good seal with the hole. Also, make sure the chain (if that's what's pulling up the stopper when you flush) is the right length. If it's too short, it won't allow the stopper to seal properly.

The package should have installation instructions. Most of them just snap on to a collar around the fill tube.

Remover the flapper and take it to the hardware store to find a replacement. 
When you get the new one rub some petroleum jelly(vaseline) around the inside edge to protect it from deteriorating so fast.

Same as above but I would recommend replacing entire unit. I started with flapper and months later chain broke.  Just replace whole thing. If one thing goes, what's next? The directions are included with kit.

Replace the particle board and make sure there's no mold underneath that.. you should never just cover mold up, it'll win that war.  Do it right the first time, it'll save you time and money.

Depending on where the particle board is at, and how much needs to be replaced, it can be quite a bit of labor.

You'll need a saw (circular) to cut around the moldy section, so it can be removed easier.  A pry-bar will come in handy to pull nails/staples.

Once you have the sub-floor up, examine the floor joists carefully... if they have any mold on them, clean them with a 50/50 mix of bleach and water, let it dry, and then apply a mold-blocker to encapsulate the joist.  This will prevent any regrowth of the mold.  If you have insulation under this floor, and it is moldy, I'd suggest you replace it.

When I have to cut out a floor like this, I like to run new 2x6's around the perimeter, where I cut the sub-floor out.  I use joist hangers, and set the new framing so that it overlaps the seam, where the new piece(s) of sub-floor will be installed.  This eliminates any weak spots.  I prefer to use wood screws, not nails, (or sheet rock screws - they tend to snap off, under stress), to secure the new sub-floor.

This can be a bit of work, but if you're comfortable running a saw, yes, you can do it yourself.  Expect it to take a day or two, if the damaged section is very large.

There is no paint that will prevent the build up of dirt and algae ETC on block paving and painting it would make it look worse .The best way to keep this clean is to use jet wash and or a paving cleaner it will only take a short while unless you have a massive area 
Just pour/ spray the cleaner on to the surface brush it with a stiff broom  leave for how long it says on the tin then rinse with a jet wash or hose .Remember you will have to clean this area before you used any paint anyway
