system restore is like a time machine it makes your computer go back to its original state. so if files and programs are not in the original setting it will not be there.



you should always backup you data or files before restoring your sytem because you will defenitely lose this files. (and programs)

Just undo the restore and save them elsewhere first, to a disc or memory stick, then redo the system restore and then put the original files back where you want them

If they're dirty pictures, you're at fault. sorry. But, if they're just pictures of you and your friends and he's using them as his default picture then he can get in a lot of trouble for posing as someone else. And, also if he has pictures of you in his phone then I suggest breaking his phone.

It's Microsoft's answer to Adobe's Flash.



It's a new programming platform that drives interactive ads, menus, apps etc that you see on the web.



Silverlight is still only in Beta, so the only place where you'll see Silverlight in action is on Microsoft's websites.

Microsoft Silverlight is a programmable web browser plugin that enables features such as animation, vector graphics and audio-video playback that characterize rich internet applications . Silverlight competes with products such as Adobe Flash, Adobe Flex, Adobe Shockwave, JavaFX, Curl and the JavaScript programming language.



Version 2.0, now in beta-testing, brings additional interactivity features and support for .NET languages and development tools.
Silverlight was developed under the codename Windows Presentation Foundation/Everywhere (WPF/E). It is compatible with multiple web browser products used on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X operating systems. Mobile devices, starting with Windows Mobile 6 and Symbian (Series 60) phones, will also be supported.



A third-party free software implementation named Moonlight is under development to bring compatible functionality to GNU/Linux.

The Flash Player is just... a player. It plays Flash videos in your web browser.



To download videos from Youtube, you need certain programs like http://vixy.net/. The videos are stored on Youtube's website and Vixy allows you to download them directly to your computer.



To use it, copy down the Videos URL address and paste it into the Vixy website. Hit the Start button on the Vixy site and it'll begin converting, once its done you can download it in AVI format.

For sims you need a product code. Even with a disc you may not be able to play them - it all depends on where you downloaded it from and exactly what you downloaded

If it's just an installer/.exe file, double click to run it. You will probably not need a disc at all.



If it's an ISO file, or a kind of disc image you'll need a Disc image loader like DaemonTools 3.47 to mount it.

there is no way you can do that,for games in order to run they need to be register them on the system registry,some will need a full installation and some will run from with the exe. file only, the thing is for games like sims and football manager,these games actually store some of their files on the pc,for example profile files and progression, so as far as i know you cant run such games from an external source(cd,memory stick)

Keynote to Quicktime high/crisp quality (no antialias)?



I have a presentation in Apples Keynote (Mac), It is mostly text, that shows crisp and clear when viewed from keynote on my projector.



I need to export the file to QuickTime so I can run it from an iPod Touch, but I can't find a way to retain the crisp rendering of the text as it gets exported to QuickTime.



Can anyone help with how to do this. There must be no loss of quality, the edges of the text must still appear super sharp and clean (white text against a green background).



Is is possible to simply take screenshots of the keynote and then assemble these pictures (.png format) in QuickTime to run as a slideshow (times or manually advanced), without QuickTime applying any compression on the pics.?



Thanks in advance.

I got my computer severely infected by viruses and adware and spyware and the lot and though I got rid of all of them, sometimes it does get infected by spyware and etc again as it starts restarting by itself after a few days after I delete the adware or spyware.... And it is really slow, so what I want to do is format and install the windows completely so that it quits giving me all these problems..... So I would like to ask u how to do that, the detailed procedure as Im still a bit of a noob and dont know much..... Thanx...

er  as a novice you may get into trouble.  there are programs that need to be installed to run the processor, southbridge and northbridge chipsets.  I suggestr to fix what you got.  You need to learn hoqw to combat spyware as you never know when you going to get it.



print this and keep it.



From my notes
Also while your computer is in good nick you should download and install Superantispyware and Spybot –Search and Destroy, Ccleaner because when malware gets going you will not be able to access the net.



Clean Up Computer
CCleaner  (about 10 minutes to install and run)
=========
google ccleaner and install it.  While it installs just untick the boxes as some you dont want.



run the cleaner in windows/applications but dont tick the bottom 11 boxes in the Windows Tab.
run the registry cleaner as well, when it asks to back up the registry , allow it to do it, then clean the registry.



Also ccleaner will remove the  program entry that you may have difficulty with in add/remove, or the uninstall doesn't work.
Just ensure you tick the one program and not the whole computer to delete, if you use this feature.



Superantispyware (1 hour)
===============
http://www.superantispyware.com
Has a stop homepage from being altered which is good
Can reset windows defaults in various parts



Download and run superantispyware. I was put onto this program because of an annoying popup (XP or Vista plus all OS preceding)



Install it and set the preferences to monitor your home page.
Set up tick boxes that you want in the other tabs as you require.
You don’t need to run it at startup unless you want the antispyware protection 24/7.



Note Superantispyware has powerful reset tools that will set stuff back to windows defaults.
To use these tools click preferences &gt;repairs. This may be handy to reset IE URLS if you have annoying pop ups.
Superantispyware is a good program and remember to update it before scanning. A scan may take 45mins.	Just run a scan for the first attack.



Spybot – Search and Destroy (1 hour)
=====================



Download spybot search and destroy.  Through its immunize page and link to javacools spyblaster, spybot can manage activex problems which is extremely difficult for antispyware programs to find.  Also just run the scan for first attack.
http://www.spybot.info/en/download/index...
.



Windows Live Onecare (2-3 hours)
===================
Onecare safety scan  fixes registry and finds temp files that nothing else seems to find.
Choose the Beta Edition link for vista users.
It does registry, spyware , virus , disk clean up and defrag



XP Users http://onecare.live.com/site/en-ca/defau...
Vista Users
http://onecare.live.com/site/en-ca/cente...



Run the full safety scanner,  it takes a few seconds to install the scanning files but when you start the scan, it takes 2 hours or more. Let it load the scanning tools, then start the Safety Scan.  So once it starts to load the safety scans'  x file of x , you can leave the computer and go to bed etc.



Then at the end of the scan it asks you to set it running full time.



Think twice about setting it to run in the background as it could be another thing to slow you down. However, it may be worth while if you have no other security programs running.



Consider the following options:
I personally run Norton 360 which is full internet security and run superantispyware when I want to.



So if you don’t have a decent internet security program then perhaps run the superantispyware with your antivirus in the background.



If you sick of antivirus programs that don’t work perhaps run onecare full time and run superantispyware whenever.



Now you should be flying and Onecare has even set up a new system restore point for you.
Note onecare does other stuff as well.  Click on the menus on the LHS column., but all of this is done if you click Safety Scan.
add onecare to your favourites



IE7 (2 minutes)
=======
Over time IE7 seems to set its own (or programs do) tick boxes in the advance tab.
In IE7 Tools &gt;Internet Options &gt;Advance Tab
Click Restore advance settings defaults button.
Then scroll the listings down to near the bottom and:
Tick empty temp files when browser closes (this empties the cache, which if not empty, will stop you from going online).
Bullet disable phishing filter (optional. Leave it on if you want that type of protection, usually for financial data like internet banking)
Delete Browser History, cookies, add ons,  the whole lot regularly.
Close the browser to set the settings.



.



NOTE:  2008 will be the year of add on malware and spyware.  I advise NOT to install active x when asked to on unknown websites. If you allow an active x install and it contains adware or such, no antivirus or anti-spyware will find it, because you have given permission to install it.  The cleanup programs think that you want it installed. It will be very difficult to remove.

Hi. First you have to copy all your necessary data from your windows driver (C:) into another driver (D:). Then you can insert your windows disk and install. During download there is an option that tell you to format your driver (C:). You can choose the top option (I don't remember what exactly it is, but it is quick NTFS format). And install your windows normally. When done, you shouldn't double click on your driver (D, E) because the viruses still resident on it. You can show all hidden file and open your explorer windows in folder view. and delete file autorun in these drivers, restart and install new antivirus. Goodluck.

You should be able to just double click on the Quick Mask icon at the bottom of the tool bar. It will launch a dialogue box that lets you pick between color indicating masked or selected area, you can pick your color (it doesn't have to be red) and set the opacity. I believe the standard setting is 50%

Pointer at the end of the paragraph in Word 2007?



Hi,



I have Word 2007, and every time I click to the right of a line, it selects the whole line (with only one click). I would like the program to simply put the cursor at the end of the line when I click there (if I remember well, that was the case in earlier versions of Word). Is there any way I can change that?



Thanks a lot!

I do not use WMM, but I think that is a codec issue.  Either you add codecs to WMM or you convert the video.
You can check the encoding of the videos with the free GSpot.  Once installed, right-click a video and select open with GSpot.
http://www.headbands.com/gspot/



I do not know how to add codecs to WMM, but if you need to convert the free Format Factory works well:
http://www.formatoz.com/



Most likely the videos are encoded in either DivX or XviD and I do not think that WMM, at default,  supports those.

How do i play windows games on bootcamp?



I have a really really good imac..core 2 duo and Nvidia 8800GS graphics card. My ram is 4GB so i think i can play pretty much any game out there. When I check my graphics card using dxdiag on windows vista (parallel desktop), I don't see my 8800GS displayed on the info. Instead I see some crappy 12.0mb graphics card installed...When I try to play games, the quality is really bad and the game window is tiny. How do I properly play windows games on bootcamp with this imac?

<answer>



Your laptop won't be able to play most modern games on high. It's not that good of a laptop for heavy gaming but yes it'll do nicely for you.



You must install the Nvidia drivers on the Windows part of bootcamp for it to read your card. You may need to get beta drivers that support that version of the GS.

What sort of pop-up message?



It may be a virus - have you got a decent anti-virus?



If not, un-install your current one and install AVG Free (www.avgfree.com) if you can't afford an anti-virus system, or ESET NOD32 (www.eset.com) if you are prepared to spend money.



Run a FULL Computer Scan and hopefully it will find anything.



If not, go on Google and search for Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware. Download & Install it, and run a full scan, removing anything that it detects.



Good luck!

it defenitely sounds like a virus or more like an adware. did you recently install any programs in the last couple of weeks???  It is not an attack..It probably is an annoying adware..but take no chances. download an anti-adware software and an antivirus software, and scant the hell out of your computer. Let us know what programs it is that you have installed in the last couple of weeks.it could have come from any program..so dont lave out anything...not even the toolbars..

You say that you don't have any anti spyware, because it might not be necessary to install one. You are right. You should not install one but at least 2 anti spyware programs. Not having one at all. is asking for trouble and trouble you do have now. is n't it. Otherwise you would not ask us for help.
Firs don't be silly any longer and install these anti spyware programs

Hi!
There are two programs I've used to extract or find icons. The software with the most features is the 1st link I list below IconCool - they make several different programs to manage and edit icons. You can download 30 day trials to see if you like it or not before you buy it. Another program I've used before for this is InfoFind from Omnicognic listed in the 2nd link. It will allow you to view icons in *.ico, *.exe, *.dll files, etc in the free version of the program, but if you want to extract them then you need to pay for the full version. I just checked using the free version of InfoFind and see that most Windows Icons are located in the file C:\WINDOWS\system32\shell32.dll. Since your developing with VB if its 6 and you have full visual studio or if it's any newer version then you can edit *.ico files with Visual Studio but is not as powerful as IconCool for editing.

Open-source software vs. Closed-source software?



Which one do you prefer using and why?



I myself like and support the existence and pervasiveness of closed-source software for a number of reasons, including market revenues and employing highly-skilled software developers instead of looking for contributions from someone I don't know about.

Well you are right. But look at the ultimate end product of open source software which always turns out to be much better over its closed source counterparts. I agree that the development cycle takes much larger amount of time in the case of open source software as compared to closed source software. But the result of such a patient time consuming process is quality. Because there is no restriction of any sort for inflow of ideas from any one at any point of time, open source philosophy always wins at the end though it may be the tortoise in a hare versus tortoise race. Moreover most developers of open source software are first its users, user's requirements are better represented in an open source software. Mozilla Firefox, GNU Compilers and mplayer are some of the clear successes of open source philosophy over closed source.

Publisher not being verified is common for many if not most programs but not being a valid win32 application means that it didn't download it correctly so you just need to download it again.

Okay
I've given this sort of advice before
And my previous account was banned as a result
Downloading mac os without paying is illegal
You have to buy it
So we can't tell you how to download it because it's illegal
Posting illegal answers will get your account suspended

If your outgoing SMTP server requires authentication, verify that you have you configured Outlook to use SMTP authentication.



Your Internet service provider (ISP) (ISP: A business that provides access to the Internet for such things as electronic mail, chat rooms, or use of the World Wide Web. Some ISPs are multinational, offering access in many locations, while others are limited to a specific region.) can tell you if you need to turn on SMTP authentication. If your ISP instructs you to turn on this feature, you can verify by using the Internet E-mail Settings dialog box.

2. Select View or change existing e-mail accounts, and then click Next.

You can check several things to help resolve being able to receive but not send e-mail messages.



1)Outgoing SMTP server requires authentication



If your outgoing SMTP server requires authentication, verify that you have you configured Outlook to use SMTP authentication.



Your Internet service provider (ISP) (ISP: A business that provides access to the Internet for such things as electronic mail, chat rooms, or use of the World Wide Web. Some ISPs are multinational, offering access in many locations, while others are limited to a specific region.) can tell you if you need to turn on SMTP authentication. If your ISP instructs you to turn on this feature, you can verify by using the Internet E-mail Settings dialog box.



Note



Only POP3 and IMAP e-mail accounts allow SMTP authentication to be turned on.



How?



1. On the Tools menu, click E-mail Accounts.



2. Select View or change existing e-mail accounts, and then click Next.



3. Select the name of the e-mail account, and then click Change.



4. Click More Settings.



5. On the Outgoing Server tab, verify that the My outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication check box is selected.



2)



Outgoing SMTP server requires Secure Password Authentication (SPA)
If SPA is required by your Internet service provider (ISP) (ISP: A business that provides access to the Internet for such things as electronic mail, chat rooms, or use of the World Wide Web. Some ISPs are multinational, offering access in many locations, while others are limited to a specific region.), verify that you have configured Outlook to use SPA.



Your ISP can tell you if SPA is required with your account. If your ISP instructs you to turn on this feature, you can verify by using the Internet E-mail Settings dialog box.



Note



Only POP3, IMAP, and HTTP e-mail accounts allow SPA to be turned on.



How?



1. On the Tools menu, click E-mail Accounts.



2. Select View or change existing e-mail accounts, and then click Next.



3. Select the name of the e-mail account, and then click Change.



4. Under Logon Information, verify that the Log on using Secure Password Authentication (SPA) check box is selected.

Why would you use DXwind? Just press ALT+Enter to change from fullscreen to windowed. Hypercam/Camstudio should work just fine.

How do I change the default software for viewing images?



I have this super annoying quicktime picture viewer that takes forever to open a picture and displays a message EVERYTIME that i can't get rid of.. And I can't figure out how to delete Quicktime picture viewer component without deleting quicktime altogether (required for many videos)..
How can I at least change the default image viewer to say "Windows picture and fax viewer?"



thank you

A cyclic redundancy check is used to verify that the data you have is the same as the original. Even a slight modification in the file will result in a different output value. It means that you have corruption or modification in your installation, you should probably re-download it, or get it from another source (like a CD)

You can use programs such as VMware, Parallels, or Boot Camp (which is only available with Leopard 10.5, but it is free)



However, to use these you need to have a Windows software (either XP or Vista)  which you can get on eBay for ~$100



Boot Camp would be the only realistic one because games take up a lot of memory, but if you don't have Leopard, upgrading a Windows software and getting Leopard would end up costing you $200 for a game.  Is it really worth it then?



Good luck!!

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Go to Control Panel and click on the icon for Sounds And Audio Devices. Click the Audio tab.  Be sure that the correct device (your sound card) is selected under the default device for Sound Recording.



Also, be sure that the Windows Audio service is running:
Go to Start, run, and type Services.msc.  Scroll down to look at the Windows Audio Service.  It's Status should be "Started", and it's Startup Type should be "Automatic".  If not, right click it and change these settings.
That should fix it. Don't forget that your mic has to be un-muted in the Windows Volume sliders.
Good luck,

So many programs use that file type. If you dont know what program was used to make it, your probably wont know. Try opening it with a program you think might have created it.. Best thing to do is use notepad. That might work but like I said, its hard to tell..

You can run Mac on a PC, I've done it before and it runs almost 2.3x as fast with my native Intel processor. Go PC.



Anyway they are fairly user friendly so don't worry, once you get used to the mouse and controls and such then it shouldn't be had at all. May be easier then Windows after abit and more intuitive.

Problem with WinAmp and AVG?



im an avid listener of music and im getting really frustrated because of this problem im having with winamp...



one time when I opened my Winamp ver 5.44 AVG will pop up and say that it is a trojan



then another window will popup and say that "winamp has encountered a problem and needs to close."



i tried removing winamp, reinstalling and i even tried downloading a new installer from the website itself...



please help me! thanks to those who will help!!!!!

I was about to say "I don't have that problem.." I opened winamp and bam, there it was. It's probably a false positive (at least I hope it is), hopefully AVG will fix this for the next update. For now, you can add winamp to the exception list in AVG. I want to google a bit and see what others say. I'll write more in a minute....



Yeah, the consensus is that it's a false positive and AVG is already aware of the problem.



-Open the AVG window by double-clicking its icon.
-Tools -&gt; Advanced Settings.
-Choose Resident Shield -&gt; Exceptions on the left
-Click Add Path
-Navigate to C:\Program Files\Winamp (that's the default directory)
-Click OK until you're back to main window (you can close it now)
Try Winamp again.

Have you downloaded it from the official winamp; site ??



I am a  great fan of winamp. I think it is by far the best media player.
I never had any problems with anti virus programs interference.



I would uninstall AVG and install the following programs.



Avast free

then you install Threatfire. Threatfire is an anti virus you can install on the same computer with any other anti virus program
http://www.threatfire.com/?gclid=CL6Z6rr...



You can then uninstall winamp completely with the help of this uninstaller

Then install it from the official website I gave you
I am pretty sure, that your winamp will give you no more problems.

I suspect it is AVG, but to prove it, one needs to disable it or wait for a fixable upgrade... BTW I have the same problem with a pre-installed Winamp, so the Winamp update has nothing to do with it...

you have to becareful using older software on vista.  I once installed a webcam for xp on my vista pc and i got a very ugly result.  Luckily it is a lot easier to get into the safety mode in vista and i uninstalled the webcam software and my computer was fine check with each of the softwares websites to see if it words with vista you really do not want your new computer to have a nasty reaction to a software conflict

You can, and it'll start up and say:



"What system do you want to start up:



Windows Vista
Older version of Windows"



And you can select between Vista/XP. You only need the amount of RAM that each OS requires.

My advise for you, is not to install Vista and XP on the same PC.
It will give you some hard time, cause as much as you upgrade your RAM to.
It will still be slow,
If i were you, i would keep the XP.

You can dual boot. But expect pc to be slow and I guess the selecting of os on the boot up is such a hassle. 3-4gb ddr2 of ram , 160 gb of hd or more depends to you.

Looks to me like you have far too many programmes running from startup. You really don't need most of these running all the time so go to start, run, and type msconfig and go to the startup tab. Tek out all this itunes and nero and quicktime stuff. However - most imnportant it looks to me like you have symantec/norton and avg running at the same time. This is not a good plan and could well be causing a conflict. Take one or other of them off. Edit your question if these suggestions don't work or if you don't understand the advice

Does it give you the BSOD or just crashes on screen? Does it automatically restart your computer when it crashes?



You might have too much programs running, and depending on the specs of your machine, it can't handle it. Turn off all the startup programs you don't need like adobe, nero, qttask, apple, google and etc. Go to Start&gt;Run&gt;type in msconfig&gt;startup tab and uncheck those.



Uninstall norton and install another kind of antivirus, norton sucks. It's a big memory hog and it doesn't detect viruses well. Get one of those free ones like avast or avg, they're not the best but they're free and they're probably better the norton.



Download a spyware scanner like spybot or whatever. Do a scan and clean out any malware, spyware and adware in your computer.

The most simplest way is to click, start &gt; run &gt; type "msconfig" without the quotes &gt; click the startup tab &gt; now untick all the programs that u dont want to start up on boot up and restart your system.



Another alternative is to check the settings and preferences for each of the applications that you don't want to run on start up, for instance sign in to yahoo (you must be signed in) go to the preferences and remove the start on windows startup option, all the other applications will have this option in there settings as well.

If you are running Windows XP then bigjohn, previous answer, has got it exactly right. If, however, you are running Windows Vista, you just click on the Start icon in the bottom left-hand corner of your screen and in the Start Search box at the bottom of the menu type in msconfig.
It's a good idea to leave Yahoo Messenger to automatically start when you switch on because once it has loaded, all of your other programmes will be okay to use. Once Messenger has loaded correctly you can just shut it down,

If you only have the 1 AVG,, its always a good idea to have at least 2.. If one cant find a problem - the other does and viceversa..



Its prbably better to use both..

I was a long time user of AVG, and although I'd had no probs with it, I had been advised to use Avast.  I tried it out and within 2 days had a nasty nasty virus, and couldnt get rid of it.  Had to reinstall windows and I lost all of my data!!  Back using AVG and happy again...



If it aint broke, dont fix it!!

Avast! is better.



It scans files you access on the Internet before download.  For example, if you were to navigate to a harmful executable file, it would catch it and warn you before you download and run it.



It also has an easy command line quick scan which you can use for Internet applications that support virus scan, such as Download Status bar for Firefox.



Not only does it get rid of viruses, but also malware, spyware, adware, and root kits.



It also takes up few system resources and can run comfortably in the background all the time.



In my opinion, it's just as adequate for an average home computer user than expensive big name antivirus programs, like Norton.



Don't believe whoever says Avast! is bad.  Chances are they don't know how to do anything but surf the Internet in regard to computers.



Trust me, those who know something about computers and software will tell you Avast! is the best free choice.



Avast! has a great philosophy in that the first step to preventing massive outbreaks of viruses is to project us home users who are more subject to viruses and other nasties.  That's why it's free for us.

Once Windows is running under BootCamp, it IS a WIndows PC.



So, yes, running Windows, you can install any program you want.  Windows doesn't know it's running on an Apple, and OS X doesn't care that Windows is also on the hard drive.



But, the real question is:  Why would you need to install MS-Office on either OS?



For Windows, get the free Open Office



For OS X, get the free NeoOffice



Both are free and virtually 100% compatible with MS-Office".



Please take the time to go to the links below and read all about these amazing programs.  Then, tell all your friends about them.

Yes and No. There should always be choice I think.



I use GNU licensed software whenever possible. You seem rather proud to be a thief, I am rather more ashamed to admit that I am not too clean myself. There are usually viable alternatives to a great deal of software that is out there - however, there is no excuse for stealing... but I have previously had difficulties in purchasing and activating software, and one case of this was with NoD antivirus which came installed on my computer - I replaced it with a crack which seems the only way to use it! I since stopped using it, I never waste time with Antivirus in Windows now. (I have a scanner which I can use to check flashdrives).



Almost - in the case of Microsoft things are a little different. I am always angered when people send me '.doc' or '.docx' files. Microsoft have managed to dominate the desktop, mostly through unfair means, and predominance of the .doc file is unpleasant. What is more worrying is that it is actually ILLEGAL for any kind of free software to decode and edit the new .docx format.



In this case, I support theft.However, for my office work, I use Open office, and for podcasts and music I use Rhythmbox and Banshee mostly - I never use iTunes.



I think that your question is rather stupid, and you probably think that iTunes is free, wheras it's really no better than MS Office.



So many websites post 'subscribe to iTunes', but only the more aware sites make it easy to copy and paste the feed.



You should try to grow up and develop a rather more intelligent point of view before you visit public forums. You tend to make yourself, and your fellow answerers, look rather ignorant.



It is the choice of the software developers whether they make their code open and free or not. Free software does not always mean it is not paid for, but then I wouldn't expect you to know about that either.



I am confident that you don't support free software, and use Windows every day - thus reinforcing the Windows domination, and causing problems for people like me - who refuse to accept documents in .doc format (.pdf is fine, or html) - and businesses which tend to go with Microsoft because they don't see any way around it.



Instead of STEALING AND SUPPORTING this software (supporting by using it - do you understand?) you should try SUPPORTING ALTERNATIVES



Otherwise, just shut up and die quietly please. You are doing nobody any favours, nothing to encourage business models to help programmers get paid by working on free software.



If you're interested to learn more about the future - which in the short term will see Google improve the balance of power by sharing a little of the Microsoft domination (albeit with the demonic and utterly capitalist 'cloud software' idea) then you should first start by supporting a free Operating system (that means anyone can have a computer and can OWN the software on their computer, which is impossible with Microsoft - you pay and never own it).



Once you have a free operating system, come back and say something more intelligent. You tend to find this - people who use Mac tend to be equally stupid in their own fashion, in a kind of 'I paid a ton for my system, so why don't you? What's wrong with the whole world being forced to use iTunes? If you don't want to use your credit card you shouldn't be allowed to use a computer should you?

I'm not sure where the icon is located, but if you press the Crtl button and the += button at the same time, it will go to subscript. Pressing the buttons again puts it back into 'normal' text size. Also, if you have to type a superscript, you push Crtl, Shift, and += all together.

Well for simplicity sake, I'd suggest a Debian or Ubuntu Linux install. However, on a machine of that vintage, I'd wager that these two Linux version would not runn properly or smoothly on this laptop.

Instead, may I suggest DSL Linux? This small but effective Linux version is so small that it can fit on a credit card CD or Thumb Drive. It runs well and has most of the common Linux features. DSL Linux (http://www.DamnSmallLinux.org) was passed to me by a Pholosophy Professor and former Microsoft Developer. It is very nice indeed. Try the LiveCD  and if you like it, you can install right from the booted live cd linux environment. That's very nice, I can boot into DSL from a cd, try it out, and if I like, a click or 2 and it's installed. No reboot needed. The LiveCD is also the Install CD. And all under 100mb.

OR

One could look into KDE Linux. This is a slightly more beefed up linux install that is comparable to both Debian (in respects to the usability) and DSL Linux (on resource demands).

I would also like to point out that DSL Linux has a streamlined network enhanced version called DSL-N  "DSL's Bigger Brother"...

Good Luck

EDIT: After reading the answers above my response, I have to say, they are all really good answers and it seems like thus far, the general consensus is DSL Linux is your best route. I'd hate to be in your shoes having to figure out a best answer out of all these great responses....

One of the best cleaners is rubbing alcohol, but you can also use a warm water and mild soap solution. Avoid any heavy duty solvents when you clean a CD, as they can damage the disc.

Apply the cleaning solution to a clean lint-free cloth, and wipe the disc, again radially. When you clean a CD with a liquid material, make sure to wipe the excess liquid off, and never put the disc back into its packaging when it is still wet. Allow the cleaned disc to dry completely before attempting to play it again. When you clean a CD with alcohol or a specialized cleaning solution, often the cleaner dries so quickly that this is not a major concern, but check for spots and marks which may interfere with clean play.

Even after cleaning, a disc may fail to play properly because of scratches. Some companies manufacture products which are designed to resurface discs, smoothing out scratches so that they will play again. Depending on how severe the damage is, these products can be quite effective, but it is a good idea to back up the data as soon as you have repaired the disc, in case it fails again.



***DO NOT USE WINDOLENE, TOOTHPASTE OR T CUT.***

These all contain small granules and will scratch the plastic surface of your CD even more. What I suggest and have tried is washing up liquid. Pour a little on over any visible scratches, rinse in tepid water, then dry radially with a lint free cloth. e.g: a spectacles/ glasses cleaning cloth.

Windows movie maker does not support the I-Tunes music format "AAC". If the song you want to use is in this format you could rip it to a CD and import it from there. Or if you want to have it on your computer to use from there, just import it back into I_Tunes as a MP3; " EDIT, PREFERENCES, ADVANCE, IMPORT, MP3"

Nope it is a more expensive version of Windows.



Note if you did upgrade, it won't give you better performance and things such as Flash won't be compatible unless you download the 64-bit versions.



There really is no point in upgrading yet even if you have a 64-bit processor.

this is what happens, when you close application the processor marks it as the active process and torrent goes as the backend/background process...now at this point of time torrent software is receiving and sharing with the same bandwidth but as its no longer an active process their are some checksum error and its calulation process stops for a while, meanwhile torrent is still downloading , now again when the processor shifts is focus to the torrent and makes it the active process...it again starts calulating from thereon...and just calulates the downloaded data in that time frame due to which it thinks that the a lot of data was downloaded at that point time , so it increases the speed but gradually the speeds retraces to normal.

The reason for the spike could possibly be because your computer lags and slows down a little when you're opening and closing applications. Your torrent program doesn't know how to interpret this, and thus shows you how much you've downloaded during the period when it couldn't record download speeds accurately.

In short, it's a burst of data.

Try using Roboform. This software remembers passwords, login info and is useful for filling in forms. It can also generate random passwords for you. I use it all the time and it makes life dead easy.
The free version can hold 10 logins but the upgraded $29 version is unlimited, but both can be used for form filling.

Try it

Hi, we have a hard-drive based cctv system, a fault on the software wont allow us to copy the recordings



Either on to dvd or datastick. The system automatically erases everything every 30 days and starts again. How can i tape some footage directly from the monitor or monitor output? please help

</answer from>



<answer>



I'm probably sticking my neck out here, but I would go as far as to say you can't.



If it's recording for thirty days and then I would say as each day passes it deletes the last day so you have a continious thirty days recording.



Possibly the data is protected by the programming so that it can't be tampered with or copied. I mean whats the point of CCTV if the evidence can be easily altered or overwritten?

Yeah moving the images behind the watermark is not possible. To do that you have to watermark the picture itself. Watermark in word document is only for the hard copy to be prevented from being copied not the soft copy document. To watermark the picture use some utilities.

Ckick on Update Manager, ensure that updates are not disabled. If they are enable them, select a time for updates. Once you have done that click uo Update from the main screen to get the latest updates then run a computer scan.

It says outdated because you need to update, just click on update, make sure all options are selected and then click OK to start update.

Anti virus software goes out of date almost daily because there are so many new infections out there. So you need to click on update before every scan. If you are Windows Vista select to update and scan when you want to run them and not on auto scan. Programmes running like that in the background when you are doing other work in Vista really slows your computer down. Vista is so full of security things running all the time that it is very slow.

It doesn't show up in add/remove programmes, it doesn't show in add/remove windows components and, having browsed through the program file directory subfolders, doesn't come with an uninstall program.

I am sure that it would be possible to delete the program folders and manually edit the registry to remove all references to it, but why would you want to remove it?

First, make sure you have done File&gt;"Save Movie File" or "Save to my computer" Then it will let you choose what folder to put the saved video in. Just choose "My Documents" Once everything is saved, go to browse on youtube and find the video in "My Documents" or whever you have already saved it.

If you're hanging on AGP440 that doesn't necessarily mean that AGP440 is the culprit.  It's probably just the last text entry you see, subsequent drivers are hidden from view.
Personally, I think attempting to bypass this problem mid-way through the installation is futile.

Provided your vista DVD is genuine, then your problem is most likely with your hardware.  Sometimes it's as simple as the DVD reader.  You could also try swapping the graphics card (that would also address your concerns about AGP).

What makes you think that is so simple.

If you don't care about blending or matching, then I suppose it is. But if you're trying to make it look like they are both in the same photo, that can be a lot of work to do it well.

If you're just trying to put two images side by side, take one and increase the canvas size so that it will be large enough for the second one to fit. Then copy and paste the second image into the first one. Reposition them the way you want and you're done.

Expand the canvas size so much that you can fit in both pictures, click and drag the second image to position it right. Then you just click File -&gt; Save as... and choose a file type.

You'll need to extend the canvas size first on one of your images in order to fit them both in. 
The do 'Select All' on the other image, copy it to the clipboard and then paste it in to the first image.
You can then arrange your images, crop the whole lot if required and then flatten it (or just save it as a jpg file)

If you are wishing to put part of a photo into another one you will first need to cut around the part - maybe using the magnetic lasso tool, or the magic wand tool, then erase the background. You can then open your other picture and drag the cut-out part on top of the other photo and place it where you want it to go. If the edges of the cut-out part look a bit rough you may want to go around the corners carefully with the blur tool a little bit to make it blend more into the background. You may also need to play around with the contrast and colours a little bit to make them match more. When you are happy enough with your image just click on 'layer' then 'flatten image.' This will turn the two photos into one.

It can take quite a long time depending on how good you want it to be. There may be an easier way to do it, but just play around with it and practise. Don't forget to make copies of your originals in case you mess up. :-)

First, insert a blank CD.

A few options should show up on the auto run, and if it does, select the one that has the folder icon.

If the auto run does not show up, go to "my computer" and you will see your cd drive icon, open it and you should be able to drag photos on it like its a folder. When you are done, click the button (usually in the top left corner) that says "write these files to the cd. It should take a minute, and your done!

Depending on the photo size you should be able to fit anywhere from 100 to 800 pictures on one CD. Make sure the size of all the photos does not exceed 700 mb, because that is what one cd can hold.

To check how large the photos you are adding are, select all the photos you are putting on (or select the folder they are in) and right click and go to "properties" and it will show the size there.

I wish you would have left more information but ill try. Assuming that you are using Windows XP and have a CD burner then put in a blank writable CD into the CD writer tray. Then close the tray and in Windows XP open up the CD in My Computer. Drag and Drop all of the pictures here or select your pictures copy them and then paste them here. after your done click on Write these files to CD on the left hand side when you are looking at the files on the CD. The files should burn to the CD. Now you can give them to your friend or do what ever you want to do with them.

I would recommend you download ConvertXtoDVD. Ive been using it for a year now, on windows, never had a problem!

It will convert your video files to the dvd format readable by all standard dvd players, then burn automatically to DVD!

it is easy to use, fast and it works perfect for me.. give it a try, you'll love it

1. Download ConvertXtoDVD from vso official site here:
http://www.dvd-to-ipod-converter.com/con...



It can convert any video file.. like 
avi, divx, xvid, mov, mkv, flv ,youtube,  mpeg1, mpeg2, mpeg-, nsv, dvr-ms, tivo, ts, ifo, vob, asf, wmv, realmedia, rm, rmvb, ogm,

2. Add or drag-n-drop as many video files as the DVD can handle

3. Insert blank DVD

4. Click "Convert"

5. Enjoy watching those video files on your home DVD player! =)

ConvertXtoDVD has a lot of extra nice features too,
for example you can make your own DVD menu or auto-generate it, add subtitles, auto-burn to dvd or save your conversion.

Changing cell size in Excel - Spreadsheet warriors please help a noob



I have a spreadsheet.  One column has the name, and then the next has a long description about what the client has discussed.  The size of the 'comments' box is soo long that you have the press the arrow to go across and read the end of the paragraph.



I want to know how to change the cells from being one long massive box to being a box of a smaller size but with a couple of paragrahs going down, i.e. the box can take up 3-4 lines going down, instead of being one long line across.

Thank you

right Click on the letter above the column, then choose format cells, and in the alignment tab choose Wrap Text. Now resize your cells to narrower.

If any of the boxes have text runnoing out through the bottom, double click on the line between the 1 and 2 on the left hand side of the screen, to resize the cells to fit.

Select the column you want, and then go to "Format" and "Cells" and then click the button that says "Wrap Text."  This will keep the column width whatever you set it at and the text will go downward.

Right-click the cell, and select "Format cells." Click the "Alignment" tab, and select the box that says "Wrap text," and click "OK."

If you move your mouse over the lines separating the column letters, you'll see a double-headed arrow; click and drag the line on the right side of the column until you like the column width.

You might need to go back the "Alignment" tab again and change the vertical alignment so that the cells on that row look right.

If you don't have the toolbar turned on or can't find the button to turn wrapping on you can select the column and goto:



(Office 2003 earlier and maybe later versions)
Format Menu --&gt; Cells... --&gt; Alignment Tab --&gt; Click 'Wrap Text' Checkbox

Excel seems to default to bottom alignment for adjacent cells so you may want to select the other columns and in the same area choose a vertical alignment of top.

Finally the most frustrating thing to figure out was how to input a carriage return within a cell... use ALT+SPACE to create paragraphs in your description cells.

Hope that helps.

Ok this is called "Cell Wrapping"

Select the cell you have all the writing in

Next select "Format"  (this is located at the top of the screen in the same menu as File, Edit, View, Toolbars etc. etc)

Once you have selected format then select "Cells" 
(a new window should apear with a series of tabs running along the top of it called: Number, alignment, font, border, patterns and protection)

Select the Alignment tab

You should now see on the left hand side of the new window three tick boxes labelled "wrap text", "Shrink to fit" and "Merge Cells"

Check the box labelled "Wrap text"

Select OK from the bottom right hand corner of the window

You should now find that the text fits into one cell and that the cell will change its size to fit the text.

If you find that the cell is too thin and tall or too wide and short then you can manually adjust the size of the cell to your desired size.

You should notice that the cell references (i.e. the row number and colum letter) are orange on the activated cell. in order to manually adjust the size of the cell you have selected (a.k.a. the activated cell)
Move your mouse so that the cursor (white cross) is hovering over the orange column letter.

If you now move your mouse so that the cursor is hovering over the line inbetween two columns you should see the cursor change from a white cross to a balck arrow pointing downwards. once it is pointing downwards hold your left mouse button down and drag it to the right. you see the collumn expanding in size!

This same principle follows for when you want to adjust the height of the column

If you find that a cell is too big for your text, a quick way to get the cell to fit the size of your text is to hover you cursor inbetween the two collumns so that the cursor turns to a black arrow again and double click. This will automatically resize the cell to fit the text within it. ( note the cursor must be a balck arrow in order to do this.

Hope this helps

As someone has said, you can wrap text, or even merge a couple of cells together. To wrap the text, either right button of mouse, format cells, alignment, wrap text or, if you have already typed it, click in the cell, then click in the formula bar where you can see it and where you want the break in lines use Alt Enter to force the words onto next line within same cell.  Excel is not really designed for long descriptions and as you yourself say it is 'comments' perhaps you should consider using a comment instead of normal cell (right button of mouse insert comment). The comment is then in a separate box which you can move away from the cell in case it covers other data in other columns, and right button of mouse to show or edit comment.  However, as you appear to be using your spreadsheet purely for text, I would advise using a table in Word instead which is more used to text. In that case assuming 2.5 cm margins all the way round and you are working in A4 landscape your first column could be 2 cm wide to accommodate name and the second column 22cm wide to accommodate the comments.  You can always cut and paste rather than retying if you want to try this. It would then automatically go into Word as a table and you just need to change the widths. Another advantage of using Word is, as you type in one cell, when it gets to the end margin of that particular cell the text would automatically wrap to the next line.

There is a setting on your iPod called Sound Check - go to Settings --&gt; Sound Check and turn it on, and this is designed to try and make the volume of all songs the same. There is a similar setting in iTunes, go to Edit --&gt; Preferences, and look under the Playback tab.

Why is it when someone tells the truth about vista yahoo removes it. is yahoo in with microsoft now.?



people ask about windows vista all the time and yes it does suck so don't waste your money on it. anytime I let people know how bad vista was even after I went and spent $200.00 on the vista ultimate upgrade and it still sucked so I went and installed XP on a New Dell E521 that came with vista. Every time I let people know how bad vista was yahoo answers removes my answer. If this has happened to you my question is do you think yahoo and microsoft are ripping people off together or is yahoo getting a cutback from vista sales.

I sure hope not, thats the whole idea of internet, people can share information.
Vista do suck, and suck bad, we have a business licence where we get licence for Vista and Office 2007, and not a single person here uses it, the idea of having to change the way you work and get less productivity is just stupid.
Windows 7 , based on Vista is due late next year or 2010, if its anything like Vista, god help them.

So many users I know moved to OSX because they cant stand Vista but heard that XP are no longer supported, this is one marketing that backfired, MS may think by butting off XP will force users to Vista, but there are also Mac and Linux, even though Mac has limited support and Linux and difficult to use, when push comes to shuf, users will jump ship.

Personally I hope either Linux will gain more market, or Apple will licence OSX on regular PC (unlikely). Microsoft has become its own boss and want to determine how you should use yours, not to mention all the spying within their updates, until its found, its always a 'no we do not do such thing.'

Neither one Chris.  If it was true your question here would have been pulled as well. Your experience with Vista is a bummer but it seems many others have had the same experience.  I only know 1 person who has Vista and it seems to work ok but having had a quick play with it and reading some of the horror stories in computer magazines, I will stick to my beloved XP till the bitter end.  It is still supported by MS but I know that will end eventually.

It operates in pretty much the same way as all windows programmes to be honest.
If she wants to change font size, or the background etc then you now have to go through control panel.
Once on the net if you're using wireless then look bottom right for information on your internet connection. You'll be able to see your network and sharing centre manager. Click that and click 'connect or disconnect to a network' to see available wireless networks. Vista will offer solutions to any possible problems.
When you tell it to shut down, unlike XP it will not come up with options of sending it to sleep etc again, it will just shut straight down. So if you want to just log off you HAVE to select that, not shut down, then log off.
She'll get used to it after a week.

Torrents tend to be hellishly slow and are bandwidth- and CPU-hungry, but if you think it's worth it, I say go for Azureus.

It's a much bigger app than most other clients, but I've downloaded torrents with it, BitTorrent, and Transmission, and Azureus was at least kilobytes ahead with every torrent I tested, if not more.

As long as you don't use other bandwidth- or CPU-hungry apps at the same time, you shouldn't have a problem.

It also has a massive built-in torrent search system and more advanced features than any other client, including those for Windows. As Vin C said, Azureus is the best client for Mac.

If you are trying to watch some Youtube video you need a plug in called Flash Player. Flash Player allows you to run dynamic content from Internet. The latest version is 9.0. You can easily download and install it from Adobe's website.
You also need java script. Java script is a pack of scripts that "reads" and "runs" the flash player on Youtube.
So, if you have java script turned off or an older version of flash player you will not be able to watch any Youtube video.
.
In order to install flash player, access: http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/...

To know how to turn on javascript, access: http://www.btny.purdue.edu/enablejavascr...

You don't have to respond anything. Either you turn javascript on or you install the latest version of Flash Player.

Do you have a rescue or recovery disk or drive on your computer?

Drivers can be found there. If you do not then download them.
Put in any software that came with the devices you have installed.

after you re-install windows or any OS you have to run the cd that came with your Mother Board, then it's all about your video and sound card drivers etc.  Best thing to do is find the manual for your MoBo and that will give you the info on what components you have to update. i.e. the name of your network card, sound card, etc...

on another computer go to the fujitsu siemens site and for your model # laptop you should be able to find all the drivers for the devices that came with your computer. Best to write down what you need say ethernet, video, sound and the like but you can download them to a flash drive and install from there. I would do the ethernet only and once the yellow ? mark goes away then your set to get online and search the same site and it might scan your system and tell you which ones you need. Thanks

Those drivers should be on the Motherboard's CD or on a CD supplied by the manufacturer of your computer when the computer was purchased.

You shouild be able to get the drivers from your computer's manufacturer's web site in their Support section under downloads. The Motherboard's Manufacturer should also have the drivers for you at their site.

These drivers are in the Manufacturer's CD that is shipped with your computer. If you don't have this CD (either they didn't supply it when you purchased your computer or you have lost it), you have to go to Fujisu Siemens' web site and download them from there.

Windows update will NOT have them as they are all proprietary drivers specific to the motherboard you are using.

You should have started notifying people you were changing t o the TalkTalk email account when you first set it up. you  could then have just forwarded all existing emails to you new account. you can niot transfer them from AOL to talktalk, you need to notify people and get them to use this account.

Why don't you just tell every one your new email adress and tell them to stop sending them to your AOL account. As for your emails you want to keep just forward them to you new one. Rather simple I would have thought than paying AOL all this time..

What's the SIMPLEST free photo editing software?



My father (65) has recently got into digital photography, and would like to edit some of his photos on his computer.

He doesn't want to pay for photo editing software, and he'd be scared by anything complicated. If it can crop and fix red-eye, that would be great. If it lets him fiddle with brightness/contrast in quite a basic way, or make his photos black and white, that would be even better, but that's as far as he'll go.

If it has massive menus with bewildering options, he just won't use it. He doesn't want to work with layers, or apply complex filters, or convert from RAW (his point-n-shoot just takes jpegs), or any of that. Just make his snapshots look a bit better, not create works of art.

What do you recommend?

Hi, my recommendations are below:

1. Photoscape
Website: http://www.photoscape.org
Direct Download: http://download.photoscape.org/PhotoScap...
Some Features:
Viewer: View your folders photos, slideshow 
Editor: resizing, brightness and color adjustment, white balance, backlight correction, frames, balloons, mosaic mode, adding text, drawing pictures, cropping, filters, red eye removal, blooming 
Batch editor: Batch editing multiple photos



2. Paint.Net
Website: http://www.getpaint.net/
Direct Download: http://www.dotpdn.com/downloads/pdnsrc.h...
Short Description:
Paint.NET includes simple tools for drawing shapes, including an easy-to-use curve tool for drawing splines or Bezier curves. The Gradient tool, new for 3.0, has been cited as an innovative improvement over similar tools provided by other software. The facilities for creating and working with selections is powerful, yet still simple enough to be picked up quickly. Other powerful tools include the Magic Wand for selecting regions of similar color, and the Clone Stamp for copying or erasing portions of an image. There is also a simple text editor, a tool for zooming, and a Recolor tool.



Good Luck! Happy Editing!
Nick~

Simply for the basics I'd recommend Photobucket. 
It does all the things you mentioned - fixes red eye, crops and colour contrasts and also as your father may grow in confidence it also has a 'geek' section for more professional elements of editing photo's.

Good luck.

Try this program: http://www.any-video-converter.com/
It should be able to convert the videos to another format for nero to use to make dvds.



If you convert them to mpeg-2 will make the nero faster to make the dvds as mpeg-2 is the format used with dvds.

I would recommend you download ConvertXtoDVD. Ive been using it for a year now, on windows, never had a problem!



It will convert your video files to the dvd format readable by all standard dvd players, then burn automatically to DVD!



it is easy to use, fast and it works perfect for me.. give it a try, you'll love it



1. Download ConvertXtoDVD from vso official site here:



http://www.vso-software.fr/products/conv...



It can convert any video file.. like



avi, divx, xvid, mov, mkv, flv ,youtube,  mpeg1, mpeg2, mpeg-, nsv, dvr-ms, tivo, ts, ifo, vob, asf, wmv, realmedia, rm, rmvb, ogm,



2. Add or drag-n-drop as many video files as the DVD can handle



3. Insert blank DVD



4. Click "Convert"



5. Enjoy watching those video files on your home DVD player! =)



ConvertXtoDVD has a lot of extra nice features too,
for example you can make your own DVD menu or auto-generate it, add subtitles, auto-burn to dvd or save your conversion.

you will have to convert it first. As far as I know...the only player out there that reads rmvb is the Real player...AND a small real substitute, Jet Audio. So you will have to find a converter that not only reads it but will convert.



I recently purchased ZC video converter because I also have a lot of movies I wanted to convert and join into one long one...It cost $40.00 but has worked simply and very smoothly and will convert almost all formats into another and then even burn the disk. You can check them out here



http://www.videoxdvd.com/



you can also just do a google search for a free converter there are several decent ones out there but are very limited in their capabilities...I.E. they will convert only 50% of the movie  unless you purchase it.

You need a codec.  That's a bit of software that puts the music into an mp3 file or back.  lame_end.dll can be downloaded easily,  try http://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-fi...

Put the file in C:\windows\system32, restart Audacity and all should be well.

<answer>



firstly 
you need to tell Audaicty where to find Lame_enc.dll



you may well have this in the media player folder, or another audio package so first search your system for it, 
failing that you can download it fairly easily from DLL-FILES.COM

once you have it, back to audacity and go to file &gt; export as MP3

the first time you run it it will ask you to show it where lame_enc is, and after that it will run everytime.

once you push export as MP3 than you can add tags to it, and then it takes a wee while to do the compression etc.

There is no Photoshop CS5, in fact CS4 isn't even released yet. (Still around a week or two) Not only that, but downloading it would be illegal.
Unless you want a trial; Go to http://www.adobe.com, go to the section on Photoshop, and when it comes out, download the free trial.

There is pretty much 2 ways. Promotional ways like the previous poster which are sometimes legal.



The other way is illegal such as torrents sites eg. Demonoid, The Pirate Bay.



If you like Photoshop then buy it. Dont steal!
by the way they have only officially released CS3 not CS5 but i believe they are about to release CS4

download firefox then bittorrent and get an antivirus program, and if you are just going to download music then search what you want followed by the word torrent in google and choose one of the linkd but read the comments that everyone else has made before downloading, they always tell you if they are dodgy. and make sure there are plenty of seeders.

I would never recommmend to use LImewire or bear share or frost wire... Virus City!!!!!!!!

My Free WAY!!
The best way to do it.. IS to download torrents..you can find single songs but its easier downloading ablums...
Go to http://isohunt.com/ type in the search bar the show you are looking for. This is a torrent that you are looking for. You will have to download a client to drop and drag these files you want to download. I use Azureus http://azureus.sourceforge.net/ Download that. then once it is open go to you r"dashboard" go to your iso hunt torrent that you have found.. shrink the page.. Find the Highlighted Blue title and just drop and drag. It is good to look at the comments of the torrent to check if it is real or if it is good.. Try too download the ones with high seeders. it downloads the fastest.. GOOD LUCK

Limewire is perfectly safe if you exercise a bit of common sense, e.g. downloading a "song" that's only 350kb is clearly going to give your computer a trojan or worm. I've been using this programme for years now and I am yet to get a virus :)

Try Ares, it runs on the same network as limewire (meaning all songs available on limewire will be available on ares)

However, compared to limewire, it takes up much less space!

If you suspect you have an infection, there are several things you must do - and this sure sounds like some form of malware.  Unfortunately, if you find one infection, it is highly likely you have another one. A virus, trojan or worm are all different types of infections/malware and there are some great FREE programs that can help you.

First, clean up (delete) your cookies, temp files and temporary internet files. I prefer to use Ccleaner to do this, rather than the built-in DISK CLEANUP, as I feel it does a much more thorough job - for example, it will clean out the index files on your next reboot.



If you want to use Disk Cleanup, you can find it if you:
- Double-Click on My Computer to open it up
- RIGHT-click on your C: drive 
- Choose PROPERTIES and then click on the DISK CLEANUP button
- When done, reboot your computer.
Delete these files daily or run Ccleaner every day right before you shut your computer down.



2 - You should also have a good anti-virus program to help protect your computer. AVG Free, Avast or Avira are excellent anti-virus programs. You can't go wrong in choosing any one of these 3.

3 -Since NONE of the anti- spyware or anti- adware programs are 100% accurate in finding and removing spyware, you need at least two programs which you will run one after the other, not at the same time.

There are three excellent free ones:
- Spybot, Search and Destroy
- Ad-Aware
- Spyware Blaster



You will need to download, install, update (and IMMUNIZE in Spybot) and run them, one at a time. Be careful with the NAME of these programs - there are "look-alikes" with very similar names, that are in fact spyware themselves! Reboot after you install each one!

After this current infection is cleared up, be sure to run both of the above programs at least once a week if you are on the internet frequently and/or like to download music or files.



NOTE: Some infections prevent your from downloading the above programs. You may have to use a clean computer to download the programs and copy them to a thumb drive or CD. Then transfer the install files to the infected computer and run.

--Occasionally you will not be able to run these programs without being in SAFE MODE.  To get there, reboot your computer and tap the F8 key, repeatedly until a menu comes up.  You want to choose SAFE MODE WITH NETWORKING.

4 -You should also have a good firewall to help protect your computer. Zone Alarm makes a totally free version (watch you don't download the 30-day free trial of the paid version). You can download this from the manufacturer at zonelabs dot com



HTH : )
Good luck!

PS - Most of the above programs can be found at www.download.com

install it.
also plug a usb memory stick into a usb socket.
the vista program will use it as extra ram memory (if the stick is suitable).
just follow on screen instructions.an auto play window will come up.
accept it to use the usb as extra ram.
1gb will give you 0.8gb of extra ram.
hope this helps.

Your problem isnt vista i already told you its your operating system (its much worse then your seeming to get) And when you do restart it then you will lose everything that wasnt originally on there.

Ok, I am no computer genius. But here is what I did and happy I did so. I installed a "clean" version of vista from the upgrade disk. I had to find and download several drivers and all my programs I had before that I wanted again. It took time, and searching the web sites of various support forums to find everything. What didn't get installed was all the trial bloatware like norton trial, and all the other crap. Well worth the time and effort as it runs nice and smooth now.

When you install vista you should have all the normal and essential programs that came with your computer, like windows media player and all that stuff. Along with Vista comes some stuff that probably didn't come with your computer like Media Centre.

What wont be put back on are updates and programs and anti-virus' (also virus') that you download or allowed your computer to download and files or documents that you created.

you either need dvd-r or dvd-rw. and when you burn it on you need to do so as a movie screen. that way you can put the disc straight in the dvd and itll come up like movie. Never use CD's if you want to make a viewable performance as they are noncompatible with the software of the dvd drive.

no you dont need to put it on dvd. Just dont use Moviemaker.I have been making musical slide shows on cd but dvd authored.Nero has a choice that you can use, it takes a while before you find all the correct boxes to tick, so I suggest you use a cd+rw, so you dont waste disks till you suss it all out, then always use rw to test and then copy to r. I did this for almost three years, with different sets of photos from all over the world taken by friends, and turned out to be knock out. The out put format should be mpeg anyway.

Nope, itunes will just detect all the content on your computer (songs and w/e else your version supports) and will re add it all to the library. The only reason itunes wouldn't re add all the songs would be if you simply removed them, or deleted the songs.

Recording Guitar to PC?



I have my electric guitar plugged into an effects pedal and then into the soundcard on my pc. I can record and playback with effects but the problem is, I can't hear what I'm playing as I record. What software will have a monitor function where my PC will allow me to hear what I'm playing while it records? Should I just do it the old fashioned wat and use a mic in front of my guitar amp?

The "old fashioned way" is how they do it in recording studios nine times out of ten.

The reason for this is that the amp forms an important part of an electric guitarist's sound.

I use this cheap little thing

It has amp modeling and you can monitor through the computer

What you can try and do is right click on the speaker icon in the bottom right of the screan and select playback device. Then put the volumes up on everything and play around untill you hear the input through your speakers

Another way is to use a double ended headphone jack
http://www.niharsworld.com/wp-content/up...
And plug one end in the headphone input of your effects pedal and then the other end into your speakers or computer speakers

What I do is plug my sterieo into the headphone jack so I can hear what I am playing aswell as the computer recording : )
hope that helps

If you are comparing the two, the Kaspersky is far better than AVG. Even though Kaspersky do not have a "Eye candy" as AVG, it is better with dealing viruses. Most of the people like AVG just because of the user interface. But Kaspersky is far better.

Both are good anti viruses.
But 'AVG' leads in certain aspects.Although certain viruses like funnyscandal.exe are often caught by 'Kaspersky' while AVG could not detect it.
'Avira' is also a good antivirus.
' autorun.inf ' is a virus that is not detected by Avira.But AVG and another antivirus 'Avast' detects and deletes it.
In the rating Avast is the best
Avira is next
3rd one is AVG
and Kaspersky comes only after these.

Put it this way.  I just went about twenty miles and gave the lady my money for a new library card, and told her I could live without the Internet connection but not without the books.

I definitely think books are underrated.  While the Internet is a new paradigm and it has its strengths, there are systemizations in the discourse you find in books which, when applied to documents on the web impair your ability to use the web effectively.



In essence I don't have a preference but I see the library as valuable as something to learn first, and the place to go (especially given reference librarians) to get information on something I know nothing about, before I go to the web.

Maybe we can live without professional reporters but we can't live without professional librarians and Kindle doesn't do it for me.

I definitely choose the internet.It's so much more easier. All you have to do is type in the keywords and hundreds of searches will come on.All you have to do is click away and read through. Although I do like books, but in studying, you have to spend time reading over everything to get to what is it your trying to understand.With the internet, it is more interactive in the sense that you can have animations to explain a particular topic that you are studying on.Im currently doing Biology and I use the internet A LOT to check out animations which explain a particular topic I just studied on. And believe me it stays in your head longer too. Once I even went for a test with the animations playing in my head and I found it easy to score on that paper.Books don't offer that kind of stimulation most of the time.(but books are cool too!)

Pie charts are the easiest of all to create because they are not comparative and therefore you don't have a Y or X axis to worry about. Presumably you will have two columns of data, Col A the row labels, i.e. food, clothes etc (starting row 2) and the figures alongside in col b. Row 1 should contain the column description, i.e. Item, Amount or something like that.

Highlight both columns EXCLUDING column headings, then up to insert on the Menu and click on the Pie chart icon. This will immediately create a small pie chart near to your data. Either right button of mouse down to move chart so it is placed on a separate sheet full size, or up to the toolbar area, last icon, move chart location. Once it is full size, you can play around with it through the design, layout or format icons which are underneath the Menu chart tools.

Couldn't be easier in 2007:
Put all the categories in a row of cells, then put all the numbers next to the relevant categories.
Highlight all the data you've just put in (both rows) and then go to the insert tab.
Click on the pie chart symbol and select one of the charts (doesnt matter which, id use the first one) from the dropdown.
Job done!

A computer running Windows XP or Windows 2000 can access files on an NTFS partition. A computer running Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 or later might be able to access some files. Other operating systems allow no access.



FAT
Access is available through MS-DOS, all versions of Windows, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and OS/2.

FAT 32
Access is available only through Windows 95 OSR2, Windows 98, Windows Millennium Edition, Windows 2000, and Windows XP.

have you installed some software you need to get to.
if so what is it.because sometimes a change to the file name works.

AOL  9 doesn't like it if it's not in the Start Up folder, and will display a nag window every time you use a browser, whether you go on-line or not. If it's not taken out of theSU folder, it will also run several resource hogs in the background without telling - you even it you don't use the browser!.



You have to remove it from the 'Start Up' folder, but Windows can start up  programs automatically from other places as well, so you might have to look at the 'config' files also.  There's alot of sites that tell you how to do this. Master Your Windows , Win Patrol and other programs can do it for you - search for and download them. I think download.com has them, or similar programs.

You can try some best DVD Ripper Platinum here, they can convert DVD to AVI, DivX, XviD, VCD, WMV, MPEG4 format video files, with almost same quality, but just only 10% size. So you can add DVD Movie to iPod, Zune, Pocket PC or any other MP4 player. Also, you can rip the DVD to the formats for Youtube video such as wmv.



Even you can use the video editor profile to output avi file for your video editing software, such as Adobe Premiere, Sony Vegas. Also, it supports ripping MTV, music DVD to MP3 audio; you can listen to your favorite movies on your iPod now!



There is the free download link:

ABC is a bit outdated.  It has not been updated since 2005 and there has been alot of change in bittorrent.
This article discusses the best free bittorrent clients and has links to downloads and setup guides for the best:
http://www.techsupportalert.com/best-fre...



You go to torrent search sites to find content that you want.  This article discusses the most popular torrent search sites:
http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/...



When you find content you want, then you download a small file (the torrent) associated with the content.  When the torrent is opened in your bittorrent client, transfer of the associated content begins.



The url that ABC is asking for is the url of the torrent.  Much easier just to download and open the torrent file.

if u mean like a notepad then there's notepad++ which is a freeware i believe. But u wont be able to test ur queries/codes here. It just serves as a notepad but is able to differentiate ur codes andhighlights commands making it easier to write. example SELECT will be bolded and in blue color whereas table names and whatnot is left as normal text. and u can choose a range of different coding languages to use. However if ur requiring something to test ur codes then u have toad, SQL Tools, SQL Plus etc.

Oracle provides SQL Developer for free (http://www.oracle.com/technology/product... which will certainly be much better than SQL*Plus and has some of the features you're looking for.  If you're willing to pay, I'd suggest PL/SQL Developer (www.allroundautomations.com).  Finally TOAD is very popular (www.quest.com) but is significantly more expensive than PL/SQL Developer and (IMHO) not generally worth the additional money.

If you are at all disatisfied with your computer, as it is so new you really should go back to the retailer from where you bought it. I can assure you it has nothing to do with the fact that you now have Vista, rathern than XP operating system, which in fact is so much better. It probably just needs tweaking a little bit and I'm sure the retailer can help you.

Once you get the viruses, spyware, etc, it's usually a little harder to remove than just downloading a program. AVG Antivirus is the top downloaded antivirus program on Download.com. I currently use it on all of my computers as well. If you know WHEN you got the viruses, you might be able to do a system restore to back before you downloaded them.

If you want to download free software for your computer to keep it running smooth without downloading anymore garbage attached too it, go to www.filehippo.com  There you will find the antivirus catagory as well as downloads for CCleaner and Avast to keep the spyware and trash gone.... run those two at least weely.... and keep your Avast, or AVG antivirus up to date. Which you can use best will depend on your computer and what is most compatible with it.  Try the most popular one and work down. You can do lots for free....

Good avi splitter and joiner?



I have the Banana Splits on dvd. They contain the show Danger Island. I want to split and join the episodes of Danger Island so that it plays as one movie instead of watching them one at a time. I need a program that will split and join them and also have the audio synchronized with the movement of their mouths. I want to eliminate the opening credits of the show so you only see it once and eliminate the part that says previously on danger island. Thanks

Processing a web application depends on the contents of the page and your internet connection speed. If the page contains graphics more and ur speed is slow then it will take time. 
Another thing is if you have virus in your m/c like spyware then it slows down the processing speed as well. Also do one thing,clear the temp internet files and cookies they also slow down ur speed.

What's a good program to use to cut up a song file?



I got a game I want to upload a song to and it lets you upload sound clips but only allows for 10 seconds  you can however chain multiple sounds to play one right after another, and that is allowed. so I'm thinking I could slice the song into 10 min segments and upload but I need a good cheep program to do that with any sugetions?

sounds like you've apparently got some data in either the very last row of the very last column.  Then you're trying to insert a column or row that by doing so it would "push" the data off the sheet (perhaps your macro is doing an insert?)

for example create a blank sheet.  enter "test" in A1.  Then enter "test" in IV1.  Now try and insert a column anywhere inbetween. You'll get the same error message.

try pressing &lt;END&gt; then &lt;HOME&gt;. This will jump you to the very last cell that excel shows to be and the end of your spreadsheet.  I suspect you're going to jump to column IV or to the very last row somewhere.

Any video experts know of a VOB creator?



I've got some home movies I want to transfer to DVD.  I can get the movies into MPG2 without a problem, but the issue arises when I try and burn them to DVD.  Nero tries to recode them, messes with the frame rate and introduces compression artifacts - this I don't want.



So - does anyone know of a program (preferably free software or open source) that will convert an MPG2 file directly into VOB.



I don't need subtitles or anything, just a straight MPG-to-VOB conversion, and it can run on any of Windows, Linux, OS/2 Warp 3 or BeOS as I run them all.



</question>



<additional details>



I'm actually trying to be quite specific here.  I don't need a program to rip off DVDs thank you, so please don't tell me about shareware DVD copiers.  I have a custom DVD menu maker and I need a tool (command line or GUI) to convert MPG2 to VOB, after I've done postprocessing on it (thanks for the filtering tip, by the way - v helpful).

Look at DeVeDe (Linux). As far as artifacts, you have to run a filter on the captured movie before the DVD. The cause is video is an "upper" and "lower" field. Anti-aliasing will blend the two fields into one dot.



a command-line video convertor called ffmpeg, excellent and has several gui front ends that basically have all the presets in lists. One example is kdenlive. And mencoder, similar transcoder software. Google mencoder on youtube.



And, I'm only telling about the Linux stuff because you can try it free.

Difference between MS Access and Open Office Database?



I need to use Access at work soon, but I've only got Open Office at home. I wanted to familiarize myself with Access using the latter, but don't know how different they are, and if my preparation would do me any good.

Has anyone used both these programs? What are your thoughts?

The simple answer, until quite recently was Quark. Professional design studios and up-market/large publishing houses (newspapers and magazines), invariably used Quark.

Quark, however, is very expensive and not really intuitive to use - although it does have the advantage of being quite easy to customise. If your body text is, for eg, 10pt Times, then it's easy to program one button to do that and set it out over the correct width and leading.
I haven't used the latest InDesign, but I don't believe that's the case with that.

More recently, however some companies have been moving over to the Adobe product, particularly smaller ones.

Adobe do a much better deal for universities and colleges, so people generally have more opportunity to learn this while they're in education. And then people like to stick with a product they know

I predict that Adobe will continue to grow in popularity unless Quark does something with its pricing

I've been a graphic designer for almost three years and I would say that Quark is still top when it comes to a layout package. Though I must admit, I am finding myself using Indesign more frequently. Also you can find software usage can differ between areas of a country. Freehand for example is software I very rarely use as Illustrator does the job so much better, but some places still stand by Freehand in the way I prefer Quark. Personally I think Quark is the best software as its easy to use and has everything you need. Indesign however seems to have long ways round a simple action. Use both of them I would say to keep you on top.

Hey there. As stated, you'll need to install drivers for your sound card. Go to the manufacturers website, and put in the model of your soundcard. There'll be drivers there.



If you've still got the CD-Rom of drivers you got when you bought your PC, they'll be on there too!

Don't know the name of your soundcard? Go to 'Device Manager' in Control Panel.

I hope this helps.

The next time I turned my mac on and logged in Ichat(AIM) popped up (auto-sign in), and all of a sudden all my contacts and buddies weren't there. I tried adding them back and it doesn't show any error messages. However, they still don't show up.

first mistake is letting anyone use your computer other than you. 5 days is a long time to not know what it is being used for, where on the web it is being used at, and what they may have downloaded from limewire.



Have you ran a virus scan, malware scan, and a scan for spyware?
I bet that will be your culprit.



Next time you want to leave for a few days then setup another windows login account and make it a limited account and lockdown limewire from being able to be used.

Open Internet Explorer, and open  &gt;&gt; Tools &gt;&gt; Internet Options &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; View Files .. a new window will pop-up and all your temporary internet files will be displayed. If it's not there then it will not have saved to your computer.



There is another possibility that it saved to another location. If "Search" doesn't locate the file, go to the same site and download the file again, but when you click "Save", check the path the file is saving to - it will be the same place as it downloaded to before when you were disconnected.

if the file transfer was terminated the file will not have been created and therfore will not exist on your disk. The parts of the file that you have received so far will have been written to the disk but with no file headers you will not be able to access it. Depending upon your operating system or download software, the file transfer may be resumed.

both programs by design have their own specific hardware drivers. they should work just fine together.



historically though, i prefer using only nero as roxio has failed to either burn (detect a drive) and/or read a cd/dvd from time to time.

I'll touch on the cons first, because the list is a LOT shorter, (I'm not saying less important to you, just shorter.)



1.  Although wine can run *some* windows programs (office - some versions, games, etc.) don't expect to be able to run any programs written for windows.



Now for the Pros: (Yea, the only con is it won't run windows program.)



1. Security
2. Speed
3. Cost (free)
4. Community support
5. Literally tens of thousands of open-source (free) programs available.  You can find an open-source program to do just about anything you can buy a windows program to do.  OK, the high-end games aren't available, but there are a lot of games available also, even some 3D  First-person games.
6. Because windows programs won't run on Linux, neither will most viruses, spyware, trojans.
7.  Ease of installing, upgrading, and un-installing programs.  For the most part, any program you want to install, you can use your package manager to install.  Just start the package manager, select the program you want to install, clck the box and tell it to install.  Linux will go out, download the program and install it for you.
8.  No registry to get corrupted.  Linux configurations, options etc. are all stored in plain text files.  There is no windows "registry" to grow, get huge, corrupted, bloated and crash or slow your system.
9.  Actually, despite what you might have heard in the past, it has better over-all hardware support than windows, and you usually never even have to go download a driver.  (WAY better than Vista's hardware support)  There are exception, don't buy Kodak printers if you want to use Linux...  Apparently  Kodak is sucking on Micro$oft's tit or something.  The Open Source community has offered to write drivers FOR them, if they would just release some specs, but they refuse to do so.
There are many many more advantages, such as not being tied to proprietary standards, being hugely customizable, not being locked to one vendor etc...  But we don't have to explain everything to you, go try it for yourself.



You don't have to make a "jump" to linux.  I'd suggest Ubuntu or Kubuntu http://ubuntu.com http://kubuntu.com  The difference between the two is primarily the user interface.  Kubuntu uses KDE, ubuntu uses GNOME, KDE is a little more like Windows than GNOME... but even then you aren't limited... even if you install ubuntu, you can still install and run KDE, and vice-versa.



Ubuntu/Kubuntu (and many other distros) uses a "Live CD" to install from.  This means you can download, burn a CD and boot from the CD.



You have the option of either installing or running it from the CD.  You can boot directly from the CD and "play around" with the system to see what it's like and never install anything to your hard drive.  (Of course, when you reboot, anything you 'saved" or modified, will be gone when using the "Live CD" mode.)



Also, keep in mind that it will not run as fast from the CD as it will if you install it to the hard drive, but you can still get a taste for it.



If you decide to install it, either version will re-size your windows partition on your hard drive, and install itself into the space created.  It will install a GRUB Boot Loader, that allows you to boot into either Ubuntu or Windows, so you will still have the choice.  Later, if you wish, you can delete the windows partition and increase the size of the Ubuntu partition to fill up your entire hard drive.  You can even access your windows data from Ubuntu to copy over pictures, music etc.

Pro:
1. Easier to write and/or modify programing if you know HOW.
2. Not QUITE as prone to most malware AT THIS TIME, (most is written for windows.)
3. Easily adapted to MANY concurrent users, (which is one of the reasons it is popular for servers,) and remote access from "dumb" terminals.



Cons:
1. Similar to Vista in that for a LOT of accessories, (video cards, sound cards, printers, etc.,) there are NO drivers available that take advantage of ALL the options available.
2. Usually LESS tech help available for problems.
3. For gamers there are MANY fewer games available and for other users there is much less "specialty" programing available.



Overall, it depends on what you need, and whether or not you are capable of writing your own programs for most "limited interest" uses for which commercial programs are either not available or outrageously expensive.

Cons - If something goes wrong, it can be difficult to fix if you don't know whats going on. Some devices, like NVidia videocards, can be extremely difficult to install, and require extensive use of the terminal. Not always as user friendly as paid OSs

What's the best FREE DVD burning utility?



Remember the days when you could use Nero, to simply drop the files you wanted onto the disc, and hit burn? Without killing your computers RAM at the same time? I just want a simple burning utility that is very very basic and free.

There are a number of programs available, the one I use most often is DVD Decrypter.  You can use it to grab the ISO image of the DVD, and then use Nero or DVD Shrink to burn it onto another disc.



NOTE: This is STRICTLY for making a backup copy of Stuff that you already own.  Do not try to be a pirate, as that usually ends badly.

Mac OSX + KDE4? ? ? ? ?



Hi,



I hate the OS X interface, but love the kernel, hardware, and need certain application supported only by OSX.



Is it possible to port KDE4 to Mac OSX and make OSX look EXACTLY like KDE4 on linux?



I know about the current porting project from KDE4 to mac, but all it does is let you run KDE4 apps, not run the whole KDE4 desktop.



Thanks!

What are you running XP, Vista, sometimes you have to tell it to let you download. On your browser, at the top, you see a pop up that prevents you from downloading, right click on it to allow it to download. See if that works,



Or do you have parental controls on your computer prevenying you from downloading



Or where are you saving it to, try saving it to your desktop

It depends on the kind of movie that you are attempting to download.



If you are trying to download a flash video (such as one on youTube), you will need to find third-party software to download the video.



What kind of video file is it, and what browser are you using?

You can try liteCam, I've been using it for few months to record YouTube videos and pretty happy with it. I've tried several programs, and it works the best for recording short (5-20 minutes) streaming videos.



They have 30 days trial as well.

When you say "attach" do you mean Insert? I'm going to assume yes.



Which version of Excel do you have? Is it Excel 2007 or Excel 2003?



For excel 2007:



On the ribbon click insert, then look to the right to the TEXT group, click "OBJECT" and then Click Adobe Acrobat Document, and then find your document and insert.



For Excel 2003:



On the toolbar click INSERT, OBJECT, select Adobe Acrobat Document, then find your document and insert.

Techincally Ccleaner, is a registry cleaner.
An easy way for a registry cleaner, would be to browse file hosting sites such as http://filehippo.com or http://tucows.com, or search "registry cleaner" in a search engine.
Though a proper decent, free registry cleaner is rare.

before you open ANY bit torrent download SCAN  the file with your latest updated Anti-virus!
These torrents are from a mixed group of users and whatever they get, you can too.
Some of it's intentional, but often it isn't: they may not know they even have a virus/trojan, etc.
Better safe than sorry.

DOS, short for "Disk Operating System",[1] is a shorthand term for several closely related operating systems that dominated the IBM PC compatible market between 1981 and 1995, or until about 2000 if one includes the partially DOS-based Microsoft Windows versions Windows 95, 98, and Me.



Microsoft Windows is a series of software operating systems and graphical user interfaces produced by Microsoft. Microsoft first introduced an operating environment named Windows in November 1985 as an add-on to MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces



Unix (officially trademarked as UNIX, sometimes also written as Unix with small caps) is a computer operating system originally developed in 1969 by a group of AT&T employees at Bell Labs, including Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. Today's Unix systems are split into various branches, developed over time by AT&T as well as various commercial vendors and non-profit organizations.

dos is an character oriented; single user;system



you can not share files between 2 dos pc in older dos system.



windows is an multiuser GUI support system where you can access each & every thing easily inspite of issuning command each time as compare to dos. Each task u perform os will invoke commands for you internally



unix is similar to dos as character oriented system support diskless client provide high security by making shadow oassword file . unix is basically for network while dos & windos are not.



unix is also an multiuser system.

you cant change it. you must open it with a program that can open it. try googling winrar. it has a 40 day trial and this will open it. for zip, just right click desktop and say new&gt;winrar zip archive. then name it and drag ur stuff to it. but yeah to open it use winrar. you can also use 7 zip but winrar is way better in my opinon

There is no need. .Rar files are easier and better to use than zip files although zip files are still useful for a few things. (zip files are down loadable on almost any websites. Some websites don't accept .rar files and there are more of these kinds of websites.



Search google for "winrar download" and download the corresponding program. Now right click on the zip file and click "open with WINRAR"



It will open, same as if it was a zip file.

.rar is just another form of compression. winzip should open it, or winrar. if you absolutely have to have it in .zip format, use winzip to expand it, then rezip it.

The same purpose as any other operating system. A computer is simply a calculating device which does nothing on it's own but is capable of responding to instructions that it understands. Now if you wanted to create a diary for example, you could spend hours and hours writing such a programme or you could simply install an operating system which has a method of communication already set up along with a host of programmes and basics.



So for example when you turn your pc on, you see a screen with all your icons, well they come from your operating system. Windows vista is just another type of operating system with different layout etc.

Windows Vista (pronounced /ˈvɪstə/) is a line of operating systems developed by Microsoft for use on personal computers, including home and business desktops, laptops, Tablet PCs, and media center PCs. Prior to its announcement on July 22, 2005, Windows Vista was known by its codename Longhorn.[3] Development was completed on November 8, 2006; over the following three months it was released in stages to computer hardware and software manufacturers, business customers, and retail channels. On January 30, 2007, it was released worldwide,[4] and was made available for purchase and download from Microsoft's website.[5] The release of Windows Vista came more than five years after the introduction of its predecessor, Windows XP, the longest time span between successive releases of Microsoft Windows.
Windows Vista contains many changes and new features, including an updated graphical user interface and visual style dubbed Windows Aero, improved searching features, new multimedia creation tools such as Windows DVD Maker, and redesigned networking, audio, print, and display sub-systems. Vista also aims to increase the level of communication between machines on a home network, using peer-to-peer technology to simplify sharing files and digital media between computers and devices. Windows Vista includes version 3.0 of the .NET Framework, which aims to make it significantly easier for software developers to write applications than with the traditional Windows API.
Microsoft's primary stated objective with Windows Vista, however, has been to improve the state of security in the Windows operating system.[6] One common criticism of Windows XP and its predecessors has been their commonly exploited security vulnerabilities and overall susceptibility to malware, viruses and buffer overflows. In light of this, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates announced in early 2002 a company-wide "Trustworthy Computing initiative" which aims to incorporate security work into every aspect of software development at the company. Microsoft stated that it prioritized improving the security of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 above finishing Windows Vista, thus delaying its completion.[7]
While these new features and security improvements have garnered positive reviews, Vista has also been the target of much criticism and negative press. Criticism of Windows Vista has targeted high system requirements, its more restrictive licensing terms, the inclusion of a number of new digital rights management technologies aimed at restricting the copying of protected digital media, lack of compatibility with certain pre-Vista hardware and software, and the number of authorization prompts for User Account Control. As a result of these and other issues, Windows Vista has seen adoption and satisfaction rates lower than Windows XP.[8]



Windows Vista is intended to be a technology-based release, to provide a base to include advanced technologies, many of which are related to how the system functions and thus not readily visible to the user. An example is the complete restructuring of the architecture of the audio, print, display, and networking subsystems; although the results of this work are visible to software developers, end-users will only see what appear to be evolutionary changes in the user interface.
Vista includes technologies such as ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive which employ fast flash memory (located on USB drives and hybrid hard disk drives) to improve system performance by caching commonly used programs and data. This manifests itself in improved battery life on notebook computers as well, since a hybrid drive can be spun down when not in use. Another new technology called SuperFetch utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze usage patterns to allow Windows Vista to make intelligent decisions about what content should be present in system memory at any given time. It uses almost all the extra RAM as disk cache. In conjunction with SuperFetch, an automatic built-in Windows Disk Defragmenter makes sure that those applications are strategically positioned on the hard disk where they can be loaded into memory very quickly with the least amount of physical movement of the hard disk’s read-write heads. [26]
As part of the redesign of the networking architecture, IPv6 has been fully incorporated into the operating system and a number of performance improvements have been introduced, such as TCP window scaling. Earlier versions of Windows typically needed third-party wireless networking software to work properly, but this is not the case with Vista, which includes more comprehensive wireless networking support.
For graphics, Vista introduces a new Windows Display Driver Model and a major revision to Direct3D. The new driver model facilitates the new Desktop Window Manager, which provides the tearing-free desktop and special effects that are the cornerstones of Windows Aero. Direct3D 10, developed in conjunction with major display driver manufacture

How can I keep my computer date and time accurate?



OK So my computer date and time keeps going back to 2005 (that's when my computer was bought) because there is something wrong with the CMOS battery or something and hence it is unable to keep date and time. Every time I shut down my computer the time goes back to some day in 2005 due to which I face problems. Yahoo and other login pages (encrypted) give Certificate errors saying they are outdated because my system date and time is not accurate. I tried to synchronize the time with Internet servers using the Windows Time Synchronization but it only works if the date is accurate which I have to fix manually. Is there a way I can get my date and time updated automatically using Web severs say every time I restart my computer or something like that. I have DSL hence my computer is always connected to the Internet, you know something that regularly updates my date and time automatically.



I have a laptop which I use much more frequently than this hence I don't want to spend money buying/replacing hardware on this computer.

All you need to do is buy a new CMOS battery. They're less than 5 dollars, and all you do is plug them in. If its a standard desktop, it takes a standard 3V cell. Its very simple, and will last many years.

Maybe your modem or wireless thing is repeatedly restarting.



Could be any device is repeatedly restarting.



Maybe a driver conflict, one driver starting to access the device but then the other driver starts accessing it as well.



I would recommend re-installing Windows unless you already had this problem since you installed this. But first, try your hardest to find the cause of the problem.



How long have you had Windows installed? I had it installed for years but then I re-intsalled and my system seems to be slightly faster. Re-installing gets rid of junk thats on your comp. Remember, back up your stuff.

may be this problem can cause this:



1. your devices that attached using usb port, like mouse, keyboard, usb camera and others. try to pull out all the usb devices and try to hear the chimes again in few minutes. if yes, try check one by one which is cause that problem, and replace it with new, it may cause the problem in your device. if not, try second.
2. update your chipset or motherboard driver. refer your hardware documentation on how to update that.



hopefully this problem can solve it...

Being able to display the characters won't convert it for you. To display the characters go to Control Panel, Regional and Language, Languages and in the Supplemental Language Support section check the 2 tick boxes and OK. It will then instal everything you need to display them. You may be asked for your windows disc to be inserted during this process

Its the next OS from microsoft that will replace vista. From the screenshots on wikipedia.org it looks the exact same as vista. In my opinion though, microsft should scrap windows and start over from scratch instead of trying to patch something that should have been finished years ago.

My computer had been running real slow for a day or two, i thought that maybe it had a virus but i ran a few norton scans & everything came back fine so i shut my notebook off, gave it a rest & attempted to turn it back on. well it would not start i tried a system restore but nothing happened, some how i ended up restoring the computer back to its original settings, had to re-register my computer as if it was new. But my big question is if there is any way to get back all my old pictures & documents? i checked the restore points & it only goes back to when i re-registered my computer [yesterday] please help me. im really hoping i can get my stuff back =[

If it went back to the original settings, that sounds like you did a system reformat and not a system restore.So, in that case you can't recover any documents as you wiped your computer clean, sorry

The same thing happened to us awhile ago.
We had to pay someone to come in and fix it, but it was worth it
because otherwise we would have lost all our photos etc.
One point the guy made was get rid of Norton (which we had at the
time) He said it is like a virus itself.
Since then we've used Kaspersky and haven't had a problem.
By the way, I should be, but I'm not earning commission from Kaspersky.
I also got the guy to teach me how to do a system backup and restore, very helpful.
Save yourself Hundreds if you just ask!

There many different kinds of modeling software with various degrees of getting towards a final project. Perhaps the most complete is Blender, but others include Wings3D, Google Sketch-Up, CB Model Pro (beta) and a host of others.
It all depends on what you desire as your final product. If you want models for just rendering many can do that, if you want to export models for a particular platform, you will have to look at feature sets and available export filters.

You've got a compressed file similar to what's known as a ZIP file.
Both RAR and ZIP are compression formats, of which there are many.
You can use a program called WinRAR to open it, but it is only shareware and you will have to buy it if you want to keep it.  I believe a free software from 7-zip will also work.  WinZip is another popular software.
Check my source in wikipedia, they list a few others.

Limewire of course, just google "Limewire" and download and install the program. You can then from there download FOR FREE!!!!! videos, music, software and images. Most of the things that you download ARE protected by copy right somewhere, but if you want them free, it has to be done illegally, otherwise you must pay.

If you haven't installed the graphics driver, install it.



If you have 3D effects compiz fusion turned on, then turn them off while you use Google Earth. Some graphics cards can't handle both simultaneously.

mac software and OSX runs on the vanilla kernel the only way to run Mac software is to install OS X and a hack on you pc. i doing this currently and it works like a charm if you can find all the right drivers.
it is slightly illegal and you have to download the hack and OS off the intenet (its about 4GB)

What is the best format + software to reduce my MPEG2 video files.?



I use Windows Media Center to record my TV shows and the files are massive.



I use DVRMStoMPEG to change the files to MPEG2.



I want to keep the quality and reduce the size.



I saw some MP4 files of a 40min / 350mb letterman show and the quality was very good, better that x264 shows at 1+GB in fact.



Of course I'm not sure of the recording source or if it would be good to convert MPEG2 to MP4.



Also, what is the best software to use. Freeware prefered but will buy if it's good.



thanks in advance

Whenever I try to open up my documents/my pictures, or anything like that, a windows message comes up saying "Windows explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience" and then my tool bar at the bottom dissapears and then comes back. and all my system tray icons dissappear



It always does this, even for things like control panel. I dont think its a virus, I have a pretty good protector and scan it often.



Why is it doing this?

i hope you dont have norton because thats bad news



if you do deactivate it and then see if it works



go to  start/run/type "msconfig" in the box /start up tab/disable all/



services tab very important check "hide all microsoft services" then click disable all



it will ask to restart yes then it may ask to restart again



this just disables all the background junk that sometimes runs behind the scenes  you dont have to leave your anti virus running all the time



scanning once a week should be sufficient



most of the time you dont have to worry about viruses unless you download a whole lot



good luck friend i hope i have helped

Hello,



(ANS) In my opinion the answer is NOP!!. Just because you have virtualized windows vista makes no difference, as far as Vista is concerned it doesn't know its running within a virtual environment.



To windows vista it still thinks its running as normal and so therfore it will behave as a normally installed version of windows vista, thus it will still want & ask for activation.



**If you want to activate Vista (assuming its a normal copy of the product) then you should still be able to even if its running virtually. If you do activate it then provided you have a valid EULA & Product key you should be able to apply the normal service packs, hot fixes, patches & windows updates.



Kind Regards Ivan

RMVB files are actually meant to be played by RealPlayer, but some ppl just can't stand that player. So here's your alternative:



Some ppl developed a codec that plays RMVB and all the formats that only RealPlayer can play (except for streaming media). The codec is called "RealAlternative" (lol).
http://www.free-codecs.com/download/real...
Download the codec, install it (run the setup file you just downloaded), and you should be able to run your RMVB files with MPC now. I used that method when I got some movies in RMVB format.

<answer>



If you entered a serial number when you installed it you should get updates that come with what you received. I've never had to update an Office version though because it's pretty much all has the same principle. I always just update when a new version comes out. But you have to pay to receive the new version.

"Which anti spyware/anti malware program do you use...?"?



Which anti spyware/malware program do you use? Is it a free downloaded one from online or did you buy it with a product licence from high street or wherever?



Which product is the best in your opinion?



I think i should buy one rather than have a free downloaded one, as they don't always have the full access for everything you need. What do you think?



Thanks in advance.

Norton 2007 is pretty amazing.. i bought the full one, but if you buy a new computer from PC World, then they normally give you like a 'half' verion.



I would recommend Norton 2007, but it is very expensive.
There are loads of good freeware virus scanners like AVG they obviously aren't as good as one you have bought.



Hope this helps

I use Avast, these ones you buy EG: Norton are resource hogs and not to mention it's like €60 a year or something.



That's a joke, when a good free one will do the same job, if not better; I'd go with Avast Home edition(that's the free one, professional is the one you need to buy).

Avast definitely, it is a full client and does not hog your system, it has a unusual interface that looks like a music player, but it is a very good product, it also has audio warning and prompt, so it tells you when it has updated or finds anything, it is not overzealous, norton thinks everything is virus and slows your system way down.

CCleaner is good, but the most feature-rich in my opinion is Perfect Optimizer. It's an award-winning PC repair software that does all of the following:
- registry cleanup and repairing
- junk file cleanup
- IE repairing
- evidence cleaner
- system optimizer
- memory optimizer
- windows startup repair
- install / uninstall manager



It's a nifty tool for Vista registry repair that runs flawlessly and securely with minimum user intervention. The customization features are really very good for system-heavy users.

how can i overcome this problem as i need to burn a cd?
i dont really want to get rid of my virtual driver because i have an important software on it and also i would have to reinstall it and i'd loose all of my important work!!!!

You must first convert the itunes music format into an mp3 format using a converter software.  If the music is in mp3 or wma format, you can easily burn that on disk using the NERO software.

Windows XP help. What do I do and what caused this problem?



The other day my laptop just shut down for what so reason while I was working and now I can't start up windows! This is the error message I get after I press the power button:



"Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:
\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM



You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows Setup using the original Setup CD-ROM.
Select 'r' at the first screen to start repair"



I haven't been pestering with system files due to the fact that they make windows work. My AVG was up-to-date and laptop was virus-free before the crash and I haven't downloaded nor installed any windows update for a long time now.



Also, I have the original setup CD but nothing else happens. I press "r" at the error message screen but it just restarts the laptop and it shows the same error message. Safe mode and other modes after holding down F8, same story.



I've had this for two years now and just about a month ago, i had it reformatted. Also, after reformat, I started hearing "motor"-like sounds on the lower right-hand area (near the directional pads; refer to the link below) after I would rest my hand near that spot. It stopped after I took my hand away. But I would get a blue screen if it didn't stop making the sound.



Someone please help. What could have caused this and what can I do to fix it?



If laptop and other details would help:
Model: Toshiba Satellite M30
OS: Windows XP
Hard Drive: 46GB free / 60gb total



Sample image of the laptop: http://notebook.cz/clanky/recenze-notebo...

Fix it, meaning, XP, not the buzzing motor sound.



The CD is inserted but nothing is happening. There is no "next screen." After the Toshiba welcome logo, the error message appears

Due to some reason, system files of your OS are corrupt.
If repair does not work, just reinstall windows, do not format the drive, the corrupt files will be replaced by orignal ones,



you then have to reinstall all the software again as it will also replace the registry file.
your documents will be save.

You can try to look for the recovery file if it's there. Go to folder: Documents and Settings-&gt; &lt;your username&gt; -&gt; Application Data -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; Word. If your document is there it will have the name: autoRecovery save of &lt;name of your file&gt;. You right-click on that document and select open with -&gt; choose program -&gt; word. when the document opens you can save it as &lt;old name&gt;

Try the Undo option - Hold the Ctrl Key on your keyboard with the key Z down. If you have closed the document.. I am not quite sure if you can get the old content back.. unless if you are using a version control system.

Mac os tools for windows?



there is this software on mac, which gives roll-on options for music, pictures, movies, etc. and while you select movies, you get an option for theatrical trailers - that load instantly by connecting to the net, and thus giving you instant access to the latest movies' trailers. NOW, is it possible to get the same software installed in windows? on my laptop? if yes, how? from where?

I recommend you use opendns which can help block all porn sites w/o installing anything, you can choose many kinds of site category to block, like porn, adult, sex, etc.



Or you can use Zone Alarm firewall I remember has a similar site filter but maybe not as good as opendns

Photoshop can't be downloadded. And if it could it's most likely virused. The cheapest i've seen it is for $80. I don't use adobe though. I use paint.NET. It's a free download (just type paint.NET download in google) and download that. It's very similar to photoshop exept free!

You may try the software for free for a preset period by downloading it from the website - www.adobe.com. Upon expiration of this trial period, you will need to put in a key or serial. This serial needs to be bought from Adobe. You will be prompted to buy it from www.adobe.com once your trial period expires. However, as you would know, there are "other ways" to use the software illegally. But by doing so, you may be deprived of any support from Adobe in such a case. If you want to ensure regular support and smooth operation of the software, it's advisable to purchase the key from Adobe. Else, crack it at your risk.

The 'PS' freeware item is pretty bloated.
Many use 'Gimp' and like it a great deal.
Another full feature (includes 'layering') editor is 'Pixia' although it's a tad bit difficult to master & a bit glitchy.
Both PS alternates are freeware; Google for download sites.

So, are you on your own PC or one in a school/college/work? A Group Policy is one usually set up centrally to determine what users can/cannot do. So if that's whats happening you shouldn't try to get around it.  If you feel you want to run the program, then do as it says.



If it's just on your PC, then you can amend your own policies (if you have admin rights - see what group your user belongs to) - go to 'computer management' in control panel, and you can see and adjust the policies that are running. It might simply be that you cant run it from where it is - so moving it to another location might work.



Edit
*****
Logon as administrator, and make your normal user a member of the administrators group (in user accounts, or computer management - depends on version of Windows). Then go back to 'you' and you should be able to run it.

Whenever downloading softwares, you have to see whether they are available for free or whether there are some restriction of usage like 30 days trail period. If the software comes with a price tag, they will not work.



Apart from this you should install a good Anti-Virus programme. Some are available for free like AVG antivirus. There are good Anti-virus programmes which are not available for free like Kaspersky. They will offer free softwares for certain period like 30 days. later you have to buy it.
These require frequent upgradation like once in a week, fortnight, etc.
Please consult a computer technician too for the problems.

If you are using Windows Vista then it is possible you have a problem like this because, the software is not possibly licensed with Microsoft or that the software is being found to cause some problems like spyware or virus related or things like that.



Some times also in recent times I have found that some worms actually blocks and creates messages like the one you have described. Make sure you click and make the software compatible with the version of the windows you are using (to do this, just right-click your mouse on the icon that represents the program and select properties. In one of the Tabs you should be able to see Compatibility, select that option and make the program/software to be compatible or run on OS lower than the one you are having... That should solve the problem.



Again, if you are using Vista, you may be requested to Allow the software to run, click the allow option and you should be alright. But if all this are not working, the I will leave the problem to virus or worms possibly.



Good luck to you.

You can print many copies easily, you can make basic or drastic changes easily without the need to manually rewrite a whole section of the document. You can e-mail it to people, you can also take numerous backups instead of a single master copy.



Of course there is also the benefit of spell checking at your fingertips and the ability to manipulate the style, size and colour of the font.

Writing is rewriting.



A word processor makes it easier to rewrite. You can rearrange words, sentences, and/or paragraphs. A word processor also has a spell checker, and most have a grammar checker too. Plus formatting is much easier. Most offer various templates that already have the style you need for the paper you are writing.



You can save your work on the computer and that saves paper.

Photoshop is for raster graphics. Things like photos, made up of dots/pixels.
Illustrator is for vector graphics. Things like logos, charts/graphs, etc made up of lines and shapes defined by mathematical expressions. Vector images are resolution independent and can be scaled infinitely without any loss in quality.
Fireworks is a graphics editor that can create, but is more geared towards optimizing, graphics and interface elements for web use.



These are 3 distinct and very different market areas. Trying to "mash them all together" would make for one hell of a mess.

IBM Lotus Sametime account - what do I need to get it?



My questions is simple - do I need to download IBM Lotus Sametime to actually register a Sametime account?



I just want to make an account; Ill use it over Trillian. Sametime is payable program, and Trilian is free.



I searched all over the net, but I couldn't find anywhere answer to how the hell I can make a Sametime account.
I suppose I must download trial (or order full one) Sametime, but I, for example, dont know whethere my account is going to be solid while that trial is still goin' on, and then expire, or is it a permanent account? Also, Sametime weights around cca 500 mb. Trillian / Pidgin messanger has like 5-6 megabytes.



And, for the end, I would like to have Sametime account because few of my friends have.
I do, however, already possess AIM, MSN, YM et cetera, but I would really liek to have this one also.

Inconsistency with WinAvi converted file size?

Yet all the episodes of this series when still in rmvb format range in the 300mb yet the files i obtain when converted to AVI format range in size 500mb to recently 900mb (like episode 1 in AVI contains around 500mb of data whereas episode 10 has around 900mb), is that normal? how can i fix this problem?

with this. The following is a list of compelling advantages of Foxit Reader: Incredibly small: The download size of Foxit Reader is only 2.55 MB which is a fraction of Acrobat Reader 22 MB size. Breezing-fast: When you run Foxit Reader, it launches instantly without any delay. You are not forced to view an annoying splash window displaying company logo, author names, etc.plus its free

Question about vista: did you know this?



this is a question, but I am also trying to get the word out.



there is a way you can speed up windows Vista. A way Noone I know has ever figured out. its about visual styles. there are a number of things they put in vista to make it graphically more appealing, though they really do slow down the computer, mine sped up, and it wasn't even that slow before. here is how you do it:



1. go to the control panel.
2. in the "search" bar, type "performance"
3. go under "system" as it appears, and click on the link "adjust the appearance and performance of windows"



having a box unchecked will aid in speeding up your computer. when I initially unchecked all of the boxes, I noticed no difference in my ability to effectively communicate with the computer. If you have vista, and it is really slow, then, by all means, uncheck all boxes.



seriously,...



1. did you know that you can speed up your computer by doing this, 2. have you done this?

I have Little Snitch on my iMac and it works like a charm. In fact, the version of Little Snitch that I have I got from a torrent lol. I got Adobe CS3 Design Premium from a torrent and the FBI hasn't come knocking down my door. I already know you know that torrents are illegal, so I'll let you make your own conscious decision about what to do. But just to let you know, Little Snitch will help you out with what you're looking for. Oh and Photoshop CS4 is sick!

You only have to have a firewall that alerts you when Photoshop tries to connect somewhere. When it tries then you set a rule that it isn't allowed to ever do that again.



I have never used little snitch. if it does the same thing then great.

There are probably a bunch of other files in that folder (labelled 1.rar and 2.rar...and so on) The 911MB movie is actually in those files. Open the rar file and extract the movie and then you can watch it.

It's probably not a virus, its most likley a driver you installed which would be put on if you plugged in some new hardware which vista didnt like.



Vista 32 is good in my books now but 64Bit is very unstable...



I had problems at the beginning of the year with some hardware on 32bit but now its fixed.

I'm sure your music files will still be there somewhere on your HD, have you tried searching your computer for music files? Try searching by file extension eg; MP3 etc. Maybe try System Restore? Failing that, you can download free software from the internet to recover deleted files on your hard drive.

Definitely audacity. Just download it from th link shown in the source. Audacity is a 100% free recording and editing program. All you have to do is import the song or ringtone into audacity edit it and export as an mp3.



Hope this helped!

Computer System Restore?



I am planning on restoring my computer back to its original settings using the XP disc that came with my Toshiba Satellite but before I do that I was wondering what I need to do about some of my software programs like Microsoft Office 2007 and some anti virus software like Webroot and McAfee.  I am having a hard time finding the discs that came with these software programs and was wondering if I could make a backup of them without the cd, like on a flash drive or if I could tell the computer not to delete these programs while doing the system restore.  Also, I was wondering how long a system restore takes?  I don't want to screw anything up but my computer has so much junk on it that it needs to be reformatted.

If you have defragged lately it runs faster.



I'd think real serious about this. You'll lose everything youve installed.  Including virus scanner.  You wont lose stuff in your email inbox, or things youve posted on someone else's website.

I think that you have another piece of software running that is trying to get your attention. When that software tries to take the focus (like when it will flash on the task bar) it boot WMP out of Full Screen Mode - I have a piece of software that does this to me and so I don't run it when I am using WMP

Right-click on the file and select Properties. Click on the Advanced button. Click on "Encrypt contents to secure data". Click on OK, and then OK again.



Next, right-click on the folder in which the file is stored. Select "Sharing and Security". Check the options to secure the folder. NOTE: This will affect all files in the folder, so you may want to move the file to its own folder if you still want to share other files.

you can try Ubuntu which can detect your older software and act accordingly but there are also other more minimalist distro's, Xubuntu is ubuntu for older computers, also there are distros like Damn Small linux and mini linux which are also popular and would probably work on your older machines

Two caveats:  The BIOS firmware version must be newer than 1999, and, 256MB RAM is a bare minimum for most modern Linux Distros.



Then, Xubuntu is a good starting point.  Run in Live CD mode ONLY to test your hardware.



Do not install any Linux that isn't compatible with all your hardware.

(Assuming you are using windows)



Windows ignores a filename change unless you actually change one or more of the characters completely. Add a random character to the filename with one rename operation, and then remove it while changing the original characters to capitals with a second rename operation; this is time consuming, but works.



There are hundreds of bulk renaming utilities that will transform whole directories (and all their sub-directories) at a time. The built in move command may also do the trick.

I'm looking for Digital Photo software to organize and rename photos?



I'm not looking for editing software, and I can't remember the name of the software that I need.



A few years ago, I downloaded a software program that was "smart enough" (AI) to recognize similar photos, among thousands of image files. Also it can rename the files in batches and even change the dates on them if needed. There is so much that this software can do.



I have thousands of these photos from the past years, on dozens of DVDs and CDs, and need to put them all on one disk or two disks, without duplicate the file names or duplicate images of different names taking up space and adding confusion.



Any help or suggestions is appreciated.

I'm assuming your using a windows operating system.



insert a blank cd.  Open it from my computer.  Drag the files you want to save to the CD onto the cd.  they should appear on the cd with the same icon as normal except they'll also have a down arrow on the icon.  This means the files are waiting to be written to the CD.  There should be an option of the right that says write these files to CD.  Click it, and it will open a short wizard.  Follow the steps and it will write them to the CD.

you can use any standard image burning software like nero or just pop in a blank cd in to your writer, drag and drop your photos on to the drive and u can burn them using your windows inbuilt cd burning software. Remember cds can also get scratched, i have lost a lot of precious data because of aging cds. What u can do is a keep another back up of your photos in your mail account. just attach the images on your email and mail it to your self. Thats what i have done to keep a soft backup of all my images.

When you install vista it either automatically gets an activation code from the internet or you can get one online.  If you don't get an activation code within 30 days it stops worker.



The CD key and activation code are bound together, but neither cares about what computer its on.



If your hard drive fails an you have to reinstall windows you'll probably need to call Microsoft and tell them that is no longer on the old PC, and they will give you a new activation code.

If you have reasons for moving the installation from one computer to another (and/or aren't sure if it breaks the licence agreement) you just give Microsoft a ring and have a chat.  Most problems of that kind can be quickly sorted out on the phone at no cost except for the call and most people can call Microsoft on a number that costs no more than a standard local call.

AAC is Apple's proprietary system for encoding music files. It produces files that are more compact than mp3 files with sound quality about the same. It offers configuration so that when importing a file (say from a CD) you can choose to do the importing at lower or higher "bitrates" which will give you bigger files but higher quality.



The option you mention will convert your mp3 to an AAC file.

By far the easiest way is to copy them all onto a sheet then print the new sheet. To copy them all at once select the rows you want (2, 3, 10 300, 350) by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking the row numbers. Then click copy, go to the new sheet and click paste. Resize any columns that need it then print.

Since downloading Windows Service Pack 3 my computer fails to start about half the times  I switch on.?



The Windows loading page stays on indefinitely, and I have to switch off the computer. On restarting a black screen with white writing comes on saying there is a software or hardware problem, and if I use the use the cursor to highlight 'start from last good configuration' the startup proceeds, although at times even this procedure needs to be repeated several times. At other times, for no obvious reason, it starts normally. Any suggestions please?

the figure in cell L36 is correct but it must not repeat itself in cell L37 and L38. as i am using the formula =IF(OR(K36=30,K36&lt;30),J36,"0")



the cell numbers have been chages accordingly the part k36&lt;30 (30) indicates the number of days.



can some tell me how i can put a filter or condition where the amount in cell L36 is not repeated in L37 and L38.

not sure im understanding this correctly so if this is way off im sorry, but try doing something like:
=if((IF(OR(K37=30,K37&lt;30),J37, "0"))=L36,"",L37



something along those lines.



basically its saying if L37 is has the same value as L36, then stay blank, otherwise repeat the formula you used in the previous cell (but for the next cell over)

<answer>



first, for your info, if you want to compare a number less than or equal to something, you don't have to do an OR(xxxx, xxxx) statement. You can simply put IF(K36&lt;=30, xxxx).  So if K36 is less than, or equal, to 30, then it's true.



without seeing the formulas in each of the cells it's hard to determine the problem.  But since the column headings suggest that Col L is 1-7 days, Col M is 8-30 days and Col N is 31-90 days then each column simply needs an IF statement to determine the answer.



in Col L formula should be



IF(K36&lt;=7, J36, 0)



in Col M formula should be



IF(AND(K36&gt;=8, K36&lt;=30), J36, 0)



in Col N formula should be
IF(AND(K36&gt;=31, K36&lt;=90), J36, 0)

true, it is full of viruses but there's a trick on how to detect it. when downloading files using limewire or frostwire, "preview" it at 1% or higher. if it plays, it's a genuine mp3 file, if not then there's a very good chance it is a virus. scanning the file w/ an antivirus program like avg should verify this for you.

Most of the content available via Limewire is illegal, infested with viruses, or more easily available elsewhere.



So, the risk isn't worth it. No, it isn't safe.

It shouldn't. I recommend you visit your system manufacturers website and check for the latest drivers. A few drivers were poorly coded and caused SP1 installation to hang and fail badly, but most systems are fine and most of these drivers will be detected by the SP1 installer before it actually starts the upgrade.



Once you have it, it includes security fixes and makes Vista run a little smoother (less bugs/crashes, a little more responsive in certain apps).



Hope this helps!

Easiest sure way is to put one inside a plastic grocery bag and snap them in half if you are strong enough to do so.  The reason for the bag is that when it break it will explode little mirror like shiny pieces of metallization off the CD that will litter your carpet.
Just snap them one at a time.



One other method is to take something pointed and scratch them on the top surface.  The side with the imprinted brand name/logo etc.  Even if it has a paper label on it this will work if you scratch them deeply and in several places.



The best bet is to break them or you may have a friend that has a paper shredder that will shred them for you.  My shredder does CD's and DVD's and doesn't even pause on them.



Hope this helps.

Take a power drill and load it with one of those wire brushes.
Hold the cd with pliers and on the top side - scrape off all the shiny stuff with the drill.
Unorthodox maybe, but makes CDs unreadable.

Just breaking them in half should be sufficient. Although, I tried breaking one in half by hand and it shattered. You should just cut it in half with scissors.

ok, beware altering partitions, all data will be lost....



that said, set the PC to boot from CD (done in the bios)



hit a key when prompted and you'll be brought into the xp installation screen...



from there, follow the instructions, and when it comes to selecting where you should install, there'll be an option to press the likes of T to delete the partitions.... delete both then you can create a single, (or 2,3,4+) partitions on your black hard drive....



oh and always do a complete format, it takes about 1 1/2 hours longer, but it's worth it in the end.

You can't upload software to a blog. But you can post a link. To know why, you have to understand what a blog is. it is just a page of text with style sheets, and links. If you would like to offer others to download some programs that are already online, you may add a link. If you would like to post your own software, you would have to find a server that would host your file, and then add a link to that file. Any furthur questions? feel freee to ask and i will answer more in detail. At your service

windows movie maker isnt really good to edit try using camtasia studio 5 from the internet just google it, try and find out that is free or a 30 day trial



when u go on camtasia, click on "callouts" then there should be an option "Shape callout" click on that and choose the blur callout and then choose how big u want it to be...



there is no way on windows movie maker to blur out a specific part unless u put a picture on top of that video or something idk..

Hi - I'm not totally sure this can be done in WMM.



The acknowledged expert for windows movie maker is papajohn



If he can't answer your question then no-one can!



It must be said, though, that WMM is not the best tool out there. Apparently CNET rated it 1 star out of 5 due to stability and response issues.



However, there are numerous free editing tools for video you might want to try:-



Jahshaka
T@B ZS4
Wax
Video Spin
Vivia
Avidemux
Blender



.. to name a few



Information about these and more, and a link to papajohn can be found on my web site. Check my profile for that link

Limewire is a P2P client. I used to use it but i dont anymore. too many viruses. But there is nother p2p client called bittorent and it works very good. you can download torrent files with it. Go to sites like www.thepiratebay.org and mininova.org and you will find millions of movies to chose from, and they are all free. just download the torrent file and open it with bittorent. you my download bittorent from www.bittorent.com If you tell me whcih movie you need i can give you a link to it. you may contact me at bentam1993@yahoo.com at your service&lt;&lt;

This comes from the main site, http://www.directsoftwareconnection.com , and they look pretty shady, especially selling a $1,700 program set for $114.00.  They try to explain why they can sell so cheap, but I can't say I'd feel comfortable giving them my card payment info.

I dont think you need a special software.
but I think you have to go to your audio panel, and reduce the treble setting of your audio output.
another way is, to connect your active speaker's ground (could be the biggest part of metal in the structure) and connect it using cable to your computer's ground (metal casing). hope these help.

First of all, Photoshop CS3 costs a lot of money (try over $700), so you can't really complain that i doesn't work, when you try to download the cracked version :)



Regarding your problem - Go to Control Panel -&gt; Programs and Features and Uninstall Photoshop CS3 to make sure it's completely gone from your system. It sounds like you are trying to install multiple copies at once.



After you have done that - just install it again, it should work.

Check the control pannel&gt;Programs and Features. Look for Adome photoshop there and uninstall it.



Then run the install again. Reboot after uninstalling old version.

Well, I have Vegas 6.0, but it should be pretty similar. Click on Media Generators. If you don't see it anywhere on your screen, go to View&gt;&gt; and make sure Media Generators is checked. Then, select Text. Once you select your style, make sure you put it a layer above your pictures so it can be seen. And also make sure it is a text generator that has a transparent background (the checkered gray and white). If it isn't transparent, then you won't be able to see your pictures. Once you place the text generator a layer above your pictures, you can edit it by right clicking and selecting Edit Generated Media. You can also change the color and size as well, hopefully you'll figure it out from there!



Good luck! I hope that helped. Remember, my directions might be a little off because I have 6.0, but it should be pretty similar.

If your a student you can use that to obtain a student discount.  Downloading Windows Vista off a torrent is illegal and so are warez sites.  If you have Windows XP you could skin it to look like Vista until you can afford it.  Just google Vista skins for XP.  Remember that windows is releasing XP service pack 3, don't forget to try that before you decide you need to buy Vista.

There is nothing. You need a capture card (look them up in google). It's not software you need, its hardware. You could also buy a good video camera and record off the screen is waht i do and ud be suprised by the quality. There is also another way but is mutch harder. you need to save the clip on your 360 and download it onto your computer from 360. I'm not sure how to do it though. you'll have to research it.

Yes you can do this in different ways. You can set up the machine to dual boot. To do this you would need two disks or two partitions and you install an OS on each partition. Windows will automatically create a start up option where you choose which OS you want to boot into.



The second alternative is to install a virtual machine inside your main Windows OS (doesn't matter if it is Vista or XP) and then install your second OS into the virtual machine. With this method you would go into your main OS as normal and then when you wanted to access the other OS you just go into your VM software.



There are pros and cons to each of these so give them a try and see which suits you best - the VM route is probably the easiest to experiment with. I have given you links to a couple of free Virtual Machines below.



Incidentally you will need a legal copy of each of the Operating Systems to do this

Yes, Google up "Dual boot Vista and XP" and you'll get a large list of guides that tell you how to multi-boot your system.



I won't usually suggest the Virtual machine option, seeing that if you actually prefer using XP to Vista, you may as well install it on a seperate partition and set it to your default OS.

I doubt that any firm would still be running Office 2000 or Office XP (aka 2002). If you find one that is, run or quit!



If you can find out which version your new employer is using, get the relevant book. If not, aim high and get 2007. (It's not that different, the buttons are just grouped together in different places.)

i think the help section is enough. but it is better if you are doing something like making a payroll system, to automate calculations. you can buy a payroll form then learn how each column is being calculated. if there are charts, you can convert these into formulas/ macro programming within excel. i did this successfully by just using the help section. i didn't know a thing about programming or excel when i started. the help section is more than enough. if you buy an excel book, the contents will just be the same. it is just a good thing to know more math equations, procedures and operations where most of the programming are based.

yes there is way if i understood your question correctly. Your trying to shorten th song but quickly? when the song is in the timeline, you cant see the whole song obviously and on the right hand side of the screen where the song is there should be a little sideways triangle. hold onto that with your mouse and pull it left and it should shorten it instantly



EDIT: you can also maybe use the zoom out button to see the whole song and then drag it so it will go faster.



Hope this helped

to me the best is still windows, bec more people in the world use it than the others combined. and now we are currently stuck with xp, which will be supported by microsoft until 2014. but don't worry if you don't want vista, windows 7 will be released mid next year. unless microsoft changed its mind again.

Your video player can't play the file format... You can either download a codec pack that allows you to play the format, or you can find a player for it eg. realplayer for rmvb (which it may be). Right click and go 'properties' to see what format the video is.

you could either use Access or break the spreadsheet into more than one and import into multiple worksheets within Excel, you can still run calculations over multiple worksheets then

You can't.  The Sims 2 isn't DirectX10.  Even assuming you could run it in DirectX10, it's not set up to take advantage of any of the added features so there would be absolutely no difference.  You'll just have to run it in DirectX9.

The difference between the two is that a codec pack will simply allow you to play your files in *any* video player you like, and VLC is a *specific* player who can play almost any video.
If you want to use windows media player you will need the codec pack. If you want to use the VLC player alone, use VLC. Neither of them will slow your PC down as codecs are not running without playing a video, and VLC doesn't run without manual running it.

first of all I like to tell you that VLC is a Player where as K-lite is a codec Pack.



&gt;&gt;&gt;
CODEC (compressor/decompressor)



(Computers) technology used to compress and decompress computer data (such as sound or video files, etc.)



AND



WMP is just a player... which wont support to all kind of files...



Other than WMP you hv to keep VLC also...



Use VLC Player. Its really awesome... It looks very tiny... but it is a very powerful software...



&gt;&gt; this is the direct link:



http://download.softpedia.com/dl/d83ddf9...



SO FOR YOUR BETTER CONVENIENCE YOU SHOULD KEEP ALL THE THREE (K-LITE,WMP,VLAN)

Which version of Vista is the fastest?



Hello,



I've got a toshiba laptop that downright refuses to take Windows XP. I've been able to put drivers on it, but it blue screens randomly, and is very frustrating. So, I've decided to now put Vista back on it (the reason I formatted it in the first place).



My question is, which version of Vista (i.e. Basic, Home Premium, Ultimate), will be the most efficient? The laptop is a celeron 1.8 with 2 gigs of ram (it will be slow, I know.)



Thanks for the help,

V Ultimate only....



If you use the same computer at home and for your daily work, Windows Vista Ultimate is an excellent choice. You can smoothly shift between the things you want to do and the things you need to do. For fun, you'll love the extensive options you get for music, images, live and recorded TV, and online entertainment. For work, you'll find improved document sharing and networking support. If your PC is a laptop, you'll appreciate how easily you can manage and extend your battery life. And you'll get the most advanced, layered security protection of any Windows release yet.
Easier
See what you're doing, find what you need
The first things you'll notice about Windows Vista Ultimate are its elegant looks and how it helps you with essential tasks. It's easier to work with and visualize your information with Windows Aero. You can conveniently arrange and manage your open windows using Windows Flip and Flip 3D. And you won't have to click to see your content because live taskbar thumbnails reveal it.



Windows Aero helps you quickly locate the window you need.
Every day you have to hit the ground running at full speed. Now, with Instant Search, you have a faster way to find whatever you need on your PC, on your network, or on the Internet. Whether you're looking for an e-mail from a colleague, a picture of your mom, a spreadsheet from last quarter, or the website for your kid's homework, you only need to start typing in the Search box on the Start menu.



As soon as you start typing, Instant Search begins showing results containing the letters you've entered.
It's easier and faster to find anything, no matter where you may have saved it, with the consistent, streamlined menus, toolbars, and preview panes in the improved Explorers in Windows Vista. Explorers include Search boxes too, so you can search within a particular type of information, such as all your documents.



Explorers include Search boxes so you can find what you need fast.
You can organize your files any way that you want and immediately sort and filter information based on file type, saved date, or the name of the file creator. Watch this demo to see how Windows Vista helps you find and organize information.
Back up without fuss, roll back file changes
If you've used a PC for long, chances are good that you know the sick feeling you get in your stomach after you've accidentally deleted a picture or a document you spent hours writing. And you know you can avoid that feeling by routinely backing up your files. But you can find yourself procrastinating because it seems like it will take a lot of time and trouble.
Now you can avoid the procrastination because you can easily use the Windows Backup and Restore Center. If you want to back up just your files and data, you can choose Automatic Backup. Or you can choose Windows Complete PC Backup and Restore, which can get your entire PC back to normal in one easy step if you experience a catastrophic hardware failure.



The Backup and Restore Center makes this essential task simple to do.
What do you do if you've made a lot of changes to a document and realize you want to go back to a previous version? In the past, you had only the version you'd most recently saved. Now, Shadow Copy automatically creates and archives copies of your files as you work on them. So if you accidentally saved over a document or a document becomes corrupted, you can easily retrieve any previous version of that file.
Use multiple languages
Windows Vista Ultimate is available in 35 languages—simultaneously. If you have a multilingual household or are learning a new language, you can install as many languages as you want and even switch between them as easily as logging off and back on again. And if your family shares a single PC, each family member can use his or her preferred language to interact with the PC.
Easily fax and scan
Once in a while you might need to send or receive a fax or scan a document or image. You have flexible, integrated faxing and scanning capabilities in one convenient location with Windows Fax and Scan. For faxing, you don't need a fax machine. And if you have a locally connected or network-connected scanner, you can scan documents and images with a single click.



Create, send, and receive faxes, documents, and images from one spot.
Enjoy easier setup and simplified maintenance
If being an IT support person isn't your idea of fun, you can relax. For one thing, you can get up and running fast using Windows Easy Transfer to automatically copy your files, photos, music, e-mail, and settings from your old PC to your new Windows Vista–based PC.
After your computer is set up, you will be pleased that system disruptions are kept to a minimum with little or no effort on your part. Built-in diagnostics alert you to disk failure, defective memory, and other potential issues so they can be resolved before affecting your everyday tasks.

1. Navigate to "Start-&gt; Programs-&gt; Accessories-&gt; System Tools" and click
on "Task Scheduler"



2. When the task folder appears, delete any entry that starts with



"Webreg" (i.e. "Webreg 20031218075500" or similar)



The above steps should clear out all reminders.



Also, if you open HP Software update you can deselect to do updates as opposed to removing it.

Did you buy a FULL version of OFFICE or just an upgrade?  If just an upgrade you needed to leave the trial version on the machine to get the upgrade installed.  IF the full version then try reinstalling.

The one you bought is the full package so you need to uninstalled the trial version first or use it until it runs out before installing the full package that you bought and then remove it when it runs out. That is why you get a message saying it doesn't match. They may be both office 07 versions but they are two different packages. One is trial and the other one you bought is the full package.



I know this may seem a minor thing but to a computer it is different.

even though nowadays sw are overbloated, likely they don't need the whole code at the same time. so the "code" is splitted into pieces. according to what funcs you are using, these pieces are in memory or not. keeping the interface and input waiting (it is all word does 80% of its time) is not so memory consuming.
anyway, if the memory space is really too few, no matter if it exists the f*cked virtual mem, the loader of the OS will refuse to load it.
the usability of programs in such a low-mem situation is another fact

The only method provided by Windows to reset your password is to use a Password Reset Disk. Windows typically bugs you to create a Password Reset Disk when you first create the password-protected account so that you can recover your data. Unfortunately, if you don't have a Password Reset Disk, the only option available is to reinstall your copy of Windows, which will likely result in a loss of data.



I hope this helps!

boot it up in safe mode (this makes you become an administrator) go into the "change profiles and password" section in the control panel.  Then change your password for your account and log on to yours! to go into safemode i think its F8 when the computers booting up.



If that doesnt work use this



Place your Windows XP CD in your cd-rom and start your computer (it’s assumed here that your XP CD is bootable – as it should be - and that you have your bios set to boot from CD)



Keep your eye on the screen messages for booting to your CD Typically, it will be “Press any key to boot from CD”



Once you get in, the first screen will indicate that Setup is inspecting your system and loading files.



When you get to the Welcome to Setup screen, press ENTER to Setup Windows now



The Licensing Agreement comes next - Press F8 to accept it.



The next screen is the Setup screen which gives you the option to do a Repair.
It should read something like “If one of the following Windows XP installations is damaged, Setup can try to repair it”
Use the up and down arrow keys to select your XP installation (if you only have one, it should already be selected) and press R to begin the Repair process.



Let the Repair run. Setup will now check your disks and then start copying files which can take several minutes.



Shortly after the Copying Files stage, you will be required to reboot. (this will happen automatically – you will see a progress bar stating “Your computer will reboot in 15 seconds”



During the reboot, do not make the mistake of “pressing any key” to boot from the CD again! Setup will resume automatically with the standard billboard screens and you will notice Installing Windows is highlighted.



Keep your eye on the lower left hand side of the screen and when you see the Installing Devices progress bar, press SHIFT + F10. This is the security hole! A command console will now open up giving you the potential for wide access to your system.



At the prompt, type NUSRMGR.CPL and press Enter. Voila! You have just gained graphical access to your User Accounts in the Control Panel.



Now simply pick the account you need to change and remove or change your password as you prefer. If you want to log on without having to enter your new password, you can type control userpasswords2 at the prompt and choose to log on without being asked for password. After you’ve made your changes close the windows, exit the command box and continue on with the Repair (have your Product key handy).



Once the Repair is done, you will be able to log on with your new password (or without a password if you chose not to use one or if you chose not to be asked for a password). Your programs and personalized settings should remain intact.



Hope this helped!

yes, there is how. Open your photos in the photoshop again. Click



Save as in the file menu. When the directory where you want to save



them opens, below there will be File name field. It will be filled



with the name of your file - you can keep it, unless you want to



rename it. Below the name field there will be format field. Click it.



There will be a drop down menu, with the list of file formats. Select



the one you want - if these are photos, you will probably want JPG,



the most popular image format. Click save. A window will appear,



asking you if you want to save it anyway, because it will "lose the



format". Say yes - your photos will be fine, it just means that some



of the photoshop properties will be lost, it's nothing. Click save



again. Go to the directory where you saved your files, and open them



as images, without photoshop.

Open the images in photoshop, go to "File" -&gt; "Save As..." and choose a format like png or jpeg/jpg or bmp, definitely NOT psd. Photoshop probably saved your images in psd format. If it didn't do that then you probably set photoshop to open every kind of picture (or it set it itself).

Did you save them in the native photoshop format (they will have a .psd at the end of them) or as jpegs (with a .jpg at the end of them)? If it's the former, you'll need to convert them to jpegs.



Alternately, your computer may be set to open them in photoshop by default. If this is the case, and if you're using a pc, open up the folder in my computer and then right click on the individual pictures. A menu will open up with a selection of different programs you can use to open the picture.



One of the options may be a picture gallery - use that to view them as pictures without opening them in photoshop.

Software problem with LG E500 notebook: Bluetooth?



I've recently bought myself a new notebook computer, LG E500.



I want to use the Bluetooth connection for my cellphone (Nokia 6300).
I installed the driver for Bluesoleil and the small icon appeared to the right on the task bar. Now, when I click on "Turn Bluetooth on" it just says that bluetooth-software wasn't found...wtf! I just checked the files for the BT drivers and even though I'm not a computer-genius, it seems like the install-files is not supported by the OS (that is Windows Vista home premium)...
Is it possible that this would wok if I install XP as a second OS? Or is there another way around?
In the product description of the notebook at the webshop, it says that BT is optional an may not be installed on every notebook: how can I find out if there's installed a bluetooth-receiver/antenna in my pc??



Sorry if I seem confused -I really am! Hope some of you smart guys can help me solve this one ;)



Thanks!

There is usually a warning light which illuminates when an internal Bluetooth card is active, but doesn't for an external device.  Also, in Windows XP at least, there is a Bluetooth icon in the Control Panel if an internal card is present.  However, if you contact the LG Service Desk or the place where you purchased it from, they should be able to confirm if your machine had one installed during the build.



If there isn't a card installed, you can buy a USB Bluetooth device for about £15 / $25 which is generally cheaper than an internal card and that will come with its own drivers.



Also, as you probably know, you have to activate Bluetooth in your phone before it can be detected by the computer.



Hope this helps

What's the best anti-virus out there?



With less memory usage and lite weight, also the strongest virus fighter. So I can play games or do something without being interrupted. I know there are many anti-virus software that claims that its the best one. But all that I try is kinda heavy and use lots of memory. Recommends me something that will put my head into it.

Ok you NEVER want to go for the popular ones like norton because hackers (people that send you viruses and spyware) are most likely to try and get through the ones most peopl use. The best free one is definitely AVG but hackers also breakthrough anti virus protection on that. NOD32 in my opinion is best. It's not that popular and it's got some good features.

Microsoft Word 2007 Exits List Formatting When I Press Enter?



I'm trying to create a multi-level list in Microsoft Word 2007, which I wouldn't think would be too hard. I go to the Home tab, and click on the multi-level list button, and my first line starts with the bulleted "I" like it's supposed to. However, whenever I hit Enter it exits the list and resets all fonts/formatting I've done. If I press the list button again it shows the next bullet of "II", but as soon as I press Enter it exits the list again.



How can I fix this?

You can't compare the two because they are different.  Torrent is the file extension and it tells the application (which is the utorrent) where to download the file.  Utorrent is the application used for downloading and sharing the torrent.

What operating system are you using?
if you are on windows look for a bluetooth software in your start menu a window will pop up look for an option to "add a device", "look for a device" or "pair a device" and also make sure you have turned on bluetooth on your PC as well as on your phone.

if u have a bluetooth adapter on ur pc, then just switch ur bluetooth on,on both ur pc and phone and then sync ur phone wud ur pc by searching devices on ur phone (should be under bluetooth settings) then just click on the items u wanna send to ur pc 4rm ur phone normally like how u would send from 1 phone 2 another.



PS : when synchronizing the phone wud pc, it might ask u for a code. u can make up watever code u like. but most ppl just use 1 or 0. its easy 2 rem.
Hope this helped

depends on what phone you have and what program the pc is using for bluetooth.. but for the most part its pretty easy,



1st. activate bluetooth on both pc and phone
2nd. find picture you want to send, click send, via bluetooth



the phone will then search devices from your phone
-- at this point you should see the pc name on your phone
3rd, connect them.. ( it might ask for you to set a password.. just put like a four digit caracter you will remember, like 1111 or 0000)



it should start sending after that..



if phone doesnt have option to send it via bluetooth then you might not be able to do it at all and a usb cord would really come in handy

Use usb cable for data transfer.
Or use card readers if you have a memmory card and reader.
You can use bluetooth which is much slower than above methods only if you dont have the facilities.
Try in the sameway as you receive photos from computer to send them back.
Make your P.C bluetooth settings as discoverable for other devices.

I use Yahoo Mail, Gmail (both very good) AND Hotmail as a "throw away".



I've found that Yahoo Mail has better SPAM filtering, so that is my personal recommendation.  To start fresh with Yahoo, just create a new account.  Remember to Export all your Yahoo Contacts FIRST.



TIP:  Use your Yahoo Mail for Friends & Family, and Gmail for everything else, except:  Use Hotmail if you  don't trust a website that demands your Email address.

Yahoo and gmail are best email services.
Better select Gmail... Because we can login to different useful applications of google using the same id..
and gmail provide super security.
They are having IMAP and POP3 enabled for free of cost.
In yahoo they are not free.

There are many types of Audio files.



Wma, Mp3, RM, Flac.



Media players need to know how this file is made and how to play it.



These bits are called Codecs which gives the player the info.



VLC as said should ply it but if that fails you need to post the file extension for better help.



.Mp3, .Wav. .ra ???

Double check that you have enough memory free when you start the program Press ctrl+alt+del and go to performance and it should say available physical memory. If you don't have over 800Mbs free then it may throw the error.



You should need alot to install something like that, for safety reasons because if it runs out, it can crash the installer thus rendering your computer useless.

My iTunes programme all of a sudden has Chinese or similar language/writing, how do I change this?



Not sure what went wrong, but one minute my itunes on my laptop (PC) was in English, the next minute it is in some Far East language. I don't know what buttons to click etc now. How did this happen and how can I change it? I run Norton for protection on my computer. All other programmes on my computer are running as normal, in English. Do I need to uninstall itunes and start again, if so, how do I safely uninstall without loosing my songs? Sorry for the long question!

Best I can assume from your lack of information that it is an unrecognized file format. Such as you cannot run a .exe file from a Mac OS so it'd give that error. That may be specific to the file that your brother downloaded..

you probably are running out of memory on your computer. go to your control panel and click unistall programs. if you have any programs, music downloads, game downloads, etc that you really don't use or want anymore, unistall it off of your computer, and that will definitely clear up some space...



if you basically want to keep most of the stuff on your computer, then consider going to a computer store and buy more memory for your computer.

<answer>



Firstly, You should usually re-install Windows every year or so in order to keep the PC running efficiently. Obviously make sure that you have all your data backed up, and choose to repair install for Windows, not REFORMAT, or else you will lose all data. You should have recieved a manufacturer recovery disc when you purchased the machine.



If you don't wish to do this, it could be that you have lots of spyware or a virus on your machine. Make sure that you run a virus/spyware check with your current antivirus software.



Refrain from using CPU hungry virus programs like Norton & Kaspersky. All be it good programs, they make your machine ridiculously slow.



As mentioned by another user. Try disk defragmentor, this should run for a while and make your computer run more efficiently. Start --&gt; All programs --&gt; Accessories --&gt; System Tools.



The last thing i can think of is the possibility that you may have a faulty fan. If this is damaged in anyway, and your machine is still under warranty, then its worth getting this checked out. Only as a last resort though, ensure you do everything else mentioned first.



Hope this is of some help.

My Operating system Cannot Be Validated & I Dont Have an Activation Code?



Hi



My computer has a message that keeps coming up as from this morning saying that My Operating system (Windows Vista) cannot be activated and asks me to enter my validation code.



This would not be a problem except for the fact that i have an Acer laptop and Vista was already built in, the only disc's i have are the recovery ones i made when i first had it and a disc called Windows Vista Anytime Upgrade, which i dont think is a full version of Vista, none of these have an activation code and i caqnt think what to do next? do i need to contact Acer and get them to send me an activation code? Thanks

Can only access Vista through BIOS?



Hi, I know nothing about computers.
When I turn on my laptop all I get is flashing line unless I first press the key for BIOS and cancel through there to go to loading. It has me select from the cd dvd drive/ usb drive, and another one that sends me where I need to go when I choose it. The laptop is fine otherwise. I was wondering how I can skip this. Thanks :)



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



When you go into BIOS, look for the boot order.  Make sure your Hard Drive is listed as the first boot item.



Also, If you have a CD in the drive, you might want to take it out.  It can sometimes cause a hang up at boot.



Finally, if you have anything connected via USB, try disconnecting it before booting.  Sometimes that will hang your computer also.



Good Luck.

100Mbps is the speed of your PC's connection to your modem/router. The speed of your modem to your ISP is completely different, it's whatever your ISP charges you for. As well as a bunch of other factors, like what speed the server is uploading at.
If you want faster internet, you should pay your ISP for a faster connection.

the only way you can really improve speed is to find healthy torrents with lots of seeds.



also, with programs such as bitlord, download speed is directly linked to upload max speed. if you allow faster uploads, you should have faster downloads

The speed indicated might not be your true speed.Check up with ur internet service provider to see what scheme is yours and try internet download manager.its better and utorrent does not specialize in increasing internet speed.100.0 mbps is not at all the true speed.It just shows the maximum speed ur LAN card can handle.Virus check your Comp.un-install utorrent.

Internet Explorer 7 has broken my Vista!?



I tried to install Internet Explorer 7 on my computer, i have windows vista.  It all installed ok, and told me I should restart my computer, which I did.  When windows opened back up again, a little box appeared in the top left hand corner which just says "Setting up personalized settings for Internet Explorer".  I waited and waited but nothing happened - i opened task manager and ended 'Personalized Settings' and restarted my computer but everytime windows opens it just stays there.  This wouldn't be so bad but nothing else is starting, i have no desktop shortcuts or a task bar with start menu, can anyone help?

You can't convert an image to a worksheet.
Best you can do is import the image into an excel worksheet.
To do that you go to Insert&gt;Image&gt;from file and locate your jpeg.



Good luck.

I don't think the people above know what .fla is. the FLA format is the format used by Flash. You can't convert it to anything. You need to compile the FLA by opening the FLA with Flash and then pressing Ctrl Enter. Then you can go back to where the FLA was saved and there should be an SWF file with the same name as the FLA. This is the file you can convert.

You probably accidentally hit the shortcut keys for screen rotation. By default on Intel graphics, it's CTRL + ALT + Up to return to normal. If that doesn't work, go to your graphics control in Control Panel and change the rotation back to normal that way.

Lg U8138 phone connection error?



I'm using an old LG U8138 phone which has full memory and can't save anything else onto it. So i decided to transfer it onto my computer but it doesn't want to connect! I've looked everywhere for a usb driver and such but can't find anything and 3 and LG both want me to give away details about my phone which i'd rather not.



When i use the phone manager and try to connect clicking the button on the top left hand corner of the window it comes up with this error:



"Fail to connect to mobile handset, Please check the COM port and connect in idle screen"



Naturally i have no idea what its on about and need a little help.

That's because Vista is crap... Do you use Dragon Speech? If you do you need to go to their website, download and re-install the VISTA compatible pack.



Either that, or re-install your voice recognition point in the installation.

How to install icon pack in windows xp?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Windows  XP not only support changing icons for shortcuts and file associations but they allow changing the system icons as well. This is accomplished from the Effects dialog box available in the Display settings of Control Panel.



To view your new icons, run Windows Explorer and open your icon folder. If you have a collection of individual icon files (ending in .ICO), you will see the icons displayed for you in the Explorer's window. If necessary, select Large Icons from the View menu to properly see them.



To view the icons stored in a .DLL collection of icons, you will need to take the same steps you would normally take to actually change the icon of any shortcut.

Internet Explorer is dangerous because it uses Active X controls.  Active X can be used to infect Windows.

you really can't have a open source os that will run windows games nativly, but if you have any linux distro, i recogmend ubuntu. you can download whats called wine which is also free to run windows games in. it's not a 100% and there is other programs out there to help you but some you have to pay for but those work a lot better. and do some reasearch for the games that he wants to play a lot of people could have already gotten it to work. and some games even have a "linux client" that helps port the game to run in linux. good luck

Most popular Linux Distros, like Linux Mint for example, can run many Windows games in "Windows Emulation Mode" using a free program called WINE.



More info at:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winehq

the long answer above is close but wine is not too clever for games
Cedega is better (actually derived of wine)

Ubuntu is perhaps the best os but it is the software you use withit to port the games that is important



There is also crossover games
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossOver



there are tons of good sites that tell you (her) exactly which games run best etc



Tell her to go for it or consider dual-booting for now if she is unsure. We want Linux users to remain users. Tell her to kick the windows habit. She will need help and support from her friends but she can do it!! lol

I dont think you can change the date on a document after you have save the file.  The file will still be the same but the date will change according the the last save of the file.

if all you want to do is change the date, set your computer clock to the relevent date and resave the file.



If you want to recover the older file, prior to modifications, you'll have to look for word backups - they're usually hidden, and called wrl~somethingorother.

Did you download or not?



Did the bet forbid you to even browse porn?



If the answer to both the above is "no", then you have not lost the bet.



Often, when bets are made in fun, people don't go into a lot of discussion about what specifics are and are not allowed.  He may have understood the bet to be that you wouldn't have anything to do with porn for a month while you understood it to mean that you could watch 24/7 so long as you didn't actually download anything.



Watching streaming video IS considered downloading even though the data is in a temporary file which you probably can't retrieve.  You are still downloading the data to make the video play.



So, I'd say chances are pretty good that you've lost the bet.

Can someone tell me what software that is free can help me recover deleted photos?



I was having some trouble with my computer and I decided to do a system recovery and I didn't even think about transfering my photos to a memory stick because I used the option where it saved a backup and I thought it would include my photos and documents but in my backup folder there was nothing there. I need to know if I can get my photos back?

simply type this code in at the end of a url. its very fast and easy.



so if you are on youtube and watching a vid, go to the adress bar and type this code in right at the end .::



&fmt=18



some videos might be too rubbish and this code might not doo much but try it on a few videos you'll see the difference.

Problem with recording audio with camstudio.  PLEASE HELP?



I asked this and no one answered me.



I have camstudio 2.0. I tried to set my audio to microphone then I tried speakers then I tried to adjust the settings to my sound card. No matter what I do, the software records what audio is being picked up by my webcam and anything that goes on around me is recording. I want to record audio from a video streaming on my desktop. How do I get camstudio to do that? I tried both microphone and speakers.

I cant seem to find this feature in Mac Word 2004. I have used this feature in multiple versions of MS Office, so I this is not a new feature.

Not really.  I have legit copies of windows.  I use linux because:



1) I am A LOT less exposed to malware.
2) more stable
3) I found Vista to be downright annoying
4) I am genuinely starting to prefer the way things are done in my linux distribution of choice (linx mint, which is a fork of ubuntu)



I find myself being able to do easily anything I could do in windows with exception of a few selected software specific functions.  Otherwise I would never boot into windows.

I'm lazy so i'm just going to paste something i said elsewhere. The only thing that's different in your case is that i'm guessing drive d is a partition on the same drive as C. You didn't need to make a new partition in windows, but it's easier that way because you know exactly what's gonna get wiped out.



Here's a recycled answer:



Ubuntu's differentiator is
1. it comes in a zillion languages
2. it's easy to use
3. it tends to 'just work'.
4. installing software is easier (in my experience) than anything else. its package manager, synaptic, allows you to search up what you want, select a batch of programs, and download and install them all automatically. All in one place. What's more, you can upgrade all the software you have, including the linux kernel, at once, with a few clicks.



You can keep XP. What you want to do is to resize your xp partition to make room, or install linux on another drive. You need 15 gigs free, tops. 10's fine. 1 gig for 'swap'.



To do this, first defrag your disk to get all the data on one side. The resizer will just chop off the last few gigs no matter what's on there, so margin of error is good.



Then you can just resize your xp partition as part of the ubuntu install, it will detect your windows install and give you the choice of what operating system you want to use at boot.



If your computer's fast and comes with a nvidia card and you like eye candy, there's a package called compiz-fusion you may want to look at.



If your computer's not fast and a bit old, you may want to try xubuntu or an older version of ubuntu (6.06 preferably) so it doesnt run so slow. Ubuntu's competitive with vista in more ways than one, if you know what i'm sayin'.



Ubuntu comes with an interface called GNOME. It's pretty simple, not very configurable. It may sound wierd to a windows user, but you can change that window manager out for something else. An alternative is KDE, which is slightly more similar to windows, except it is extremely customizable.

First off, if you choose to install Ubuntu on the secondary partition, it will erase any files on there during the install.
Second, yes Ubuntu is easy to use. To be honest, the only things I've found I can't do on Ubuntu are watch DVDs and play Windows Games (even with WINE).
I cannot recommend any other free OS which is as good for a new user as Ubuntu.
Here's how the installation will begin: Insert the installation disc, reboot the PC, and it will auto start the installation process from there,

Never heard of it.  Some kind of security software that probably has an access code that changes every second or two.  No way to get through that without the proper Equipment to give you the codes.



Just my guess.

How do I find my Windows Vista Key?



I know I used to have a program to find all my serial numbers off my pc but can't seem to find it again. Please note i'm NOT asking for a serial number, just how to find it. After moving across country a bazillion times with the Navy I've managed to misplace my cd, so I'm planning to use my husbands cd but I still need my personal serial number. If you know where on the system I can find this information on Vista or a compatible program to find it, please reply.

Is there software available better than ms paint?



I'm looking for software similar to ms paint but better. I remember a while ago one of my relatives had a really old computer with image editing better than paint because airbrush had a fade effect rather than the spackling effect paint has. It would be nice if it's free to. Any suggestions?

no you cant.  downloading torrents is not like regular downloading.  you need a torrent client to download torrents.  think of it like this.  when you download a regular file you get one large file from one large server.  when you download from bit torrent you are downloading from other peoples computers so you get lots of small files from many different computers.  hope this helps : )

Window close effects?



I'm not quite sure how to explain this.  Many of us have heard of the free OS, Ubuntu, and the application to go with it: Compiz/ Compiz fusion.  Not only can it give you a "3D desktop cube" effect, but it can give you some pretty neat effects for when you close a window.  Like fire, rainbow sparks, etc.  I know there's some app. out there that lets me get the 3D cube for Windows XP, but I was wondering if there was any way to get some similar colorful "window closing" effects for XP too.

Norton is better, but if you've got limited ram you may want to use Avast. Avast uses far less ram.



I use Avast, simply because I hate that most Anti-virus programs use around 10% of my cpu's ram. With that, I've never had any issues with Viruses. I don't know if that's because I've been lucky or Avast is working -so take that however you want.



If you visit a large number of "enjoyable" sites, or bootleg sites, I'd go with a more powerful protector though.

Norton is very good but a very heavy program which will slow your pc down if you have low specs!



Avast is also very good and i have used before fine!



Remember to only use one at a time, but if i had to choose, i would keep Avast out of the two you mentioned...



Here are other free Anti Virus programs that are free and also good you may want to look at including reviews.

You may be able to drag them, but a suggested way is to use the Preset manager and save all those things that you want to transfer into a separate folder. You can create your own groups of brushes, filters, etc. Then when you want to load them into CS4, you would just point to the appropriate folder.

One of several things might have happened:



1) You may have accidentally put the screen in Full Screen mode.  Try pressing the F11 key to fix this.



2) The taskbar may be hiding.



1.	Look for a thin line on one edge of the screen.



2.	Click on it.  The Taskbar should open up.
3.	Right click in the Taskbar and select Properties.
4.	Uncheck the Auto-Hide the Taskbar menu item.
5.	Click OK.



3) The taskbar may have shrunk or moved to another edge of the screen.  To fix this:



1.	Look for a thin line on one edge of the screen.



2.	Right click in the thin line.
3.	Drag it towards the center of the screen to make it big again.
4.	If it's not on the bottom of the screen, drag and drop it back to the bottom of the screen.
5.	Right click in the taskbar, and select Properties.
6.	Check the Lock The Taskbar item.
7.	Uncheck the Auto-Hide the Taskbar menu item.
8.	Click OK.



If none of these help, then the process that runs the desktop, explorer.exe, has probably died.  You can do this to get it back:



1.	Press the CTRL, ALT and DEL keys at the same time.
2.	If you’re running Windows Vista, click Start Task Manager.
3.	Task manager should open up.  Click the File-&gt;New Task (Run) menu item.
4.	In the text box, enter



explorer.exe



5.	Click OK.
6.	Close Task Manager by clicking the X in the upper right corner or by the File-&gt;Exit Task Manager menu item.  There is no button to close it.



Hope that helps.

This is typical.  Virus creators don't want the source of their virus uninstalled.



The program's files may be in  a folder, something like:



C:\Program Files\Ovulation\



If My Computer or Windows Explorer has an Address Bar, you can copy and paste that line into it, to delete the folder of the program that won't uninstall.



After that, I recommend cleaning your Windows Registry, using software designed for that purpose.  I have had good service using Registry Cleaners from EasyDesk Software.  They provide a 10-day trial version, which is more than enough time to repair your Registry.

I am trying to install XP Media Centre onto a pc but I am being asked for files from XP Pro SP2?



I have installed everything successfully, starting from a format, but during installation I am asked for files from the 'XP Professional Service Pack 2' disc. I do not have this disc but I know you can download XP Pro SP2 from Microsoft.
I have tried this but it is an .exe file so the install will not accept it, even if I make the SP2 into a bootable disc.
If I cancel the option for the SP2 files during install, the install when finished, does not work correctly as obvious files are missing - such as internet files.
Am I being stupid here or is there someway around it?

I assume you have a Dell.  The hidden partition is about 50 megabytes in size and only contains HD diagnostic utilities.  Anyway, you do indeed have 250GBs of HD space... in decimal.  It just shows up as 232GBs in binary (which is what computers run at).  If you look at the actual number of bytes on your hard drive, it's something around 250x10^9 bytes.  However, you have to look at how memory is stored on a computer.  1 kilobyte is 1024bytes (not 1000).  1 Megabyte is 1024 kilobytes.  1 gibabyte is 1024 megabytes.  So if you take your 250x10^9 bytes and divide it by 1024^3, you get 232GBs.

No, that is correct. Your hard drive has 250,000,000,000 bytes
Which humans count as 250 Giga (billion) bytes



Your computer however counts by binary Gigabytes
1 GB = 1024 MB and 1 MB = 1024 KB and 1 KB = 1024 bytes
So 1 GB to the computer is not 1 billion bytes, but 1,073,741,824 bytes



232.83 * 1,073,741,824 = 250,000,000,000 bytes, so what we call 250 GB the computer calls 232.83 GB = its the same number of bytes.



This is all explained in the fine print in your owner's manual.

(Don't listen to the answerers who say it's 'lost to formatting' or 'there's another partition with the 18 GB in it' - they are just wrong)

There is a small portion of the computer that is in 'setback' mode and I think it is for shutdowns, overloads, etc. I think it said that it was Something a service worker needs when you have a crash.
Wish I could be more technical.
Best wishes.

This is true with all hard drives. It is caused by the difference in number systems. When a hard drive is advertised as 250GB, it is assuming 1GB=1000MB. In reality, computers use the binary number system, where 1GB=1024MB.

hi james b, i have to laugh at the other responces to your question although some of them are close. now please listen to me james what you have is three petition. now when you set up your computer everyone setup their computer different so like i set my computer up for raid setup now what is raid other then a bug spray? good question raid setup is like for instance you use all of your room on your hard drive it will automaticly overlap to the other petition. so tell you what to do my friend place your windows diskett in you dvd driver when you see your windows logo start tapping f12 boot from usb cdrom your number one petition is your main petition number two petiton is your raid petition and number three delete it you don't need it. good luck hope i was helpful to you



Source(s):



be careful not to delete your number one or number two petition this is raid but make sure your delete number three what happened is while you were downloading something it automaticly downloaded another petition which is number three. but a little secret i will never run out of space on my number one petition so when you notice youir hard drive is 250 gb but shows 232 gb you petition is devided which nothing to worry about

What is the best tv tuner program...?



i use windows media center and i love the quality and just everything....except for one thing



i want to use my tv tuner card's composite parts to play my xbox 360,wii, and others. but the problem with windows media center is that when you hook things up to the composite it has a 2-3 second delay so i really cant play....so i was wondering what would be a good program to be able to play on.

i write deathmetal music myself...



i use fruityloops to make the drums, but i use my own drum recordings (individual acoustic drums i sampled and processed myself and i actually have to screw with the bar/beat settings to give more space per beat for death metal as the drums are generally really fast, with my bar/beat settings, i track the drums at like 700bpm).  The idea here is to make them sound like natural drums being played by a real drummer...



i record using logic on a mac or protools and audition (cooledit) on pc.



i mix all these things in either protools or audition.  I actually prefer audition because i can do real mastering, editing, and postproduction there, not just simple bounces with hit-or-miss effects and processing like in protools.

i record live instead of tracking whenever i can...but the neighbors dont always like this method.

If you want to create a death metal / heavy metal song, why waste your money on music making software.  First of all it isn't music it is noise and you could just buy some pots and pans and slam them together and create something I am sure someone will find beautiful.

Microsoft Word 2003 question?



Grrr. If i wasn't so impatient I could probably fix it on my own, but I am impatient, so I'm asking you. When I type a quotation mark followed by a vowel ("A, "E, "I, "O, "U, and their lowercase counterparts) Word automatically turns them into Ä, Ë, Ï, Ö, Ü, and their lowercase counterparts. How can I stop it? It's extremely annoying.



</question>



<additional details>



I'm putting quotes in front of them because I'm typing a quotation....(duh) As in "All your base are belong to us." Word would make that into Äll your base (blah blah blah). And it's not in autocorrect, I already tried that.

Try checking under 'Tools' &gt; AutoCorrect Options. There may be a setting there that you can turn off, or a list of 'autocorrections' there you can delete those from.



Also, remember: "Whenever AutoCorrect makes an unwanted correction, you can undo the correction by pressing CTRL+Z. If you select the Automatically add words to list check box in the AutoCorrect Exceptions dialog box, the unwanted corrections that you undo are added to the list of exceptions. " (from their HELP section).

Probably you change your keyboard layout to an international layout, example from "US keyboard layout" to "US INTERNATIONAL keyboard layout".



The layout controls which characters appear on the screen when you press the keys on your keyboard. An international keyboard layout makes it easy to type specials characters, where only two keystrokes are required. Example: ú = ' + u



ñ = ~ + n



ü = " + u



To change your layout (assuming Windows XP) :
1.- Click Start and then Control Panel
2.- In Control Panel, if you are in Classic View, click on Control Panel Home (top left corner)
3.- Open Clock, Language, and Region
4.- Click on Regional and Language Options.
5.- Click the Keyboards and Languages tab and then click Change keyboards.
6.- To set the new layout as your default, select it from the list. Click OK to save your changes



You can switch between different input languages (keyboard languages) by:
• Clicking on the Language Bar button



• Pressing the Alt + Shift keys

It's possible someone set up AutoCorrect entries for this.  Try this:



In Word versions prior to Word 2007 (Vista):



1. Click the Tools-&gt;AutoCorrect Options menu item.
2. Click the AutoCorrect tab.
3. In the Replace text box, put a quote mark and an A.
4. If an entry in the lower list box with the Ä gets selected, click the Delete button.  Repeat as necessary.
5. Click the OK button.



In Word 2007:



1. Click the round Office button in the upper-left corner of the window.
2. Click the Word Options button.
3. Click the Proofing task.
4. Click the AutoCorrect Options button.
5. Continue as in Step 2, above.



Hope that helps.

My files don't open when i click save?



If i get an email and it has an attachment from word or something like that, a box pops up that asks me if i want to save or open.  i think i accidentally checked something that says "close this box after save" so after i save i can never open it right away, i have to open word and then open it.  is there a way i can uncheck that box, it won't let me because right after it saves, the box closes. sorry if that was really confusing, i don't know how else to explain it.

What computer program do you need to digitize images for embroidery and where can I purchase ?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



There are alot, but it is basically a better idea to have the shop do it.



The problem is that embroidery places don't use just point by point images, they rely on stitches.  Typically the place you have embroidery done will process an image into that for a small-ish fee. To do so yourself is usually a huge pain, as image conversion automated things still leave alot of custom work on the stitching to be done.

Software installation/update on Ubuntu 8.04?



What's the easiest way for software to be updated on Ubuntu 8.04? I'm referring to the external repositories that always need to be added to "Software Sources" before proper updates can occur. Lately, I've been wanting to update lots of software (OpenOffice.org 3, GIMP, VLC) and it's proving to be a real hassle.



Is there a frustration-free way for a relative newbie like me to accomplish this?

Can Someone help me to repair my Girlfriend's PC?



I am a newbie technician... Most familiar to easy formatting using windows CD in BIOS... My problem is in the case of my Girlfriend's PC... 1st scenario is I set the first boot in the CD option and the others are set to None... then save and exit BIOS set up then... 2nd Scenario it doesn't boots on the windows CD and it says "put a removable media and press any key" so I put a DOS disk but it does not boot... what shall I do now? Her PC is accessible but I probably doubted it that it won't boot after it requires to restart the PC... The cause of this Problem of why it needs to be reformatted is a virus that cannot be fixed because my Girlfriend doesn't have any internet connection.

In Excel, how can I find out the frequency of each word in a one-word-per-cell column?



I'm entering a lot of data (for a project on the frequency of certain first names in a large data sample), and is there a way for me to find out the frequency of each name with a certain command?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



assuming the first name is in a cell by itself (ie: one name per cell) you could use the COUNTIF function.  For example



if you data is in A1 to A5000, in B1 enter
=COUNTIF(A1:A5000, "BILL")
this will count the # of times BILL is in your data range.



you could also do it like:
=COUNTIF($A$1:$A$5000, A1)
and then copy/paste this formula all the way down from B1 to B5000.  This will look at what is in A1 and count the # of times it occurs in your range.  In B2, it will look at what is in A2 and count the number of times it occurs, etc, etc, etc,

<answer>



Newsgroups are legal.  Downloading any file that's under copyright (commercial music, movies, software etc)without paying for it is illegal.  It doesn't matter how you do it, the act itself is a crime.  You're paying for access to a service, not for the files.  If you're using newsgroups to download open source software, home movies, or music by unsigned bands looking for an audience then it's legal.  But if it's commercial software, music or movies then it's illegal.  It's copyright infringement.  The penalty is a fine between $750.00 and $150,000.00 per file and up to five years in prison.

You can just download a plugin for Office 2007 (it would only work on 2007): http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/detai...
Then you can save a document as a PDF. (Click "Save As", and select "PDF or XPS")



If you have Office 2003, I suggest downloading PrimoPDF, which is freeware. http://www.primopdf.com/

The sound you are hearing is an indication that a device that has been previously installed with plug and play has been connected to your computer; you will only see the notification in the taskbar when you plug a hardware component that has not been previously connected and windows needs to install the drivers necessary.

"I can hear the little bubble pop that tells you the device is connected"



It's built-in to Windows, and that's exactly what it's for.



The only way to stop it, that I know of, is to mute your speakers.



Or, you could waste some time, editing Window's default sounds, in the Control Panel.

What do they do?Do they do the same job?Why and when should we use them? Which is the best? Please use lay-man's language as I'm not the most computer-literate person on here (by a long way).



</question>



<additional details>



Oh, dear, I've already bought 'RegCure' as it was recommended by someone here to help as my computer had become very slow at downloading videos etc.
How will it mess up my registry and should I de-install it?
I've already paid for it but if it's going to do more harm than good should I just get rid of it?



...or should I just delete it by using 'file-assassin?'

Defrag just arranges your disk to use the space more efficiently. A PC can run faster with an organised disk. Do a defrag every few months.



RegCure is scamware that you DO NOT NEED! Just about everything that claims to fix or clean your registry is fraudulent.

RegCure probably mucks up the registry on a Windows PC and defragmenting is the process of tiding up the disk on a computer.
Defragmenting a Hard Disk is a good idea as it can improve the performance of the computer.

Regcure fixes and configures the registry system of your computer if your not keen on computers better stay away from altering it you might damage your computer settings.



defragmaneting is different from regcure, in theory it organizes data from your harddrive so your hardrive can find data faster, think of it as your drawer if it is well organized you can find clothes easily.



you can use defragment if you want but it does not make a difference. but make sure you finish it! you could ruin some programs or  lost files if you terminate it halfway (defragmenting could take hours depending on how big your harddrive is)

Actually, there are two types of defragmentation: registry and disk.



If you mean 'registry defragmentation,' this is the process where the program would compress the registry (a database that lists all of the configuration settings that determine how Windows looks and behaves). Fragmentation of registry is caused by several install and uninstall of programs.



If you mean 'disk defragmentation,' this is the process where the program would defragment (compress) the disk to save space. This process will just leave the unused files unmoved, while the ones you are using will be left untouched. Defragmentation of disks don't require a restart, but defragmenting the registry requires a reboot (restart).



RegCure is not a registry defragmenter neither it is a disk defragmenter. It is just a software that 'cleans up' unused registry keys. Using these kinds of programs is not reliable. Such programs doesn't know which keys are used, and it could delete the ones your system use.



A word from Microsoft Help and Support:



"Some products available for free on the Internet suggest the registry needs regular maintenance or cleaning. Occasionally, a registry setting can become corrupt but, in general, the registry is self-sufficient. If you do decide to install a registry cleaner, be sure to research the product and only download and install programs from software publishers that you trust."



My only suggestion is, do not use the so-called "registry cleaners." These kinds of programs could corrupt (destroy the configuration) the registry and make your system unbootable.

You should have two programs (which come with windoze in most versions) which will help you, PING and TRACERT. Both are run in a command window from a command prompt. The usage is PING &lt;domain name&gt; which will show something like this, as I did for yahoo dot com:



===== in the command window ====
C:\PING yahoo.com



Pinging yahoo.com [68.180.206.184] with 32 bytes of data:



Reply from 68.180.206.184: bytes=32 time=75ms TTL=52
Reply from 68.180.206.184: bytes=32 time=75ms TTL=52
Reply from 68.180.206.184: bytes=32 time=72ms TTL=52
Reply from 68.180.206.184: bytes=32 time=73ms TTL=52



Ping statistics for 68.180.206.184:



Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:



Minimum = 72ms, Maximum =  75ms, Average =  73ms
=====



Essentially, this tells you two things, the IP address of the domain and the response time for a packet of data to be returned. Now for TRACERT: (usage is the same)

Note from this that IP 192.168.0.1 is my router and avvanta dot com is my ISP. Note also you do NOT see the IP address of the machine I am using which is 192.168.0.10. "Self" does not count as a hop in the route. Again, note the times which is a measure of the speed of your connection and the speeds of the connections between hops. AND you get the name of each domain AND IP address of each server which handled the packet as it traveled to and from the destination.

Any attempt to trace an IP address comes back to the owner of the address. This will normally be the ISP who issued it, which may be in a totally different town to the person using the address.

just reinstalling Xp wont work... the errors remain as your only overwriting.. not reinstalling.



theres two ways to do this;



1 get another hard drive, and connect it thru a USB port... anf transfer from A to B in safe mode. (press F8 at startup)



and the other way is to get a copy of LINUX. (Linspire Xp2007) it boots off teh CD, and then you can use that to transfer your files, and then reformat the drive using XP disk.

Yes it is but it is a pain. You must install it to the same disk/partition, you must not format or delete any partition, you must use the same user name, you must use the same password. Do all this and you should be able to access and backup your files.



Once your files are safe then I would do a completely clean install formatting your OS partition as you install

You probably want to download torrents, right? If im right, there is 2 options: first is to find the torrent do you want to download. It should be a .torrent file. You simply double click, and it asks you where you want it to be downloaded. The  second is to open utorrent, File/add torrent by URL, but for this, you must know th exact link to the torrent, so i would use the first one. You can use www.piratebay.org  or www.isohunt.com to find these torrent files. Usually when u succesfully download one, its in many many .rar files or in .iso format. In first case, u just need to open one of them with WinRar and extract like normal. In the second case, you will need a program called daemon tools ( http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/download... ) , install it, and an icon near the clock should spawn. Click it then click Mount image and find the file you donwloaded. Thats all!

Is there a download manager that can download a file by connecting to its URL using Multiple Users&Passes ?



i want to download form a site that only allows 1 connection per user to download. also it requires to register an account with them.
i created multiple accounts but when i want to download a file it asks me for a user and pass, i enter mine and it starts downloading using only 1 connection,



can i download using more connections by entering extra users an passwords? perhaps using a specific download manager ??

No since it checks what ip downloads the file, and three accounts with the same ip = possible ban. If theres any premium service you can buy, then maybe it will go faster.

Photoshop is not a small file.  Nor is it free.  It will take time to download and after the trial period you will have to pay for it.



Try Gimp.  It stays free.

<answer>



Well either the CPU/ram usage increased because of another installed application. Either the hard disk is in more usage than before...



It wont load or it just takes more time? Not responding usually means you have loaded RAM and CPU to max so the program doesnt respond now, it may respond after waiting a little



You can still reinstall it, since you usually keep saves (but backing them up in a different location wouldn't harm)
....



Try using Ctrl+Shft+Escape to close unnecessary applications
before and retry

Deleting Microsoft Word - Help Please!?



So I got this laptop and it had a trial of Microsoft Word. I did work on it, saved it all as  93 to 2007 documents. Now it's expired and I want to load the XP version on, which is the only full one we have. I tried, but I think I have to delete the trial I have of Word on already before it will work. Now, the question is, when I delete the trial, will the word documents saved get lost too? Sorry, I'm not so good with computers, I hope this is understandable to you computer people out there!

Ok. You need to uninstall Microsoft word, not delete it. This will also delete the documents. You could send the documents to yourself by email and then save them to your xp version.

im not all that experienced myself either but i think deleting programs and files that you have saved are two totally different things, so with that said i dont think you will delete your files but now theres the question about weather or not you will be able to Open them or have a program that can open them, you know.
hope that helps but lets see what other responses come in, and hopefully someone can clarify if im wrong.

On what support do you have windows 98 ? if it's on usb, so you have to change the BIOS setup. you will set the laptop to check an operating system on the usb port first. After that you can remove linux by following step of intalation of win 98.



good luck.

There are still a few mirrors of the repositories for older releases. There is also an archive on an official Ubuntu server, but moved off the one that supports more recent ones. No one to my knowledge is still doing backports or security fixes for them, though.

How do I use WinRAR in Total Commander to extract, make and test archives?



I just installed Total Commander Ultima Prime v4.3 and I saw that it has built-in support for extraction for files. However I want to use WinRar (v3.7) to do extraction etc tasks. So I was wondering if anybody could help me set up the extract button in Total Commander to start extracting files using WinRar.



I made little progress when I configured the extract button to open winrar.exe. It opened WinRar but it did not automatically start extraction, instead I had to navigate to the file and then press the extract to... button.



Thanks in advance!

Yes, the GIMP is an amazing piece of open source software that I have used now for a few years with no problems. You will need to download the GTK runtime environment from the GIMPs website in order to run it though. You should find everything you need here:

If you are using Windows Vista, have you turned on the feature to use Check Mark Boxes?



If you have turned on that feature, you don't need to use Ctrl and Shift keys.



If you want to use the Ctrl and Shift keys, turn off the Check Mark Box feature.



If you are not using Windows Vista, or you have not turned on the feature I mention above, or if that feature is not the issue, perhaps someone else will provide different insight.



Good luck.

I would go with the Windows Vista X64 OS...



However, there is a requirement to run a X64 OS by installing more RAM, my recommendation 4GB total... on a X32 OS it will only read 3.5 GB but the X64 OS will read the complete ram.

gamer = 32 bit.
64 bit you have to have a 64 bit OS + all software compatible with 64 bit. and drivers as well. now the 64 bit works but you have to have over 4GB of RAM to actually see a difference, because 64 sees over 4GB, 32 bit edition will only see up to 3.5 no matter if you have 4GB in your mb. the 64 bit affects hardware, if you do not have a x64 process and mb to go with it you will not be able to use it. no one really writes games for it anyways. 32 bit is much more stable, unless you are using it as a server or file hosting and webhosting ftp and such.....stick with 32 bit editon.

On the side of the download, it should tell you how many sources they are. The more sources, the faster the download.



Or your problem could be that the ports LimeWire uses have been blocked.

LimeWire, Ares Galaxy, FrostWire, LemonWire and eMule are all free.  I think MP3 Rocket is too, though they have a Pro version with a one-time fee.  LimeWire has a Pro version also.  There are also torrents which are free.  Bear Share and iMesh are pretty much the same and charge a monthly fee for unlimited downloads but you can only listen to them; if you want to put them on a CD or anything you have to buy the songs at 99 cents each.



There are also search engines like MP3 Search and SkreemR MP3 Search where you can type in the name of an artist and it will find places where you can download their songs.

Try emusic. It also has a download manager for its database of songs. By using p2p apps for downloading songs you risk attention from the RIAA and possible lawsuit. It is better to use a legitimate source for music.

That web site didn't work for me. Does it even exist? By the looks of the domain name, it's pretty dodgy if you ask me..



In either case, Canonical is a company that ships Ubuntu discs (it's free to ship just 1 or 2 discs, but you have to pay if you want a bulk lot).



If you want a Ubuntu disc delivered to you, see https://shipit.ubuntu.com/login

This error comes up when the machine is instructed to run a program which isn't a program file, or that doesn't exist.



You may be infected with the RavMon virus or another variant
It has inserted an autorun file into your root directory which is referencing a non existent file.



To get your machine to boot again, boot from a Windows CD or from a floppy, and delete the autorun.ini file from your hard drive
Then run a complete antivirus scan.

because of copyright, in other words the music companies, writers,and singers own the rights to the songs and every copy of the song, so if you havent bought a cd of music from an online store or somewhere like target ( which has a license to sell cds from the record company ,you're stealing) if you download from a filesharing site or a blog etc. that being said, there's still a legal fight going on about how music is shared, no word yet on what they're going to do about about friends exchanging cds. the same rule applies to movies. pictures and jusy about everything else these days. these people by law have the right to sue you and win because you are infringing on their right to make money on the songs they wrote or sang. you yourself used the word...illegal...that's what it is, against the law.

Sony Vegas Pro 8.0 Rendering Issues?



Ok, so when I try to render a video on Sony Vegas Pro 8.0 it says it's going to take like an hour, but then when it hits a little over 50%, it jumps to the end. When I try to watch it, it goes really slow and the video doesn't match up with the audio correctly. But if I save it to the computer on Windows Movie Maker it saves it right. That's why it wouldn't have troubled me that much, because I could do that. But I just noticed now that when Vegas renders the videos, a two-minute long movie ends up being 4 GB and I have to erase everything! Does anyone know what's wrong???

when your labeling your render try changing your settings to mpeg 1
you prob have it on hd mode try slower fps 29.7 unless you are trying to make a cinema style video i usually go with low settings if you have a lot of motion in your videos its gonna really slow the process

Excel Help. How do I link "Max" to the contents of another cell?



I am looking for a way to do the following in Excel.



I currently have a B1 Cell that is set up to =Max(A451:FQ451). I have Cell A1 = A451 & Cell A2 = FQ451. How can I change =Max(A451:FQ451) so that it is linked to "contents" of cells A1 & A2. Therefore I can change Cells A1 = A452 & Cells A2 = FQ452 and the formula in B1 is automatically updated to =Max(A452:FQ452)

you can do this with the INDIRECT formula.  With INDIRECT, you can type a cell reference in a cell and INDIRECT will use that cell reference as the cell reference in your formula (did that makes sense).  In your case just enter



=MAX(INDIRECT(A1) : INDIRECT(A2))



in A1 enter A451 and in A2 enter FQ451.  Max interpret the range as MAX(A451:FQ451).  And changing the cell refs in A1 & A2 will automatically change the MAX references.

Transfer incomplete files to Vuze?



Ares no longer works on my computer and I just recently downloaded Vuze.  (Kept saying Socket Error 10054)
Is there any way I can transfer my incomplete files from Ares to Vuze so that I would not have to download everything again?  (I want Vuze to finish what Ares started)  Downloading is painfully slow to me and the file download progress is at 90%.

You cannot copy a piece of hardware. You must be referring to the software on your hard drive? You can use your operating system to make a copy, windows, set up a place to put the copy of all your software, another drive perhaps.  Copy and paste, it might take awhile as its quite a bit of copying. You could also use two open windows and grab with the cursor all the folders and files and move to another place another window, it will automatically copy it all.

I prefer Acronis True Image (www.acronis.com) over Norton Ghost.  It has a few more features and with the optional "universal restore" feature, it will allow you to restore a drive image to a completely different PC (different hardware, etc).

Is there a website that will let me download free music (legally) without having to install anything?



I have been looking around for a while, but I have have had little luck finding such a place - probably due to my poor computer skills.
Basically, I need a place where I can download recent music without worrying about the cost or whether the police are going to storm my house! As stated in the question, I do not want to be installing any programs onto the computer itself - although if it is necessary, I will do so.

It doesn't necessarily need to be on your desktop to be put in a powerpoint. So long as you have the song on your computer, all you need to do is go to "Slide Transition" in powerpoint, "Modify Transition," click on the little drop down arrow next to "Sound:" and browse to the song on your computer.

Microsoft Office Home and Student 2007 Question?



Alright,



So this is a question for those who can help me, the idiot. I threw out my MS Office '07 CD by mistake and now all I have is the CD key itself, rather than the program on the CD. So, I was curious to know if I install MS Office Home and Student 2007 from office.miscrosoft.com and put in my CD key, will I still retain all of the same features, etc, as if it were an actual copy? This is, of course, after I enter the CD key.



I'm freaking out over here and MS wants fifty dollars just so I can talk to some support guy and get a yes or no answer to rather I can by a replacement CD instead.

"the rating on vista for my graphic card is 1.0."



That's probably because your nVidia drivers are not being recognized in Vista.



Do not use the driver disk that came with the card, get the latest VISTA drivers from nVidia's website.

Try booting in safe mode... hit F12 while booting and select safemode from the list and hit enter.
( more time will be taken to boot in safe mode..wait till boot)After logging in shutdown as usual and reboot in normal mode.



If you cannot enter safe mode remove the hard disk and check the connection.Reconnect and check again.
If the problem persists try to reinstall the Operating System.
Ask help for some local service.

XP was designed for hame and professional
use. I would chose this for a personal pc.  NT is designed for
servers.  Nt isn't very user-friendly, and only certain software will
work on it.  I would use this for a server.

Need help for excel formula?



Greetings



I have this spreadsheet question for homework but am having difficulties understanding what to do.  I haven't used excel before so the whole formula thing has me completely stumped.



I have a $122,740.45 loan to pay back and I am charged a 6.95% interest fee per month.  What formula do I need to type in for it to work out how much interest it takes out each time?



Many thanks for your assistance

Hi there,



More information would be helpful... For instance - do you have a set payback amount? Are you wanting to know what the decreasing interest charge is per month as you pay back the loan? Or do you simply want to know what the interest is per month at 6.95%?



I'm going to assume the last one in my first answer to you so:



In cell A1 type '$122,740.45'
In cell B1 Type '6.95%'
In cell C1 type '=A1*B1'



That should tell you what 6.95% of A1 is.



Alternatively if 6.95% is the annual interest charge and you want to know what the monthly interest charge is then type into C1:



=A1*(B1/12)



Does this help?



If you want to know what the monthly payment should be to pay it back over a certain period of time then you can use the =PMT() function but I'd need to know more (such as what the repayment term is) in order to give you the formula for that one.



Best of Luck,



Alex

Can Someone help me to repair my Girlfriend's PC?



I am a newbie technician... Most familiar to easy formatting using windows CD in BIOS... My problem is in the case of my Girlfriend's PC... 1st scenario is I set the first boot in the CD option and the others are set to None... then save and exit BIOS set up then... 2nd Scenario it doesn't boots on the windows CD and it says "put a removable media and press any key" so I put a DOS disk but it does not boot... what shall I do now? Her PC is accessible but I probably doubted it that it won't boot after it requires to restart the PC... The cause of this Problem of why it needs to be reformatted is a virus that cannot be fixed because my Girlfriend doesn't have any internet connection.

If she does not have a connection, how does she have a virus? What you are setting in bios will not work anyway. You need to set the cd as first boot, but will need to allow the hard drive to boot, as it will stall the installation otherwise. you can NOT use dos disks on a current Windows system, it can not handle the drive sizes or file system. From your obvious lack of knowledge I would take it to a shop before your totally destroy it.

The product key affixed to the side of your computer IS your license for that computer.  You can use a disc from an OEM computer but not from another mass produced computer like Gateway, HP, Dell, etc.  Those discs already have keys in them and it will make your computer appear invalid and most likely shut the OS down.  When you do this method, however, you will most likely have to call Microsoft to get the key validated, but only the first time and it will be in the system if you format again.



OR, you could pony up the cash and call whoever made your computer and ask for the disc.  It might cost you $30 or so.



OR, if it's been made somewhat recently they probably didn't give you a disc, they put the install files on a partition on your hard drive and you just need to use the correct key strokes to access that partition and reload the system.

With a 300W default PSU it will struggle and your system may crash.



If you can't upgrade, your best bet would be a 8800GS which will still be tricky.



The order is 8800GTX&gt;GT&gt;GTS(unless 512)&gt;GS

The easiest would be Garage Band on Mac but it does help if you have the actual ability to create the music or play the particular instruments in the first place because great music doesn't create itself.



Sony Acid Pro 6 would be fine too - you may just need to spend some time learning how to use it - as well as creating some decent music that is actually worth recording.

I'm not sure what you are trying to say, but I'll try answer your question.



The typical music format is MP3, and you can't just upload MP3 files to Youtube. There are other formats but MP3 is the most common. Youtube is a video website, and videos is what you can upload. MP3 files are music-only. You can't really "send music in media player" to anyone. You can send the MP3 music files (or whatever format your music happens to be in) to your family, but you can't "send it in media player". As long as they have a media player installed on their computer, they should be able to play your music. There is a default Windows Media Player that comes with Windows, so having a media player shouldn't be a problem. Just send them the music file and you should be good to go.



How you send it depends on how much music you want to send. If you just wanna send one piece of music, you might be able to get away with sending it as an email attachment. But if you are mass-sending music, you should use a file host. Popular (free) file hosts include Rapidshare, Sendspace, and others. How it works is that you upload your music into the file host, and then they give you a download link. Just give your family the download link and when they click on the link, they will go to a website where they can download your uploaded files. Generally file hosts give one download link per file, so you should compress your music into one file before you upload it.



Hope this helped.

If It's a torrent you need to use the torrent to download the actual file before you can play it in any media player. Is that what you mean? You have just downloaded a torrent for something and you want to watch it? If you have just got a torrent then you will need to get a programw hich will use the torrent to actual download the file such as u torrent. And then you use that to get what you actually want to download wiht the use of the torrent. And you will then be able to watch the file after that.



Oh and also, alot of the time you cant play downloaded movies or shows in windows media player as it doesnt have the right codecs to support the file format. So you need to download a different media player such as vlc media player which works for most file formats.

Pukka is the release group for the torrent.
It looks like pukka releases are all avi encoded in XviD.
WMP at default does not have the codecs to play XviD.



Easiest thing is to get the free VLC.  It has codecs installed within and will play that and most anything downloaded:

the "send as an attachment" option in excel is setup to use the outlook email program. Since you haven't set up outlook (or maybe didn't even install it), you won't be able to use the option in excel (there's no way to tell excel which email program you are using).  Instead, you'll just have to attach your file to an email message directly from your email program (ie: the same way you would send any file from whatever email program you use).

Uninstalling programs will not make your PC run any faster. If it lags, consider adding more RAM. And keep doing defrags, scans for spyware, malware and viruses to keep it performing well.
Also, use CrapCleaner to clean your computers rubbish files and clean the registry to keep your PC performing at its best.
There are probably processes that you can cancel to make your PC run better but i wouldnt advise messing with those unless you know what you're doing.

If your trying to optimize it for web browsing, then removing applications won't help.



If you want to get rid of some stuff then take out all of the trial software that they give you, such as mcafee or norton antivirus. Dowload AVG free.



then go to the start menu click run, type msconfig (or in Vista just type msconfig in the search bar) then go to the start up tab and disable all the programs that you don't need to start when you turn your computer on. (I.E. msn messanger, yahoo messanger, quicktime etc..)

After reinstalled windows, what you need to do is active your windows on line. No activation key is required. Perhaps, you may need a activation key if you are not activating it on line. In that case, contact Microsoft office to get one.

At a technical level it uses Voice Over IP to send your voice as bits of data across hte interwebs.



As for what it does, well you can use it for free call's to other Skype users, as well as free video calls(webcam needed) and IM chats.
It can also be used to call Mobile phones and landlines, at pretty competitive rates, espcially when calling internationla numbers(costs are listed on the website)
I use it to call my parents, Im at Uni so thers no phone in the dorms, so Skype is an excelent choice to use, it would be even better if any of my parents could use a Pc good enough to use Skype, then it would be free.
You can download it for free, and it usually comes with about £5 balance included so you can start straight away. all you need is aheadset, which some are 'skype approved'(usualy a rip-off costs though) but include Skype credit too, and some Skype certified handsets(look liek a normal phone, has buttons n stuff, though headsets are probale more comfortable)
Some mobile phones and the PSP includes Skype too, and some landline phones may have Skype built in.
If you find that it is not much use in your particluar sitiatio then jsut uninstall it. simple.

Microsoft word doesn't scan forms.
If you have a blank form, then print it out, then scan it.
You will be able to fill the form out with any good image editing software that allows you to enter text into an image.  I use Paint shop pro

If you still have the Word format form, all you need is to fill it up and attach it to email. No need to scan it, unless it is required.
If you have the (image) scanned form and you need to fill it up, open it in MSPaint and use Text control in the toolbox to fill it up.

if you want an instant shut down Windows XP, you can press the CTRL + ALT + DEL, and then pop in the Task Manager, click on the "off" → "shutdown" At the same time hold down the CTRL, less than 1 second, you will find it closed system, in the blink of an eye on it. By the same token, if the "off" menu, select "restart" to restart quickly.

As you are viewing Yahoo Answers, the web page is 'downloading' to your web browser, so that counts as traffic on your net connection, but we don't usually call that downloading, because it is not permanently saved on your machine.



Downloading is where you click a web link to save a file to the hard drive of your computer, or where you use a program like a FTP program, Limewire, P2P or torrent program to transfer a file from the Internet and save it on your computer.



Watching streaming videos is kind of in the middle -- you aren;t permanently saving the video to your machine, but you are receiving a large amount of data, which consumes the same amount of traffic as if you had downloaded the video file.  So watching videos becomes significant if you have a limit on the # of MB you can 'download' on your Internet account (and particularly on cell phone internet use where overages on data traffic can cost you big bucks)

You're not downloading it in the same fact that you can access it anytime from home without being online. However, windows does save parts of it so that when you log on it can load faster. These can be deleted by emptying your cookies and history. Some things are downloaded though.

Going or browsing a site, is not downloading. If you enter a site and you browse it, that's all! It's simply browsing the site.



But if for example, you're looking for a software, games, pictures, etc. there is a download button and after clicking that, a prompt like "save as" will appear, and when you click yes, that is downloading.



If you are to download something in the net, there is always a prompt that will appear and from there, you will know that you are downloading something.



Enjoy! Hope this helps!

Downloading is the transfer of data from a remote machine (e.g. answers.yahoo.com) to a local machine (e.g. the one you are sitting at) when the request is initiated from the local machine.



When you request the Yahoo! Answers homepage, your browser downloads the Yahoo! Answers homepage. It doesn't download the whole of Yahoo! Answers - because it consists of many thousands of pages.

Yes, visiting a site is downloading a portion of a site.  You don't download the entire site, just what you are viewing.  There are differences in the type of download though, which is what may be confusing to you.  When you view a page, the information is transferred to your computer, otherwise you wouldn't be able to view it.  This is often in the form of "caching" the data to memory or to a file on disk.  The browser handles this form of downloading internally with minimal input from the user (you can always configure the browser for caching options, but for the most part, it works without user input).  The other type of download is where you get a copy of a file from the server with the intention of using it "offline".  What I mean by this is you can download an application (examples: iTunes software from Apple, a trial version of a game, etc...) and use it without being connected to the Internet.

Well I know in Firefox you can select options to automatically delete personal information on exit.



Tools &gt; Options &gt; Privacy



Down the bottom you will see the check box for clearing data on exit. If you click the settings button you can select which information is cleared.
There is also a check box there to require you to confirm clearing.



As for a program that just plain doesn't save history or cookies I don't know of one. Cookies are required for most websites that you are required to log in to so doing so would cause problems.



Best bet is probably to enable an auto delete of your personal data.

Firefox and Stealther Extension (google them up).



Or use Google Chrome, and use the Incognito browsing mode.
Any browsing you make while in Incognito mode will be made private and will leave no traces (no history, no cookies, no autofills) on the computer.

You're looking for RADMIN- or remote administrator.



That is the only software which can control your computer. But no software of that sort all in one can block websites, you can do that yourself by editing the c:\ Windows\ system32\drivers\ etc\HOSTS file and adding an entry like:



127.0.0.1 www.website.com



to block all and any access to the website.
