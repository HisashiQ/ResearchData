The Pantec Matrix is probably the best. It is the second coming to the DUO and it runs better because it does not use windows Mobil. Full slide out QWERTY keypad and alphanumeric keypad. Have lots of cool features and is just cool looking.



I have one and love it for texting, some Internet surfing and also has IM, if ya want that.

Lack of sound quality in new sony walkman phones?



Older w550i, w600, w800, w810 has great mindblowing sound quality.



Recently I tried a new mobile. Its a W910i which has walkman 3 player. When compared to my older w550i which has a older player, even with the same headphones, W550i sounds way better than the newest W910i for the same EQ and stereo widening settings. Anybody experienced this? I was planning to upgrade for a new W595i and worrying because of this.

The N85 is Nokia’s successor to the N81, adding a dual-slide (dedicated music + gaming buttons), AMOLED display (which looks fantastic), 3.2 megapixel camera (Carl Zeiss), FM transmitter, and a whole buttload of other fun features. This is the phone to get, and I would highly recommend it



Meanwhile, the N79 is your N82/N78 upgrade. That means it’s a candy bar with most of the bells and whistles of the N85, minus the screen and the obvious. It’s a solid phone but there really isn’t a whole lot to say about it.



the best choice would be N85

Dear Friend,



If you want to choose between N85 & N79 - in my opinion N85 is better than N79. Lookwise and as per specifications N85 is good. Even u can find more details on other online websites which can help you to buy perfect mobile as you like.

n95.
why:
fantastic camera
great call quality
great amount of features the g1 doesnt have (voice dialing, video recording, video player, bluetooth file sharing, headphone jack, internet browser with embedded flash and java)
the g1 has some things over the n95:
its open source which means that it will eventually have more apps for it.
it has a massive screen compared to the n95-4
thats about it.

How can I get this ringtone/song onto my phone?



So, I really enjoy the song "Oh Oh Sexy Vampire"; By Fright Ranger. -- I would like it as a ringtone/song on my phone.. Problem is, I can't find a way to get it! I tried using Myxer Tones, but Verizon Wireless phones won't allow it.



"You cannot use this with your VW phone. Grr! I h8 u!"



Anyone know a way I can get this song onto my phone? I don't care if it's a ring tone or not, I just really want the song. If I can use it as a ringtone, that's a plus. I want something that works like Myxer Tones does? Where it just sends the sound and I can save it. If it's free, that's great, if not, I'll deal. (As long as I don't have to pay monthly for a membership to something stupid. I'll pay like, 2 dollars for the ringtone, but I won't pay for it every month. That's just dumb.) D&lt;

I know this is a lot to ask for, especially all the specifity, but I REALLY hate asking for pricey things, like phones. It's not like were poor or anything, but a penny saved is a penny earned.

well you might have to settle for a used one, i usually buy them used but trust me they are barely used.. you can check www.craigslist.org and search in the electronics section however you might have to pick up,, and since you are just 14 make sure you are going with an adult in case you get the phone... good luck

You actually don't even have to use Rhapsody; unless you are buying the music from them.  Just hook your Dare up to your computer.  Go to tools on your Dare, then choose USB Mass Storage.  It will ask if you want to connect for Music or Data.  The rest should be straight forward from here.

N70 ( Nokia) is really a great phone. Also N73 but many people seem to hang on to their N70s so that's why I recommend it. You can't go wrong with either anyway. You can get the N70 Music Edition. It can also take 1G memory.

Not got the phone but have worked with it plenty.



No issues with the battery life - I would expect the battery life to last on average 4 days.



Found the phone very easy to use.  The touch screen on the phone is very easy, the phone supports most music files and has expandable memory of up to 8GB.



5 megapixel camera - takes excellent photos.  The phone can also record and play videos.

I believe you are missing part of your question.  If you are asking whether or not you can: Yes.  It will count towards your messaging.  An example of this is the weather channel.  www.weatherchannel.com they offer a weather update SMS.  It's free from them, but will deduct from your available messages; unless you have unlimited messaging.

How can I "unlock" my virgin mobile phone without returning it?



I ordered a Virgin mobile phone online and when I tried to activate it I was told by Virgin mobile that Walmart would have to "unlock" it.When I got in contact with Walmart, they said that Virgin mobile would have to "unlock" the phone. I really like THIS phone and the only store that has THIS phone is like 16 miles away and I can't travel that far.So if anyone knows any fancy tricks or other solutions to this nerve wrecking problem please let me know.

Go on ebay and there're loads of unlocking clips, codes and sites. Just search for your phone model with the word unlock at the end.

I'm sure you can call the operator (or visit its shop) and get it done. they will only verify that you is you and you will be pretty much done.

There is no way if you don't rememeber you can get in.. also they can't do it in the store.. cause they can't change or see what your old one is..



You will have to call customer care & have them reset it.. I do it all the time.. (I work for a US Cell Company).. I hope that they wouldn't charge you for it.. But it def. have to be done through them :)

personally I would say definetely go with the Titanium voyager (i used to hav the enV also) I jess got mine last Friday && I love it!
BUT if u r realli good at txting on that touch screen then I'd say go wit the dare. that's tha onlee reason I chose not to get it because it makes txting difficult =\ (for example I am currently typing this from my itouch && it's taking me twice as much time even WITH the qwerty keypad nd plus tha touch screen on the dare isn't as sensitive as the iphone so it will b harder to txt)
oh! && about tha glyde don't even BOTHEr givin that phone a chance lol all it gets is bad reviews && tha feel of the qwerty keypad sux && lacks several keys that the voyager has && tha touch screen isn't too good && compared to tha voyager it's not as NICE looking other than tha sliding part.

There is no way for anyone to retrace your old text messages once permanently deleted off your cell phone.  It would cost AT&T/cingular to much money to send a detailed bill with all your text messages on them.  And as a matter of fact AT&T did away with detailed bills in the beginningg of the year.  So No worriess

My T-mobile/Sidekick LX Questions?



I've recently had the LG Voyager undere Verizon Wireless, and I loved the phone to death until mymom had gotten the bill and we found out that Verizon wireless lied to us and cheated us. Now, my mom told me that we may switch to T-Mobile, so I've decided to get a Sidekick LX. I'm a new T-Mobile/Sidekick LX owner so I have a few questions about T-Mobile and the Sidekick LX.



T-Mobile



-I'm planning on getting unlimited everything. How much will that contract cost? Which plan do is the Unlimited plan for the Sidekick?
Other than the ringtones, and other apps, will my other data make the bill higher if I get the unlimited everything plan?



-When T-Mobile says 'Unlimited text messaging', do they mean 'unlimited teaxt messaging to all companies' or 'unlimited text messaging to other T-Mobile owners'?



Sidekick LX



- How fast does the music player, mood lights, and flashing lights drain the battery power?



- I'm thinking about having my sidekick painted white with color ware.



http://www.colorwarepc.com/p-121-sidekic...



Is color ware good? Did the color of your sidekick come out good?

You technically don't have a simcard in an iPhone (I have one) but if you get the new one you can probably bring it to the AT&T store and have them re set it up for you, you might have to put all your contacts in the new one, probably, but I'm not positive.

Hi Bianca. It's a Samsung X380, and you can find out all about it here:



http://uk.samsungmobile.com/mobile/SGH-X...



It's a great little phone - I've had Samsung's before and always found them easy to use and reliable. It has a built in MP3 player and camera too, as well as being very cute. You can get it a whole bunch of different colours, but I expect you'll want pink ('cos I know who it's for!)

Thanks, you even had all the different colors for each model. I definitely want the Glimmer, hopefully they'll have it at the Alltel store tomorrow.

Fixing a phone with a bad ESN?



If I "flash" or "reflash" a CMDA phone with a bad ESN, will the ESN be good after I do it? Is there a difference between flash and reflash because I have heard of both terms being used but I didn't know if there was a difference. Also, where can I take the phone to get it done or can I do it myself?

My Env 2 randomly turns off?



I got it about 4 months ago and was fine up until about 2 months ago when it would randomly turn off. I would take it out of my pocket turned off. At first I thought "Maybe I accidentally hit the power button." But I realized about a week ago that it wasn't that. While I was texting, I closed my phone really fast and it just shut off without sending the text. I tried that again and the same thing happened. I don't know what the problem is. I have never dropped it in or on anything. Do you guys think that if I go to the Verizon store, I can get a new phone or battery without having an insurance plan?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You prolly over charged the battery. I did this on my first cellphone. Don't charge the battery for more then 3 hours. You prolly charged it for a while or overnight. Thats what I did, and they next day it kept shutting off randomly. Prolly need a new battery tho....

You may luck out depending on the damage. Do not turn it on. Take the bateries off and leave it to dry. Once it dries put new batteries back on. Is not the water that causes the damage but the short circuit. It may not work but you may get lucky depending on the damage.

Take the back and battery out and put it in a bowl of dry rice.  The rice will absorb the moisture from inside the phone.  This will often help.  If not, you may need a new phone.

Turn it off and take the back off and the battery out. Also go to your phones website. They will most often have a page on how to dry out your model of phone. Give it about a week till it's dried out and then try to turn it back on. Good luck! I hope it works!

I am not sure about this one. I assume that this will use 3G or EDGE which carriers normally charge for, so I expect this to be the same. If it was wi-fi capable then if you use that it should be free, much like the iPhone.

Try resetting it. If that doesn't work, email your pictures and videos to yourself and save your numbers in case you decide to get a new phone. Best of luck.

You mighn't have the "old" version of the phone, (no I don't mean an old model, I mean an old program or watever it's called) they had to replace mine... both my mom and I had this problem...  do u have Verizon Wireless? That's was I had, they just transferred all of our info to the new phone... a new battery probably won't help... TRUST ME!! lol, I know it's soooo annoying!!

One thing I learned when I handled the Nextel account at my old job was to take an eraser and "erase" the gold connection thingy's on both phone and battery.  This helps to ensure a proper connection.  And also, if you are always leaving your phone on to charge...that is not good.  You should let your phone die out completely or shut it off and then charge it.  This is the advice I have been given and I have never had a charging issue.

It depends on which plan you have, if you don't have a plan where you are subscribed to vcast then you will pay charges even for just being on and browsing plus the costs of anything you download. Call verizon to see if you are subscribed to VCast before you go into the program, other wise your first bill is going to be much larger than you ever expected...
You can add songs to your phone for free by buying and using verizons music essentials kit with the USB cord and software. It will allow you to transfer and music on your computer to your phone.

Ringtone Problems with my Motorolla W385...?



The ringtones that came with the phone works just fine, as well as the the ringtone I got through a stamp that I won.



Now I tried downloading several ringtones on the internet to my computer, then emailed it to my phone and saved it (just like the instructions on the -net say), but it wont allow them to be a ringtone for my phone.



Both the downloaded ones and the one I got from the stamp are under MP3 format, but the stamp one works...



Is there anyway I could get them to be an actual ringtone??

AT&T phones. Blackjack 2, quickfire, propel?



i have the iphone and hate it, so i'm getting a new phone but i need qwerty keyboard cuz all i do is text and internet.
Ive narrowed it down to the Quickfire (soon to be released) Blackjack 2, and Samsung Propel.
Any thought?
i really like the blackjack 2 but am afraid the keyboard will be ahrd to use because its not as roomy as the quickfire.



any other sugestions are apreciated. thanks!

the quickfire looks like a good choice. the camera kind of sucks, but that's not as big of a deal to me as it is to a lot of other people. if you don't care, that's the one i'd go for. however, i'd wait until a few more reviews are published, specifically by cnet.com. the phone looks good in theory for what you want to use it for as it's very sidekick-esque, but it might not function well. you never know.



second choice would be the blackjack. if i was going to get a smart phone, personally, i'd go for the blackberry bold, but they're not everyones thing. the blackjack has pretty good reviews, i just don't find it appealing appearance-wise. you'd get used to the keyboard, i'm sure, it'll just take a little practice.



i'm not sure i'd do the propel. i was looking at it today coincidentally, the fact that it looks so much like the piece of crap samsung sliders that went to free phones a month after release makes me nervous. it's a nice looking phone, i like color choices and that it's a slider qwerty, but the functionality might be like the samsung sliders that everyone hated.

I REALLY want the Quickfire, so obviously that would be my first choice. Then I would go for the Propel, because I don't really like the layout of the Blackjack 2.

Hello!



I have recently ( 1-3 months ) got a new phone for £120 and had no money left, BUT now i have enough for a warranty/insurance/policy



( If it gets damaged or destroyed, you can get it fixed )



Is it possible to get a warranty or is it not?

OK, I am going to buy a new phone, because I don't like my Nokia N95 8GB. I am thinking of buying a blackberry phone or maybe the nokia E71 or the Nokia N96. which phone should I get? I am really not into music or stuff. I just want the best phone. Or should I stick with the N95 8 GB? And I won't use the Nokia E71 for work. Just for socializing. thanks. and please tell me their pros and cons

The text message you receieved means that you are elligble to upgrade early now if you would like. If you decide to do this you will void your new every two and not be able to use it. If you upgrade now your new every two date will start over and be two years from todays date.

Verizon just had a major issue with Glydes,so bad that they asked dealers to stop selling them until they get a fix out. I would go with the Voyager.

My LG Rumor does not ring for incoming call or messages! how do I fix it? ?



I'm not sure if I accidently set something, but all of the sudden my Rumor doesn't ring or make noise when there's incoming calls or messages. I know speaker still works because when I go to change ring tones I still hear the preview of the tones.  What could it be?  Is there some master mute button I might've pressed??

Only if you have an online account and you have registered a account with your network otherwise no , I think you would have known if they have done that without yu so no i don't think they can . If you think they have set up an account delete them after you have received them . And I really doubt they have that's pretty mean and they wouldn't have given you a phone if they don't trust you with your own personal messages and texts !

Well there are a lot of options here, and some work out better than others. But if your sister upgrades her plan to a family plan with unlimited texting on all lines (every major carrier has this option) (example: verizons "select" family plan) it costs $10 per line to add a line (but 2 lines are already included in the price). Now you will of course want to cover any increased costs for more minutes or cost difference in single line to family plans. But it is quite likely that it will only cost you $10-30 a month

Pay as you go gives you sometimes limited service (in case of blackberry for example) and in many service providers' PAYG packages no free minutes or texts. If you don't want to spend a lot on costly contracts, then my suggestion would be to choose a mobile phone and buy it separately and go for a basic contract. In UK, O2 gives a monthly contract limited for 1 month only, so you are not bound for one year or 18 months with it and can change anytime you want. you get 200 minutes and 200 text free as well for just £15.



As for the duration of top up is, well, it really depends upon you because if you are into a lot of texting (which trust me you will be if you have friends with mobiles) or use internet on your mobile extensively (like me) then a £10 or a $10 top up would hardly last a week.



Summary: Buy a mobile phone separately, and get a basic contract. Live an easy and simple life :)



Cheerio



P.S: You can buy iPhone on PAYG too, so why bother for an expensive contract?

I wouldn't recommend a pay as you go phone service, especially if you use your phone alot. Depending on the service, you could end up paying more in one month to add minutes, ring tones, etc. than just paying a monthly bill... I've tried it before...

It depends on what you want to use the phone for. If you dont talk/text/picture mail much and just need a phone for "just in case" type of thing, then you're fine but if you plan on doing any of that with a pay as you go phone you will end up spending more then $40 a month to get any significant use out of it. Their pay rate (the average rate per minute, or text) is way higher than on a contract. Additonally you have to purchase the phone out of pocket and the price you spend for the phone you get isn't close if you compare it to a regular plan. I worked for AT&T for close to two years and I'm not a huge fan of those things.



To top all that off, if you don't regularly add minutes to those things (I think its at least once every thirty or sixty days) they cut your phone off so you might as well just get a regular service. Usually the only people that get those things are people that can't for whatever reason enter into a contract with a cell phone carrier or people that just need an emergency phone  and don't plan on using it much.

NO the only thing that shows up on the phone bill is the airtime you used for the message. It NEVER shows the name of anything having to do with text messages or pictures.

display problem



LCD not working or damaged by short circuit.



happen by over charging for liquid fall on it.
if its in warranty then company changed it easily otherwise change LCD with local brand, you get little difference in display clarity, but its affordable.

Myxer still works for verizon. You just have to download the ringtone and then send it through your email. It explains it on the website. I think they still do that anyways, maybe something's changed? Phonezoo is a good site though.

Verizon wireless owner - How to compare Dare & Voyager?



I am a Verizon wireless user and am up for a phone upgrade next month.  Currently, I've got a Razr while I'm interested in both the Voyager & The Dare (which my wife has).



My priorities are for mobile internet and multimedia capabilities.  I want to be able to put .avi video (or conversions from that) onto the expansion card and play that on the phone.  I'm don't do all that much texting (which I hear would tilt things in favor of the Voyager, and also of the Env2).



Are there better phones for what I'm looking for from Verizon - better than these 2? (please don't answer that I need a new wireless provider - I'm a 7 year vet of Verizon and I'm happy with my service, thank you.)



I'm not that much concerned about talktime or price, unless that reeeeeally skews the competition.

The Dare has a better camera - 3.2 Megapixel Resolution vs. 2.0 for Voyager. Dare's has Bluetooth version v2.1 while the Voyager is v1.2. Also the Dare's screen is bigger. The only drawback is more expensive than the Voyager

I have Verizon as well and there is no way to view the deleted pictures online or the text message.  The only thing you can view online is who you sent a text to (as in telephone number), the date and time same goes for received messages - it will list the number that text you, the date and time.  No contents as in words or pictures are viewable.

It really shouldn't be a problem unless one or both of you have a limit on your accounts which prevents international calls.  Do you have the correct international code?  I know it sounds like a silly question, but it is worth triple checking.  If the numbers are definitely correct, then you need to contact your operators and check that your contract allows international calls.  Some don't - even pay-as-you-go.

Some networks have an international bar on customers accounts and it will only be lifted if the customer requests it.



Ring them up and ask them. if there isn't a bar on the account then ask them why you cant get through

Does Samsung U900 Soul Mobile phone save the last three people you sent text message too?



I just want to know that when you go to create a normal text message in this phone and then you go to add a recipient. The phone lists three contacts and then a line.



Basically, all I want to know is are these three people at it lists the last above the line, the last three people you sent text messages to?

the blackberry uses a proprietary browser that uses java to render pages , flash uses up too much battery so will not be in very many phones this year

-Would they give me a new phone? The upgrade they're talking about?
-Do I pay less now?
-Discount?
-Freebies?
-Do I just continue with my T-Mobile and never having to sign a contract again?

If the contract ended -then you are free.  You can continue to use their service normally as if you were in the contract.  When the contract ends -you can go to another carrier if you wish or cancel their services without a penalty.  If you decide to stay with them your monthly payment will be the same -no changes.  If you decide to get a new phone or in other words "upgrade" you will have to sign onto another contract -or extend.



I would switch vendors T-Mobile SUCKS!

I've never worked with T Mobile, but it's probably the same as any other company.  They may inform you that your contract is up and offer to renew it.  Most companies will offer you a new phone with a two year contract.  You probably won't pay less.

It's a good phone, espically if you do a lot of texting. The Pantech Matrix is better. I looked up the LetsTalk.com (no, I don't work for them) and they have it in  black, blue & red. it has:



- 3G technology for high-speed data



- Windows Mobile 6



- 1.3 Megapixel Camera - for Picture Messaging



- Bluetooth Wireless capable with A2DP



It's free through them  (w/AT&T signup/renewal) and comes with a 2gb kingstom memory chip.

i heard the phone is a cheap phone, it doesn't have very many good features, and get old fast. I would look at the samsung propel if your looking for a full QWERTY keyboard. The samsung propel, and this is what i've heard, is a nice phone, you can record music,it has fast internet, and good to text with.

How does the International Roaming Smart Buddy work?Does it work for you?



Please do not give me the website of the "smart.com.ph" because I already know and I have already read it but it doesn't show if the Smart Buddy International Roaming works.



Here's my question. Does the International Roaming of Smart Buddy work for you & how does it work? I might be going back to America in which I do not want to live my boyfriend here in the Philippines. I am scared to do International Roaming because there might be a slight chance that when I am in America, that the International Roaming does not work. For example, my uncle, and his gf were together and she got a job in Singapore but before she went, she registered to International Roaming. So they thought everything was going to be okay. When she got to Singapore, she never text and her cellphone was always off so that is probably a sign that her International Roaming might of not worked. How can I make sure that everything will be okay with the International Roaming? about the signal in America with the Smart Buddy International Roaming and every little detail. Please share. Thank you very much =)

Hiiii,



i think, its not fairly possible to get connect a cable with pc to record FM. bcoz, the mobile to pc connect's mostly through USB. so, its not possible.



[This idea seems silly, but u've asked so, i'v to tell u whatever possible way to fill ur thaught.



U've not mentioned ur mobile model.



so, jus try(if possible) to find a speaker out which matches ur mobile headset pin.



Connect the speakers.



Get a mic, keep it near the speaker.



In the pc, go for Start/Programs/Accessories/Entertainment... Recorder,



using this, u can record it. it may not be so much clear. jus try it]

<question>



Is this Koodo plan any good?



I am a cell phone noob!



I have decided to get with the program and get a cell phone and after much looking and comparing I came to this.



With Koodo I can get:



100min
unlimited messaging (text & pics)
unlimited evenings and weekends which start at 7pm and go till 8 am
call waiting & forwarding + conference calling



for $25



I will pay an extra $5 a month for call display



It works out to $33.60 a month



I know 100min isn't much but I don't plan on using it more than that.



I don't see how this can be beat. I will get the LG Keybo and pay $75 right off the bat and have the rest paid through the tab thing. Even if that is garbage for whatever reason the entire cost of the phone will be less than the fees other companies would charge for breaking a contract. I could leave Koodo whenever I wanted.



So what do you think?

2. 7310 classic



3. 3120 classic (3G handset,having FLASH to take clear pic on nights)

Seems like the .jar file that you're installing is corrupted - you don't need to install any other app for this, try downloading .jar file from another source and then copy it over to the phone.

You can probably use it now while you are reading this answer.



But just so you know,



Verizon has a some sort GPS tracker (part of the phone's navigational system) in most of their phones.



The owner could activate it to find his/her phone.

Well you can't use it. If the person reported it lost or stolen then you can't use it. Verizon basically black lists it so when you try to activate it toward your line it says it cannot happen.

Who else out there thinks the price of the cell phones is ridiculous? Looking at the new Blackberry and since verizon  signed me up for a new 2yr contract after giving me a exchange because the lg chocolate screen goes blank I can no longer get it at discount price...Verizon is really starting to get my nerves.  We are in a recession and they want to mark phones up past 500 dollars...

Can you keep the mobile phone after your plan finishes?



i want the sony ericsson c905 with virgin mobiles in australia. does anyone know after your plan finishes, do you keep your phone and can it be used with a pre paid sim card. the phone costs 12 dollars a month over 24 months so the phone would cost around 250 dollars. the regular retail price is 800 dollars so after the plan finishes, would you need to pay the other 600 because on virgin mobile's website, it says we pay 39 dollars of the phone a month



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Whilst you can keep the phone, it is "locked" to Virgin. This means you cannot use the phone with another company unless you pay a fee.



If you'd like to unlock the phone, call Virgin about the prices- it'll b e somewhere in the order of $20AUD.

1. It means u have a lot of SMS & MMS in it. Or u install a lot of applications in ur Memory card, that wil keep more files on ur phone memory too. Try avoiding install application in phone memory, except for Anti-Virus



2. Next thing, u can do so is, update ur software.



Just go to this website:



http://europe.nokia.com/softwareupdate



then follow the direction on the website and it should show u how to update your phone.



3. Just Reset Software.In before you backup memory of your phone.
Reset code is *#7370*.



4.format the memory card along with the phone memory and...do not restore phone memory back to the phone from the memory card.



Try these things...if it doesnt comes gud, get to ur nearest NOKIA centre.



give ur n73, a service. it wil come gud.

Download the Nokia PC Suite from Nokia.com and back up all the data of the phone using the app and once you did that open the Nokia PC Suite app and with the phone connected click on the "Update phone software" icon and then update the phones firmware and that will solve the problem.

Heyy!



You need to take it to a shop to get it unlocked because the phone won't be unlocked! Take it to one of those crappy back street shops and they'll be able to do it for you starting from around £5!



Good luck with that!

If you haven't tried a soft reset of the phone do that first. Problem still there, do a full back up of your phones data, it comes with a BU program. Then do a complete Hard Reset - its in the manual on page 46 Clear Storage - this sets the phone back to the factory defaults. If these don't work - call AT&T.

Cingular phone on tmobile...?



I want to trade someone phones but I have tmobile and they gave a Cingular phone, will I be able to use the Cingular phone with tmobile? If so, is their any special way I have to do it! And this might be a stupid question but if I do this and something happens with the phone what would I have to do to get another one considering I'm not a Cingular customer! Thanks to all answers



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You can use a Cingular phone on T-Mobile service if you unlock it to accept your T-Mobile sim card. I do it all the time because Cingular offers much better phones than TMobile If you break the phone then you're just out of luck because Cingular has no obligation to help you whatsoever and neither does T-Mobile.

Hi,



Well out of the 3 phones you mentioned, the only 1 that lives up to your required specifications is the Samsung E740 however this is probably the worst of the 3 phones based on battery life. I live in the UK so any suggestions I make to you will be based on outr market over here but I would recommed the following to handsets.



Nokia 6300 - 2mp camera, bluetooth, mp3 player, video player and explandable memory using micro SD



Sony Ericsson G502 - 2mp camera, bluetooth, mp3 player, video player and explandable memory using M2 memory sticks



Both phones are pretty similar feature wise but the Sony Ericsson in my opinion is the better looking of the 2.



Hope this helps!

This is your cell phone you are talking about, right? Don't use your cell phone. Instead use a public phone, if you can FIND one, as they seem to be going extinct, OR simply use any landline and call a local number.With a landline, only toll calls are listed with a number. The reason why all cell phone calls are listed is because ALL cell phone calls are toll calls, paid for by the minute. Now if they had a flat rate, like a landline does, the numbers would not be listed. The law requires the phone company to list all toll calls on the bill so you can see what you are actually paying for. Why are you so intent on hiding that you talk with your boyfriend? Are you ashamed of him, or it is that your parents do not approve? Who actually PAYS your phone bill, the one your father checks? Is it possible that he is simply keeping track of how you are spending HIS money?

I suggest you put it in your computer and retrieve all the important data from it. Do this unless it is read-protected or has any other specialised software blocking the above.



In that case, you can just get to the nearest Nokia service centre, and they would unlock it for you. However, the safety of your data is not guaranteed.



All the best.

There are annoying people who are calling my cell phone and leaving me unwanted voice messages. Is there a way to intentionally return the voicemail back to the sender?



Right now, I've completely stopped accessing my voicemail. I'm letting the messages just pile up. If I just leave the voicemails there without listening to them, will they be bounced back to the sender eventually?



If it matters, the service I'm using is AT&T Wireless.

How much will it cost for a mobile in the uk to text a mobile in australia?



i need to know how much it will cost for my friends to text me whilest im on holiday any help please thank you . :)



ASAP.

<answer>



Hi,



This of course network dependent but I work for Vodafone so I got a pretty good idea of all round costs. If you are using your UK mobile phone in Australia it will cost them the same as if you were in the UK but you will have to pay approx 35p per message to text them back. You will also have to pay for every incoming call you take as per your networks roaming charges. If you are using an Australian mobile number it will cost your friends approximately 35p per message to text you and probably about the same for you to text them back.



I hope this helps and I haven't over complicated my explanantion,



Have a good holiday



Nick

IPhone and AT&T Question?



I would like to get internet connection at all times with on a iTouch, but I know this isn't possible, seeing it's only WiFi able. So was thinking does AT&T, let you purchase a iPhone and get the 35.00 Data plan and not have a Voice Plan. Because the new iPhone 3G is 200, same as iTouch 8g, and this way for 35 a month could have the iTouch features with the iPhone internet for only 35.00 a month. Does anyone know if this is possible?

As far as getting the iPhone with data only, AT& T will not allow you to have a data plan without also having a voice plan. The only other way I can think of is getting the iPod touch with AT&T's high speed internet service for your home because it comes with free WiFi at participating locations like starbucks. You wouldn't have internet everywhere though.

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



3g and wifi are hardware-related and if it's not in the phone, then you can't use it. The w580i doesn't support 3g or wifi, so you can't "hack" into your network. Plus, there's no such thing as "hacking" into the 3g network because it depends on your carrier. T-Mobile does not have 3g support in the U.S. (yet), but AT&T as well as Sprint do. As for free mobile web, you can get the basic data plan for $4.99 a month if you have T-Mobile and download a mobile web browser call Opera Mini 4 from operamini.com (do it from your phone browser) and you'll be able to browse the web using Opera Mini. I'm not sure about Sprint or AT&T though, because I only have T-Mobile.

your bank won't tell you your pin code over the phone, however they can cancel your current pin and arrange for a new one to be sent out in the post - from their you should be able to change your pin to one you will remember

Phone your bank and tell them you've fogotten it, they'll issue you a new one.



With my bank they are not able to tell you your PIN over the phone. You have to wait for a new one to be issued and sent to you in the post. This can take a few days. In the mean time you have to withdraw any money from that account from the branch directly.

Will Updating My Unlocked Iphone Lock It Again ?



I currently have an unlocked iphone on 1.1.4 software and i have recently got my internet back. When i synced my iphone with itunes it asked if i wished to update to a new software which is 2.1. Im not sure wether to because to do it incase it locks it again, and with my unlocking company it cost £20 for the update. Also i have heard scince the release of iphone 3g pay and go that 2g iphone customers can get a pay and go sim card specially designed for iphone. (which is obviously made for people who have upgraded and want to give there old iphone to someone) i just wondered if it was true.

Can you have two different cell phone services?



I am thinking about helping my mom get a cell but she can't get cingular service where she lives yet so I was thinking about going Verizon for her. But in a year we will be able to get a cell again. Can I have a verizon service and still be eligible for Cingular? We have no problem getting a cell and have never had to pay any deposit or anything.

T-mobile research team? also i need help?



Does T-mobile really have a research team? or are they just lieing to me? I received a phone exchange. i put my phone in the box like they told me to and put the prepaid shipping label on. I sent the box with my old phone as they told me to. The phone i got was faulty so they told me to send it back. When i called them up yesterday, they said that they never received my first phone, but they received my second one. They said they can't do another exchange because they never received the first phone. I found out that the person who wrote the prepaid shipping label wrote a completely wrong address. Now someone else has the sidekick i sent. Will t-mobile charge me for a restocking fee because they never received the phone? I thought it would be their fault because they were the ones who wrote the prepaid shipping label and i was just following the instructions they told me to do.

You mean the handset research team? yeah, they're the ones who investigate issues with handset orders and returns when there's any problems.



Nobody writes the prepaid shipping labels, for exchanges, they're all printed with the return center address in LaGrange, Georgia, or they should be. You should be able to look up the shipping info for all of these shipments (including the address they went to) by putting in your phone number in the UPS site as a reference number. If it is found that your prepaid shipping label was used and the phone was still sent to the wrong address, likely the restocking fee can be adjusted.

I have a MOTO RIZR Z3 phone It uses Micro SD cards. Can i use a 4 GB card.Which is better-Sandisk/Kingston?



The phone id originally built for 2 GB. Can i use 4 GB / 8 GB Micro SD cards, without affecting the performance of the phone.
Also, WILL THE LENS OF THE CAMERA GET AFFECTED IF I FOCUS IT DIRECTLY TO THE SUN AND SHOOT PICS?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



technically, it was built for Micro SD cards. SD (SD, miniSD, microSD) cards can go only up to 2GB but that 4GB (or more) is not called a Micro SD card but a Micro SDHC. yes 'HC'. It's still the same architecture but different internal hardware. Its like a CD, a DVD and a CD looks exactly the same but the disc internals are different.



&gt;&gt;&gt; It will not work on your phone according to technical specs. But it might work (with a 10/90 chance).



About the brand, it doesn't really matter since SanDisk and Kingston are well known  memory-making companies.



About the camera lens, if you focus it on the sun itself it will get affected (UV and Balance). But if you take pictures on a sunny day (anything outside except the sun) then its fine.

On the 5610, the right softkey can't be changed unless you debrand your phone by flashing it. If it bothers you that much and if you can't flash phones yourself, you could always take it to a repair shop and have them do it. It'll probably cost $30-40.

Old vs new iPhone connector/cables?



Do the new and old iPhones use the same connectors. More specifically if a company is selling a USB cable for iPhone, will this definitely be compatible with my 3G iPhone if it's actually designed for the first iPhone?

Yes. All the USB dock connectors are the same for all iPods/iPhones except for the shuffle and the really old iPods.

you have an option to copy the numbers to the phone memory and then switch the sims and copy them from phone memory to sim memory. It's not as complicated as it sounds!

It can be simple to transfer data from one SIM card to another if you have the right gadget. I bought my kids a small device which will store all your numbers and which can then be used to download them onto a new SIM. It is a bit like a memory stick and very useful to have as my daughter found out when her phone was stolen.
Most phone shops will have them and they are not expensive but very useful. I did find, however, that if your provider is the 3 Network then they tend to be incompatible with other SIM cards so it depends on your network.
There is usually software provided with a phone also whereby you can download all your data onto a computer so that it can be put onto a new SIM from there.
I would suggest that you pop into a Mobile phone store and just ask for details and they should be able to advise you.

Last time I wanted a phone unlocked I went to my local market stall, they did it for 10 pounds and I could use any network after that.
Much cheaper than paying O2 or 3G!
However, I didn't know you could get computer software to do it yourself, very cool!

Definitely BlackBerry - they're world leaders in what they do, which is specialising in email and internet on the go, plus does phone, the camera, media, gps and that normal sort of stuff.  Also really easy to download new applications games, themes etc.



The BlackBerry Pearl is really neat and tidy - smaller than other phones.  I've ordered a pink pearl recently! The new Pearl Flip looks really smart but not sure if it's available yet.



I'm after a Bold for work at the moment though - not as small as some phones but still looks good and has the qwerty keyboard which is a must if you type loads of emails.



Whatever you do don't go for an old one with the wheel on the side - they really are too big and chunky.



If you just want a phone to make calls, take photos and send texts then it really doesn't matter though.

Blackberry if you want a really good tool. If you want loads of games and a video function get a Sony.
I have changed to a Blackberry and find the keyboard fantastic. The multiplicity of functions and easiness of use is great. But games to download are limited and I have no video camera.



However I need this phone for my business, to plan my appointments and to get my emails etc etc and am fully satisfied with it.

Unless you use internet apps and have a need for sending and receiving email on the move a BlackBerry would be overkill IMHO.



But if that's what you're looking for I would recommend holding out for the new Pearl Flip if you can. Link below...

it has to connect to the stereo. You may be able to plug it into the cigarette lighter but as the cigarette lighter isn't connected to the sound system you would need to then attach portable speakers to your ipod. if you can connect it to the radio/cd player you will be able to play it through your cars speakers. the cigarette lighter only acts as a power source.

Is it possible to transfer my messages from W810 to pc?, how?



I've already installed "sony ericsson file manager" and "sony ericsson pc suite", but none of them has got the ability of transferring my messages from my cellphone to pc.
I used to do this with samsung, apparently ericsson doesn't have it.

You can not "text" on an old rotary telephone. Do you have internet service? I think all or most all telephones can be sent messages via an internet address. Verizon phones would be 10 digit phone number@vtext.com

the new sidekick 2008 is a great phone! if your upgrading from the LX it wont be much of an upgrade ( i have both the 2008 and the LX). if you owned a previos sidekick before this take a look at this..
http://www.hiptop3.com/archives/how-to-g...



but if not you wont be disappointed with a sidekick. great for multitasking. you could be texting, instant messaging (aim/msn/yahoo) , browsing the web, and listening to music at the same time and the phone will not lag at all.  great keyboard (simply the best). your contacts are never lost because they're backed by dangers servers. so i'd say go for the tmobile sidekick 2008. its $150 us dollars with a 2 year extension or i believe $300 retail price. great price, great phone. and you can also customize your own shells online using your own pictures.  there is also this forum site called poweredbydanger. basically a sidekick community. everyone there will be glad to help (including me xD) here's the link..

No, even with the card. You need to activate it with a carrier. If you got sim go to T-mobile although i dont reccommend them, Verizon is the way to go.

I'd either take it back where I got it or call the # on your cell phone bill & tell them.  Sometimes they can update your phone with new software which helps signal-wise.

My phone wont take its memory card..? Or any other memory card.?



Right now I've been using the same Chinese phone for about 6 months. And up until around 2 weeks ago the memory card formatted itself and now i cant put pictures, songs, videos NOTHING. Even when i try someone else's memory card on my phone it doesn't work! Its getting frustrating and everywhere i go to ask to get it fixed they say they can't help me. Is there anyway i can do this myself. When i tried to restore factory settings it asked me for a password that i never made up, and when i did it on the computer it still didn't do nothing.
Oh and btw please don't tell me that my phone is cheap and to go get another one im not made out of money.

Heya. I work for the Carphone Warehouse. Just a few questions...



1) What is the make & model of your phone?
2) What type of memory card is it, M2 or MicroSD (All Sony Ericsson's only take M2 memory cards)
3) How big is the memory card (what GB)? Because older phones may only be able to take up to 1GB memory cards?

i had a sidekick... The sidekick has its own plan... to get the internet and features for an extra 20 bucks a month..the sidekick its self is very expensive 200 i believe but it may be cheaper if u aare creating a whole new line  I would check the t mobile website.. and u can pick out the phone you want and the phone contract and before paying for it it will tell u how much



Before buying the phone make sure your gonna like it...
its a big phone and the keyboard is full.
I switched to it from a tiny flip phone and it was so hard to get used to...i actually sent it back cause it was not for me. If u think its you go for it!!

I have had tons of bad cell phones.  Ones that break or have internal problems.  I suggest doing some research online to see about the quality.  Try and find what problems other people are having and decided if those are problems that you are willing to deal with.  Try this link. I really like their reviews.

Don't charge the phone overnight. Newer phones have a new type of battery. Charge it until the battery full. It usually takes around 2-3 hours from completely empty to full.

Is there a KF700, did you mean the KF750? If so, i'd say the KF750. There has been quite a few problems with the Viewty. It always seems to break. And the KF750 is cheaper too!

You can't get them back on your phone, but if they're important enough, you can use a SIM card reader and some software, like PhoneFile PRO, to read and copy the deleted files onto your PC. You can also print them out if you wanted to, but do be aware that the messages would need to be important because the software plus card reader will cost about £100.

You may be able to find someone who can do it for you at a much lower cost, but bear in mind that any new messages received or sent after the deletion can, and probably will 'overwrite' the deletions, so if you want to do it, do it now.

i have both, and the iphone 3g. The voyager could not be more useless for any other feature than the phone itself, and text messaging. it is REALLY great for fast texting, and the Lg dare is just a more business inquired version of the touch screen voyager with no full keyboard, and its slimmer. So if you are awesome, get the iphone, if like to text, get the voyager, and if you are a hard working business man, get the dare.

I have the SAME problem, and I am having trouble deciding which one to get. My husband and I were talking about it and we decided to go with the Voyager. The Dare is completely touch screen, so if something happens to the screen then we are screwed. If something happens to the screen on the Voyager, at least I have the texting and I would still be able to call until I got a new phone. The Dare is truly awesome though, but everyone at Verizon had no idea how to run it, I knew more about it than they did, and it was the first time I had used it. If I ever have a problem with the Dare, who in the hell could I go to for help? That's why I think we picked the voyager.



Good Luck on your decision!

Delete, then reinstall.

Since you already paid for it, you get to download for free as many times as you want.

As far as I'm aware, you simply ring them and give them 30 days notice to cancel.  A lot of people think it's a fixed term contract, e.g. 18 months, but that is not the case with a simplicity sim-only deal.  Just ring them from your mobile and they'll happily talk you through the procedure.

Hi couple of things MSN is not yet available on the sidekick only Yahoo messenger there are talks going on to allow this in the future, and the sidekick is only available on T-Mobile as it is exclusive to them and no other network has the authority to add on the danger feature that is needed to allow all features of the sidekick to work if you try to use it on another network the only thing you can do is make calls and send texts (no internet, messanger or access to the sidekick catalogue you need this to download anything to the phone.)

The network may be down or something has become corrupt on your phone and may need to be reset by your carrier.  I went through this a few days ago when my sis sent me like 10 picture messages and I didn't get not one of them til about 2 days later!

You can't block a particular number on your phone, and neither can the network.  There is something you can do, copy the phone book entry from the sim card onto the phone memory - there will be some new options listed, one of which is to assign them a "personal ringtone" which you set as silent.  They can still call and text you but you won't be disturbed.

I am on contract with the phone company 3, on their £15 a month 300 minutes or texts price plan. Will i be charged if microsoft phone me and im in malta?

I am with Three and have just come back from France, I believe you will be charged with receiving the call but they have one of the lowest rates for taking call outside the UK.I can't remember how much but it is less than 30pence per minute.Give them a call 123 from your hand set and they will tell you.It would also be a good idea to make sure international roaming is unlocked on your phone  good luck

How to text message/phone Canada from a mobile in the Uk?



Now, i've managed to text a friend in Canada from the Uk, but only through a Uk number which converted her phone number, when replying.
Whereas she's able to phone and/or text me on my normal number.

Just wondering if given Canadian numbers, if it's possible to phone/message them? The only way I've been able to was replying to her messages.

I know all about the call codes, but still have no luck? What am i doing wrong?

That's the great thing about Apple and the iPhone. They don't give you a manual with the phone only on apple.com/iPhone. Hopefully you can get your phone and Bluetooth to work after going there.

How do I get my SanDisk memory card to work on my phone?



I have an LG CU500 phone. I ran out of room on my 1GB SanDisk memory card which worked perfect, so I bought a 2GB.  Big mistake.

I put it in the phone and it says "Card not ready" over and over, it never works, so I check online and see 2GBs don't work with the CU500, so I figure I'll go back and get a 1GB but now my old 1GB card which I have not had any problem with in over a year gives me the same error "Card not ready" which really pisses me off because I had a lot of pictures on there I hadn't put on my computer yet. So now that I tried to use the 2GB and my phone is just rejecting everything for some reason.

A lot of people suggested hitting 277634# or something like that and its supposed to bring up some menu but every time I do that it gives me an error which says "Unexpected Data", then it closes.

So ya, I don't care about the 2GB memory card any more or the money I wasted or anything I'd just like to be able to get the old one to work again because I had a lot of pictures of family and friends and vacations to places I probably won't be able to go back to for years.

If anyone knows what to do or has any suggestions I would really appreciate it.

Samsung Tocca - Watching videos?



Hi,



Has anyone with a Samsung Tocca (F480) had any problems with the video quality? I tried to watch Youtube clips today on the phone and although I could access the website and actually watch videos, the quality was terrible, it was really distorted and the sound quality was bad, despite the good sound quality on the music player.



If anyone knows of anything you can do to fix this, ie is there any settings I can change on the phone to be able to watch videos properly, any help is much appreciated! Thanks

You absolutely can, because my partner and I have done exactly that.  We are also with 3 and my partner was told during a phone call that they were increasing their charges for non-direct debit payments.  We argued that it was an unfair variation of our contracts, and because of that we had a right to cancel.  Customer Services rejected this, but we didn't accept that.  We contacted the press office (their number's on the website).  They rang my partner and told him to expect a call from the Chief Executive's Office.  The CEO rang us and agreed that we were right.  We cancelled the contracts, .giving 30 days notice, and received our letters this morning confirming this.  You have to go via customer services first as the press office won't deal with you till then.  Hope this helps.

Glad your sorted. 3 have phoned my partner and I twice each today offering us new contracts, with the same non-direct debit fees, statement fees, and round-up of charges.  Watch out for these calls and get all the facts before you commit to anything.

Call the network provider as they should be able to block it for you, both phone and SIM. If they won't do this then I'm afraid there's possible nothing you can do.

It's free if you download the correct unlocking software for your phone and have a USB data cable for the phone.

The software you need depends on what make and model of phone you have.

It cannot be unlocked for free on the internet. Any site that says they can unlock for free is a con. My best advice is take it to your local market and get them to do it. I searched the internet high and low a few weeks ago and ended up being conned out of a fiver. I then took it to our local market and they had it done in seconds via a laptop. I asked the man about unlocking via the internet and even he said its a con. The software they use is very expensive and is constantly being updated. It only cos me £10. The man said it depends on the phone as to the price and I think he said 3g phones are more expensive to unlock.

Hope this helps

Depending on how long you've had your handset for your network provider may do this for free, if your contract is up then most providers will do it for free or a low charge. If its PAYG you may have to wait a few months before they do this. I would advise going to your local 3 shop or the market as already advised. Completely ignore any 'on-line' offers as you cannot do this. There is software available to download but it is a bit complicated to do this. You can follow the link below if you feel confident enough. Otherwise, it's down to the local market. That's going to be your easiest and possibly cheapest. If you got your handset from a high street retailer like Carpho.../phones... then your handset may already be unlocked as the shops usually buy in unlocked handsets and just supply the required networks SIM with it.

when you touch the screen to create a text. it automatically does the following:-

touch recipients box and  you have choice of entering number by keypad that pops up or a list or 'previous', 'phone book' or 'group'.

click on the message are and a keypad appears for you to type in the message with predictive or not (predictive on samsung is wonderful)

its as easy to use as a keypad based phone but clearer as space to touch is bigger and its interactive when keys are not!

I would definetly go with the 16GB iPhone 3G. Verizon is pretty good too. The LG Voyager and LG Dare are both cool phones and both are with Verizon. Sprint just sucks in general. The Instinct(Sprint's iPhone wannabe) is okay, but it's nowhere near as good as it was hyped up to be. And like I said sprint just sucks in general. But yeah, if I could have any phone I want right now, I would get the 16GB iPhone.

Sounds like your phone is trying to load its operating system.  Unless it has a way to obtain that OS, it can't go any further.  It's just as though your computer had lost Windows, and didn't have a source to get THAT.  You'll either need to find some kind of source for that OS (not very likely), or you'll need to ship it back to the manufacturer and have them load it, which may cost a few bucks.  You'll almost certainly be better off simply buying a new phone, and getting Verizon to put it on their network in place of your old one.

when you dropped it in water did you take the battery out and let it dry out? sometimes you can do that and take a hair dryer on low heat and dry the circuit board and it work other wise there is nothing you can do except get a new phone. if you have contract with someone and it has insurance they will replace it for free or fraction of the cost.

Yes you can change networks and keep your old number. It's no big deal. The simplest way to do this is to buy your phone in a phone shop and get the people in there to manage the changeover for you. Much simpler than having to go through ringing customer care yourself :)

I think around 70-100 something a month because if you get the iphone, you have to pay $30.00 for this data plan that you have to get.& then its all up to you of picking the minutes :)

this really has nothing to do with the iphone but your usage patterns its like asking how long is a piece of string. - it depends on how long you cut it or  in yur answer how much you use the phone.  for £75/month you get:-

unlimited (500MB/mo) data charges on 3G
3000 minutes of calls
500 texts.

NOW thats a lot of talk time and texts if you use more than this  a month  you perhaps need to view how you use the phone!

if you want more info go to www.o2.co.uk/iphone/paymonthly

Any way to unlock LG Chocolate for an 02 sim card for free?



Hey my sister has an LG chocolate on Orange which she no longer uses but her other phone on o2 has a broken screen and she wants to switch her sim cards so she can use her old LG chocolate. Is there a way to unlock the phone for an o2 sim card without her having to pay stupid money? Thanks :)

If I was you I would have a professional do it. I mean what's the point of you or someone else trying to unlock it and then messing it up and it costing you even MORE to repair/ buy a new one.
That's my advice. ;)

I received unlock codes from my cellphone provider. THEY WERE WRONG and my phone locked. I had to send it to the manufacturer [Samsung] provide a copy of my invoice when I purchased the phone. It took several weeks to have the phone returned. The answer to your question.......I do not trust them. I found a cellphone store locally and he charged me $15.00USD to unlock the phone is 5 minutes. I've had 4 phones unlocked by this chap without any problems and FAST.

Can people view stuff on your phone when it's been barred?



And is there anyway to get a phone unbarred?

I recently had a samsung d900 on one of Vodafone's contracts, I had it for 3 months then it got stolen, i had no insurance or anything. So I rang them up and they blocked the sim card, and the phone.

But.. people say there is a way to get phone's unbarred, it wouldn't bother me if they did, but would they be able to see all the stuff on the phone that was on it before? like SMS messages, pictures, videos etc etc.

And would they have access to anything else?

The SIM card has been barred from accessing the network so anybody who had it in their possession couldn't run up your bill.  Anything stored on it may still be accessible if you didn't have a PIN code set up on it so somebody may still be able to see your phonebook and SMS messages stored on it.

As for the phone itself, it is possible to get it unbarred - however for anyone to do that they would have to get Vodafone to remove the bar, which would require them to have a lot of information associated with you, which they will not be in possession of.  Anything you had saved to it may be visible to the sticky fingered individual that has your phone.



The good news is you can still have your old number on a different SIM card so you can keep that much.  For future reference Vodafone offer a service on their website to back up your contact list in case of such eventualities.  Often getting all your contacts back is the hardest part of having a phone stolen.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to give me a shout.

I highly recommend this site in general for mobile phone reviews http://www.mobile-review.com/review-en.s... and I totally agree with everything they say on D900 here http://www.mobile-review.com/review/sams... My friend has the D900 and it's FREAKING AMAZING!! Sound quality is pristine both through speaker and headphones and the screen is simply stunning. Camera is THE BEST EVER and the whole thing just oozes quality and class. It's a truly amazing phone and easily the best of Samsung's current crop of slide phones. Hope that helps :-)

, which carrier do you have?

actually, i dont know much about koodo, i know that its a cool company though, i might switch to it. 
why don't you email ventones? they have a contact us page on the top of their menu, and tell them exactly that. they helped me with my telus until we finally got it working.

No, it will be under your friend's bill (which doesn't matter, as he has a data plan).  The sim card stores all of the billing and phone number information; the phone doesn't have anything to do with it.  In fact, at&t has no way of knowing when people switch sim cards to different phones.  So if you switched sim cards with him, you could go online for free, under his plan (but you would also recieve his calls and texts on your phone).  But anything he did on his phone with your sim card would be charged to you.

To make it less technical and less complicated here is a simple breakdown.



CDMA (verizon, sprint, alltell) have their phones with integrated sim cards which means that you are stuck with the phone and the provider most of the time. In other words if you have a verizon phone it will not work with sprint or alltell (exception to this rule is some blackberry phones) and vice versa.



GSM (att & tmobile) have their phones which you can swap sim cards from one carrier to another by keeping one phone. Yes the phones sold by these carriers are locked but you can get those phones unlocked.



another good thing is GSM is used worldwide and cdma isnt namely only 8 countries use cdma due to its rural coverage is better compared to gsm.



if you are gong to travel around world on business trips or frequent personal trips i suggest purchase an unlocked GSM phone which is a quadband and you can use any sim card prepaid or post paid in the world with your GSM quad band phone.



Same luxury cannot be achieved in cdma phones.



hope this was simple and easy to understand and helped you

Good luck!

Basically the phones talk to the networks in a completely different language. 
GSM (global system for mobile telecommunication) is by far the most popular network type with around 203 countries using this technology. They use SIM (subscriber identity module) cards to identify the user on the network and to store contacts and SMS messages. 
CDMA (code divisional multiple access) is used in very few countries - mainly those with ties to the USA. The individual handset serial (ESN) number is transmitted to the network and this identifies the user as SIM cards are not usually used on this system.

Both network types have had later overlays allowing faster data speeds for handling things like email and picture messaging. The latest GSM networks utilising HSDPA (high speed packet downlink access) are called 3G networks and allow broadband data speeds for video calling and full music track downloads and assisted GPS.
If you want a handset to handle everything you can throw at it and be able to travel anywhere in the world then it needs to be a GSM 3G phone - try a Nokia 6210i navigator!

My boyfriend had the wing and at first used a stylus, but when it got broken he just used his fingers. You could use either. The stylus is obviously more comfortable to use and its more accurate, but if you have smaller fingers its all the same really.

I have two friends who have owned RAZR's and they both loved them... theres slim, and modern- although rather on the long side when opened up..

The PEBL however, I don't know much about- it's newer thats for sure, but it doesn't look as nice, and can imagine it doesn't just slip into your pocket..

the RAZR comes in so many versions and colours, so I reckon you'd be better of with it, plus u can take pics using the front camera and screen which is really cool!!!

i used to have the razr ... it was for a 12 month contract and the phone only lasted for 5 months before all sorts of things went wrong with it!



i was advised years ago never to buy motorola and having bought the razr i learnt very quickly why - they are diifficult to use, the functions are slow and well out of date, and they are incapable of lasting the duration of the contract.



if i were you i would look at other brands, ie. samsung or nokia etc.

good luck with your choice.

Try noise canceling headphones, the ones with there own power supply. There meant  for airplane use, but have a considerably higher base level then normal headphones. (With out the higher price.) Target or Walmart should sell them, and if there not what your looking for you can always return them.
