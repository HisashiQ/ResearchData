I don't have a clue what they are for, if you like a question and think it is interesting, you give the asker a star.



Here is one for you which may help more to answer your question, as I feel a bit of a fraud for answering as I don't have a clue where you other one went and what happens if you get one!

Stars are just to show that you have an interest in the question or if you want a book mark. I use them for a book mark for the questions I want to keep. If you get a star, all it means is someone thinks your question is interesting, or again, they want to book mark your question

The stars on Yahoo Answers mark an interesting question. The stars are also about happy shining brightness ;)
Will I give you one? Will I??
The one that you have...was never used...:S either you gave one or received some. Where did it go: To Bethlehem.
Q6 Yes, I give them out, the stars are blue, but not you too (in other words you're happy? joke? rhyme? Yes? No? Maybe? Lobster?? y/n:_)
Can you have one...Can you? I suppose you have the ability, yes.
What happens if you get one? You catch it, put it in your pocket and save it for a rainy day ;)
you're welcome. I believe I'm the first person to answer ALL of your 8 questions in a row, so I hope you value this star (*)

Well yes they can, as its all done via coding. Instead of seeing characters, the letter is regonised as a number. So say when they see the word " day " the code could be say "4125". Thats what would appear. Now when certain digits are placed together it flags up and sensors it.

Well, many people do swap around the c and u in the F-Word so people can still tell what it is.



Even though everyone can still read the words, they will post it as long as it is not the correct spelling, so they just censor the incorrect spelling, which means people that spell terribly will still be able to swear.

What manner of fiendish code are you using here, Scoundy? I can't decipher a word! Is it what we used to fox Gerry during the war - you know, the old Enigma system? Anyway, being female I really don't need to be worrying about stuff like that, do I.
However, I CAN possibly get my head round the "naughty words" aspect of your Q. I actually feel Yahoo's matronly attitude serves us all well in that it encourages us to use language more imaginatively. For example where p*ss holes, ***, & **** would never get through, peewee-funnel, rump-dumpling, & bunny-flaps just might....

Remember some one once asked about going to work for a large retail group here in the UK and got a lot of negative answers I said to try it don't listen to people make your own mind up when you have tried it they did and E-mailed me a couple of times to let me know how they were doing, which was a great feeling that some one is prepared to take time out (ok just a couple of minutes) and make the effort to make contact.
If you answer a question and would like to know the outcome of the situation let them know in your answer you don't mind them E-mailing you they can contact you via Y/A.

For Level 1's its used to show them the ropes and get used to the site.
Also to 'somewhat' control Trolling and Spam.
Which is a becoming a big problem on the site.
Once you reach Level 5 you have no limit so strive to reach the goal.

First, I'd like to say... welcome to Yahoo! Answers!

Here are the point requirements for each level.
1 ► 1-249
2 ► 250-999
3 ► 1,000-2,499
4 ► 2,500-4,999
5 ► 5,000-9,999
6 ► 10,000-24,999
7 ► 25,000+

Get 250 pts. and you'll be on level 2.



Things you might need to know:

RATING: You can "rate" answers with "thumbs up" and "thumbs down." Just click on the “thumbs up” icon to give someone a “thumbs up” and show you approve of or like their answer; same but reverse meaning with “thumbs down,” click on the icon to show you disapprove or don’t like the answer.. It doesn’t cost you any points to “rate” an answer but, once you do rate, you’re stuck with that rating. You can’t later change your mind and decide they don’t deserve the “thumbs up” or have regrets about giving a “thumbs down.” They’re forever.

STARS: Stars are ways to show approval for questions. You click on the star icon to give a star, click on the same place to remove your star after you give it. No points involved..

VOTING: Vote for "best answer" on unresolved questions “in voting” and you get 1 pt. per question. You can vote by clicking on the “answer” toolbar at the top of the page then click on the “vote” tab or, when you see the list of questions available in a particular category, there’s a “vote” tab at the top of the questions. Either way, if you vote then you earn a point per question and help pick the “best answer.”

The point system is at this site: http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...

Good luck, you'll be on level 2 in no time and then aim for level 3 (1,000 to 2,499 pts.)

Yes it does come up for every misspelled word.  If you're not satisfied, or just haven't figured out how it works (or think some words are misspelled and aren't)  submit your question, then immediately click on "edit".  The old "Check Spelling link will be there.  Do your manual spell check the old way.

If you have a pop up blocker program it may be keeping the spellchecker from popping up. You may need to turn it off when you are writing something and turn it back on when finished.

I know what you mean. the other day I posted a joke with was only a bit rude and was deemed unacceptable. Yet some people are completely racist and highly offensive and they carry on asking questions without getting suspended for days. I think it partly depends on whether the do-gooders on this site get around to reporting you or not.

surprised this question got posted. cos they obviously filter them.

Are you racist against Americans or what? Sometimes if i answer a question that just so happens to be in this section, like this one, when i go back to answer more questions i will be in the UK section unknowingly.  If i happen to post a question, it will go in your section. Also there is 6 to 7 or 8 hours time difference in the US. You are ahead of us. Sometimes when i am up until 3:00 or 4:00am i am bored & there are not may Americans online to answer my questions because  most of us are sleeping, so i go to this section. But I dont ask questions that i know people in the UK cant answer. Besides, Yahoo is American to begin with, like almost everything else that you use. If it wasnt for our technology you all would still be living in the stone age.  If you have a problem with it, change your options to UK questions only & leave us alone.

I don't see the point in answering someones question just to write some nonsence like a lot of people do- this isn't a message board for silly comments.
It seems no one on here takes Real questions seriously enough, which is a shame because the concept of Yahoo Answers if very good.

Coffee Break/Breather.
It is when they are fiddling with the system.
This can often be bypassed by back clicking, waiting a few seconds and then continuing.
If that doesn’t work try another country.
Click on a flag at the bottom.
I am on Yahoo Australia and if we are having that problem so I switched to Yahoo New Zealand.
Check that you haven’t done your daily limit. 
If you are using the percentage button that will also bring it up.

its OK if you take notice of it,, What is the problem? ,,Only thing is it geared to American spelling and it highlights  as errors completely correct English spellings. . Surely in this technological age it should be able to accept as correct either of the alternative spellings .  Also the punctuation thing is a bit of a nuisance  ..  But if it helps a lot of questions and answers to be more legible  ,  then it's fine.

Write what you're writing, the click "spell check",  and then it will show any errors you've made, along with spelling suggestions.



OR
 Write what you are writing, and push "enter" on your keyboard and there should automatically pop up a little icon ob the right of the screen.

Double-check in your profile that you still have the option set to receive those emails. However, Yahoo has been having trouble with this feature for a while.
An easier way to find them than looking on the homepage is to go into your profile and select the page 'My Network's Q&As' (in blue, right under the search box). You'll still have to figure out what's new, but at least it's just your contacts and fans, not everybody.

Yes your contacts can see them.
So can your 'fans'. If you are having problems then check out who is on your fan list.
I think it's wrong that people can add you and see your q & a's without your permission.

Does anyone else think the Yahoo Answers spell checker is bloody annoying?



It tells me I've mis-spelt a word before I've even finished typing the word, it's bloody condescending. And sometimes it tells me I'm using too much punctuation, when the punctuation I'm using is perfectly adequate, what retard added that bit of code?

Yes, I hate that bit about the punctuation. It's like, who taught these people to speak/write English? I consider myself well educated in that area & resent being told by an American of all people, that I am not correct.We all know what Americans have done to the English language! No offence to the individual  American of course. lol

I think the tips in general are annoying and condescending. [Tip - be as specific and detailed as you can.] [Hm . . . it looks like you have used a lot of punctuation.] I can use as much punctuation as I b*@^%y want! [Oops! It looks like you have 1 misspelling(s).]

[Open Spell Checker] - It doesn't like Hmm - I change it to Hm.
Oops! It looks like you have 2 misspelling(s).

It now doesn't like the Hmm I put in to explain about the spell checker.
[Ignore].

Aargh - it is like bashing your head against a brick wall. What is the point of it anyway? Are Yahoo! assuming we are all a bunch of morons who don't have the confidence to type anything without some electronic guidance?

[Oops! It looks like you have 3 misspelling(s).]

They do actually charge you 5 points for each question you ask but when you choose a best answer you get a refund of 3 points.

Surely you are not asking if they charged 5 pence (actual money) for each question you ask whether or not you would still ask questions?  If that is actually your question you might perhaps want to edit this question or post another question. 5p could mean 5 points as well as 5 pence.  Your question could be regarded as ambiguous.

If they charged you 5 pence for a question they would need a link to a bank account or they would have to have some other arrangement for paying.  Presumably very few people would be interested in such a charging system.

Get answers from millions of real people.?



I have a 8 week old chihuahua and she cannot walk straight, she tumbles, leans to one side, I have taken her to the Vet and he said that in time she might walk. Does anyone know what I could do to help her. She is very tiny also only weighs 14.5oz. She eats normaly, she has a hard time when she goes to the bathroom, because she cannot keep her balance I have to help her balance. The Vet seems to think nothing is wrong, but I have had many puppies and have never seen anything like this before. Anyone have any ideas what I could to do to help her or what might be wrong. Thanks

I think your vet needs a reality check! The puppy may have sustained brain damage at birth, or sometimes ear problems can cause vertigo in both animals & humans.

Edit: Try another vet.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



A "Top Contributor" is a member of the Yahoo Answers community who has shown that they are knowledgeable in a certain category. Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.
You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section. The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members.
It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get one although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret.

I would imagine it takes quite a long time, because a top contributor is someone who answers alot of questions and gets voted best answer in most of them. 
Hope this helped you..

You can hold TC badges in up to 3 lowest-level categories at once (except 'Polls&Surveys' and 'Jokes&Riddles'). Badges come and go on Monday mornings. Yahoo keeps the formula secret, and it's subject to change at any moment. It probably also varies from category to category. Experienced users have formed guesses, but they're just GUESSES.
You probably need around:
- 30-50 answers per week in the category
- at least 20 'best answers' in the category within the last 3 weeks
- 200 or more total points per week (including all answers, B.A.s, votes, and 'thumbs ups') in the category
Concentrate on participating regularly and giving high-quality answers in just a few categories to earn or keep a badge.

Why? They already got their prize, the Top Contributor badge is their prize. It shows that they are knowlegable in a category or more than one. It would'nt be fair if only Top Contributors got it and not others. Then that would mean, if you get prizes for being a Top Contributor, then everyone would want to be one. Which is a hard task to get the badge.

Why dont people pick best answer if people have bothered to answer why cant they be bothered to read them?



earlier today I read through the voting questions and was surprised how many there were even those saying urgent please answer some people give silly answers just to get 2 points then there are those not picking answer so loosing 3 points does not make sense

I have often wondered this myself - only once have I not given a best answer - and that's because I got stranded miles from anywhere during the 12 hours up to the cut off point!  When I came to look at the answers though - they were all complete cr@p anyway - so I was spared having to choose from the best of the worst!

Since I came back to answer here on my home ground a couple of weeks ago, I have noticed that this phenomenon is much more prevalent here on Answers UK than elsewhere: indeed, the majority of the questions I answer here seem to go to the vote.

I have considered this, and I think it's cultural. Many British people are anti-elitist. I get the impression that a lot of users think that taking part is its own reward and "winning" isn't important. I get the impression they consider it unsporting or immoral to set one answer above the others. That is a point of view I can well understand, having frequently had cause to curse the mechanism which only allows us to choose one best answer out of maybe half a dozen which, objectively, are equally worthy of reward.



But personally, I have always considered it a moral obligation to assign best answer. I may have forgotten once and that can happen to anyone. Yes, it can be a bind, but I think it's the minimal sacrifice which shows respect to everyone who's taken the trouble to give a decent answer, showing that you've taken the trouble to read and evaluate their answers. Only one can be rewarded, but I hope they all feel respected and appreciated.

What if they just removed the "report button" altogether and made it harder to report someone?



Simply because you do not share the same opinion as others, does that give someone the right to remove questions?

I agree that if a question is in bad taste, sexually explicit, racist or sexist than there is a legitimate reason for reporting.



But when I see so many innocent questions being removed, I can't help but wonder if there would be another way of dealing with things?

Maybe e-mail the offender first (provided they have an open e-mail).



Your thoughts please....?

Too many questions and answers are removed from yahoo because some people dont like or agree with them. It only takes two people to report and the offending question is removed never to return. If yahoo are going to allow reporting then they should put more into their appeals system and actually use real people to look at your appeal instead of sending you a bog standard reply

If only they would take the time to consider both sides, I suppose that might actually take up too much time on their parts - gotta consider their profit margins.

In general, questions or answers don't get reported because people have a difference of opinion.  Although it does happen, more often it's because someone (or more than one person) recognizes a question or answer as a violation and reports it.  No one has the power OR the ability to remove questions other than the Y!A Team.

An answer can be "innocent" and still be a violation.  It doesn't have to sexually explicit, nor does it have to be rude or offensive to be a violation.  It could be something as simple as a chat violation.  Questions like "Am I pretty"? is a violation.  As well as How's the weather"? "What's for dinner"?, etc.

But.. I would also tend to agree that the report button is still used way too often.

the whole report thing is bogus, as everyone is free to report. i think removing questions/answers should be possible only to yahoo staff, keeping in mind they're strict. at least it'll prevent countless deletion by haters, and trolls...

sometimes, your right, people are lazy and simply do not care enough to take the time and thank those that answered by giving the best answer.

others do not know how. if someone is new on yahoo answers and asking their first question, they might not realize you have to pick a best answer, and they aren't on frequently enough to see the notices yahoo puts out for them.

some recieve many great, helpful answers and cannot choose for themselves, so they let voters decide.

Most of the time, there are many great answers they will receive, so they have a hard time choosing them, other times, they have no time, and probably are on vacation or somewhere, and haven't noticed their question not having a best answer to it. A lot of new members on here, need help, and sometimes don't know how to select a best answer. At least if the person doesn't choose a best answer, it'll be set to voting for the voters to choose the best answer, and get 1 point.

I think quite a few just ask and run. I've seen questions with like 1 or 2 answers and they were unresolved after like a week still. Heck I think after about a day you should resolve your question, because you rarely get any more answer. Now the one question I asked that I didn't resolve it was because no one gave an actual answer. So I voted as no best answer once I could. I personally think Yahoo would do a great service to let us vote it as no BA and just not give the points back if that is the winner.

bloody hell,... someone posted a answer i wanted to post,...

its true, occasionally there are more good answers to a question & its difficult to chose which is the better answer. I wish I could simply award 5 pts to each of the great answers to a question of mine. It just isn't fair!!

Then on the other hand, from time to time, I don't always check a question because I'm busy with other obligations & responsibilities or just plain forget (must be gettin old).

Sometimes there are questions I really really want to chose a best answer on but i miss the deadline to chose by a few hours, so the default kicks in and I lose me opportunity. - the best way to prevent this is to extend the deadline to give you a few more days to remember to choose or you lose.

you cannot make the picture visible like the avatar. But, all you have to do is copy and past the URL code into your question or answer.

If you want a photo/custom picture as your avatar you need to make a yahoo 360 page. http://360.yahoo.com/login.html?.done=ht...

The photo needs to be saved on your computer as a jpg file, don't worry about the size to much yahoo will adapt it.



1&gt; Click "my page” top of page.

2&gt; Click "edit personal photo" on the left above photo window.

3&gt; Click “browse” choose the photo from your photos click save, Set as primary and save.



4&gt; Go to your “edit my profile” http://answers.yahoo.com/my/my_edit  click  “use my yahoo 360 picture” scroll down and press "preview", and then "OK" in the next screen.
And your done.

Some users are experiencing a delay with the 360 avatar showing. it can take some time to show but it will eventually so try to be be patient.

<question>



I have twice now posted a question, which ive automatically been informed is over the 110 letter limit?



why is this happening?

previously, when you hit the limit...you were physically unable to add any more letters...you didnt have to count your letters!

has there been some idiotic glitch with recent updates to yahoo?

if i have to go back and edit every time i want to use up the full quota of letters, this will make asking questions so tedious that i'll give up posting questions.

in case any one wanted to ask....unlike the idiots and preteens who think that its enough to post a four or five word question to get people to respond, i usually like to use the full quota of letters to make my question as clear to grasp as possible just from the title---hence my annoyance if i'm having to work out how many letters ive used

Y!A is acting weird lately.



You can create your question in Word first and do a word or character count.  Then copy the question in.
You can also start your question, then use the 'add details' for the rest of it.

That bugs me too.
It's either because they think/ know they look good and just want comfirmation.
Or because they have low self esteem and are hoping that people they don't even know and will probably never meet think that they look nice.

They may want reassurance and confidence as they have low self esteem, some women think they are ugly and feel they need to keep up with celebrity looks and skinny models mainly because of the media. Then again, some women know or think they are quite attractive and are very vain, they crave as much attention as possible!!

They aren't confident, they have low self esteem, and just want opinions on theirselves. Women and girls these days are too insecure, and don't know much really. Or maybe they really want the attention, or just the thought that they are pretty.

Because they have low self-esteem. Nobody does it out of narcissism, they just want to know if people think they are good-looking because they have low self-esteem. People with low self-esteem have it for a reason, they think they are ugly and they want to know if they actually are by posting those questions.

They want everyone to lie and say they look pretty. I don't look at the pic's any more because I like to be truthful, and I don't want to be offensive. For instance I can't say 'I think you look like a dog', or 'your mouth would look better on a clown' or words to that effect. Pity.

once a question is answered, and once you answer a question, it becomes the property of yahoo answers forever, so it can't be deleted and neither can you.  Unless, like they say, you delete your whole email and everything.



I guess it was in the small print when we signed up that we didnt' read :)

You cannot delete your Yahoo Answers account, you can only delete the whole yahoo account. but people will still be able to search and see you Q&A.

If you just want to get rid of Yahoo! Answers, here are a few things you can do:
Go to your Profile page and do the following:
1&gt; Change your nickname to anything that cant be connected to you
2&gt; Eliminate any links from your profile to Y!Messenger or 360 page (if you have one), and disable the e-mail communications option.
3&gt; Change your Avatar to the grey profile.
4&gt; Opt out of messages and notifications from YA. Note: You can't opt out of Best Answers notifications, so you might keep receiving these for a while until the last Q&A you answered are Resolved.
5&gt; Check all your Privacy options to make your Q&A As private; eliminate your Contacts and select the option to not allow fans (if you have current fans, they will be deleted).
6&gt; If you have Open Questions, or Answers in Open Q&A you should delete these to prevent them from going into the database.

After you've severed all your connections between YA and the rest of your Yahoo!-related activities, and no search will find your Q&A,s.

Is any one having problems with their yahoo answers personal photo?



I use my yahoo 360 profile photo here on yahoo answers. My current yahoo answers picture is NOT the same picture I use for my yahoo 360. I don't even have the picture yahoo answers is using up on my yahoo 360 page. How is it, they (yahoo answers) are using a photo that isn't even on my yahoo 360 profile? How do I get my yahoo answers photo the same as my yahoo 360's? I already have the "use my 360 photo" marked.



Thank you in advance for your time and answers.

They should make an announcement or deadlines for everybody to be aware and  make our own changes in our personal profile.(to consider that I put my photos as private
not for* public view* but they do not ask my permission for any of my pictures to be published)

They should always keep us informed.

Everyday I spare some of my extra hour to "answer" and I do not read any of these changes regarding to this matter but today I was so surprised that It was my  photo displayed on my profile.

Now I know how important for me to them for not giving me my own privacy.

<question>



My account was suspended with out any reason? can anyone tell me why?



i mean i use this yahoo ID for half my life and they just say you violated the rules and deleted my account.
heres the deleted question "From which country is this phone number? +79132617216?" 
and they say i violated :Community Guidelines and/or Terms Of Service Violation
and then moments later another mail my entire account suspended is this fair just because of a single question i lose my account. there was a valid reason for asking that question also. the owner of that phone has been calling me lately. when i asked the local authorities to which country the number belongs to they said they dont provide information about another countries. and so i had no other choice but to post it here and find out.
and i did send the yahoo Customer Care that may be that did it by mistake and the they send a mail saying "We reviewed your case, and 
decided that your account is not eligible for reinstatement."
is there anyway i can get the account back. ok if without content also i only want the same ID
im sure this question and this account also soon will be suspended

We would need to see your entire account history to help.  This may have been your 100th violation, we don't know.  That single question did not do it, unless there was more to what you posted.  It has looked like you may have posted the question multiple times. That is a violation of the rules.

I asked this question last week but it got deleted, so here we go again.



For some reason a 16 year old jumped off of a bridge and on landing broke his back, up run those brave heroic cops and taser him 19 times as he will not do as they say. He was not moving or posing a danger to them, yet they still taser him. Did it not occur to them that the reason he was laid there when they arrived that he was injured, or are they just too thick and quick with the trigger.



</question>

It is true i saw the report on another site last weekend, also they are told 3 shocks is the limit, but they always ignore that. One law for us and another one for the cops.

Not many of us do get it, but if I can give you the best guesses,
like another user pointed out, simply:
They're bored, spiteful, disagree with you, can because they're anonymous, in a bad mood, or just have time to waste.

Don't worry about it.  We've all suffered from the 'thumbs down' syndrome, even when giving perfectly good answers.  You can still receive "Best Answer" so it's them who have wasted their time, not you.

The truth hurts and can be very inconvenient.  Lack of knowledge or common sense doesn't help.

I have to honestly say I don't get why people care about thumbs down.  Make believe they don't exist. They serve no purpose.  Some people give them for no reason, or sometimes someone might disagree, which is a good thing... or would be if they could explain, but we're not allowed to do that.  Or someone my disagree who isn't answering the question, and so wouldn't be commenting anyway.  No points are deducted.  The whole process should be eliminated, replaced by stars for good answers and no option to give a negative rating.  Just ignore them.

Thumbs down can be gotten for many reasons, only one of which is the correct usage. Some of the ways:

1. the answer is incorrect or you disagree with an opinion (the only real reasons)
2. you sound over 18 (believe it or not)
3. you support the rules on YA
4. you understand the rules of YA
5. you take the site seriously
6. you answered the question (some answerers will TD all other answers)
7. it was fun (random playing)
8. you are in the military, a policeman, or some authority figure
9. etc -



very few TDs are legit so don't sweat it unless you get one say on a science or math question, then review your answer for a mistake

Don't you think its stupid when you get answers like this..?



i mean there so fake.



One said something like 'I've been learning from it for two weeks now' and then goes on to Say's lost 9 pounds in five weeks by using their methods from there site'



which means they have lost in 5 weeks from there website but only been using the website for two weeks, don't they realise what they say?

and also, Why do they get away with it? or do there accounts get deleted and then they get another one?

Agree with the out of school hours being not the best time to ask questions, but also I think it helps to have an eye catching opening sentence, but definitely not the latest vogue of "Millions of answers from real people". I now skip them without even looking at them.

Hi !! I have found that early afternoon the best time ,14/00, hours onward to be best for replying to Qs maybe because a lot of US Qs flood in. But i find early morning a good time to search many of the answers to get the feel of the situation for the en-suing day.
 It seems to create the best chance of finding best answers and really taxing ones intellect.

Some categories are simply more popular than others, and the 'other' categories certainly appear to generate less answers as they are deemed to be more generalised categories.



My advise would be to re ask your question in a more popular category such as polls and surveys. More answers for your points.



So what can you do to generate more answers ?

Why not make Chris your Yahoo! Answers network. You can add up to 200 hundred contacts within Yahoo! Answers, and each time you ask a question, they shall be notified by email and Yahoo! Answers. The more people who are aware, the more answers.

Has anyone else had this problem or is it just me?



Whenever i go to a question, everything is fine except one thing: The avatars and pictures on the people's faces are all missing! On the home page, the link to the question has a picture, but not when you click on the question! Is this just my computer or is this a problem with the website itself?

Happens to me, too.  A few days ago, I clicked on a question about someone's avatar, but their avatar showed up as a red x.  The question asked me what I thought about the avatar, so I decided to try to put a little humor into my answer and say, "A white box with a red x... how... original!"  I got four thumbs-downs for my answer, and everyone else answered complimenting the avatar... I guess that time, it was just me.

For yours:
Wait a minimum of 4 hours and the buttons to pick a Best Answers will show up. Select a Best Answer before 4 days and earn 3 points. After 4 days, if you don't, the question 'expires' and goes to voting.

For others:
Click the VOTE tab on the far right of any section. Pick a question, vote on an answer. Get 1 point.

The only other question you have listed shows that it is less than 1 hour old. So it is too soon to choose a Best Answer.

I agree with the person who first replied. The amount of publicity she was getting was unbelievable. I can't believe it went on for so long.



I personally believe it was her parents who did it, but other people may have their suspicions.

Whoever abducted her, probably freaked when it became a "world-wide manhunt" to find her and dumped the body. Weird how she's not been found yet though. You'd think SOMEBODY would have seen her by now. That's if she's not dead, which she probably is.

your pretty sick to want to join into a discussion vilifying those poor parents.
no, its not that people don't care any more, it's a case of leaving them alone.

who are you people deciding what is right or wrong?

if you want to know the latest developments, READ THE NEWS.

I can get visa very easy because your wife has green card and your children are US citizen.... You just need to apply for US visa in its embassy, here you'll find its addresses in India, and also info about US visa:

You shouldn't have any problem if your wife is working in the US already. Your first responder was a bit rude but I think I can understand your situation. If it is entirely possible for you to contact your wife's employer you may be able to acquire the credentials necessary to get visa to the United States. Don't quote me on this though. You may need to go through the your nation's Embassy connected with the US to get visa. May the blessings of the Brahma be upon you in your endeavor.
