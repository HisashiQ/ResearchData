Pepsi. Less glucose and corn syrup. It tastes more crisp and natural to me. If I had to choose anything, I would go with water, though.

Does lactaid milk or any other lactose free milk make you lactose intolerant?



I am not lactose intolerant but my friend is, she drinks lactaid milk and I tried it and I like it better than normal skim milk. If I continue drinking it will it cause my body to become lactose intolerant?

Nope. Lactose intolerance is the lack of a specific enzym which makes it impossible to metabolize lactose. Drinking lactose free milk, or lactaid which actually has some lactose but also some of the enzym necessary to process it cannot make you lose use of an enzym that you have. However, if you do not ingest any lactose over time, you will stop producing the enzym, but this will come back gradually after exposure. It takes about 6 years of having no lactose for an otherwise non-lactose intolerant being to become intollerant, and only 3 weeks to recover from the condition.

no, there is no lactose in the lactaid milk for you to develop an intolerance to. just like if you were to drink soy milk, nothing would happen to you. some people even drink lactose-free milk without haveing an intolerance, because they think its healthier.

Short answer no. All lactaid does is reduce the lactose available in the milk, so people wirh lactose intolerence are able to drink and tolerate the milk with minimal side effects.
Therefore if the taste of the milk appeals to you, go for it by all means.

I was just going to ask this question because I am really gassy.  I havent drank milk in probably over 2 months, and then yesterday I had cereal and about 2 cups of milk and the same this morning and I've been farting all day long.... I am convinced since that is the ONLY change in my diet and everything else has been consistently consumed that I am gassy because of the milk.



Not only are mammals not supposed to consume milk after nursing as an infant, we are the only animals that do so. And it is not good for our bodies.  The milk just curdles in our stomach and it is difficult to digest..... So yes, milk does and is currently making me fart a little too much....

sorry if thats a little too much information 8)
