What is your opinion of Home-Schooling, where children are taught at home?



what are the advantages, and disadvantages?



</question>



<additional details>



I asked this question because I read an article which was very negative when it came to home-schooling, saying that Americans tended to hijack it for religious reasons. I am glad to see no-one mentioned religion, but came up with pertinent points for and against homeschooling. I was thinking of the heavy time committment on the part of the parents, but then here is one answer about long disussions with the librarian... I can think of cases where it is far better to educate your child at home. For instance a deaf child with a



high IQ, and the only school which caters for deaf children does not have the time and resources... Anyway, I will bring this to the vote. Thanks, everyone, for contributing.

Children do more at school than academic learning, there is a lot of personal and social development , interaction with peers and adults other than their immediate family that a child who was home schooled would miss out on. Personally, I don't see the value of home-schooling.

Hmm, I don't think you can. Usually the only way one can do a GCSE for free is to study at a government (state) school. All the distance education providers I know of in the UK are private schools and therefore you'd have to pay fees.

Methinks your only options are to:
i) study at home but have to pay (approx £600) to a company such as Oxford Homeschooling in order to do so; or
ii) study for free (or minimal cost) at a local college of further education.

If it's the need for childcare that is drawing you towards studying at home then check out the facilities at your local college before dismissing it as an option -- many colleges now have a creche/arrangements with a local nursery etc.

Are you homeschooled? If so, we consider all of our school work homework. :o)

If not, I would probably suggest decreasing homework may not be a good idea for spelling and English.

Why do you think your homework should be decreased? Perhaps you need to learn to manage your time better.

By the way, many schools in the US go by this rule of thumb for homework:  10 min. per day for each grade level, so Gr. 1 should have 10 min., Gr. 2 = 20 min., Gr. 3 = 30 min., Gr. 4 = 40 min., Gr. 5 = 50 min., and so on. College preparatory schools or high academic schools often have more homework and also required summer work.

Due to a little thing called No Child Left Behind, which forces schools and teachers to "teach to a test", I highly doubt you would ever get your idea passed. Of course providing an example of why additional homework is needed in school certainly won't help your cause either.

Good luck though.

In Georgia, how do I switch back to public schools from homeschooling?



If any of you guys could tell me exactly what I have to do or send me a link to a website that can tell me, I would greatly appreciate it.



Like, every time I switched schools, they needed to know my grades, and it had to be on a legit official document that was sealed and everything. So, I don't know how we'd go about doing that.



I basically don't know anything about what I'm supposed to do xD

Just go to the school and register.  They'll take down all your information.  If you don't have grades and stuff from homeschool, they'll probably want to test you to see what level you really belong in according to their curriculum.  Just do the tests, and they'll place you in the best grade and schedule according to your age AND what you already know.

Good Luck!

Not to calculate the change, but you will probably have to count the change.  There are a few that will tell you how many of each coin, and each bill to give, but most won't.

Yes, since the machine only does the calculations that are pressed into it.

Think about it - if you have a sale that is $17.38 and the customer gives you a $20, what happens if you accidentally press in $2.00?  $200?  You can stand there looking dumb while you try to figure it out, or you can hand them their $2.62, thank them, and figure out the accounting of it during a slow time.

Also, what do you do when you press in the $20.00 and the customer then hands you the 38 cents?  I've had high school and college kids look at me with this look of panic - I can't do the math!  It's pretty embarrassing when your customer has to tell you the correct amount of change.

Even in an age when we have computers to do everything for us, we still need to be intelligent enough to handle it when they don't work - or we don't work them right.

YES!!!! What happens if you put in 20.00 instead of 2.00? If you put the wrong amount of money in the register it will give you the difference as to what change you give but if you entered the wrong amount it will tell you the wrong amount. You have to be able to give correct change no matter what.



If the total is 19.53 and they give you 20 what is the change? Well What if they give you the 20.53 and you enter it as 20.00. Are you going to give the change of 0.47 or of 1.00.



Cash registers are very dependent on humans to enter the right amounts but if you screw up then it calculates right but with the wrong numbers. Am important skill for any cashier is to be able to count back the correct change with out having to think about it for too long or write it down.

We have computer system for our cash register at public high school.  It adds the total for purchase and has option for me to use money on the account or put money on account and/or pull money off the account for the student to buy from the express bar which is not on computer.



Mental math is necessary to figure the change on the register.

I was 50 years old when I learned the system and was taught to count money back starting at the amount due and count up to the amount given.

Well, since "...together; they..." is not an option, I also choose B.  C is okay, it is a correct sentence but it's a little immature-sounding.  A is a comma splice.  The one in the question is a run-on.

I know it's semi-colon, but here are several ways to rewrite the sentence (mainly beause I'm bored...).

Period/Capitlization:
Lewis began publishing his Narnia series in 1950. At first, it was more popular in the United States than in England.

,and:
Lewis began publishing his Narnia series in 1950, and at first, it was more popular in the United States than in England.

Semi-colon:
Lewis began publishing his Narnia series in 1950; at first, it was more popular in the United States than in England.

When you have a run-on sentence and need to separate the line into two destinguished sentences, you are safe using any of the other ways I listed with the variation of ", and" being ", but" or something like that. The way I tell where one sentence ends and the other begins, is to look out for certain words that seem off being in the middle of the line. For example, "at first" doesn't seem placed in the right spot. It's much better suited to be at the beginning of a sentence, thus that is where your second sentence begins. To help you out with knowing where one ends and the other begins, try slowly saying the sentence out loud. A lot of times, for me at least, you tend to stop at where the sentence will end. Your mind's pretty much already programmed to spot out such things, and it tends to include natural pauses when you read.
