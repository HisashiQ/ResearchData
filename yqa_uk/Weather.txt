if a cloud forms at the cold high-levels, it will be usually be made of ice crystals, so will tend to look rather thin and wispy. High-level clouds include 'cirrus', the commonly seen delicate white tufty clouds, and 'cirrocumulus', which is made up of many small round clouds. A sheet of 'cirrostratus' is generally more uniform. It is often translucent and can give a 'halo' around the sun.

Medium-level clouds usually look thicker. Because they are lower, they are mostly made of water droplets, although they can also contain some ice particles too. Some of the medium-level clouds are similar to the high-level clouds; 'altocumulus' is made of larger puffs of clouds than the high-level cirrocumulus, and the grey layer of 'altostratus' is a denser version of cirrostratus. There is also a thick dark rain-bearing cloud at this height too - nimbostratus.

CloudLow-level clouds are usually made solely of water droplets. As well as the grey featureless layer of 'stratus', there are many types low-level of cumulo clouds too. There is the rather squashed looking 'stratocumulus', and the fluffy cotton-wool 'cumulus' clouds. There is also the 'cumulonimbus'. Cumulonimbus clouds can be so tall that it can reach up into the high-level. This is why it is sometimes classed as a 'vertically developed' cloud. This cloud can bring thunderstorms, or showers of rain, snow or hail.

One rare, but beautiful cloud is the noctilucent cloud that appears to glow in the sky. It is usually about 85 km above the surface of the earth and believed to be composed of ice crystals. However, because it is so high and forms in such a dry part of the atmosphere, it is a bit of an enigma in the world of clouds.

Some clouds are made of ice crystals, especially cirrus clouds that blow off from nearby mesoscale convective complexes.

Ice crystals in some clouds, especially thunderheads, is one of the reasons why some thunderstorms can produce hail as well as rain.

water vapour
Rising air currents take the vapor up into the atmosphere, along with water from evapotranspiration, which is water transpired from plants and evaporated from the soil. The vapor rises into the air where cooler temperatures cause it to condense into clouds.

They can already control small aspects of the weather. Just before the olympic games they fired over 1000 iodine rockets into the air above Beijing to prevent it from raining on the day of the opening ceremony. Also, there are places in America where the hailstones are bigger than golfballs and they prevent this by flying though the clouds and releasing a chemical.

Nice Question! Unfortunately, one that is not ansered very easily. You see, tampering with the weather is kind of like rolling the dice on the great craps table of the Earth - If you change one thing over here, something else happens over there... In terms of power though, is it any less power than that wielded by todays political leaders? Men can determine the fates of hundreds, if not thousands of civilians at the scribble of a pen or the shake of a hand, so why not tinker with the weather?



I think 'twould be best if we left such experiments however, in the hands of future generations, who may be able to better understand the relationships between land, sea, air and space that combine to shape the global patterns we know as weather. Perhaps we could first conduct such experiments on the Moon, as part of the latest exploration. Who knows, we might even stir up an atmosphere!
When it comes to the benefits of weathershaping here at home, I'm of two minds. On the one hand, Cloud-seeding (making clouds produce rain by introducing various chemicals/minerals in order for the trapped and frozen water to condense into a rain droplet) and Storm-popping (Much the same thing, only through the eye of a hurricane), not to mention instant snow (same again - this time with dry ice) have been around for decades now, I suppose the same question is what holds us back - how sure are we that changing a local environment won't adversly affect the weather in another area??
After all, it seems all major Hurricanes in the Americas are precipitated by major lightning storms over the plains of Africa... How do we know that ending the drought in Australia won't sink Japan in a biblical proportion Flood? We don't, and I think that thought is just this side of scary enough to make sure we don't find out quite yet...

Rainbows are always circular. The arc would be dependant on how high the water droplets are refracting the sunlight. This can vary. Keep in mind that no two people see the same rainbow since it's an optical effect depending on where you're viewing it from. Even a few feet can make a difference (although not a big one).

Position of the sun.  The higher the sun, the "shorter" & flatter the rainbow.  The lower the sun, the "taller" & "rounder" the rainbow appears.  It's always directly opposite the sun...if there wasn't ground in the way & nothing but sky, it could look like a full circle.

Rainbows are always opposite the sun and their centres are below the horizon at the the antisolar point. The lower the sun the higher is the bow.



At sunrise or sunset a rainbow's centre, the antisolar point, is on the horizon. The rainbow is half in the sky, a semicircle. As the sun rises the bow's centre sinks. Eventually when the sun is 42º high only the tip of the bow is visible above the horizon. In the summer, rainbows are best seen in early morning or late afternoon when the sun is comparatively low.

Parts of a bow can often be seen below the horizon against a backdrop of fields or the ground. A more complete circle is sometimes visible from mountains or aircraft

A bow's appearance depends on drop size. The best are narrow ones with intense colours and these are made by large drops several mm in diameter. Look for them during very heavy showers.



Smaller drops produce broader bows with less saturated colours. Very small drops give nearly colourless cloudbows and fogbows.

Position of the sun is the main factor. Rainbow is a complete circle located opposite the sun. The horison hides the lower half of the rainbow from you. When the sun is higher, most of the rainbow is below the horison and you only see the tip of it. When the sun is lower, you can see more of the rainbow.

From certain points of observation, you can see a complete circle.

The result is interesting: When asked what they would do if the earth was to be destroyed in 24 hours, about sixty percent answered that they would bring that time with their loved ones. About 20 percent said that they would have sex and the last 20 percent said that they would steal something they always wanted to own but couldn't afford.

The latter is interesting because it shows how much possession is important to mankind. We are willing to steal, even if it is to own our desired possession for only 24 hours.

<question>



Is it easier to survive in extreme cold or extreme heat?



Say the desert vs the arctic- in the desert I'm talking about just sand, lizards, maybe a few low-lying scrub bushes, indicating potential small reserves of water far beneath the sand. In the arctic environment I mean just snow, maybe fish under a layer of ice.

In both instances we will say you are equipped with the appropriate clothes and have the necessary tools for creating fire, a knife, a shovel, basic survival gear, but no food or water.

You only have to survive a few days, not long-term.

Which is the "easier" environment to shelter yourself from the elements, get enough water, food and just generally survive in for the short-term?

Personally I hate being cold. But if placed in a survival situation for say, 3-4 days, I'd take the cold. You can dehydrate in half a day in extreme heat. Plus you'd be threatened by heat stroke. Cold would be uncomfortable but much more survivable especially under your proposed scenario of having clothes and fire making ability.

It's probably because it's warmer in the Whitsundays. Thunderstorms usually need cold air and hot air to meet. In the Whitsundays, I'm guessing there isn't too much cold air around in summer, whereas in south east Qld, there is probably more. 
As far as hail storms are concerned, I think hail storms mainly occur when there is hot air down below and cold air above. The pieces of hail bounce up and down in the cold section, increasing in size, until they finally fall.
I'm in south east Qld, and we've already had our first thunderstorm for the season, two days ago. It was a real cracker, and way too close for comfort. I don't mind them, if I can watch them from a distance rather than right above me.
Well, that's my explanation. Someone else will probably be able to give a more detailed explanation of it, but as I said, I think it is to do with the fact that you may have less cold air in the Whitsundays.

here can be several reasons. For example, a mountain range can create certain cloud patterns. But mostly different wind speed at different altitude will stretch the clouds in lines along the wind direction.

Have you heard the old seafarer saying: "Mackerel skies and mare tails make tall ship carry little sails?"

In this case, "mare tails" are high cirrus clouds that are stretched with "tails" all in the same direction. It simply indicated that there are high speed winds aloft and it is usually associated with an advancing warm front; a forerunner of bad weather.

Mediterranean type of climate occurs around the Mediterranean Sea,and on the western flanks of continents at similar latitudes north and south of the equator-- in California,South Africa and southern Australia.
It has four seasons. Summers are hot and dry,with little rainfall for four to six months.Winters are cool and wet.
Wet winters and dry summers cncourage the growth of small trees and shrubs that can survive on little water.

A Mediterranean climate is one that resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, which includes over half of the area with this climate type world-wide. In addition to the areas surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, this climate type prevails in much of California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile.

The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. For example, the city of Perth, Australia, in the southern hemisphere winter months of June-August, experiences 450 mm (17.7 inches) of rainfall and an average daily minimum of 8°C (46°F). Meanwhile during the summer months of December to February the city only averages 32mm (1.3 inches).[1]

Mediterranean climate zones are associated with the five large subtropical high pressure cells of the oceans, the Azores High, South Atlantic High, North Pacific High, South Pacific High, and Indian Ocean High. These high pressure cells shift polarward in the summer and equatorward in the winter, playing a major role in the formation of the world's tropical deserts and the zones of Mediterranean climate polarward of the deserts. For example, the Azores High is associated with the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean Basin's climate. The South Atlantic High is similarly associated with the Namib Desert and the Mediterranean climate of the Western part of South Africa. The North Pacific High is related to the Sonoran Desert and California's climate, while the South Pacific High is related to the Atacama Desert and central Chile's climate, and the Indian Ocean High is related to the deserts of western Australia (Great Sandy Desert, Great Victoria Desert, and Gibson Desert) and the Mediterranean climate of southwest and south-central Australia.[2]

The Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and shrub biome is closely associated with Mediterranean climate zones. Particularly distinctive of the climate are sclerophyll shrublands, called maquis in the Mediterranean Basin, chaparral in California, matorral in Chile, fynbos in South Africa, and mallee and kwongan shrublands in Australia. Aquatic communities in Mediterranean climate regions are adapted to a yearly cycle in which abiotic (environmental) controls of stream populations and community structure dominate during floods, biotic (e.g. competition and predation) controls become increasingly important as the discharge declines, and environmental controls regain dominance as environmental conditions become very harsh (i.e. hot and dry); as a result, these communities are well suited to recover from droughts, floods, and fires.[3]

Little individual discharges of static electricity make the sounds.

When the sweater is on rubbing builds up static charges between the sweater and the clothes underneath. If the humidity were high enough, they'd just dissipate. But with low humidity in winter (cold dry air, plus heaters that dry things out inside) the charges stay put and build up every time you move, like rubbing a balloon on hair.

When both sides of the charge are right up against each other they don't do much except make the clothes stick together a bit.

But when you take off the sweater, you're separating the two halves of the charge. Opposites attract, so the clothes try to cling. The charges can move a bit, they build up on wisps of the sweater's fluff that stick to the oppositely charged item underneath until you pull them apart.



Now voltage and charge build on the spike of fluff like the gap on a car's distributor until it has a chance to discharge as determined by the air's ability to stand up to the voltage difference, and you hear a snapping sound because the discharge is actually a series of discharges that happen at a rate that's momentarily audible, and each charge causes some sound waves like little tiny thunderclaps.

As you've already been told, it is static electricity. But then, why in the winter?

Well, in the winter your house is warmed up. Because of that, the relative humidity is lower. Say that outside, it is zero degree Celsius (freezing point). A cubic meter of air, if saturated as when it is snowing/raining will contain perhaps 4 grams of water. Once that air enters your room that is say, 20 degrees Celsius, the same cubic meter of air can contain perhaps 18 grams of water. Its relative humidity becomes much less. You feel it is dry air.

What happens is that humidity leads electricity. Working with electronics and to avoid a damaging static electrical discharge, the best is to work in a moist air. Dry air isolates the static electritity and when you remove your sweater, all the charged electricity discharges as small 'lightnings' between it and your body as a result of the friction.
