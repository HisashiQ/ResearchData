You never know when an emergency will occur, and those people who don't think you'll ever need it are very shortsighted. If you feel you need to be ready, then maybe you do. Sometimes feelings are more than feelings, right?

Yep, best investment we have made. Are you in Australia? The government gives a rebate of up to $2500. We bought a 3000gallon tank, after rebate cost about $1300. Very handy. Look online there are heaps of companies with info on the net.

In most countries of the world, having a water tank is a must and not an option.  If you are living in a highly developed country then perhaps it will not be needed but you never know when an emergency occurs and the tap runs dry.

To have a garbage free environment requires a lot of cooperation from the community. But, there are other people who won't cooperate simply because they don't want to pick up trash that's not even theirs. Others throw trash everywhere/anywhere they want to and leave it behind because they're too damn lazy to pick it up and throw it in the garbage bin. While some would say: "nahh, never mind that. Leave it to the garbage collectors". To put it in layman's terms, too many people are lazy to pick up the trash.

My personal opinion is people in the US lack personal responsibility, it is always someone Else's responsibility. We worry about ourselves more than the greater good. People think they are saving money by dumping their crap on the side of the road instead of taking it to the dump and paying a few bucks, they don't realize that they will pay for it in the end with higher garbage fees and more city taxes.

I think it just boils down to them being stupid and lazy, I always pick up trash when I visit places in the outdoors, or even if I see a bag flying  I grab it and throw it away. We need to have more trash cans around. Where I live, they have a few days during the year when people can take their trash to the dump for free.

Recycling cafeteria food scraps using worms.  Get a storage bin that is used in houses. Take two plastic pipes long enough the pass through the bins. drill them full of holes. Drill holes in the bin to accept the pipes.  Take left over school paper or newspapers and shred them.  Dampen them. not soaking wet and fill up the botttom of the bin to cover the piipes you installed. Go to a bait shop and get a carton of red worms.  They can cope better then night crawlers.  Cover them in the damp paper.



Collect vegetable scraps only.  No meat or dairy products.  About equal weight to the worms.



Bury them in the  paper. The worms will migrate to the scraps.  Watch that you don't put too much in the bin. It can spoil.  Add only as often as the prior batch has been eaten.  The wdorms will turn the scraps into a sweet smelling black soil looking mixture.  It can then be used to grow plants in pots.

i think it is around €500 and you only need it when you are selling your house.  It is a EU recommendation that it comes in throughout Europe, but it is not mandatory in most EU countries.  It Ireland it is though.  The price is not based on the size and age of the house, it is a standard fee.

A fifth of UK councils are axing road lights to cut bills - is it a good idea?



According to the recent press  'One in five councils is switching off street lights at night, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents with blacked-out roads' Daily Mail



http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-...



And BBC News 'Thousands of street lights in towns and villages across East Yorkshire could be switched off at night in a bid to slash the council's electricity bill'.



http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south...



East Riding of Yorkshire Council is considering the move as it anticipates its energy costs will rise by 18% to more than £3m this year.



As well as a post-midnight switch-off, it is also considering dimming lights to save energy.



Councillors stressed lights would not be turned off in crime hotspots.



Residents are being asked to give their view of the proposals as part of a wide-ranging council survey of 6,000 households.



Costs doubled



Dave Williamson, of the council's street lighting department, said: "The cost of energy has doubled over the last few years.



"Street lighting is a very efficient user of energy but the quantity of lights means that it costs nearly £900,000 every year to keep them lit.



"We are looking at ways to reduce the amount of energy we use, which will limit some of the cost increases and help the planet by reducing our carbon footprint."



Switching lights off between midnight and 0500 would reduce the amount of energy used by each light by 70%, the council said. Even dimming them would save about 27%, it added'

It is a great idea, light pollution is a major problem to all living things. Light is a powerful biological force. Off all the pollutions we face, light pollution is one of the easiest to reduce and prevent. As for the crime/vandalism aspect Local Councils are taking this into account and lighting troubled black spot areas and at 'peak' times.



We have effected the migration patterns and behaviours of many animals and there is new evidence to suggest that we are also negatively impacting on our own health.



The migration patterns of birds have not only been effected by large numbers of deaths, particularly of juvenile birds colliding into brightly lit tall buildings at night, light pollution also means that migration occurs too soon for nesting conditions to be right.



Migration like most aspects of animal behaviour is precisely timed biological behaviour. Blackbirds and nightingales (among others) sing at unnatural hours. Artificially long days and short nights have been consistently found to induce early breeding in a wide range of birds and this dramatically affects migration schedules.



But it is not just birds, other animals are adversely affected by light pollution. Insects cluster around streetlights and feeding at those insect clusters is now ingrained in the lives of many bat species. In some Swiss Valleys the European Lesser Horseshoe Bat began to vanish after street lights were installed, it is thought because the newly lit valleys were now filled with light feeding pipistrelle bats.



Constant light has effected other nocturnal mammals behaviour such as badgers as the lights have made them easier targets.
Nesting sea turtles need dark beaches to nest, also their offspring are confused by light pollution and head towards that rather than the sea horizon.



There have been studies that suggest a direct correlation between higher rates of breast cancer in women and the nighttime brightness of their neighbourhoods.



So I fully agree with local councils turning off the street lights after midnight in all but the most troubled blackspots in city centers. The local authority are also responsible for building regulations and planning permission. They could easily prevent a lot of light pollution within towns and cities by not granting permission for private companies in the first place.

its not the best idea, as the security angle is obviously important for some residents, but it is something they councils actually have control over, and is cost free. if they had a budget to give low paid householders financial help to install insulation they could probable get a similar saving, but at a cost.

Street lights are only needed (on highways at least) because people don't consume enough vitamin A, so they have poor night vision.



Increasing the amount of vitamin A in peoples diets would cost much less than leaving lights on all the time.



I live in the woods, so have never had a nightlight nearby.

The easy answer to this is take them back to the store where you bought them from as they have a responsibility to dispose of them in a responsible way.

Unless you are an OAP then no....you could suggest letting groups of schoolchildren come on certain days of the year...to be shown around the allotment and learn about growing food by you and their teacher...it would be good for 4 and 5 year olds...if you approach a school nearby and make an offer in writing...to say that when you have your allotment you will allow them to bring the kids on pre-arranged dates...then if they accept in writing you can present this and your plan, to the council...worth a try!

It isn't really fair to jump to the head of the line.



I suggest to start small with growing your own food where you are now.  Many vegetables can be grown in containers on a porch or patio.  I grew tomatoe plants and salad greens this way when I lived in an apartment.  There are special jars that you can grow strawberries in.  Try your library for books on container gardening.

It is a decent idea. it depends on the location. for diff locations there are diff 'most appropriate' systems.
Geothermal power plants make the most energy where there is magma coming close to the earth's surface. Unfortunately these are  the same places that have volcanoes and earthquakes. So there is a risk involved, especially if the plant is a 'binary' system, which means that a fluid like butane or pentane is the main working fluid. In an earthquake you might have a spill of thousands of gallons of lighter fluid.
For plants that aren't binary, main down side is that ground water has a lot of impurities disolved in it, sulfur, mercury, arsenic, etc. That can get into the air, or be pumped back into the ground raising the levels around the plant.



If you aren't near an area with good ground heat, there may be an excessive cost to build compared to the return. You would have to want the plant for more green reasons than just dollars in order to justify.
That all said, it's as good or better of a plan than wind or solar, because the energy supply is constant. You aren't running on batteries at night or when the air is still.

Well, almost everything on the planet is biodegradable (Biodegradability simply means that the product breaks down through the action of microorganisms), so yes.



However, the real issue is how long will the bag take to break down? That is a question that Planet Ark needs to answer



(This was sourced from their website:
Planet Ark reusable bags, like the 'Green Bags' seen in Coles and Woolworths supermarkets, are made from non-woven polypropylene that is manufactured from polypropylene gas, a by-product of oil refining. These reusable bags usually have a solid removable base that is manufactured from nylon or PET.



Polypropylene bags can carry more shopping than plastic check-out bags, so shoppers use less. They are sturdy and designed to be reused repeatedly over many years. At the end of their lives, they can be recycled - drop them into the plastic check-out bag recycling bins at all Coles and Woolworths supermarkets.



Polypropylene bags reduce consumption (and therefore environmental impacts) of single use bags and encourage customers to be more ‘waste-wise’ in their daily life



Doesn't really give any indication of time elapsed before bags degrade, does it?

Although I cannot speak for those bags specifically, I have become fully disillusioned at the concept of biodegradable plastics. Several years ago I was looking to become a distributor of these types of products. I ordered samples from several companies and put them to the ultimate test - my home compost bin. I run a very hot bin and my materials loose identity quickly and are ready to stabilize within 3 months. I abandoned the venture when they never broke down. Just a few months ago I fished out the remaining bags, which had survived over 4 years in there!. I also have a water bottle from Biota, which claimed to be fully biodegradable. I last used it in an aerial photo Greenpeace demonstration 3 years ago before putting in the pile. It is still legible and pliable. Based on my experience none of the claims have panned out. Even if the bags you have are truly degradable, it would be pointless unless they were going into a composting environment. Good Luck!



I have since continued in the green business venture and now own and operate South Florida's only Cloth Diaper Service.

Nuclear Energy Waste is Buried. Does it make sense to you?



Here's some rough facts. Hold on to your chair. U-238 rods, after a given amount of sacrificial depletion are less stable, and not safely usable for nuclear reactors. Greater amounts of the lower portions of these rods actually become Plutonium.
.
A conservative estimated half-life of the ore mix in this form is about 16 million years. To those not scientifically minded, this means that it would take 32 million years for the ore to theoretically no longer emit deadly radioactivity and be safe for open environment exposure
The problem:
The best radioactive encasement that technology can produce to date is able to safely protect us from these deadly emissions for a generous estimate of 2200 years.  After this amount of time the radioactivity will breach through the encasement.
.
Currently, the only solution to this is to someday begin to pull the waste and put it into a new encasement. This is a very expensive solution that has not been fortified financially by the waste itself, and nothing is being given any serious considerations yet as we are just 'leaning on the current encasement plan" for now. We are hoping that someone will develop either a way to neutralize the waste, use it further for energy, or figure out a final stage burial method for these waste rods.
.
In the meantime, we are still bury the waste every day.
I do know about nuclear energy and its great efficiency level. That no other pollutants are created and the only questionable area is the warming of sea water by certain power plants and the potential of catastrophic meltdown. These are some things to consider also.
Can we really call it "clean" power when we are left with such high potential waste. How safe are we if a plant were taken to a heavy artillery air strike?
I'm not talking about a threat to the birds that hang out on top of the reactor to keep warm either.  Many plants and storage areas are not at all out in the middle of nowhere, and where is the middle of nowhere on a 25,000 circumfrance when it comes to depleted U-238 rods to Plutonium?



</question>



<additional details>



Nuclear waste is kept accessable, and is constantly monitored. This is currently written into the power costs of course, since it is being done now. It is not buried deep but as said, is accessable.  As we see the problem, why do we still add to it before even a foresight of a solution?

you are really "not too smart". nuclear waste is so so so much less of a problem than CO2. what do you think is better completely destroying our envirorment by burning fossil fuels or by making some nuclearwastee which is easily taken care of.



this huge meltdown your talking about is not whatsciencee fiction has displayed it as. yes there is radiation but no it dosent explode into a huge mushroom cloud.



about the airstrike... any plane that could get past our airforce anddefensee systems to drop bombs on a nuclearpower plantt is probablyy a person who could more easily send us a nice nuclear present from space that is more likley to succseed and would do many times more damage due to the fallout which could travel across the entire country.



about burrying it.. its underneath mountains i mean look online... even if it were pored out in a hole that deep the mountain would absorb all of the radiation that is emmited.

Burying it is like trying to burying a problem.



If you bury it deep underground, if something goes wrong, like a fire, a leak, or an earthquake, by the time you notice there's a problem, it'll be too late.



This is stuff we need to keep an eye on, not bury & forget.



Also, U-235 is generally used as fuel, not U-238.

The nuclear issue hasn't fully impacted humans yet, it seems we act only when the situation is dire. I don't understand why as a species we can't accept that prevention is the best cure for any problem. Is that such a difficult concept?



The same thing is going on with CFL bulbs. The regular incandescent light bulbs are being phased out by law so all you will be able to use is the "energy efficient " CFLs. Most people don't realize that the mercury in the bulbs is toxic waste and is illegal to throw into your garbage can. Some of my friends have been just throwing them out because they had no idea.  You are supposed to take it "somewhere" to have it recycled but no one seems to no where. Most of the time you have to take them to a larger city that deals with them.



The mercury in the garbage dumps will eventually find its way into the ground water and our drinking water. A half a gram of Hg is sufficient to contaminate 5 million gallons of water or  200 Olympic-sized pools.



If you break a bulb in your house you are supposed to evacuate your pets and children, open windows and doors to allow out gassing, wear clothes and rubber gloves you intend to bring to the toxic waste facility, wipe-push up the mess with a towel and bag everything up.



I broke a bulb in my house and freaked out because I have small children (one that already has neurological issues from heavy metals) I called the poison control center and they told me to vacuum it out of my carpet. I did, trusting them, and later found out I had spread the mercury all over my house by dispersing it with my vacuum. Plus, my $800 vacuum was contaminated and unusable. You are supposed to CUT your carpet out where the spill was. You can't put your clothes in the wash machine or you'll contaminate your machine forever plus the water you use.



There are stories of people having to call hazz mat in to deal with broken bulbs in homes and work places.



I simply can't believe that CFL's are being touted as such a solution when no one here is considering the resulting waste and contamination. Parts of Europe have banned them, especially for the use in children's bedrooms. How in the world can they be feasibly considered a safe household good? Are we completely nuts here? Remember Asbetos?



I'm so tired of people brushing these issues off as nothing two worry about. I care about the future of the children of this world we are poisoning, let alone the damage we are inflicting on all the rest of the living creatures.



How can we be so negligent?

What do you think of Tim Horton's policy to encourage recycling of its waste? Will recycling bins curb litter?



Personally,I think recycling will help to some degree but how do you make the consumer put any effort into using them.I've seen people throw garbage out of their car window, dump ashtrays in parking lots,leave bulk garbage ( tires, sofas etc.) at mall dumpsters because they were too cheap to take it to the dump.We, the consumers also have to do our part.What are your feelings?

Education, Education, Education. Making community leaders responsible for the citizens of their communities as well.



I sat on a committee where we spoke at town hall meetings and all though participation is still not at 100%, it's getting better.



I'm trying to start and initiative to have the elementary and high schools recycle and go in and speak with the students since most schools do not really ingrain this into children.



Bins will help but education and making people understand their responsibility as consumers and citizens.

Bacteria converting sun energy to fuel?



In a recent article I read that Dr. J. Craig Venter from Celera Genomics has (or is about to) produce Bacteria that will be able to convert sun energy into fuel by having some specific gene(s). Now I'm not a genetic, only a mechanical engineer, and interested in the energy conversion issue. Does anybody have more information about this subject (or any publications) that would help me in doing a research on the matter and designing a unit of energy generation by Bacteria.

That depends on the TYPE of heat pump source, and costs in your area when compared with the cost of Solar.



IF feasible, I would suggest a geothermal heat pump as having the longest lifespan, and greatest overall efficiency.  I note that it is ALSO probably the most expensive to install.

geothermal will be cheaper in the long run (e.g. 20+ years).
it is in a way 'future proof', as regardless of any climate change effects, it will run fine for decades. the system is suitable for very nearly all climates and geology,  they have it from sweden to arizona.



it is more expensive but much longer lasting;  this is hopefully not a problem if you can market it right, along the lines of cheap heating for life.

But it is true that a truck delivering grocery bags to supermarkets can carry 50 times more plastic bags than paper.



So, you would need 50 deliveries of paper bags to supply an equal number of a single delivery of plastic.



Until I switched to re-usable bags, I also used the pastic bags for garbage and saved buying /using plastic garbage bags.



Not everything is a clear cut environmental decision

Absolutely not. That sounds like something the plastic bag people would say. Paper bags do cost a little more to produce, but they don't use as much energy to produce.



Plastics are only cheap because oil is cheap, as oil becomes increasingly expensive, plastic stuff will go the way of the dodo. Furthermore, recycled plastic is re-used over and over. Since plastic doesn't decay, it's likely that any plastic not recycled will stay in the environment, more or less permanently, so that's another good reason, to recycle, it does good when recycled to a garden hose, a jacket or boot-heel , not so much when it's just a bag blowing in the wind.

A watt is a watt. 30 seconds at 18 watts will use less energy than 30 seconds at 60 watts.



From my experience fluorescent bulbs hold up to frequent switching better than incandescent bulbs because they don't get nearly as hot.



Incandescent bulbs hold up better when left on for long periods, whereas fluorescent bulbs tend to wear out faster if left on for extended periods.

Makes sense to leave the old one. Say the bulb is 60 watts and you turn it on 4 times a day for 30 seconds. In a year that bulb will use a whopping 0.73 kWhs or $0.13 worth of electricity. Even if the CFL used no electricity, it would take like a decade just to pay for the bulb.

The fluorescent are better than the incandescents but
they are very poor quality and do not have nearly the

Yes, they last longer.



No, cause we live with our 86 year old dad and his having to wait for the lights to come up to full brightness isn't always good.  His sight isn't all that good and when we come in he often has to run (so to speak) straight to the bathroom and can't wait for the lights.

Yes, definetly even if they are more expensive than incandecent light bulbs they last longer and are eco-friendly.
Think of it this way, would you buy an LED light or just a regular white light flash light?
If I had a choice to pick from LED to just normal white light I would pick LEDs because first off they, like flourecent lights last longer and are now said to be eco-friendly.  I mean white light and incandecent lights work it's just that they don't last as long and they aren't eco-friendly.  Though one thing that I will admit is that flourecent lights have mercury in them, so if you or anyone drops then run out of where ever you are because mercury is poisonous and it is very bad for you to enhale.

It depends. Are you talking about CFL (compact fluorescent lamp) or LED (light-emitting diode) lights? CFL's are ok, the color is a bit annoying, and they contain mercury. LED bulbs can be expensive at first but they use half the energy of a CFL (and 1/10th the energy of an incandescent) and quickly pay for themselves. Plus, they don't heat up as much, and can last for up to 10 years. Overall, I think that energy saving is great, as it preserves the environment.

You can get a lot of controversy about renewable energy



My take on the fact is that wind & tidal which works on the same principal as Wind



Anyway it works & everythings fine, just i suppose there could be times where there is no wind at,



Solar Towers also work on a heat traveling up a tower to turn the turbines, should be easy to look up



Satelites are being condsidered as viable energy sources using solar power, if you can find it on the web it basically, power or electricty can be zapped from space using microwaves transmitters & reciever dishes on earth, it worked on a practice set up on earth just a actauall space based trial is yet to be done,



On the very far reaches of what the government should be ushing for a break through in is Nuclear Fussion, basically the same process the sun use's to create it's energy, It's so green that a bathtub of water creates all the fuel need to power the whole USA from basic Duetrium & Tritium molecules, the only waste may be a bit of escape steam in the process, no cabon smoke No Nuclear waste

Buying a renewable-energy credit allows an individual or business to financially support wind energy even if it is not available locally. The credits technically represent the environmental benefits of using renewable energy instead of traditionally produced power.



To understand how the complicated concept works, it's helpful to realize that the various attributes associated with producing electricity can be separated into partsIn the case of wind power, there is the actual electricity generated — which is fed into a power grid where it is mixed with electricity that may have been generated by coal, natural



gas or even nuclear reactions — and there are the environmental benefits of the way the electricity is produced.



Unlike burning fossil fuels, wind generation does not produce dangerous particulates, sulfur dioxides, nitrogen oxides or carbon dioxide. Renewable-energy certificates represent the value of not dumping those pollutants into the atmosphere.



Separating the electricity from the environmental benefits allows people who are actually receiving the wind power — but who don't want to pay the added costs of renewable energy — to pay the same rate they would pay for traditionally generated electricity. It also gives people who do not have direct access to wind-generated power the ability to purchase renewable-energy credits, which helps the wind company to stay competitive even without willing customers in the area of the wind farm.



One renewable-energy credit is created for each kilowatt-hour of energy generated from a wind farm. Those credits are often sold by the wind farm to a third-party broker, who then resells it to customers for a profit.



Businesses or residents who buy the same number of kilowatt-hours' worth of renewable-energy credits that they use each month often say they are 100 percent wind-powered. The electricity they actually are using, however, probably comes from traditional sources, such as coal or natural gas.



What the critics are saying:



Renewable-energy credits are just a form of checkbook environmentalism, which allow people with money to soothe their consciences without making any real efforts to reduce environmental problems.



Many companies aren't transparent about where the RECs are coming from and how much of the consumer's money actually makes it back to the wind farm.



They allow the middle man to make a handsome profit without substantially benefiting the wind farms.



They advertise benefits that aren't real in the short term — like eliminating carbon dioxide and adding new wind power to the grid.



What supporters are saying:



Renewable-energy credits provide important revenue for wind farms, which must compete with the heavily subsidized oil and gas industry.



They are a first step for the concerned public in the fight against greenhouse gases — they give the individual some power instead of waiting for the local utility to develop renewable energy.



Once you've taken all the energy-efficiency measures you can, it makes sense to buy credits to cover the electricity you have to use.



They are bringing the discussion about wind energy into the mainstream dialogue.



Some big names



buying RECs:



The University of Colorado purchased 11.2 million kilowatt-hours' worth of RECs from Community Energy, which roughly equates to between 9 percent and 12 percent of the school's energy use.



Vail Resorts, based in Broomfield, bought 152 million kilowatt-hours from Renewable Choice Energy, which officials say offsets 100 percent of the conventionally produced electricity they burn at all five of their mountain resorts in a year.



Whole Foods Market purchased 458 million kilowatt-hours to offset all the energy used in its stores, facilities, bake houses, distribution centers, regional offices and national headquarters in the United States and Canada.

There are numerous applications of biological design to solve engineering problems from materials science (on the micro scale) to architecture (on the macro scale).



Generally, this field is called biomimicry. Scientists and engineers work to model the properties of biological materials and structures and then duplicate these properties with synthetic materials. These materials are then applied to products or structures that are commercially useful.



There are numerous examples, from ancient history to the present day. For example, dams are used by beavers and humans for the same purpose, to block flowing water to create a storage reservoir.



The 19th century Crystal Palace in London was made of iron and glass, with a structure based on the pattern of ribs on the underside of the giant Amazonian lily pad.



More recently, the water-repellent properties of the water lily were synthesized to make a water-proof coating that repelled dirt to create a self-cleaning surface.



One exciting development underway is the possible synthesis of spider silk. This material is stronger than steel for its weight and can be used in many applications. Spider silk would be a good topic to study and research for your project.

I despise environmentalism and am looking for more good ways to waste energy.?



I believe the environmental religion is a death cult.  I believe the Earth's resources are here to use as we see fit to make our lives better and more comfortable.



I try to use as much energy as I can.  For example, when I'm in a public building I always try to leave lights on in unoccupied rooms:  conference rooms, bathrooms, etc.



I also make an extra drive around the block before I come home from work.  My wife and I take long, aimless drives on the weekend, too, in our Navigator.  She doesn't know I have an ulterior motive.



When major league baseball did that stupid energy conservation thing in the 4th game of the playoffs, I turned every single light on in our house for the duration of the game - about 40 lights, inside and out!



But I'm looking for other good ways to use energy that won't personally cost me an unreasonable amount of money.  I can afford it, but I don't like to waste it.



TEN POINTS for the best idea on how to show my contempt for environmentalism by causing lots of energy useage...be creative!!

Saving energy saves money, it also improves productivity (more goods and services per input cost), thus giving a boost to the economy. So if you want to continue wasting money for no good reason other than cursing the darkness as you live your life of 1950's-thinking, go ahead, but don't blame anybody else for future economic woes but yourself and others like you.

I want to open an eatery, open to anyone. Cheap for those who can afford it, and maybe affordable to those struggling.



13, 14, 15 years ago, I worked at my college's dining hall. Made 6 bucks an hour, but at that point anything was welcome.



Here is my idea: Open a community "dining hall". It would save folks money. And maybe more importantly, it would save energy - less natural gas heating up the oven, stove and warmers, less packaging etc. Folks would need to travel to it, it's local so they can walk. Those who can't, folks can walk meals to them.



We'd aim to buy local.



What do yall thnk? Yep, need to find a central kitchen. Yep, need to find volunteers, maybe paid, not that thought-out yet.

Costly to who? It is expensive to build. Takes lots of engineering and planning. Though, once it is up it is up pretty much.



Environmentally? Big cost. Altering flow and sediment in the river can completely transform the landscape and geology.
Silting behind dams is an issue and needs to be removed.



Can be associated with mudslides and other natural disasters.
Biodiversity is threatened significantly. Many types of fish, particularly migratory fish, etc.
45000 rivers are currently dammed the world over however, so it can't be all bad. Some countries (like New Zealand) are almost completely dependent on hydro.

To the 'Sheeple' answerer who touts global warming as being myth and any others whose sole focus on the environment is global warming...



It doesn't MATTER if global warming is or isn't happening and it doesn't matter if we are or aren't causing or adding to it. There are thousands and thousands of OTHER ways that we are destroying the environment. Going green isn't just about global warming. It's about protecting species. It's about waste management so that we aren't drinking and eating our own landfill pollution. It's about the chemicals in the products we use and consume that are poisoning our bodies. It's about the air we breathe being clean. It's about renewable fuels and power sources. It's about colony collapse and pollination.



Even if you don't believe in global warming (I'm not sure myself if we are causing it and there might not ever be a way to know for sure), you should STILL "go green" for the many many other environmental problems that plague us.

Just yesterday I watched a documentary on the First Africans to go to Australia over 50,000 years ago (yes, fifty thousand years ago) and how it was possible because at the time, the tilt of the earth made it so that the polls didn't recieve as much radiation as now and therefore the sea levels were MUCH MUCH LOWER then they are today... Exposing LOTS of land and islands for them to stop off at and gather food.



It showed exactly how the gyration of the earth combined with the volcanic action under the polls can cause there to be ice sheets miles thick or almost no ice at all...



If you do the research and don't just listen to what they tell you on Planet Green, you will discover that the thousands of scientists that "All Agree" do not and that the facts are still not in.



RESEARCH this POLITICAL AGENDA and you will see that it is nothing but a scam to milk every 'guilt penny' they can from you.



Al Gore is the KING of this scam... He started his "Carbon Credit" company TWO YEARS before going on his 'mission' to inform the world of global warming.



He is making MILLIONS from you sheep...



If a Republican tried to do something like this and was discovered... Hippies would have raided the compound and had him swinging from a tree!



"How dare you use environmental issues in your evil quest for PROFITS!?!?!?" They would scream...



But since it is Al Gore that is the head of the scam... Well now... That is a different situation all together!



Yeah... Sure...



Sheeple make me sick...

Realistically we can never solve it with population levels where they are and industrialisation growing as it is.
IF and that's a bigger word than it looks, if we can start being less greedy and limit our offspring, stop chasing fantasies and slow down our use of energy from the levels we are using it now, then maybe we can resolve some of our problem.
From the first time humans cut down a tree to clear land for farming we entered a cycle of destruction which changed the planet and whether this is for the worst or whether this can be seen as part of our evolution as a species and the resultant evolution of other species as they adapt or die from these changes is the real dilemma.



Is it really worth getting too worried about, just try and leave as small a footprint on this planet as you can. I doubt we will screw it up totally even if humans were to die off and most of the species habiting the planet today.



There are hundreds of ways to save energy but the majority mean giving up a few things so start there and see where it takes you.

thanks, i thought that there was a solution that could stop our damage of the environment, but as you said you can't completly solve it with our population levels. So we have to try to at least try to reduce our use of energy, and not misuse it like we do it now a days.
thx

100% recycled, but only 20% post consumer product?



I am searching for 100% recycled card paper, and its getting tough. I want 100% recycled paper to create my own cards, and the best I've found in the US is 100% recycled, 20% of that being post consumer waste.



Well, how exactly is that other 80% considered recycled, if it isn't post consumer waste? I don't understand. Can anyone explain this to me?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



They recycle paper waste from industrial sources, not collected from consumers.
For example, there's always leftovers from cutting huge rolls into smaller sheets, or test prints etc. from printeries.
Since these are usually cleaner, available in large quantities and contain only one kind of paper (not a mix), they are easier to recycle and the resulting product quality is better.
It is difficult to go above 80% post-consumer paper, but 20% is rather low.

It doesn't matter if you believe it is a natural cycle or caused by our pollution. The worlds weather is changing, it means different things for different areas. The areas near the equator are getting dryer, which means less food and more starvation. Near the poles we are seeing less snow and more ice melt, which means more water in the oceans, which it seems is causing more rain in many area, more floods and rising tides. England can now grow a nice wine grape, and CA is suffering drought and has had to cut the crops in half so we are seeing higher food prices.



There is conflicting reports from a variety of scientists, I'm just preparing for the worst, increased food prices, and energy prices. I'm cutting back expenses, making my home energy efficient and growing some of my own food as well as learning what I can get in my local area.

?? You could find tons about it on google but okay.
Climate change is basically the change in temperature due to "greenhouse gases" such as CO2. Basically, we are emitting these harmful gases (from cars, factories etc.) and they form a thick layer around the planet, so when the UV rays from the sun come through the layer of gases they hit the earth (warming it) and when they bounce back off they can't go back through the layer of gases surrounding the earth (there are loads of pictures on google to illustrate this).
Here are some causes for climate change:
-Cars, planes, motorbikes and any form of transport using fuel
-Factories and industry
-Methane emitted from cows
-Deforestation
(basically trees take in CO2 and give out O2 so by cutting them down we are reducing the amount of things that can absorb the CO2 and get rid of it for us which is why we need to start replanting trees round about NOW)
- there are many more, you can find these anywhere



We can help stop global warming (although not completely) by:
-Using eco-bulbs instead of normal lightbulbs
-Using more public transport and/or bikes and/or walk
-Planting a tree in your garden
-Turn off your TV and PC instead of putting it on Standby or leaving it on unnecessarily
-Unplug chargers when they are not being used
-Taking a shower instead of a bath (uses much less water)
-Raising awareness
there are tons of things you can do. Research stuff on Google, you will find tons and I strongly reccommend that you watch "An Inconvienient Truth" by Al Gore because it explains everything, it's really interesting and it suggests many things you can do.



Consequences of global warming are things like, floods (because the ice around the globe will melt), weather extremes (drought and freezing), increase in allergies for people, the extinction of thousands of species as they will lose their habitat and so die... There are many grave consequences. Research.

There's a lot of disinformation out there about climate change. Climate change is a term used to describe the weather impact of the human variable on the planet.



The globalist who want to find a new tax base would like to tell you that Co2 is a green house gas but it's not really because the term green house gases a term given to certain gases they think affect the weather which has been demonized in the media. They want you to think Co2 which is what you breath out is bad for the weather and is changing the weather of the planet. Horsepucky!



This is a farce, because for one plants need us to breath out Co2 so they can make oxygen for us to breath, Co2 is one of the basic life giving gases on this planet along with oxygen, and nitrogen and a host of others. Cows flatulence for instance causes more methane to be released then humans could ever match. There is a symbiotic relationship with the gases of the planet and the trees, the rain forest, and the coral reefs which help filter our air.



The bottom line is the sun and the solar winds are responsible for most of our weather with man maybe having a 3-5% impact on the weather at best which is not enough to cause catastrophic changes like the media portrays.



Watch the video on Google called "the great global warming swindle" and you will get a more complete idea of how the term climate change came about and how it's misused and how Al Gores globalist movie is filled with distortion and lies. Al Gore should have never won a Nobel peace prize for that movie.



Climate change is a ridiculous term because the climate is forever changing and going through normal cycles that occur every so many decades, hundreds and even thousands of years and right now we are heading into what's called a mini Ice age like the one that happened in the 1600's.



We are not warming we're cooling because the sun is inactive of sun spots which affects the weather we see. When the sun is dormant and the solar winds are coming in it causes a cooling trend because they generate more clouds. When the sun is having many X-class flares and sunspot eruptions then we warm up and have less cloud cover, it's a back and forth cycle that hasn't been understood until recently. Nothing stays the same or lasts forever as the next cycle is just around the corner in the course of normal weather cycle changes.



Don't get me wrong though the planet needs a good cleaning and we need alternative energy sources but it should not be at our expense for breathing normally. Carbon taxes are a scam for the rich to get richer. There are many pollutants and toxic chemicals being dumped into the air that can be controlled and cleaned up but the solar winds, our orbit, the planet, and the main one the sun have the final words on what happens to our weather not man. Man changing the weather what arrogance and ignorance we possess.



P.S. You don't want to get me started on that whole carbon footprint line of crap.........and eco bulbs have mercury that will pollute the water tables around every landfill and dump. LED bulbs are much safer and last longer than the mini florescent which are no replacement for the standard bulb that doesn't pollute with mercury.

Just leave it as it is... Fossil fuel is renewable. The plants recycle the CO2 and give us the O2 but the plants keep the C for food. Later when the leaves die they are washed down to the delta where it will break down into oil & gas. Our oil is being Recycled led so we will never run out of oil...The propagating of Global Warming just gives the oil Co. an excuse to raise prices.

There's lots of things we can do.



Recently somone suggested to me that we only keep the radiators turned on in the rooms we regularly use. Keeping the heating restricted to only the times we need it is good too.



Double glazing is also good, as is insulating your loft properly. So is simple stuff like keeping the front or back door closed.



Then there's wearing more jumpers... and everyone likes a nice warm jumper!

I just wear my warmest hoodie/fleece as my student house room is sooo cold. We turn the heating on occasionally (well, I do coz I feel the cold badly!) and only for a bit - like right before I go to bed.



I wear gloves in my room too as my hands get so cold when I'm not moving. Plus I sometimes go to my friends' warmer houses!

I set my thermostat at 50 to 55 and layer clothing during the day, and if you work around the house it will keep you warmer than just sitting still.
At bedtime, I use a bottle of hot water under my blankets keeps me warmer all night.
I am caulking my windows and such this winter as well, then I am covering the windows with plastic.
I have a plug in electric heater and I only warm the room I am going to be in.



Also I am thinking of hanging my quilts on the outside walls, I hear that is what they used to do when they had no heaters. I will just have to pick out (or buy) the pretty quilts and comforters.
Good luck to all this winter.  ToniaB

I am very luck in that my house is very well insulated and warms very quickly.



I wil be spending the winter months cooking and baking treats for my family. The oven warms the whole house and does away with the need to put the heating on at all.



At the same time i am cooking more than 1 family meal at a time and putting batches in the freezer. This helps save energy and costs as it uses up the same amount of electric to cook 2 meals as it does 1. Also by filling my freezer i am making it more efficient and reducing it's running costs.
I have been buying more board games to get the telly off and get our family interacting together it is amzing how many laughs you can have and how much your children relax and chat more when you play simple card games.

This is a great question and I think that we're all feeling the pinch these days, constant news of rising energy bills and the worry of if we're able to afford those energy bills can certainly send a shiver down our spines and make us all sit down and think. My grandmother and other members of family passed on some great tips to me as I now have my own property and I'm realising just how expensive it can be to heat our homes and stay warm, especially during the winter months, I've been able to have my home insulated free of charge through the help of my energy supplier and this has helped to cut down my bills a great deal and also make my home that little bit warmer. By having double glazing fitted and my radiators checked reguarly, this has ensured that they're giving me optimal service, instead of just burning up energy and my money.



We can all do some really simply things like switching off lights and appliances when they're not in use or when we're not in the room and that works for the radiators in those rooms too, simply by turning down the thermostat a few degrees we can save a lot of money in the long run, but don't turn them down too much as it's wise to keep them at a low level so as not to get dampness or anything else nasty in our homes. I always make sure that the room I'm in is at a comfortable level of heating and that I'm wrapped up warm as you hear so many stories of people dying of the cold in winter time, especially pensioners, I sometimes put an extra duvet on my bed or wear socks in bed at night as that helps a great deal also and even my trusty old hot water bottle comes out when it's really cold, which I must add has been boiled from my coal fire and not the kettle!



It's always a good idea to shut doors when you're in a room so as to keep the heat in, there's no point heating a room if all the heat is just going to escape, If we have draughts in our doors and windows a lot of heat can escape from there and cold can come in, apart from the obvious of making sure that they're sealed and securely shut we can also have them caulked. I just recently had my own windows and doors caulked to stop any heat escaping my home and the cold entering coming in. We can also put a draught excluder down at door entries if it's really cold or put a curtain up to stop that draught, I also take down my thin curtains on my windows in winter and replace them with thick, lined ones as that stops the heat escaping and plus it's another way of keeping the cold out of my house. We really don't need to have too many lights on and I usually just use my lamp which I must add has been fitted like every other light in my house with an energy saving light bulb. In these times of high energy prices it's the little things that really matter, I usually have showers as they're both quicker and don't use as much energy, but even after having a bath, which is now only done on a Sunday and is a little luxury I mantain, don't just let the water pour down the drain, leave it for an hour as the heat and steam from it will heat up your house and leave a lovely smell that will just drift through your home.



A lot of people are unaware that heat and cold travels, if you don't have underlay then you're more than likely to have problem with the cold entering your house from below, it's always wise to have your carpets/laminate/hardwood flooring fitted with underlay as it's another way of saving energy and keeping you warm. If we're really keen on saving energy and keeping warm we can also do simple things like moving about often or getting up and doing a little bit of excercise, this will stimulate our body and help a little in keeping us warm through the winter wonderland of these next few months, just think from all that money we've saved, we can treat the ones we love to a little something extra special this Christmas!



I have very much enjoyed answering this question and you have got me thinking about other ways I can try and save both energy and keep myself warm, by being made aware of the little things that we can do, more people will try and help out the planet and also help themselves. I post below my picture and a few relevant links which may be of use to anyone with a keen interest in this subject or someone simply looking for more information on grants for insulation, double glazing, boiler replacement or anything else that may be available to them:

The best thing is to dress warmly, make sure there are no leaks around doors and windows, drink hot drinks throughout the day, eat spicy foods, do my laundry and drying on the days when it is really cold (the dryer helps the house to warm a little), do my baking and cooking on the colder days and eat leftovers when it is warmer. Something I am doing more often is to open up the doors and let the warmer air inside during the warmest part of the day for cooler weather, or when it is too warm during the day, open up during the coolest part of the day in early morning. That really helps the comfort level throughout the rest of the day and it delays a few hours the central heat/air conditioning coming on. My house is well-insulated. The other night I was dreaming I was baking biscuits, because it had gotten a little chilly that night. I bake biscuits or muffins for breakfast on days when it is chilly in the morning, helps to keep the heater from coming on throughout the day.  If you use a humidifier during the winter, the extra humidity helps to raise the comfort level. Another thing that helps is to use the color red, because it is psychologically a warm color and may even help physically for us to feel warmer---red socks, blanket, whatever, add some red in the winter time.

Most UK homes don't have the recommended amount of insulation. By properly insulating your home you could save £180 a year on your heating bills. Also, cutting down the energy your home wastes will help fight climate change as well. That's because home energy use is responsible for over a quarter of all emissions of CO2.



By fitting an insulation jacket 75mm (3 inches) thick on your hot water tank  and you could save around £30 a year. If every UK household that could fitted an adequate tank-jacket tomorrow, it would save over £132 million of energy every year. you can also insulate water pipes - and do full loads of washing and dishes rahter than half, to get the most out of your money.



Around half the heat lost in a typical home escapes through the walls and the roof. a insulated loft should be around 270mm thick, to save you money and keep you warm, and pays itself back in no time a tall. also insulate your walls, If everyone in the UK filled their wall cavities, it would save around £670 million of energy a year. by simply adding pvc seals on exterior doors you can stop small but constant draughts getting in.



if you take a bath to stay warm, just take a shower instead,it uses much less water.



and wrap up warm of course!

I see from all the answers that we are going back to having homes heated as they were in my youth. In those days the only rooms that were heated were the Parlour or Living room and if there was a boiler the kitchen. The rest of the house was unheated and I remember having ice on the inside of the windows, no double glazing in those days, the advent of central heating has made the whole house warmer but of course costs money.



Personally I run my house at about 54 F and only let the heating come on when there is a threat of freezing or I am sitting about.



As for lighting all my lamps are energy saving.

We keep the heating turned off as much as possible. We haven't had it on yet. The radiators in rooms that aren't used as much are turned to their lowest setting.



To add a little warmth cheaply we have a hot water bottle each. It keeps the chill off without having to heat the whole house.



In the summer we spent a lot of time outside. We also get out in the winter too. It helps you acclimatise to lower temperatures.



All our lighting is energy efficient and if it isn't needed it is turned off.



We also have a good winter duvet on our bed. It's so warm we don't need heating in the bedroom that often.

lots of ways



1. Having the central heating on times mode, prior to getting up, if the house is warmer you only need it for about 20 minutes, not a couple of hours



2. Take showers and less baths



3. use the radiators to put damp washing on, not the tumble dryer



4. but a maiden for airing clothes on



5. use the washing line even if only for half an hour



6. do a once a week big cook, have lots of things in the oven all together, put in portion sized boxes, freeze and defrost the night before you need them



7, buy a big bag of potatoes, saves fuel on shopping trips



8, encourage people to wear two layers around the house



9. turn the thermostat down on heating and water appliances



10. take up exercise



11. turn everything off that you can, telly, sky, pc,



12. use a hand whisk, wooden spoon and good old fashioned bowl instead of the electric mixer



13, make up large portions of hot puddings, take some to work and reheat to keep you warm after your lunch



and there's loads more you can do if your serious about saving energy, we are, its to expensive not to be

I have bought as much ECO-WOOL as I can afford (it was on BOGOF at B&Q) and rolled it out on top of the other insulation in my loft. It's lovely stuff to handle - if you wrap it round yourself you can feel how warm it is! I have stapled THERMAWRAP general purpose insulation (it's a heavy-duty, reflective bubble wrap) to the rafters, making the loft feel like a space capsule. My photo (attached) shows both these types of insulation fitted in my loft



We also have an extension with an enclosed roofspace. I have filled this to a depth of 200mm with loose insulation called WARMCEL 100, made from recycled newspaper fire-retardant. As well as keeping the bedrooms warm, this has the added benefit of deadening the sound of the aeroplanes that pass over my house as they come in to land at Heathrow airport.



I have replaced my old boiler with an A-rated condensing boiler from BUDERUS (same company as Worcester Bosch).



My most expensive investment in keeping warm without wasting energy was a whole house ventilation system with 90% efficient heat recovery, from ADM SYSTEMS. This gives us clean (filtered) fresh air 24/7 while the windows remain firmly shut, keeping the warmth in and the noise out!



I have also installed a solar water heater which provides enough hot water for all our showering and washing up during the summer months.



In the year since this I made all these changes, my gas usage has dropped by 23%, saving over 4 Megawatt-hours of energy and avoiding 800kg CO2 emissions annually.



The total cost of installing the condensing boiler was £2500, the same price as installing the solar panel with a new, dual coil hot water cylinder. Having the heat recovery ventilation system professionally installed cost me £4500 and the insulation cost me £500. So I have invested £10,000 in more efficient heating - paid for by selling my car!



It won't all be paid back in reduced energy bills but I did it in order to reduce my carbon footprint. With no car, my total greenhouse gas emissions are about a quarter of what they were a couple of years ago!



These investments have also increased the value of my home so I will see some benefit when I sell up and the emissions reductions from this house will continue indefinitely, whoever is living in it.

First wear several thin layers in doors - they can easily be peeled off if you get too warm.  It is better to be warmer than cold in the British winter! Small children can wear vests, t-shirts and a thin jumper etc.



Set your thermostat to 20 in the daytime, at night you should have it no higher than 18 for a comfortable nights sleep.  The best way to heat your house is to have the radiators on downstairs, switching the one off in your kitchen is a good idea (or at least turn it down as in theory you are cooking and this warms the kitchen) and half your radiators on low upstairs. Set your boiler for half hour before you wake up and to go off about half hour before you leave for work school - and set them again for half hour before you return home and for half hour before go to bed.  This way you will only use gas when you are at home - but don't put the thermostat above 20 as you don't need it any warmer. Heat rises so your upstairs should be well covered.



Drawing your curtains will trap in heat.  Use low energy lightbulbs (they are on offer in Tescos @ 2 for £1 at the moment) and invest in table lights to only light the are you are sitting in.



A water jacket on your immersion will help to stop your boiler going crazy if you don't have a combination heater.  It's important to get your boiler serviced once a year as a boiler that isn't running safely or efficiently is likely to run your bills up, or worse.



Drink plenty of warm fluids and make sure you move about. Sitting down on your bum watching tv will slow down your heart rate thus slowing your blood flow - get those arms and legs moving and circulate your blood!!



Use an extra blanket on the bed, and if possible put a fleece blanket under the sheet you normally sleep on. Socks are great at keeping feet warm!!



Proper food containing slow release carbs are a great idea - make sure you eat breakfast as missing this will affect your body all day.



Always keep one room warm by shutting doors to keep the heat in, and in the evening hot water bottles are great to cuddle in front of the tv.



Lastly rugs on laminate flooring traps heat - as like carpets they stop it from escaping so if you have wooden flooring consider getting a couple of nice mats.



The Government offer schemes to insulate your roofs and even cavity walls, so check out your local council to see what is available to you.

I note the seriousness of the answers given so far, and think they are all wonderful ideas, however, I have to go with my initial reaction to the question...When it gets a little colder I get in from work, close all the curtains, have a home cooked meal with my partner (usually a one pot casserole, less personal energy used up and less washing up!), and then we climb the "old wooden hill", and snuggle ourselves down in our huge duvet, with the big fluffy throw over the top...when we don't want to expel too much personal energy we generally laugh and talk about our day, and the things we have found interesting throughout the week, but also about the exciting things the future holds for us and our friends. Its a fantastic way to keep warm, not use too much energy and yet still get to know your partner really well...helps the environment in more ways than one :o)

First of all, well done to all of you for your awareness and membership of the school environmentalist group.



You have fallen into a trap that many adults do when thinking about green issues, you have forgotten about the environmental costs of the product; the shirts themselves. Even if they are organically grown, fair trade cotton shirts, with eco friendly dyes then, it is still more damaging to the environment to grow that cotton, transport it, manufacture it, warehouse it, sell it on to the shops, transport it home, dispose of it after you have finished with it, than it would be NOT to make the shirt in the first place.
IF that was the ONLY shirt somebody was going to buy and they only had one other shirt, then buying a second shirt could be seen as a need. However, most people just buy and buy, and it is this OVER consumption that is also so very damaging.

What should you do?



Look at all the resources you already have, not just things, but people too.



So recycling stuff may be a good idea to raise cash. Hold school table top sales where students bring unwanted toys, books, cd's, uniforms etc and the profits are used to buy your trees. Or collect acorns, chestnuts, conkers, fruit pips and plant your own trees. Or do odd jobs for cash. Or start a community gardening club, where students can offer to weed gardens, cut lawns or dig patches in return for a set fee, this would be particularly liked by older people and those who have very busy lifestyles.



Or look at the skills of the group itself and your families, perhaps somebody is great at baking and can offer a freezer filling service, or somebody may be great at dog walking or car washing.



If you have to buy something in to sell on, it is not green. Using what you have, what you can recycle, what skills you have to earn money to plant trees or growing and planting trees yourself is much much more environmentally friendly and much better for your community and the students too!



Good luck, and keep up the good work!

Rather than selling shirts to fund the purchase of trees have you considered selling reusable grocery store bags in order to replace the ubiquitous thin plastic bags that are usually discarded in waste dumps or that end up in water systems further polluting our environment.
The bags and the ink on them can be environmentally friendly, meaning they use no toxic chemicals and use recycled fibers.

I have just a few thousand trees start themselves every year on my farm, so that I have to work hard to prevent them all from growing. It thus amuses me to see that someone has found a group of people to actually pay for these volunteer growth trees.



I am not concerned that you are buying them, just amazed.



Trees grow like weeds. Well, in a way they are weeds unless one wants them where they are or where one wants to plant them. For instance, once you get a walnut tree producing nuts, new trees will show up all over the surrounding land for a  hundred metres or more. Squirrels will move the nuts all over the place and next year you have a few hundred trees.
Sounds ok, but each succeeding year the number of new trees



increases, until your land reminds you of a lawn of trees, thousands of them, all competing for space, water, light.



Maple trees will seed down a much larger area much faster, but one never runs out of examples of the way trees go wild.



The problem is not getting trees, it is finding places to plant them. When you think of buying trees, offer a farmer the service of removing his excess saplings each year, for free.
Now brace yourself.  You can be talking thousands of trees and have not planned where to put a hundred. You could use an area of lawn planted fairly close together, say on a grid one meter by one meter, to await making final distribution.



But do not imagine most farmers would welcome you to plant trees all over their land. Only land that is steep, rocky,swampy, a poor fit for farming, will be offered as a place to plant your trees.  Farmers in windy areas may want trees to provide a shelter from wind or trees to line a driveway. I do not mean farmers are all anti-tree. But I do want you to understand that getting trees should not cost you money, What would cost money is finding places to plant them.



In general selling things to raise money falls into the trap of consumerism. We would prefer that people live with fewer things rather than spend money buying things they do not need to raise money for things that can be done without money.

Of the two types I am familiar with, mono crystalline and poly crystalline silicon wafer. Mono is slightly better in terms of size to power output.



You can easily spot the difference, with the poly crystalline cells you will notice that it looks as if the crystals are pointing in all directions and are all different shapes and sizes.

Corn is far less nutritious than beef. If you take as an example the Irish potato famine, the Irish discovered to their horror that corn is not a good base for a diet the way potatoes are.



The cattle rumen has a bacterial process that changes carbohydrate to protein, wasting a large part of the carbohydrate, but producing a diet for the cow that contains everything the cow needs, a fully balanced diet. When we eat that beef we get the benefit of that balanced diet, but at the cost of even further energy lost... first building up the beef in the cow, then breaking it down in our gut, and building our muscle.



Now if the only objective we had in eating was to satisfy our energy need, corn would be a highly efficient way to do it. But corn alone would leave us weak, sick. We need the array of proteins, vitamins that a ruminant can supply, even if it costs us some energy.



Now American Indian communities had realized that if corn was to be a basic part of the diet then it needed to be supplemented with squash, pumpkin, deer, fish, fruits.  Corn could provide the energy but not the health.

Meat is an incredibly inefficient way of producing calories. It is also a very destructive way of producing calories which I will expand on later.



Each 16lb of of animal feed (wheat or corn) grown produces 1lb of meat (on average). So if you have a 1,100lb steer, it means 16 x 1,100lb of corn/vegetables. Which could feed humans directly, as they do in many countries that are not as affluent as ours.



'It takes 16 pounds of grain and 2,500 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of meat. One average meat eater could consume that pound of meat during a meal, while 16 people could have been fed on the grain it takes to produce that pound of meat'



Quoted directly from the video below which takes it's facts from valid sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency and 2006 UN report among others.



http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=hWWNLvgU4M...



Further there is approximately 50% loss in butchery yields through wastage. Live weight 1100lb, saleable retail cuts = 512lb.



http://www.askthemeatman.com/info1.htm



In the West, many parts of the animal are never eaten by humans, they used to be fed back to the cattle. Even if you accept these (very conservative) figures as retail weight, there is further loss in cooking (shrinkage). It is very significant.



http://www.madbutcher.co.nz/cooking_tips...



'There is further loss in cooking (shrinkage). It is very significant'



'Generally, cooking losses range from 1/4 to 1/3 of the raw meat weight'



'An average cooked serving of meat weighs 140 - 160g. The amount of raw meat required for that serving depends on how much the meat shrinks during cooking as well as the particular cut, its size, fat and bone content and the degree of doneness. Generally, cooking losses range from 1/4 to 1/3 of the raw meat weight. Remember, cooking losses in small roasts and portion cuts tend to be greater than in larger cuts'.



facts below are agreed and supported by United Nations Reports, Environmental Protection Agency, The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Fellow members of the meat industry etc.

Quoted directly from video link above



'1 Factory farms produce massive amounts of dust and other contamination that pollutes our air. A study in Texas found that animal feedlots in the state produce more than 14 million pounds of particulate dust every year and that the dust "contains biologically active organisms such as bacteria, mold, and fungi from the feces and the feed."



2 According to the nonprofit group Greenpeace, all the wild animals and trees in more than 2.9 million acres of rainforest were destroyed in the 2004-2005 crop season in order to grow crops that are used to feed chickens and other animals in factory farms.



3 According to a 2006 UN report, the livestock sector causes more greenhouse gases worldwide than the entire transportation sector.
4 Nitrous oxide is about 300 times more potent as a global warming gas than carbon dioxide. According to the U.N., the meat, egg, and dairy industries account for a staggering 65 percent of worldwide nitrous oxide emissions.
5 According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the run-off from factory farms pollutes our waterways more than all other industrial sources combined. The EPA reports that chicken, hog, and cattle excrement have polluted 35,000 miles of rivers in 22 states and contaminated groundwater in 17 states.
6 It takes 16 pounds of grain and 2,500 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of meat. One average meat eater could consume that pound of meat during a meal, while 16 people could have been fed on the grain it takes to produce that pound of meat.
7 The meat industry causes more water pollution in the US than all other industries combined because the animals raised for food produce 130 times more excrement than the entire human population--86,000 lbs per second. A typical pig factory farm generates a quantity of raw waste equal to that of a city of 12,000 people.
8 Every 2 seconds, a child starves to death somewhere in the world. Countries such as Ethiopia and some Central American countries use their farmland to supply the United States with cheap burgers instead of growing healthful grain foods for their own starving people.
9 The livestock population of the US consumes enough grain and soybeans to feed more than 5 times its human population. 90% of all corn and 80% of all grains and beans grown in the US are used to feed livestock animals.
10. 75 percent of U.S. topsoil has been lost to date, 85 percent of that loss is due to livestock rearing.

(Aussies) Have you received approval for a solar PV system, but are now considering backing out?



There are rumors that the $8000 solar rebate has been over subscribed after a mad rush in the last 6 months. Have you or anyone you know received an approval to install, but are now considering backing out of the installation. ie. you completed an application months ago, are now pre-approved for the rebate, but with the problems in the economy (or any other reasons you would care to share) you are now thinking of canceling, out or at least delaying the installation till near the end of your 6 month grace period.

Yes when they put the $100000 cap this seemed to be the trigger for the rush in my opinion.. maybe it was just the publicity it got, I doubt many people knew about the rebate before this. As you have stated the cap means that people who could most afford it do not qualify, so I am wondering if a lot of people took it up, ie. got a free quote & made an application, but now they have 6 months to go ahead with it, are they really going to go ahead and pay the $4000 odd out-of-pocket to install it? Especially considering the change in the economy between the date of application and approval and/or did they apply 'just in case' they may want it, or were talked into it by overzealous installers?

What is the step-by-step process of making a home-made/school sci lab-made bioplastic using sago starch?



Most are using potato  starch but I want to make a plastic film from sago starch. Just how would you extract the substance in sago starch that makes polymerization possible? Please give me the process of making a plastic film.

(Aussies) Have you received approval for a solar PV system, but are now considering backing out?



There are rumors that the $8000 solar rebate has been over subscribed after a mad rush in the last 6 months. Have you or anyone you know received an approval to install, but are now considering backing out of the installation. ie. you completed an application months ago, are now pre-approved for the rebate, but with the problems in the economy (or any other reasons you would care to share) you are now thinking of canceling, out or at least delaying the installation till near the end of your 6 month grace period.

</question>



<additional details>



Yes when they put the $100000 cap this seemed to be the trigger for the rush in my opinion.. maybe it was just the publicity it got, I doubt many people knew about the rebate before this. As you have stated the cap means that people who could most afford it do not qualify, so I am wondering if a lot of people took it up, ie. got a free quote & made an application, but now they have 6 months to go ahead with it, are they really going to go ahead and pay the $4000 odd out-of-pocket to install it? Especially considering the change in the economy between the date of application and approval and/or did they apply 'just in case' they may want it, or were talked into it by overzealous installers?

My understanding was that the threshold at which you get the Govt rebate was lowered (the income threshold) to under $100,000. essentially meaning the only people that could afford it now don't qualify for the rebate and as such, can't afford it either.



I wouldn't back out though.

We had our 2.4kw system put in today. I am sure you can back out, once you have approval. Our system cost $17500 out of pocket and we only make $35000 between us so this is a huge expense for us. It is definitely worth it though. Great for the environment firstly. Also there is going to be a MASSIVE increase in the costs of electricity something like 40%. (Due to carbon trading)When this happens everyone will be turning to solar and you can bet by that stage the rebate will be no longer available. We are aware of the global finance issues, but the environmental issues definitely out way them! Something to think about anyway.
Also, just thought I would mention that it will take about 17 years to pay its self off, once  the power price goes up obviously this time will almost halve. The Government has also guarranteed the 45cents a KW hour they pay for the power you make for 20 years.

Don't feel bad because several people want what you have to offer. I do try to not give to the same people twice, and if you really take a look there are many people who use the service a lot. I'm just glad that someone seems to have a use for something that was cluttering up my home.



For the person who doesn't know what freecycle is. It is a website where people post things that they no longer want and others can ask to take it from them for free. It is kinda like a hybrid of recycling and craigs list.

I don't believe in first come, first serve. Often those who reply first live on the computer, and try to sweep down and get *all* the goodies. Or they say they want it, and then pick and choose which ones they actually show up for.



My criteria:
1. Manners - not just "I'll take it" - how about even a please?
2. Their history - I check the archives - do they give stuff? Ask for a ton of stuff? That may make a difference.
3. Possible use - I tend to prefer teachers and non profits, if possible, but I get turned off by long, whiny stories.
4. Ease of connection - do they offer times for pickup that are compatible to mine?
5. If someone was a no-show for me in the past with no excuse, there is no way they'll get something else from me.

solar power generation is made artificially profitable with subsidies and possible gains from carbon credits but not an economically feasible business in itself. see reference below for an example of a one megawatt plant.

Yes, nuclear energy has the problem to be constant because of security problems. A lot of nocturnal energy would be lost...



Liquid ammonia is a great hydrogen storage system:
1 liter of liquid ammonia containes more than 1 m3 of hydrogen at room conditions and need about 5-6 kwh of electric energy:



electric energy  ----&gt;  H2 (efficiency about 70%)  ---&gt; liquid ammonia (about 80%)  ---&gt;  H2 (from 80 to 100%)



Surely Usa and France would can produce more than 10 million tonnes of equivalent oil from their lost nuclear energy...

Probably a third world country that is too poor to pollute (and which you wouldn't want to live in).

But among the developed countries France is pretty good, very low CO2 emissions from their electricity sector (being about the only country to have actually solved the CO2 problem from electricity helps there, maybe the rest of the world should copy them) and electricity does make up a pretty high proportion of their energy usage.

As much as many of us are environmentally concious these days, we are going the wrong way about it by trying to enforce those beliefs upon the people. If an individual wishes to go "green" that should be their choice without dictatorship from their government, or anyone else. Secondly, those that try and enforce their green ideals should do so first by example!

HI there

I am interested in Ecology, and really don't know as much as I would like to know, in fact I believe on it, as a must.

I go along with water conservation, at this moment of time the water companies have a lot of leakages from their water mains, which had been unchecked for years.

Of course they are slowly repairing them. One german group sold their shares a little while back, because of Government 
legislation and penalty's. (Shareholders came first, that was Thames Water.)

At around that time 'Water Boards' where pressurising the



Government and public to have water meters, to pay for the water you use. I had a letter asking me to have a meter installed,
I gracefully declined.

When there is no - or is a water pipe ban, I was asked if I wished to include payment for a hose pipe. (A no - no.!!)  We did our part, we installed showers, ripped out a bath, our toilets cisterns are water friendly.

Also we do use Solar heating  for our hot water and our radiators., to help our financial resources. We were going to have a windmill generator as an alternative supply of electricity. this was not financially viable, or economic.

I used to travel a lot in my work, looking at the land around abouts. Farmers planted corn crops year after year, crops were not rotated, this was on chalky downs. The soil being more white
than brown, this is what I called 'Nitrate' farming to force feed the
crops, for there was no humus in the soil.

The rest of the year being pasture land,  sheep grazed the pastures. On rainy spells this nitrate would wash into the streams. This in turn killed a lot of Kingfishers, Woodpeckers, 
some years ago we had a lot of Dutch Elm disease because of it.
Not to mention other bird life, and other smaller animal life.

Dairy products can be affected too, through the spraying of root
crops, such as potatoes and vegetables. Then there are beet crops, and orchard fruit crops sprayed to keep the bugs down, these substances are hazardous, no matter how small the content.

World wide fishing stocks are gradually being depleted through over trawling.

North and South Poles are having a gradual meltdown, and the oceans are rising, so low lying land masses such as Polynesia,
Micronesia, are in imminent danger of going beneath the waves.
Low lying countries and places, like Holland, East Anglia and London are under threat to a lesser degree.

What with toxic emitions from developing countries like China and India with hot air gases rising and lodging themselves in the upper atmosphere. China is in real difficulties with heavy polluted rivers, and smog. Where large areas of land have had no rainfall with desert like conditions.

The USA has at last woken up, and is at last doing some in-house cleansing towards becoming pollution free, thus at last
being more accountable with their casual attitude to discharging
pollutants.

Cars and lorries have become cleaner and greener. I have an idea trains are being dealt with at this moment of time. What concerns me and never gets a mention is aircraft, Jumbo's and the like of:- are AV-GAS burners, the pollution caused must be
astronomical.

This is a subject that goes on and on. So it's time to terminate.

Cheers

Pee - Wee.

Plastic isn't environmentally friendly because it doesn't break down naturally.  Plastic can be recycled, if so indicated on the plastic product, which is helpful, but it still isn't eco-friendly :-)  Your plastic shopping bags can even be recycled.  Our grocery store has a special barrel where we can drop those used bags so they can be recycled again and again.  Personally, I purchased Acme bags and bring them to all stores now in lieu of utilizing plastic bags.  Saving water is always a good idea; Hubby and I are looking into buying a water barrel to gather rain water from our gutters which can then be used to water our gardens.  Keep trying little things -- they mean a lot !

You can be more environmentally friendly without spending money or major lifestyle changes. Many people confuse being eco friendly or green with global warming and renewable energy. To me renewable energy is only a part of my eco friendly efforts. I'll put my standard going green blurb below. As far as plastic, yes, much of it is recyclable, but much of it is single use. I've dramatically reduced the amount of plastic in my life and have replaced it with durable reusable items, from cloth shopping bags to glass food starage containers.



•	Going green is easy, there are so many great resources about the subject. My personal favorite is "The Green Book" which has parts of its book online as well at www.readthegreenbook.com.

As I have been striving to "Go Green" I realize it is like stepping back in time without getting rid of my modern conveniences. I'm doing many things I learned as a child, like line drying my clothes, sweeping instead of vacuuming, opening the windows in the morning to catch the cool breeze, only buying what I need instead of everything that looks cool, growing some of my own food, and canning what I can't eat now.



To me "going Green" is a frame of mind. Do what fits your lifestyle and do the easy things first, it is a process and like dieting if you go to radical to soon, you are more likely to go back to bad habits. I also believe there are good, better, best choices in most things. If you aren't ready to start a home garden, then try finding a farmers market, until you locate one look for produce grown as close to home as possible and go organic when available.



Many people think "going green" is expensive, I disagree. Some changes may take an initial investment, but they usually have a short payoff time. Things like weatherstiping and insulation cost, but the energy savings will add up quickly. You may need to purchase reusable bags, but most stores give you a 5 or 10 cent credit, so you are paid back within a few months.



My top tips are make your home more energy efficient, that also means using natural light, cooling and heating.



Reduce your packaging, if you eat more fresh food you will generally reduce packaging, it's the same thing they tell dieters, shop the perimiter, that is where all the meat, dairy and produce are located. Only buy what you will use, many Americans throw away a lot of unused food. Buy in bulk, that doesn't just mean large packages, but that area with the bins that you buy only what you plan on using.



Replace disposable items with durable items, if you eat outside often and use disposable paper or plastic plates, it is a wise investment to purchase a set of reusable plastic plates. Replace disposable razors, diapers and cleaning products like swiffer. Avoid bottled water, get a home filter like Pur or Brita.

Recycle, www.earth911.org will help you locate the nearest recycle center. I try to only purchase plastics that are #1 or #2, they are more easily recycled. I also buy recycled products when available, that includes paper towels, napkings, toilet paper, tissue, school/office supplies and clothing.

Detox your cleaning, vinegar and baking soda clean almost anything, they can even losen a hair clog. Seventh Generation and Method are a couple mainstream brands that are very earth friendly.



Just start small and build from there, don't get overwhelmed.

It helps a lot to turn off the water while brushing teeth and while soaping up and scrubbing your hands.  Some plastics can be recycled, but they certainly don't break down in landfills and since so many people don't actually recycle yet, a bunch of it still ends up there forever.

turning the water off when cleaning your teeth does make a difference.  Plastic can be recycled, but reducing the amount we use and reusing is better.  Think about the energy used in recycling something.  What do you buy in plastic containers - is there an alternative?  Think about milk..you can get it delivered in glass bottles which are reused. Instead of buying bottled water, invest in a brita filter, the filters once used can be returned to the manufacturer for recycling.

Plastic milk bottle lids are number 2, which is the same as the milk bottle itself, so it can be recycled.  However, most other lids are a mixture of plastics, so that makes them difficult to recycle.
Your council probably say no lids to save anyone becoming confused.

Yes they can be recycled, "but", the recycling plant is a business and certain items are not profitable.

They would have to pay somebody to sort bottle tops, fill a lorry and send it to somewhere like Aberdeen, were they would be melted down into fence posts or such like.

there are so many things you can do to make your christmas a greener one.



Almost everything can be recycled now! You empty glass bottles from all that extra christmas bubbly, plastic bottles, your xmas cards and wrapping paper.



Limit the food you buy so that its not wasted and compost the leftovers or feed them to the birds/your dog or something like that.

Either buy an artifical tree that you can reuse year after year or even better buy a real one with roots and replant it each year in the garden. Dont buy new decorations every year, stick to ones that are special to you and your family like nannas old glass decorations or babys first christmas decorations and other special ones like that. to fill in any gaps make decorations you can eat, cookies and sweets. Yum, use christmas spices in the recipies and they even make your room smell nice!! (saves on pine fresh christmas tree smelling sprays! lol) Use energy saving lights with LED bulbs.

Shut your doors and make sure the seals on your windows are decent to cut down your heating bills, dont use a tumble dryer where possible dry your clothes on a radiator. Same goes all year round!! :)

Re use gift bags, dont use foil wraping paper, walk or take the bus to the shops if possible, Take your own reused carrier bags or a shopper when doing your buying for xmas food and gifts, Dont put your fruit and veg from the suermarket in the little plastic bags to seperate it use paper to wrap them or something else (maybe a new use for your old giftbags! hehe)

As tempting as it is to have the TV on constantly watching all those xmas specials and films havent you probably seen most of them 100 times before?

We keep all out bottled drinks outside the back door during the winter, it keeps it colder! Also iliminates the need for the spare drinks fridge we use during the summer

The perfect gift for a 'eco warror' :) pay for their car CO2 emitions to be nutralised through this website - http://www.targetneutral.com/TONIC/index... or give a gift tree. Buy a film renting subscription for the movie nut in your family rather then a bunch of dvds, wind up torches and phone chargers make good and unusual gifts. Use ebay for gifts! it saves things going into the bin and saves you money in the prosess. If your thinking of buying a silly novilty gift for someone dont, chances are they will just throw it away, which brings me to another great tip Freecycle unwanted christmas gifts - www.freecycle.org



Limit the packaging on everything you buy and if it has to be packed then make it recyclable packing. Lets be fair you cant not buy your childs dream toy because it has a lot of packing around it. 'Sorry jimmy bob, santa didnt bring you the space rocket you wanted, there was to much packaging on it' Na!

Theres so many things you can do to go green at christmas and all year round and even if you only do a couple of things on the list you will have helpted

Merry Christmas

Plenty, especially seeing how non-green christmas is.  We could all be miserable gits and ban all these christmas lights and sit around in dull, miserable, cold winteriness (but non of us want that).  Firstly we could use christmas lights which are more efficient, such as LEDs which are significantly more efficient than normal lights.

Also we should try and use recyclable and recycled wrapping paper.  Every year we fill several bags with paper which goes straight to the landfill, a massive waste especially when making recyclable paper shouldn't be particularly difficult.

We should also try to use local produce when possible.  The traditional christmas dinner exists because it comprises of food which is readily available at this time of year, so there should be no need for our food to come from any further affield than Europe at the most.

Finally we can thank the TV channels for putting so much rubbish on the TV that no one should be wasting electricity watching the TV, so there is a positive already.

We can look at reducing the food miles on everything we buy for christmas dinner.
We can all stop sending christmas cards, unless they are from renewable sources or recycled.
We can buy a tree with roots which can be planted in the garden after christmas and used year after year.
We can use a flasher on our christmas lights to reduce the amount of energy used. And use LEDs
Reduce our travel miles, look at alternative ways of travelling and only make necessary journeys.
Reuse carrier bags - don't get a bag in every shop you buy presents or food in.
Reduce the amount of waste we produce esp from food wrapping. Try and buy fresh produce that doesn't need poythene wrapping.
The list is endless really!!
And remember - Reduce,Reuse,Recycle!!

Things we are doing are...
(1)Buy gifts from thrift stores, and fix them up, get people things that they need instead of just getting people stuff that they will end up throwing away.
(2)Wrap gifts in recycled paper, or make cloth bags to put the gift in, and they can reuse the bags to put groceries in from the store.
(3)Give green gifts, like biodegradable cleaners, and books on going green.  Hand crank cell phone chargers and flashlights, or solar powered items or chargers, and rechargeable batteries! 
(4)Buy things with little or no packaging. Handmade gifts are perfect.
(5)Buy a tree from a thrift store, and use it until you can't anymore, or get a live tree that you can plant after the holidays.
(6)Use ornaments from the thrift store, or old ones that you have had for a while. (Don't buy new ones every year)
(7)Try to get all of your shopping done in as few trips as you can to save gas and keep pollution to a minimum.
(8)Give the gift of help or time for someone, like babysitting, helping them paint (with no-VOC paints), or shoveling their driveway, or something else.



(9)Keep electricity use to a minimum, by getting LED lights, and setting them on a timer.

There are so many things you can do that will save you money, and save the environment. Every little thing helps!  We want the world to be a better place for our children and our childrens' children, and everyone else in the future.

I believe to have a green christmas is all about shopping more carefully and ethically. (you should do this all year round too)

When buying gifts think about the packaging.  I refuse to buy toys from ELC (and places like toys r us and supermarkets)because there is no need for the amount of packaging they use on their toys.  I buy simple unboxed gifts (usually from local stores).

Dont buy silly novelty gifts.  When you get them what do you do with them?  Look at them for a while then bin them - more for landfill.

Remember that you can recycle most of the wrapping paper and christmas cards - try to buy recycled ones in the first place too.

Buy rechargable batteries and a charger for kiddies toys.  again...these run out quickly and so more goes to landfill (or hopefully no recycling points)

Do we really need all of those lights on all the time??  keep it simple and stylish with lights this christmas.  Keep them on the tree and at push, around your window.  Please dont over do the outside lights...

Buy quality gifts that will last rather than cheaply made things that are less likely to break and end up in the bin.

Lastly, set a limit with partners/friends/family.  Its not a competition so why not stop buying them EVERYTHING they want and buy them some of it.



If you have a limit it means you put more thought into the presents instead of just throwing money at it. The less you buy the less is wasted.

Hi, Recycling is the answer, for a start i have used the same Christmas bags to put my children's presents in for years, every time we get a gift in a bag it is put away until next time because let's face it they are still like new you just lift the gift out and reuse,  Christmas cards should be taken to supermarkets or shops that advertise recycling,even stamps can be give to local charities. the wrapping paper can also be recycled .  Real Christmas trees should go to the local council so they can be recycled.  Bottles and cans can be taken to recycling bins.  Any left over bits of food can be made into a cake for the birds.  If people just try recycling is better than having a bin full of rubbish that is just put into landfill sites.  Have a great Christmas.

Instead of buying gifts from shops, go for those that make a difference to others, like helping communities or planting trees.  Give up Christmas cards in favour of donations to worthy causes.  Choose only products that have been proven to be green, non-damaging to the environment.  Decorate your home using eco-friendly items or totally recyclable items, or not at all.

stop eating meat. You can have an excellent Christmas without meat. Just look for some nice recipes in any magazine these days. Let the animals live, they have the same right to this planet as we do.
Bring your own bad (cloth-made...) when you do the shopping.
Find out where your clothes are made (in India? Be careful, they hardly have any restrictions when it comes to child workers, acids (for bleaching clothes) amount of working hours...) And DO NOT use Chlorine when you do the washing! That is pure poison to the water.
Small things like asking for example Mc Donald´s NOT to put a lid on your coffee. Anything you can think of. And DO that; think! It is soon to late to save our beautiful planet earth.

Recycle, re-use carrier bags when shopping, Get together with your neighbours and have all your shopping delivered in one delivery.therefore saving petrol. Don't waste food,only buy what you really need. Re-use Christmas wrapping paper. Buy one more energy saving light bulb.  Take no more than a four minute shower.  Put all Christmas decoration lights on timers. Turn your heating down by one more degree.  Cook as much as you can in one go in your oven therefore using less gas or electricity. Compost all your leftovers and peelings for use in the garden.

Hope these suggestions help. Merry Christmas,

On a wild Tasmanian mountain there is a magnificent, recently discovered stand of Huon pine trees that has been called the world's 'oldest known living organism'. Newspaper reports have claimed that what looks like hundreds of trees densely covering one hectare (2.5 acres), is all part of the one tree, since all these 'trees' appear to have identical DNA. Over the years, it is believed, 'snow has forced its branches to the ground, where they have taken root'. (The Sydney Morning Herald, January 28, 1995, page 1.)



It is hard to see how a tree could be older than the time since the biblical Flood, so if its published age of 'more than 10,500 years old' were correct, then this would present a serious challenge to Old Testament chronology. In fact, some media reports claim the tree 'could be 30,000 or 40,000 years old'. 
The media reported that scientists had definitly found the world's 'oldest living organism' in these Tasmanian Huon pines. A scientist working on the project said, 'we have made no such claim'.

I'm pretty sure it's the Bristlecone Pine, which grows in (I think) North America. The Glastonbury Yew is pretty ancient, but I think I remember hearing that the pine's age can be measured in thousands of years rather than hundreds.

If you can get hold of a DVD of David Attenborough's series 'The Private Life Of Plants' he does go into this, with examples, in the first episode and that's what I'm trying to remember while I'm typing this!

It is probably not better for your personal environment unless you live in the woods or something.

The systems are in place to deal with it.  you, or 100,000,000 people suddenly changing their habits won't change the systems in place, and I would hate to have to be the sanitation worker that picks up your **** paper.

well nappies go into regular waste - so its not illegal; but if she has carers then they should be using yellow bio bags - and disposing of correctly - especially for any dressings etc etc... call the council and see what they say - as you are quite right a fox could easily break open the bags and spread the 'stuff' all over the place.

Your neighbor needs to make sure that these are empty before disposing of them. However have you ever wonder what happens to used nappies/diapers?



However if you are concerned you can contact the council and they could charge her for disposal of clinical waste!

I was going to say that it would be a good idea but I have just looked up online for curiosity and it says the correct way to dispose of it is to put the contents down the loo and flush them away and then to dispose of the bag in the rubbish so I guess she is doing it correctly presuming it is emptied before it goes in the black bag.

as far as human blood, bloodborne pathogens can remain active and can contaminate up to 60-90 days after they're cleaned up, if they are not cleaned up properly. (HIV is only contractible until the blood is cooled).

good thing to know, and also if human waste is sealed in a bag before it is thrown away, it is better than loose in the black rubbish bags, in case the black bag rips, there will be another sealed entity in the bag.

A realistic understanding o f technology--which the majority of "green living" advocates sadly lack.

I'm not attacking you--I think green living, per se, is great.  But start using some common sense.

First ofall--the whole focus is on "reducing energy use, etc.).  Why?  I mean that seriously.  If (rather, when) we have solar and wind power generally available at affordable prices (and that's almost here) we will have access to MORE energy than we have now--completly zero environmental impact.

I'm no tsuggesting more efficient systems aren't a good idea. They are--waste is simply stupid. And expensive, no matter what technology you use.

But get off the "we have to do without" kick&gt; THAT is the main reason no one is  listening to you. We are headed toward the era of abundant energy--not scaricty.

So--if you want to develop a model, here's the basic parameters:

a) low impact resource utilization (which means MORE reliance on plastic,  not less. Produced properly it is recyclable and much less damaging to theenvironment than smelting metal or most other extraction/refining processes.

2) efficiency, not a focus on doing without. CFLs are the perfect example: very efficient, save money, and are good for the environment--with no sacrifice of living standards. You can convince people to buy a better light bulb. You will never sel themon the virues of siting in the dark.

3) Recognize that we are headed for an age where MORE, not less energy will be available--and start developing your specific pans and strategies accordingly.

I kndw-this flies in the face of all we "know" about being "green."  Check it out though--you will see I'm right.
Oh--one more point (on the plastic issue)::  Using plastic doesn't hurt the environment (as long as you dispose of it or recycle it). And is much better as it's produced. I'm not saying go ahead and keep carrying/packaging everything in plastic--that's stupid.  And expensive (30% of the cost of what you buy in grocery stores is for the packaging).



But the flip side:  Give me a high-temp resistant plastic artifact any day o the week over aluminum, steel, copper,etc. Have you got any idea howmuch coal gets burned to make those metals?  You are better off using plastic and then burning it--you put less CO2 in the air that way.

So start understanding the technology--and the changes that are in the works.

Then you will be ready to START planning.

<answer>



Advantage: The power source does not deplete natural resources, It does not generate pollution like internal or external combustion power sources. During times when power is not being used, the flow can be blocked, and power from other sources like solar cells, and wind generators can be used to pump the water back up into the reservoir kind of like recharging a battery.

Disadvantage: The process of building hydro power plants requires the building of large dams, and those dams will flood out large areas of land. This can wipe out entire ecosystems, and in the case of Hoover Dam, multiple ecosystems. This effect is not only seen where the flood occurs, but downstream of the flooded area because a shortage of water is generated. This can span multiple states, and possible multiple countries.

once it is in place the only cost is maintenance.
so the advantage is that it is very cheap to produce.
also when used by powering a water wheel it can be used without any stoppage on a year around stream or river.

The disadvantage is that in is not usually centrally located, and takes a lot of.power lines to take it to where it is needed.
The other disadvantage is that most dams are used for water control, so that the water is used for irrigation and not alway running through the dam.

One more disadvantage is that you rely on rain to fill the reservoirs. A dry winter in  a county such as New Zealand where most power is hydro and you are looking at a possible power shortage. Often  you need back up power generation.

Advantages - cheap, clean - make it the best solution though,

Each of us needs to take personal responsibility for out part in polluting and wasting. We need to make changes in out lifes that reduces waste, toxins and carbon emissions. We also need to get involved with our governments and let them know we don't want a world that will make us sick. Find out what is being voted on and let your representative know you want them to do the right thing. Use our money to improve our world, buy organic, buy non toxic, and buy renewable.

There's lots of things. Probably not enough though but one thing that comes to mind is environmental regeneration projects, many of which are in major cities. Not sure where you live but you seem very environmentally concience so I can highly recommend researching weather there's volunteer projecs near you and joining. I'm with Friends of Merri creek in Melbourne Australia and on weekends we help restore local native plant and animal communities as well as cultural heritage along the creek. A lot of kids get involved also, which can only be good for the planet as kids are the future!

A few well placed bombs positioned to take out the "ghettos" around the world would have a tremendous effect! These are some of the most dangerous areas in the world to be in no matter what race you are, and those who live there tend to have a lot of cars that generate pollution. Because rent is generally cheap in these areas, they attract those who are nothing but a drain on society, and that's all they ever wanted to be. Looking at these neighborhoods, you will quickly see that there are a lot of people in these areas who do not care about things like garbage cluttering up their streets, and tend to constantly litter. Sadly, there are people in these neighborhoods that are productive members of society, but sometimes a price must be paid.

The net effect would be:
Less pollution given off by vehicles used by these people.
Less taxes would need be taken because less people would be on welfare.
The reduction in population thus reduction in food required which would reduce famine.
Less work for the sewage treatment facilities of those areas.
Less power would need be generated.
Less births (in these areas families tend to have more kids than in others)
It will become safer for the surrounding area because the violent ones from that area will be gone.

Why choose these areas instead of some other area? Simply because these are the most densely populated areas of the world, and would require smaller bombs to do the work,  with less environmental impact. Choosing these areas would have a longer term effect because these are the areas that grow the fastest and it would leave the slower growing areas to survive.

Well, why not put up a high shelf above a window and display them there?  You can also use them as candle holders.. There are special candles that you can get for wine bottles that will fit and you can use them in the holes for the liquer bottles... Just be sure the bottles are on a flat surface so they don't tip!

I don't know if where you live it is allowed but I buy  99% spirit (for liquors) then make my own liquors out of it, I add various herbs (I follow various monks' recipes LOL)  and I sometimes "pickle" white grapes in it it's great during those cold winter nights.

The best use is to use them as a flask or flower pot, especially when they are not printed with brand names.

If they are printed with brand name like Grey Goose, as you mentioned,
use them to contain juices, sodas and other drinks.

It also depends on their shape, type and color to determine their use.
A colored and beautifully shaped bottle may be use as Wall Sconce or a candle stand.

These can also be used as Tall platters. Its an easy and inexpensive way to add height to a buffet table. Three liquor bottles and two wooden discs can be used to make this unique serving platter. The bottles are epoxied to the bottom wooden disc. Holes, slightly bigger then the bottle’s mouth are drilled into the underside of the top disc, this way, when the wood is placed on top, the bottles will be wedged into the wood.



If you have pretty bottles they can be  used to make pendant lights. The bottoms of the bottles are cut off with a table-top saw. A standard light kit is threaded through the bottle and washers are used inside the bottle to keep it from sliding off the cord.



You can use one of these bottles as Hummingbird Feeder if you take interest in that.

You may also use it as soap dispenser, depends on its shape and color.

Another use makes the used bottles as water carafe. Use these bottles to serve Soda or water with wine or liquors.

Go to a craft-type store and find tiny little colored beads to put in them. You can play with the colors and patterns and use the bottles to decorate your house by filling them with colors that work with the colors in the room. Think of them as custom colored vases. 
You can also use larger beads, stones, etc. to get different patterns and shapes.

How much of a negetive ecological impact do I inflict by using disposable paper and styrofoam plates?



I use nothing but strofoam and paper plates and plastic cups in my house.  I also have like 4 50 packs of  of spoons  and forks each.  I was wondering what is more ecologicaly friendly  styrofoam or plastic?  I won't do dishes even if I have a dishwasher and even then much of the year when I'm working I'm in Hotels around the country so I need to have disposable plate. Is there a disposal alternative? I know I've used enough DISPOSABLE forks and spoons and plate to fill my room up atleast  to my knees . any suggestions?

I think the alternative would be the reusable and recyclable materials. Even though paper plates are recyclable, paper are from tree. Which means, more paper, more trees, the hotter the Earth will be! Plastics and styrofoams takes zillions of year to be recycled, and styrofoam is bad for you and your family's health, too. If you use a styrofoam to put hot meals such as soups, it has Carcinogen. Means it could cause cancer! Please stop using styrofoam, paper plates, and plastic cups in your house and use the reusable dinner wares instead. Besides, you could spend less money because you don't have to buy new stacks of plates and cups every week or so.

All ours are energy savers apart from the kitchen where I've fitted a strip light. Arguably, fluorescent strip lights are energy savers because they use less energy that incandescent lamps and give off far more light too.

And yes, LED ones are the way forward, are coming in slowly, but way too expensive still.

Switch them OFF, all af my gadgets TV, VHS ( still got one ) DVD, DVB, Satellite receiver,  are on a multi plug that I just switch off after I have watched what I want, the only thing that has a problem is the VHS as it forgets the time, but I don't record much so it does not bother me, this can save quite a bit of power as al these so called standbys use about 400 watts an hour doing nothing, that makes about 50p to a £1 a day easily. £30 a month ???

Unplug everything when not in use. I've reduced my electric bill by between $50 and $70 for the last few months by reducing standby electricity. I have my tv, vcr, stereo and game systems plugged into a powerstrip with a switch, when they aren't in use I flip the switch no more vampire electricity. I also unplug all chargers when they aren't charging, including laptops, cellphones, and toothbrushes.

Turn off your computer at night. 
Don't leave chargers hooked up to electricity when not charging.



Run your dishwasher only at night so it doesn't heat the house up. 
Use ceiling fans to make you feel several degrees cooler and leave the A/C set at a higher temp. 
Turn the fans off if you're not in the room.

In order to be "free" from utility bills you would have to generate electricity yourself such as through wind turbines or electric generating solar panels (the renewables). With today's technology this would be very difficult to do if you consider the cost of the equipment and maintenance.



If you asked the same question 10 years ago it would be considered almost impossible. So we are gaining ground. In another 10 years we may find the answer. So no, you Do Not have it wrong.

<answer>



Hi Jillion,

I don't think you are wrong, I have met many different people from everywhere in the globe with the same questions. Can we make it? We did it once and many people from rural areas still do it, some in a different way.

Maybe as you, I believe we are highly dependable on the resources that confortably we get by paying a bill, sadly many more don't really care much about where they came from and how sustainble they are.

I have friends with different proyects, I support the idea of one of them because I visited them and saw the results and embrace the idea about having somebody doing it. I'm going to check out your website too, I enjoy the idea of having more people doing things their way to make things different.

This is an answer from Dan Martin, about living off the grid:

"Let me start off by saying we (my family and I) live completely, 100% “off of the grid and are completely self sufficient”

The house is built utilizing natures natural elements, in the shape of an octagon with 8ft wide arch doors on every wall to catch every angle of wind (typical 4 sided homes have half the chance as one with 8 sides. A circle being the most efficient design). Woodburning stoves, solar chimney, solar AC, solar heating, solar water heating (pool and home), solar stove, solar power, wind power, hydrogen powered back up generator, hydrogen back up water heater, hydrogen stove, 2 hydrogen powered trucks, 1 EV (electric vehicle) and satellite internet.

We also built many green small cabins on the ranch that we offer to family, friends and our on-site off-grid workshop guests, including one straw bale, one papercrete, earth bag and adobe, one cob and cordwood, one underground and rammed earth, one log and post and beam and one rock. Each one actually started as a test for what the main house would be and were later finished and turned into guest cabins. I later wrote a guide on how to build with alternative materials using alternative methods for next to nothing.

We raise meat and milk goats, chickens for meat and eggs, ducks for meat and eggs, trap havilina (wild boar pig), rabbit, quail. brew our own beer from home grown products, preserve our fruits, vegetables, etc. smoke and jerky the meat, make our own soap, cheese.



There are no utility lines, no water lines, no roads, tv, cell service, etc. on our ranch. EVERYTHING needed is produced here. All electricity comes from 27 solar panels, 2 main wind gens and a back hydrogen generator if needed (typically we can last 9 days with all luxuries of sunless windless weather, hasn't happened yet). Water is caught and storaged from the rain. Hot water is made with solar batch water heaters with an on-demand hydrogen hot water heater as backup. Even our vehicles use alternative energy (2 hydrogen trucks, 1 EV electric vehicle converted). Because of this we have no bills, no debt and no mortgage.

I believe this is the first step anyone can make “help the environment”. Once you convert your own life style to a greener more eco friendly route, you can start helping others."

Now, Jill, the answer can keep going on and many people will add more to your answer, which I find a good way to come up with amazing or interesting ideas. Have a good day.

Renewable energy doesn't claim to be free. No matter how electricity is generated there are costs involved. I have panels, but it will be 6 years before I break even, then I'll have many years of little or no electric bill, at some point I will need to repair or replace them. We are generating 2 huge solar plants in CA, but the electricicty they generate will be billed to the customers the same as any other, there again were huge upfront expenses, and maintenance involved with running such a plant. Plus we still need to have some other source of power for when the sun isn't out.

This is a great idea for those that are able, however not everyone can live off the grid, of for that matter would not want to, when it is so much cheaper to connect to the grid, and and not have the extra expense of battery back up, with the possibility of receiving a check from the utility company for power not used by you put back into the grid.
I could even supplement your vacation for that unused power while you are on vacation.
There are a lot of people who live in apartments that would not have the option available.
however those that can install alternative energy, but not afford a full array of solar panel, could add one or two panels and could effectively lower their utility bills and lower the drain on the grid.

Check this out. I signed up for it I should get my panels in a year. Which is fine since i can't afford to spend 30,000 to 40,000 to buy my own. my rates are locked in and won't go up.For the length of my contract. and we all know the electric company will do nothing but go UP

We have the option to pay to have additional bins. Everyone pays a set fee and that entitles them to a specific amount of garbage removal. If that doesn't fit your needs you can ask for an additional bin and will be charged monthly. We also have strict rules about what they will pick up and how it needs to be sorted. I know in general Europeans create less garbage than the US, but there should still be a way for a larger number of people to have their garbage picked up. I would call your solid waste removal department and see if they have any options.

I think there seems to be a generation of people who were allowed to get away with not caring and being disrespectful.  As parents or 'celebrities' they are passing on their bad habits to the next generation.  This bad habit cycle needs to broken.

Adults need to be educated, and they need to take more responsibility in teaching the younger ones how to behave.  Parents, schools, celebrities and all those in the public eye should be working together to lead by good example.

Perhaps those who insist on throwing their rubbish around, or allowing their children to do so, should be made to clean up the streets and countryside.

'Green' actions that have the opposite effect...?



I once saw someone washing a milk bottle top under a hot running tap. When questioned, they said they were cleaning it before recycling it. I'm sure the energy used to clean it was far higher than that saved in recycling 0.5g of aluminium.
Also, the line on email footers containing "Please avoid printing this email" (or similar) probably takes 5% of emails onto a new page boundary resulting in more wasted paper.

Do you have any other examples of counterproductive Green actions?

It's a careful balance between taking green action and the energy required to be green. No one is going to calculate the amount of energy each of their actions consumes but we generally know when we are wasting energy unnecessarily. I would suggest that there are actually very few green actions that have an opposite effect. I also doubt the figures you've quoted are they are based on any actual research? I think they must have come of the top of your head. If on the whole being green saves more energy than not being green then this is undoubtedly the way to go.

Fair comments.  Not to mention the waste of precious water in cleaning one bottle top.  But if the person thought about it and washed a collection of things at the same time as their dishes it would help.  Personally, I don't bother washing stuff for recycling.  I figure if it really needs washing then they can do it themselves all in a big bunch which logically should be more efficient.

I'll bet there are heaps of examples of this kind of counterproductive action but I'm too lazy and tired to be bothered to think of any right now.

Organic produce shipped from South America.
Harmful chemicals put into recycled plastic containers.
Recycled plastic disposable plates.

There are many things that are counter productive in my view. However, we need to start with awareness, when people are more receptive then we have the opportunity to help them relearn a better way. People have to want to change before they can learn how to change. I've seen a lot of negative things on Yahoo answers about being a hypocrite. Considering our impact is completely the opposite of how most of us have lived our life. There are still a lot of people who think it is just a Hippie phase we are going through. There is no right or wrong way to go green, but there are better choices and opportunities for those of us with the knowledge or experience to help guide others toward better choices.



There are many different aspects to going green and many of us focus on what is important to us. For me it is more important to reduce the chemicals I'm exposed to and reduce my garbage, so I care if my favorite cleaner was shipped from europe, or if my reusable outdoor plates will take more water and energy to wash. For others transportation or energy conservation are a higher priorities.



I look for solutions, I think yahoo answers is a great teaching and learning tool. I've seen questions about wasting water by rinsing recycling, I personally use the dish water that is left after handwashing my pots or pans. It doesn't take too much more energy to cut and paste an email into a word document and change a font if need be to get it to fit onto a single page.

The classic example is vegetarians and in particular vegans.



Cows are more efficient at turning plant matter into protein than humans. Removing that link from the food chain means more land is needed to support that personal choice, more transport is needed to transport that bulkier product and more space is needed to store it prior to use.

Also in terms of global warming and unpredictable weather patterns, attaching too much value to a harvest results in disproportionate price rises because loses are not spread across the farming spectrum.

It's interesting that most active green campaigners are vegetarian by choice :o)

Can't say much, but one thing for sure, nuclear reactors give way much energy production than any other generators(hydro, solar, biomass) in terms of raw production, and an almost consistent product rather than conditional generators(e.g, solar or wind).

Even so, in fiction, other non-nuclear energy sources that seems to be logically executed would be He-3 Reactors and Solar Furnace. I read somewhere that the US already have three He-3 Reactors, but the main problem is that He-3 is rare on earth, recently found available on moon and abundant in Jupiter. I wonder if that's why China and US rushing for space technology.
For Solar Furnace, it's already available, but on small scales. For a wider view, try watching Gundam 00. The animation shows the usage of mass solar furnaces and orbital elevator.

There are nuclear plants all over the place and they produce lots and lots of electricity at a low cost. They are safe and efficient. The hazards of the past have been addressed and plants are strictly monitored.

As for the enemy issue and your question. The answer to this is that renewable energy at this time could not produce enough electricity to power the country and until there is a way to produce the energy in the current quantities needed the method should be to use all methods and reduce the ones that are not environmentally friendly (coal plants) while increasing the ones that are.



Nuclear energy or some form of it is the future. Windmills are the band aid and make people feel good. Not saying they are bad just not a solid long term solution.

The actual problem to all the world ecological problems could be solved by reducing the amount of people on the planet. That's not a good political stance and therefore not discussed.

Because it will be 10 years at least before space based solar even gets really going because the program was scrapped during the Carter years and all the engineers that worked on it are retired or dead. Renewables other than hydro will never be able to handle more than 20% of the load no matter how they are promoted. Nuclear is the best option for balance because it is clean and renewable through recycling of used material back into fresh once the anti nuke edicts of Carter are reversed by congress. Eventually 80% plus of the worlds needs will be met by space based solar with nuclear supplementing it and other sources such as wind, solar, geo thermal and others where they are practical.

The major issue that makes nuclear energy, especially the plutonium and uranium based processes, an bad option is the risk involved.
If something goes wrong with nuclear energy, the consequences can not be overseen. Literally. Radiation is invisible, nuclear technology is complex, and the hazards of nuclear material and nuclear contamination remain largely unknown, especially to the public at large.
This summer, a french plant leaked some radioactive material into the environment, and stated that there was no risk, but people should not drink the water. Cattle could however drink the water, and there was no need to worry because this type of event occurs almost daily. Would you be reassured? Me neither. The point i try to make is that, even in a perfectly safe reactor concept, you have to rely on expert judgment to  know that the design is safe, you have to rely on an expert to identify hazards and think up some countermeasures, and if something goes wrong you have to rely on the same scientist or company for knowing that something has gone wrong. Study the incidents, not just chernobyl, but also three-mile island. This is wat structurally happens.

These risks don't stop at the nuclear plant. Storage of nuclear waste is subject to the same problem. With our current knowledge nuclear waste has to be stored for thousands of years. think of that! the united states are barely 250 years old. thousands of years ago, people were running around in furs! I find it unimaginable that in the course of those thousands of years, nobody will fraud with nuclear waste. Sell it to some ill-intended group of terrorists, have it cheaply disposed in some poor area, etc. 
Even the most optimistic scientists talk about 400 years of storage. Think of the institutional capacity needed, and effort it takes to maintain that capacity. There are few countries that are this old, let alone an stable institutional structure that would be up to this task.

Next to all this, mining, and refining of uranium ore costs a lot of energy, is very polluting and destroys the lands of indigenous peoples.
Every kilo of fissible uranium comes with millions of kgs of mildly radioactive nuclear waste.



A last argument against nuclear energy is the amount of it. A large scale switch, which is really needed, will burn all the economically mine-able uranium within a few decades.

Renewable energies, although expensive (solar) or unreliable (wind) or environmentally disrutping (water power) has much lower risks, because the decisions are piecemeal and can be undone. (break down the windmill is done easily, once you have nuclear waste, you have to take care of it)  Windmills and solar panels operate without a specialized network of maintenance and waste management once they are built.

Solar power panels have a performance warranty of 25 years with a expected lifespan of 30 years or more. Inverters have a 5-10 year warranty but normally last up to 20 years as they are completely automatic and have no real moving parts.

From a savings standpoint, the Net Metering law in 37 US states allows you to earn credit on any excess energy that your home solar panels produce. This is in addition to federal incentives and tax rebates for using renewable energy, be it solar or wind.

Mine have a 25 year warranty. I was told I will likely need to replace the inverter at about the 12-15 year mark. My breakeven point is about 6 years, it would have been closer to 10 without my rebate. I've only had my panels a few weeks, but I'm generating more electricity than I expected, I'll have to see how much it drops during the winter months.

Can someone convince me man made global warming is real?



If global warming was a real issue it would seem that we could simply reflect more of the suns rays back into space. This is the inverse of the plan jointly planed by the USA and USSR in the 1970's to spread coal dust across the plains and Siberia to stop the impending ice age.
Further fossils tell us that the USA was once tropical and at other times was covered with ice.
I can tell you from my own time on this Earth that it was warmer in the late 1990"s than the 1970's and warmer in the 1950's than the 1970's.

It can't be done and anyone that says different is a Liar.
Why you might ask ? Because climate and weather models aren't specific enough to predict anything. You can interpret the data any way you want. They can't even predict the path of a hurricane today, how dare they think they can predice weather or climate change in the future for decades to come. After all, that is why they make predictions 50 + years down the road, so that when those 50 years pass, its all been long over and no one can come back to that person and make them pay for their arrogance.
Hansen at Nasa made the mistake of saying we only had 20 years left on earth.......20 years later, some of us remember and brought it back up to throw in his face. Totally discredited.
Another scientist claimed the ocean only had 10 years...yet its still there....still the same old ocean.
So what can we really base climate change and GW on ? Well, how about truth, actual data and science...but there you have a problem. We don't have that much date on temps and weather...and alot of the temp data we have is inaccurate. Temp stations are located by black top parking lots, or AC exhaust or car parking lots where people park radiator side in. That's not conclusive. So everything you hear, everything you've been told is simply based on what some arrogant fool that must think highly of himself has observed in his short lifespan here on earth and has deemed that it is "unusual" and must be fixed.
Meanwhile, no one bothers to ask these alarmist chicken littles......what if we do know of a way to cool the planet ? What if we decide to do it and in our meddling with nature, we irreversibly interfere with the normal heating / cooling cycles and throw everything out of whack ?
But that's just a question. The reality is we can't effect climate change that much, Man is insignificant compared to volcanic eruptions, forest fires, natural disasters and the other natural going ons in the world that have much more effect. And just how far are we supposed to take this stupidity ? How much money are we suppose to let the government or some whacko group steal from our wallets all for the sake of 'researching a way" or "finding a solution"...meanwhile people are hurting with food costs due to these enviormental geniuses when they decided to use corn for ethanol....an inefficient fuel that robs all of us through heavy subsidies.....otherwise...OUR tax dollars.
People without a life need to stop jumping on every bandwagon they see and start using their brains.

We can observe some relationship of rising temperatures and rising CO2 levels in periods well before mankind began burning large quantities of CO2. This relationship could be causal in either direction, in both directions, or both factors may be derived from a common  cause.

We can identify that higher CO2 levels support rising temperatures, and we can identify ways in which rising temperatures cause us to see more CO2. So we should allow for a possibility that each causes the other.

If that should be so. we would have a cause to expect that burning fossil fuels and so increasing our CO2 level would start a self-sustaining process of warming, in which CO2 causes warming which causes more CO2 to remain in the atmosphere.

This does not imply that the warming trend would be constant, always rising. Despite the simplistic explanations, we know that there are numerous events like volcanic activity and absence of same,  shifts in surface movements of oceans that can cause reduction in  air temperatures.

It is just a bit foolish to assume that all global warming is caused by our burning fossil fuels. It is likewise unsound to assume that burning has no effect. We know that previous warming periods have gone very warm without human intervention, so any assumption that we will be able to stop global warming by merely reducing, or even eliminating burning of fossil fuels, if we assume that  CO2 causes warming and warming causes more CO2.

If you believe in science, then you can be convinced. If not, then you can believe in anything you want. A vast majority of scientists who have analyzed the data concluded that man-made global warming is real, although we are not 100% behind the cause.

Here is wikipedia's take on global warming:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warm...

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes "most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic (man-made) greenhouse gas concentrations"[1] via an enhanced greenhouse effect. Natural phenomena such as solar variation combined with volcanoes probably had a small warming effect from pre-industrial times to 1950 and a small cooling effect from 1950 onward.[2][3]

These basic conclusions have been endorsed by at least 30 scientific societies and academies of science,[4] including all of the national academies of science of the major industrialized countries.[5][6][7] While individual scientists have voiced disagreement with some findings of the IPCC,[8] the overwhelming majority of scientists working on climate change agree with the IPCC's main conclusions.[9][10]

Only time will tell who got the science right, I think it is irrelevant. The earth is changing and we are making it harder to adapt to the changes. We are contaminating water supplies and creating monoculture farming which depletes the soil of nutrients. We will face water and food shortages long before the earth gets too hot or too cold for human kind. The funny thing is both Global Warming and Pollution have the same solution. We all need to consider how our lifestyle not only affects the planet, but our security and health as well. In the US we import far more than we grow here, so we have left ourselves vulnerable to food shortages. We also waste more energy than we can produce domestically, we could dramatically reduce our dependance on foreign oil with conservation, we have already seen that a reduction in demand has helped the price of crude oil go down worldwide. So, from a selfpreservation point of view I try to live with less impact on the earth and support my local agriculture.

go to www.earth911.org to see if you can find a recycle location. It is a great website to find local recycle centers for anything that can be recycled.



I don't know if you will be able to recycle them unless you can identify the type of plastic, I would guess you could try #7, that's the everything else catagory.

What effect does decomposer activity have on the energy flow?



When detritus builds up in an environment where no decomposers exist, what will happen to the energy flow?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



In what environment do no decomposers exist?
There are some in which decomposers are inadequate. As in the oceans large amounts of plant matter is sinking to the bottom undecomposed to form oil or coal of a few millions of years from now.

In this case there is a surplus of plant energy that is too much to be useful, it is downight toxic. We go from having too much energy to having energy stored, but on the way all animal life dies as the decomposing plant material uses up all the oxygen.

Now note that it is because there are no decomposers, but that the decomposers are simply exhausting the supply of oxygen.

We see the same in northern peat bogs where plant matter is stored away unable to decompose for want of oxygen.

Most pigs use said energy for living and doing everyday tasks. But there are a select few who produce extra and these are the pigs that can fly and shoot lasers from their eyes. It is quite rare but it does happen. It is where we get the expression, "Yeah, when pigs fly."

Just like humans and most other living on earth, they break carbon bonds in the food they eat.  Carbohydrates gives you a vague clue into the chemistry. There are only a few forms of life on earth that use something other than carbon.



Oxygen is used in the mitochondria, which splits the carbon bonds in sugars (carbohydrates and such)  releasing energy that is stored in a easy to use chemical form ready for the cell to use when demanded.  CO2 is formed and carried away from the cell as waste.

I have greatly oversimplified, and I don't remember my basic biology well enough to give a better explanation, but this is the gist.

It depends on where you are taking them. Most recycling centers have separate bins for different products  They will have a bin for "plastic"  There are a few different numbers on the bottom of the plastic containers that will let you know what bin to put them in, There is another strictly for glass.



Plastic bags usually don't get put with milk containers.

chlorophyll is the green substance in plants that is essential for green plants to photosynthesise. it is the green colouration in the leaves.it is found in the chloroplasts in the leaves of green plants.



the actual chemical equation which takes place is the reaction between carbon dioxide and water, catalysed by sunlight, to produce glucose and a waste product, oxygen.



the glucose sugar is either directly used as an energy source by the plant for metabolism or growth, or is polymerised to form starch, so it can be stored until needed.



the waste oxygen is excreted into the atmosphere, where it is made use of by plants and animals for respiration



6CO2 + 6 H20 ---[sunlight&chlorophyll]--&gt; C6H12O6 + 6O2



*C6H12O6 is glucose.



hope this helps!

This is possible, sure. I believe they are talking about putting a few of these in the gym at my university. I also read somewhere they're trying to put these in poorer countries that don't normally have access to electricity. Basically they would have teams of riders to generate, and switch off.



There are also a number of websites out there to teach you how to make your own--though don't expect too much electricity to be gained by a single person.

How can I simplify and de-corporatize my life?



I just saw the documentary "The Corporation" and it has helped me see a different view of corporations and the power they hold in our lives. When I look around at the things I use or have in my life, I am bombarded with logos and brands that all speak from the wealth of the CEOs. How can I start spending my money in a way that supports non-profit organizations but STILL lets me budget my finances. For instance, I dont think I will be able to walk into my local drug store and buy organic or earth-friendly dishwashing detergent for the same, competitive price of the big-named brands that constantly have coupons and discounted prices.

I think that's a completely valid question, and reasoning to why it's much harder to buy organic.  there are smaller, but significant things you CAN do, for instance: if you have a farmers market, buy your vegetables and fruits there.  If you can, create your own backyard garden for the summers (and it's a lot easier than you think!)



As for dish washing detergent, we live with the conception that anything that goes into the dishwasher must be made for it, and anything that goes in our hair must be made for that as well, BUT, there are options.  If you have a local trader joe's, look into PURE CASTILE OIL soaps.  These soaps can be used for shampoo, and bodywash (they smell great too!) and they can definitely be used for dishwashing, washing fruit, and the likes.
This option is also "green" too, because the soap is biodegradable, which means it can be safely returned to the environment without further processing.



I'm sure there are a lot of local things you can do to offset your dependence on big companies, but "big companies" too are giant assets to our economy too, and although it is important to realize your independence as a consumer (which you have, high five!) I don't think it's necessary to be completely off the chain.  If you're even more serious, look more into the "big companies" that you buy from and be an activist, and send letters to express your feelings toward their motives, or morals that you don't agree with and consult the public to do the same!

If you're talking about reusing them, washing them with the dishes (and let dry well be for re-storage) will work fine.



If you're talking about putting it out on the curb for recycling pick up, yes you can toss it in the bin as is  (though it's always nice to get rid of chunks or excessive juice/sauce)

Hello, I am thinking about purchasing a water bong and I was wondering if these sites were safe? WWW.water-bongs-glass-pipes.com, WWW.grasscity.com. Also I was wondering if it will say the websites name on box it ships in, i wouldn't want my parents to see what the box contains. any answers would be appreciated.

Pot heads are dull people after a time.  I know this because pot smoking over time decreases motivation and many of my friends are slugs now who don't want to do anything!  I wouldn't order anything that you don't want your parents to know about because chances are they will find out and you will really disappoint them with this.



Instead of getting high, head outdoors and ride your bike for awhile.  Get on your skateboard and hit the ramps for a thrill. I built my own ramp I was so bored one summer.  My point is, and I am from a slightly older generation when pot and drugs flowed freely, stay away from drugs.  You only have one life and why screw it up?  JUST DON'T DO DRUGz.....

having lived there for most of my life i would think so... Maine is very good about recycling (not very many states have a bottle return), and it's 90% tree. I also know that they are strict about fuels and pesticides that can be potential water pollutants..... I live in Florida right now... it's pretty dirty. No one recycles, there's garbage all over the roads... for two weeks straight on my way to work i passed 2 garbage bags and a bumper on the side of the road... now there's finally just 1 garbage bag sitting there... In maine I used to see citizens out for walks picking up any trash they saw...

It's not true. Putting it on standby is a good thing, as is turning off the display whenever you leave your desk. Shutting down is even better because it uses no power at all!



Starting up your PC doesn't cost more money or use more energy, it just takes more time.



This afternoon I walked the dog for a couple of hours. I shut down when I left and I started up when I got home. By the time I had towelled my dog's paws, the PC was ready to rock once more.



This saved about 0.6 kWh of energy, and avoided about 300g of CO2 emissions at the power station.



My PC is too old to properly go into standby. When newer machines hibernate, you can switch them off at the wall so they are using no power - just as good as shutting down and they come back to life much more quickly.



Warning! If you don't switch them off at the wall (or unplug) they still use power during hibernation, just waiting for you to press that big ON button!

This is actually not true. Putting the computer to sleep or in stand-by mode will help you save 80% more energy than when on full-power mode, helping you save on energy consumption because the screen goes blank and the hard-disk stops spinning. But, according to the US Office for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, computers use only about two seconds' worth of power at start up. So when you leave your desk for long periods of time, turn it off.

I volunteer at an Energy Exploration center and I borrowed a watt meter and used it to see how much energy various things in my home used. My desktop uses 84.7 watts when on, but not being used, when it goes to screen saver it uses 50 watts and when it is shut off it uses 16.3. Considering my laptop uses 22 when I'm using it that seems like a big waste.  That is also one watt less than having all 3 of my ipod docking stations playing music. So, you can save a lot of electricity if you shut your computer down all the way and unplug it or put it on a power strip with a switch or at least turn off the monitor and speakers.

That depends on how long you are leaving it off.  Starting up a computer takes more power than letting it run, but in order for that to matter, you'd have to look at how long it will be in stand-by.



If you will be away for more than an hour or two, it probably makes a lot more sense to turn it off.



Aside from power, you also have to keep in mind that booting a computer is harder on the computer and frequently starting up and shutting down could reduce the life of your system.

You actually have three options:



Leave it to standby
Leave it to Hybernate
Turn it off.



If you are using Windows, go to control panel and then "Performance and Maintenance", then pick "Power Options". There you can set the times to turn off "monitor", "hard drive", individually, as well as the time the system go into stand by mode or hybernation mode.



There is also some programs (such as LocalCooling) that you can install in the background to do just that.



Choose the best combination to fit your needs.

I really don't see how that could be true. It defintiley saves a lot more energy than just leaving it on plainly or with a screen saver, but turning any electronical item completely off to stop the consumption of the energy works best.

Perhaps they do mean electric toothbrushes. People (me included) leave them plugged in all day and they don't require that much energy. Or, manual toothbrushes consume energy because they are made of plastic, and many of these cannot be recycled, or are not made of recycled plastic, and will end up in a landfill for a thousand years.

global warming  is anatural process but it is almost theoritical because we don't have all the facts. right now our polar caps r melting at a higher rate then any time before. they say anytime bfore because the ice at the caps is millions of years old. They can take sample out of the ice at the polar caps and show trends of global warming. They say it is a natural process that has hapen before. The only diff is that humans were not involved bfore. We have increase global warming hundreds folds. The big problem is tha tis going to get worse. 3rd world countries want to live like us; nice roads, cars, clothing, more food, blablabla. china is an example. They will creat about 30 coal burning plants by the end of next year..more co2. there is no such thing as clean coal technology. we r going back to when we first started using nuclear energy...the clean energy. They store it underground the same way they want to store co2 from burning goal. by 2008 to 2012 all the ice will be gone causing environmental chaos around the world. The caps is wha tkeeps our ocean currents moving hence causing climates. we r really heading to a masive extinction...including us

How do you like this idea for energy?



I'm on board with the idea of using municipal waste as energy. Why not? What else are they going to do with it? Let it just float around? It has plenty of methane in it to light up the town. I know the idea may sound offensive to some people, but that's that. I can assure anybody it couldn't smell any worse than a landfill. Would you rather they fire up more coal plants and pollute the environment with more mercury in the water? Fecal fuel doesn't cause acid rain. Think about! On days where the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing, we'll still be defecating. Who says you can't give a crap about the environment? Who says you can't bring the economy and the environment out of the shitter? Who says we can't create miracles out of our butts? Who says we can't flush away energy prices and pollution. I have a friend from St. Kitts who's uncle has a fecal fuel business called, "The Admiral's Quarters." They're motto is, "We're Number One in the Number Two business."

Why not? the sterile panda poo souvenirs are selling like hotcakes in china. I think we could use garbage as fuel too, instead of leaving it around to junk up our planet, just burn it and bury the ash. Less waste and it will break down into the soil. Instead of only clean coal plants they can burn poop and garbage too. There's plenty from past generations so it's one surplus these unreliable, irresponsible Dead Heads left us. We need to make use of the idea b4 they realize they can use it to benefit themselves. One man's trash is another man's treasure!

As an American who lives and works in a tourist town  I ask myself this question:  "How likely is someone from the Chinese factory to spend money in my town?"  On the other hand its much more likely that someone from the American factory will visit here to go fishing,  snowmobiling,  skiing,  moose hunting,  etc.  But only if he has a job.  That's why I buy American as long as the quality is as good and the price difference doesn't put it out of reach.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Unfortunately this confirms what I feared, Americans are still buying price and not product, on the other hand the American products have proven not to have anything to offer over comparable Chinese products so this is the predicament we have placed ourselves in so I guess that is called competition

Two years ago I was Christmas shopping and noticed many products were "Made in China."  From that point on I made an effort to buy products made in North America or by countries with a stronger environmental track record than China.



If a product is made in Mexico -- we've found this to be a good alternative in buying tools, for instance -- we are helping to provide jobs south of the border, and lessen the time and expense to ship a product to the U.S.  And products made in India, for example, help support an economy trampled by the rampant expansion of the Chinese government.  The Chinese expansion came at a huge expense to their own environment, present and future.



And finally:  Look at all the recalls of products produced in China.  There's bribery and a blatant disregard for human and pet health and safety.  When China acts as if it's merely one nation on a planet of many, I'll consider buying their products as a matter of course.  For now, given their environmental, human rights, and safety record, I avoid Chinese products whenever possible.



All that said, I have studied Chinese culture, and it's incredible.  They're a wonderful people guided by a government that has chosen a path unworthy of those who live there.

Renewable energy will not run out whereas non-renewable energy, by definition, will.  It's a matter of being prepared for that.



Further all the energy on earth (except perhaps geothermal) is from the sun.  We simply using up stored sunlight in the form of coal and oil and using a ton of energy to get at it.  It seems to me a more direct route makes more sense.

Solar energy is free for the taking for -anyone- on the planet - no one nation has control of it. The cost for research to promote the technology is a drop in the bucket compared to the money and lives that have been spent trying to keep our hands in the fossil fuel game. Jobs can be created in this country by introducing a solar grid for all citizens to connect to. And being independently able to provide ourselves with fuel will keep us secure from being treated like puppets by other countries that are holding the "oil" cards.

Try to contact your local sanitation department...Whatever state you live in google its sanitation site. Some city/state/federal agencies have pick up dates for such items. I'm not sure about getting money for them, though...Yes, eBay, Amazon.com or Craigs List is the best place to sell them - but you would then have to pay to ship the item as well as give the site a percentage of your profit.
Another option is to put an ad in your local newspaper for all the items you have - hopefully the cost of everything you have to sell will add up to more than the advertising costs.

Pizza boxes are made from corrugated cardboard, however the cardboard becomes soiled with grease, cheese, and other foods once the pizza has been placed in the box. Once soiled, the paper cannot be recycled because the paper fibers will not be able to be separated from the oils during the pulping process. Food is a major source of contamination in the various paper categories.

The truth is that it depends on who handles your recycling.



In most places, not if it's heavily oil-soaked.  Obviously "heavily" is subjective, so most places just disallow it altogether.



In some places, food waste recycling is becoming available and oily cardboard is acceptable since it's all going to get composted anyway.  but I'm guessing that you're not in one of those areas or you'd probably know about it.



Find out who your recycling servicer is and ask them.  Most will have that kid of information on their website.

In the UK...you cannot recycle any paper or cardboard that has been used as food packaging. you can if it was an outer wrapper, but NOT if it has been in contact with the foodstuff, or if there is no hermetic barrier between the food and the packaging.

All paper based products can be recycled. Ask yourself what can i do  with this paper product. All paper burns. Cut it up into strips put in a bucket of water. Leave it 24 hours. Then stir with a stick. Do this with all your paper products. Then after a week drain of the water on your garden. Take handfuls of the mushy pulp and squeeze as tight as you can into balls leave on a tray to dry. This could be done as a secondary use of heating your house. When the balls are dry you have a fuel source. You can by a cheap paper brick maker. Not as much fun for the kids.

I always put the clean part of the pizza box in my recycling container. Any parts with food contamination I send to the garbage, for the reasons explained above by the contributor from the UK. But remember that ordering in or picking up take-out food items always comes with an eco-cost (e.g. transportation fuels? packaging materials?) Try making your own pizzas at home when possible, with local ingredients never over-packaged.

No, actually. I like to watch the tv shows on the Discovery Channel about the new things people are doing to be more... "green." I don't see why it should bother people that much, anyway. No one is holding a gun to your head telling you to get rid of your automobile, reduce the usage of your utilities, and anything else of that nature. I do think that it is a good thing to encourage one another, because if you pull your hands away from your eyes you'll see that a lot of these green methods will actually save you money. *gasp!* Money that you could use to go towards things like Christmas vacation, better meals, or even that 52" Plasma blue screen your wife won't let you have.

I consider myself a pretty strong environmentalist, but even I am tired of the whole "go green" message. Honestly I can understand why a lot of people would be fed up with hearing it, especially since most people still associate it with the hippie culture of the 1960's.



Furthermore, why did the environmentalists have to couch the idea of environmental sustainability into a color; to me it makes the whole thing seem trivial. Saying "go green" sounds too much like "think pink."



If only people could see the justifications behind it are far more serious than saving polar bears from drowning or keeping bird eggs from thinning--the environment is everything, without a functioning environment we could not breathe or grow food. A million dollar per capita income would mean nothing if seeds cannot grow.

I prefer the oil filled mainly for safety reasons.  The latest ones have electronic timers and thermostats so they will only heat the area when need. The largest you can buy (typically) are rated at 1500 watts.  Their is a reason for this.  Most home circuits are rated for 15 amps.  110 volts times 15 amps is 1650 watts.  So anything any bigger and you pop the breaker.



A 1500 watt unit will heat an area about 15 feet around them comfortably.  Two of these units would work.  BUT BEWARE, the heaters will have to be on different circuits!!!!!



I just got a kenwood unit 6708EP , they come in a low profile and a tall profile. they are sold in most hardware stores.

Technically, there is no difference in efficiency between them. In both cases you will need one kilowatt-hour of electricity to produce one kilowatt-hour of heat in your room.



Oil filled radiators do not burn environmental dust and therefore do not produce any emissions inside your house. But it takes them some time to heat up.



Heat pumps (like air conditioners that also provide heat) are more efficient since they may take heat from outside and pump it inside - even when it's cold outside. In this case, you will need less than a kilowatt-hour of electricity to produce one kilowatt-hour of heat.

Reusable coffee cups - SANITARY?



I just wonder how sanitary it is for a coffee shop to re-use coffee or drink cups on a large scale. If I am going to feel at ease about this idea then I am trusting that the customer bringing in the cup is somewhat sanitary, and I am trusting that the barista has the time to properly sanitize the cup and lid before placing it against a common surface or holding it. Unfortunately, I don’t. I have seen the baristas go from one order to the next with bare hands grabbing cups and pushing down the lids. It kind of creeps me out to think of Joe Sh*t with his runny nose bringing in his re-usable cup, sorry... GOING GREEN

I wouldn't worry about being such a germaphobe. Every time you touch a door or a handrail or an item sitting on a shelf at the store you are likely exposed to billions of germs and viruses. Anyone who works around food is supposed to be trained about contamination and sanitation. I would be more worried if they touched money then touched my cup then if they touched a used cup then touched mine.

it can be expensive and sometimes time consuming but you have to look at it from the right angle...recycling helps the planet and if everyone did it our earth would be in much better shape. So don't think about the cost and the time, think about saving our planet for the next seven generations to come.

I want to know if Power Factor Reducers really work, in terms of saving me money or the environment?



I see a lot of different stuff on the Internet fighting the case for or against and there are a lot of people with qualifications and so on, but it seems impossible to know who to trust, and tricky as a non-specialist to evaluate what I am seeing. Could someone put it in plain English, tell me why it is as it is and conclude with where it is worth paying for them and any limitation/dangers if so. If you know a good product is that a bonus.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Power factor Reducers only work on electric motors.  If you only have a refrigerator in your house, that is the only device that changes the power factor.  If you have 25 fans, 6 AC units 7 refrigerators and not lights or electric ovens, you are a prime candidate for a power factor correction system.



The more light bulbs or electrict heaters (stoves), the more they dilution of power factor reduction from motors.  So a refrigerator with a .85 PF motor with several lights on at the same time, the net PF goes up to .95 PF.



But as pointed out in the link, only single phase motors that are partially loaded and high speed motors are cost effective candidates.  Guess what, ceiling fans are not candidates because they are low speed.  AC units run at peek loads, so, not much there.

It's just more of the government in their "wisdom" taking control of your life-----"I'm from the government, and i'm here to help u"

I've kind of wondered this myself--myself, I always replace them immediately after I buy the CFL just because yes, you will save money this way. But as for the environment, you'd have to consider the extra energy to make a CFL. I'd say in the summer to go ahead and replace it, but if it's cold anyway, keep your incandescents and save the CFL until the incandescents burn out, since incandescents will keep you warm.

Geothermal energy question...?



I've heard that to create geothermal energy, water is poured down on to hot rocks to make steam (which turns a turbine to create electricity). I was wondering, do they re-use the water (somehow turn the steam back into water and pour it back on to the rocks) or do they have to keep using new water?



I'm doing a renewable energy research project for school and trying to find out what sorts of energy are best for the environment. I live in Australia, and with the drought and stuff, if they keep using new water it would be bad for the environment. I researched it on the internet and couldn't find anything, so... if anyone knows anything, it would be very useful! :D

The system where water is re-used is called closed-loop geothermal (open-loop uses new water all the time, or maybe the water is supplied like a geyser).  It's not technically poured on top of hot rocks, but goes down a pipe deep into the earth where the hot bedrock is at.



I recently saw a web site comparing water use in various energy generation, but I can't find it right now.  You can do your own Google search, but keep in mind geothermal comes in two flavors - heat pumps for residential use (heating and cooling a house generally), and large scale systems for an electric plant.

they do reuse SOME, not all the water.  even a plain old power plant that burns fuel or used nuclear, consumes water.  Picture a big power plant, what do you see, those big funny shaped towers with smoke (actually steam) or a bunch of things that look like a building with stuff coming out of them.  those things CONDENSE water coming from the steam turbine.  This step allows steam (water) to escape.  Then, the loss of steam means minerals in the water will concentrate.  Those minerals will ruin a turbine, so water is disposed of and that water is high in minerals (which are not healthy to drink without some treating).



SO, water is lost.  But geothermal loses even more water.  First, not all the water pumped down to the hot rocks comes back, its lost into the formation.  next, the steam coming back is contaminated with more minerals, again they concentrate and must be removed, all at the loss or water.

if you mean off the internet, I don't know, but others will certainly point you in the right direction.



I feel my info on renewable energy is totally 110% unbiased. But then I am biased. If you want basic information on what is and what is not renewable, I can do that. If you want to know some of the basic technology involved I can do that. If you want some ideas on what may be a good source of energy and what is a bit hard to use, I can do that.



If you want to know the very latest technology for any particular resource or how it is currently being used in a particular country or what its political status is, I can't do any of that.



Its all too much to type here so you could contact me. (Sorry don't know how to go about that via yahoo answers without making my email address public to all and sundry.)

You are looking for info that may not be available. Most if not all reports on  energy are very biased. Most of them are totally untrue and the authors are counting on you failing to apply common sense. I think you will find that reports about wind generators and solar panels are written by individuals who are receiving monetary gains or just want to see a paper published. I think you must gather reports



that are for and against and then compare them and use your own common sense. Unfortunately our news media wants to print doom and gloom and only need a name to blame there stupidity on. So read, com pair and apply common sense.
