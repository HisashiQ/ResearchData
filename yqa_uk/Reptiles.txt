Try peregrine livefoods (depends how big a viv you need). I made my green igs viv. Buy some plywood - diy shops will even cut it to size for you, glass from my local window company (safety of course), tin of green paint and some plastic ventilation thingies and there you go - a perfect made-to-measure viv. Or try www.vivbuilder.co.uk

Well first off, many kuddos for researching the animal and its needs before getting it, and then wondering what to do.  The habitat should be set up, and water and basking temperatures set before you bring home the new turtle.

By a 2 ft. tank?  I have no idea how many gallons that is.  A 20 gal. long aquarium is 30".  So, is it a 15 gal.?  Either way, it will soon be entirely too small for a growing turtle.  If your new turtle is a hatchling, you can start him in there, but that means getting a larger tank soon.  You can use the 15 gal. for a feeding tank later (to move him to, to eat messy things like fish), when the turtle has grown a bit.

The rule of thumb for water turtles is that they will need 10 gal. of water per one inch of their shell length.  So, if the adult turtle is 10" it will need a 100 gal. tank.

You will need:
-Basking perch
-Basking light
-UVB light http://www.uvguide.co.uk/
-Digital probe thermometer to measure basking and water



temperatures (strip thermometers can be inaccurrate up to 20



degrees)
-Filter (rule of thumb is the filter should clean three times the actual tank size i.e. if the tank is a 15 gal., the filter should be for 45 gal.)

From there, you will need to research the proper diet.  http://reslider.free.fr/backup/feeding.h...



Turtles fall ill quickly when they do not receive proper nutrition and UVB light.  If you'd like a basic diet, you can email me at oxo_sensual_oxo@yahoo.com and type FEEDING TURTLES on the subject line.  When you offer insects to your turtles, those should be gut loaded first.  I also have a recipe for that if you'd like it.

Young turtles can drown, so the water depth depends on the age/size of the turtle you get.

Other than that, it's just researching your turtle, and learning as much about it from a baby right up to becoming an adult so you can be sure you are caring for its needs properly.

I'll post some sites below to get you started on your research.  Some will be for Red Ear Sliders, but the care for a RES and Yellow Belly is the same.

An informed owner is a happy one with a healthy and content pet.

Most of all, enjoy your new turtle.

I hope this has been of help.

If you have allot of $$$$ and start out with a 60 gal plus size tank and great filtration system for Aquatic turtles I say do it! 
They are the cutest!

A 60 gallon tank to start cause they grow quick.
A real good filter cause they poop allot!
A rep light for 8 to 10 hrs of basking gives them vitamin D which promotes shell growth.
Plenty of feeder guppies, minows and goldfish, and leafy greens at least 3 times a week.
This way they get the calcium from the fishes bones and protein, lettuce gives them the vitamins they need.

Sliders, Cooters , painted ,map and yellow bellied are require the same care and feeding. I have two that are 36 yrs old!! Plus an 8 and 5 yr old.
I have had them in a pond for about 6 yrs now..

That is a really cool tort.  I'm including a good site on tortoises.  It is mainly for the Russian tortoise and I don't know what kind yours is, but they should be able to provide some good information.  Please do your research before you try to hibernate it.  Like you said, you sure don't want it to end up dead.  If you can't get good enough information, don't let it hibernate.  We keep ours going all winter long.  Just have to keep him warm!

the tortoise trust has a whole section on safe hibernation, here is the site that will tell you how to hibernate and what age is best http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/ju... there is also a lot of other articles on tortoise keeping so it is worth a look, you can hibernate juveniles as they would in the wild but the gut emptying process is shorter than an adults and they do not hibernate for as long, take a look at the site and you will see what to do, i am not sure i agree with your reasons for having a tortoise, they are not a pet you can just put away so you don't get bored with it, even with hibernation you still need to check the tortoise and weigh it to make sure it is not loosing too much weight, best of luck with your tortoise honey.

It is too small. It doesn't look old enough to hibernate- so don't do do it. Wait a few years until you start to hibernate it. You should read up on how to hibernate them, or else you couldend up accidentally killing your tortoise xxx

look at your tortoise's tail and if it curves one way its a boy but if it sticks out its a girl and they have to be over 2 or 3 years of age to hibernate  and your tortoise looks like a herman cos mine looks identical  but you have to stop feeding for at least a week before hibernation and look for this happening around october november time Good luck and you tortiose looks fine try massaging some olive oil in his shell sometime it makes it look rich and make your tortoise dead happy! good luck x

with those dimensions your corn will be in paradise ! you will be fine with the lamps just make sure the snake cant get in contact with them(burns suck.) other than that remember SECURITY. make sure there are no gaps a snake will find the smallest gap the plastic sheeting will warp so go thicker. if you really wana get detailed about it e-mail me. here is a pic of a monitor enclosure i just built.

Ok the "fire risk" is alot lower than people think its only because in american buying cheap poor quality mats and not fitting them with a stat then being supirsed when they over heat. there widely used in the uk without almost any cases of fire (in fact i would say no cases but i have no evidence to back up this claim)



either will work really. just a question tho why 2 foot tall it seems a bit excessive

I made mine out of two bedside tables which I joined together.

I joined the drawer fronts of one together to make a door, and had a piece of glass cut to make a sliding door on the other.

For heating I use a 75w infra red bulb which I have wired into a dimmer switch to control the temperature.

All made on a shoe string, but my Royal Python (Monty) is very happy with it, and it's escape proof.

Personally I use Orchid bark, as this holds a decent level of humidity for them.  Many of the other substrates available such as beech chips or aspen take humidity out of the air and you may have problems when your royal starts to shed.

Cypress, coconut, or aspen. Never carpeting because ball pythons like to burrow occasionally, especially if they are feeling a bit insecure. Even with hides, I have found my snakes burrowed either under their water dishes,  under the substrate under hides, or other objects in their cages, during thunderstorms, or after I have few people over, and there was excessive noise.

Bearded Dragons!! living in Scotland



Is it possible for Bearded Dragons to survive in the wild in the U.K?. the reason I ask is that I saw one sunning itself by the roadside recently in Scotland,!!. I am thinking it was  a unwanted pet that had outgrown its tank,and had been dumped it was nearly 3ft long from nose to tail. How fast can they run ? can they be handled safely?

No they wouldn't.
1) wrong temperature range
2) wrong environment

Not sure exactly how fast they can run as I have never had one before but I would assume that they can run quick, depending on their body temperature.

Like all reptiles, careful handling is very important! If you are not sure how to handle properly, don't try and call your local rescue center.

To be honest, if you have spotted one it would be a good idea to report the sighting to a rescue center as someone may have lost him/her

Firstly any lizards would not survive a Scottish winter. It may be fine basking on a rock on a sunny day but would run into severe difficulty when the weather gets colder.

Secondly are you sure it was a beardy? I know 3 feet would have just been a guess but no beardy gets quite that big. Beardies rarely bite and are one of the easiest lizards to handle, but not all lizards are quite as laid back.

My best advice would be to report it to the RSPCA with as much information on the lizards location/desription as you can. They will find out exactly what he is, have the specialist equipment and perhaps be able to reunite him with his owner

OK first of all the both require massively different set-up any1 who has done any sort of research into the care of these animals will know this
if u did your research then u would know how fragile red eye tree frogs are to there environment



the other common mixing issues are



Fighting (2 different species may fight when put together whether they live together in the wild or not)
Eating one another (you'll be surprised what will eat what)
Stress (just from having the other animal in close proximity to it can cause stress issues. these can vary from a generally unhappy pet to behavior disorders and illnesses)
Toxins and bacteria/disease(just because one animal is resistant to one disease/bacteria doesnt mean they all are these animals evolved in different ways in different environment, this can make your pets very very ill, toxin/venom/poisons can all be used in defense and offense and simply being exposed to these can harm or kill your pets  (both of these problems are especially noticeable in phibs but affect all other herps

If you're willing to gather a few materials and spend about 15 minutes working on it you can make one of your own. It's really easy and really pretty cheap compared to the commercial setups.



Basically you'll setup a terrarium using a 16qt sterilite tub with a cover and some additional supplies. All in all it shouldn't take you hardly anytime. A 10 year old could actually do it by themselves if need be.

If you have any questions contact me

they call it a box turtle because when the turtle is in danger or threatened it will pull its head and legs into it's shell and the lower shell moves up creating a tight fitting box around the turtle, keeping it safe from predators, not even raccoons can get into the shell once it has closed up

Box turtles have a movable hinge in their lower shell that allows them to completely close up with their head and legs inside to protect themselves. That is where the name is derived from.

you can usually sex a tortoise by about 5 years old but it really depends on its size rather than its age.  if you go onto the tortoisetrust website or tortsmad and place a photo saying what your tortoise weighs and what its length is then there will be someone who will be able to help you.  Size can be deceptive and depends on whether it has been wild caught or captive bred, and what it is fed on amongst other things.  take photos of the top shell, underneath shell and head of the tortoise to be more accurate.  Hope that helps :)

it is really hard to tell the age of a tortoise if you have not had it from a hatchling, you can send a photo to the tortoise trust  http://www.tortoisetrust.org/ and they will give you an estimated age of your torotise, they go on the lenght and the wear of the shell but it will only be a rough age, you can sex a tortoise better when they reach the age of 5, look on hte bottom of the shell, if it has a dip then it could be male, but as some females can have a slight dip the best way to tell the sex is to look at the tail, a females tail is short and dumpy it looks like a kinda triangle, the male tail is longer and more cone shaped and the torotise will keep it to one side when it walks here is a site that will show you the difference between a male and females tail shape, best of luck honey

You can usually sex them by the time they are about 5 years old, but sometimes sooner for males bependant upon  rate of growth.
You cannot age tortoises as size is dependant upon diet, husbandry, etc.
BUT Your hermans tortoise should have come with an article 10 certificate when you purchased it, which should tell you the year of hatching on it.

When I was keeping border collies, I used to use baby shampoo for washing, any generic cream rinse for rinsing, and as the coat dries, spritz with Show Sheen for horses (mix it 50/50 mix water/Show Sheen), rub in and comb (wide tooth comb) through the coat..

Brush when thoroughly dry, and you'll have a glossy coat which is very easy to keep free of tangles.  Also, you can shorten grooming time by air blowing the hair.  It will work out potential tangles, without having to brush the animal several times a day.

But - this is the reptile section.  Guess a lot of us own dogs, too.  lol

My present lil terror is a rescued lab mix.

Hope this has been helpful.

This question should have been placed in the dog section, not the reptile section.  But to answer your question: Any mild shampoo can be used.  If you want, you can get shampoos specifically for dogs, but it's not really necessary.  There are also various conditioners out there to help keep tangles from forming, but really daily grooming will do a better job to keep the coat mat free.  A good fine wire or soft brush will do the trick.

Probably better to use something very mild, such as Johnsons Baby shampoo, and of course, the only real wway to keep the coat matt free is to use a good grooming brush / comb at least twice a day, and certainly, after each walk.

Why is this in the reptile section?

Make sure that you get a healthy turtle. Often times when you buy turtles or tortioses they will be sick and require a lot of treatment. I bought a couple of turtles a couple of years ago and they were both very sick and almost died, but luckily I have a very good vetrinarian. Other then that, they are very easy to take care of...although they do smell a bit.

Turtles are great pets if you can take care of them properly. Make sure you have a tank/enclosure large enough for them. Is it a water turtle? If it is you need to make sure you have a good filteration system for it. Just make sure you do your research before you get one.

Baby turtles are pretty easy to take care of at first. At least thats what a lot of people think.
But they grow up and need lots of room and care many many expensive things. Make sure that you read ALL about the kind of turtle you are going to get and get all the things you need before you go out and adopt the turtle.

And also, go to the forums and ask turtle qeustions there instead of here because they will give you better answers and lots of better information.

Help with Leopard Gecko Diet?



When I first got my Leopard Gecko, it ate Cricketts and Wax Worms as recommended. Recently though he's gone off Cricketts altogether, and now will only eat Wax worms. The vet advised to feed him on worms, insects, beetles, etc, out of the garden, but still he won't touch them.
He just eats Wax worms. Can anyone think of any ideas as to why?

http://www.drgecko.com/index.html is a good site to check out.  Crickets (no bigger than the space between his eyes), superworms, mealworms, phoenix worms, silkworms are all good.  Your vet is wrong...wild caught insects may have been exposed to pesticides and fertilizers which can be deadly to your gecko.  Instestinal parasites may be a problem.  Under tank heat pads too hot or too cold cause appetite problems.  Do NOT use any kind of sand in the tank...it dehydrates them and causes impactions.  Be sure to have a humid hide available at all times.

Wax worms are like chocolate to leos! they are tasty and full of fat so they should only be used as a treat. try feeding your leo meal worms with a wax worm or 2 in with them then take out the wax worms gradually. Some people dont think meal worms are a good diet for leos as they can be hard to digest but others have reported having no problems with them. Dont worry if your leo seems like he isnt eating for a while when he is hungry he will eat he just wants to eat wax worms forever but he shouldnt!!  If he starts to lose fat from his tail then you should get him cheked out as he might have a mite problem but if he is eating wax worms i think he is just addicted to them!!

Also be careful feeding him wild bugs they can carry all sorts of mites and stuff and that could make him sick its best to stick with bugs brought from the pet shop.

Waxworms, mealworms and locusts should be given a couple of times a week as treats only.
Lots of Leopard Geckos get lazy as they get older and hold out for the waxworms, they are easier to catch, digest and are just like chocolate to them.
A trick I have used before is to not feed them for a couple of days making sure there is no food running around in there still (This can suppress the appetite).  Make sure he is not shedding, as he probably won't eat at this point anyway.
After a couple of days try feeding 1  appropriately sized Brown cricket (don't put loads in at once), as it starts to get dark.  If the cricket gets eaten pop another one in. 
Quite often people put loads of crickets in at once and if the gecko isn't hungry they really can get irritating to the gecko (as well as getting out in your house) so always put them in one at once.



if the brown doesn't get eaten try with a black the next day.  Once the gecko starts to eat them again (If its not too fat and lazy) gradually increase the amount and then start introducing the calcium and multivitamin supplements again.

If this doesn't work carry on with your normal diet for a little bit and then periodically try the above again, it sometimes takes some time to get them back onto crickets.  If you really struggle you can try the above with suitably sized locusts (although still a treat food not as fatty as waxworms) and then gradually wean them over onto crickets once they are used to chasing their food again.



Make sure all your food is gutloaded to ensure a balanced diet for your gecko as well.  A good caresheet can be found on www.coasttocoast.co.uk

Iguanas are funny things. Depending on age and personality, your iguana may never do more than simply tolorate you. The best way to get your iguana to like you is to hand feed it, give it occasional treats (mine liked grapes and mandarin oranges), and handle it often. It may take time, but your iguana should start to warm up to you- especially if it thinks you're going to give it some treats.
Just make sure you're feeding it right and you don't give it too many treats.
Good luck.

If your iguana is still young, as in its first 2 or 3 years of life, then spend lots of time with it.  Handle it every day and interact with it.  Iguanas are like people, each with their own personality, and some are more friendly than others.

If your iguana is older and doesn't like you though, the best you can really hope for is that it will tolerate you.  Once they are set in their ways, it is extremely difficult to get them to change.

Is Miniman serious? Mother snakes don't take care of and feed their babies. That is ridiculous! The babies should be separarated from the mother. They'll start off on small minnows and worms. Avoid goldfish. If he had just caught the mother, you should release most if not all of the babies since they were intended for the wild.

it needs to go to the vet.  if it is turned upside down and won't it could be very sick.  snakes (boas and pythons) can get a disease called IBD (inclusion body disease) unfortunately if your snake does have it the disease is fatal and there is nothing that you could have done for the snake except end the little things suffering.

Signs of infection include central nervous system disorders such as paralysis, BEING UNABLE TO RIGHT ITSELF WHEN TURNED OVER, "star-gazing", inability to strike or constrict. Other signs include chronic regurgitation, extreme weight loss, respiratory infections, .......

Take her to the vet:

If you don’t already know of a qualified exotics/reptile vet in your area, google: “Herpetological Society” -or-
http://www.herpvetconnection.com/  for the one closest to you.

Reptile are slow to show signs of illness and by the time they exhibit symptoms, it's usually pretty advanced.  They are also slow to heal, so time is a factor, and the sooner you get her to a vet, the better.

I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help, and I hope she's better soon.

Its probably just scared. Babies tend to be frightful then adults. And they curl into balls when their scared, hence the name ball python. Mine went without eating for months and was fine. just try giving it live baby mice, either newborn or pinkies. you should be able to get them orm pet stores. live help entice eating. Also allow it time to adjust. it also might be close to shedding which might explain its behavoir. How long have you had it?

Snakes can learn to recognize you, not necessarily as an owner, but as someone who frequently handles them. As long as you treat your snake right, it will learn to trust you, and may even seek you out when you open its cage.

I love my two beardies.

I do keep them on sand as I was advised to by the local reptile-specialist vet and a colleague whose husband is head keeper at a reputable exotics zoo.  Some people have good reasons not to use sand.  There's no universally accepted 'best' subtrate.  When they poo, it certainly smells, but is very easily cleaned up.  My two have a habit of doing it in their water tray.  This is just emptied down the toilet, washed and refilled very quickly.  If they soil their sand, I scoop it with the surrounding sand and dispose of it with my cat litter scoopings.  Apart from excrement, they are clean creatures which don't smell.

I would not be without beardies now.  They are not as low maintenance as my spiders, but they are not especially labour intensive.

I use calcium sand, and all you have to do when they poop (not very often.. maybe2-3 times every other day.. and is very small), or get water on the sand, is use a fish net, and just clean it that way.. its SUPER easy.... if you get sand remember CALCIUM SAND ONLY!

If you go with sand for a substrate I would stick with regular play sand from Home depot. The repti sand and calci sand can cause more problems and they can discolor your lizard until the next shed. It's easy to clean, just use a kitty litter scoop to get rid of the poop and done. They don't smell unless you don't clean out the poop. They only time I have sand over the house when he is running around is if he got into the water dish and climbed on the sand first. But that is what vacuums are for. They are a lot less messy than a cat or dog. For care sheets and diet suggestions try beardeddragons.org or bearded-dragons.com

Corn snake. More docile, smaller, easier to feed and maintain, readily available, and a perfect beginner snake.

If you have to ask, the answer is corn snake. A red tail boa can reach 6-8 feet as an adult. That is a formidable animal if you are not able to handle it properly, and requires a large habitat specially designed. A corn snake can spend its entire life in a 20 gallon tank.

It really depends on the temperment of your snake.  Is this the first shed, since you've had it?

Some snakes get very defensive when their vision is impaired during the shedding process, and tend to strike blindly at anything that moves.  This is a defensive behavior.  The reptile is only trying to protect itself.

The toughest part is getting it out of the tank.  Just accept that you might get struck, and don't hesitate.  Pick the snake as you normally do, and handle it the way it is used to being handled.



You can transfer it to a soaking bucket, or another tank, while you clean its habitat.  Handle it gently so you don't damage the skin, and cause a partial shed.

Repeat the process to return it.  (If you soaked it, pat it dry gently with paper towels first).

It is alright to handle him so that you can bring him to his other enclosure, but try to avoid holding him so he can attempt taking his skin off himself, unless you plan on taking it off.
Either way, holding him won't affect the shed.

Good luck and I hope I was of some help.

Most likely your ball python regurgitated his last meal.  How long after feeding did this happen.  If it's been 3-4 days, that's most likely what it was.  If this is the case, you need to wait at least 10 days before feeding again. They need time to replenish the stomach acids that they lose from regurgitating.  You also need to address the reason it might have regurgitated.  Are the cage temps too high or low, did you stress the animal too soon after feeding. Some snakes have been known to regurgitate if fed too close to shed time. In the years I've had snakes, this only happened to a couple of babies who were already problem feeders.  Otherwise, I've fed thru blue and any stage in between with no problems. You snake could be sensitive though.  Once you start feeding again, make sure you feed a smaller than normal item for 2-3 feedings to be sure you don't have another regurge.  Wait at least a week between feedings and don't handle the animal too much.  If you have another regurge, you need to have a vet look the animal over. If this is a pet store ball, it's most likely imported and probably full of parasites. These need to be treated if that is the cause of the regurge.  The other thing is that it could have a respiratory infection, but most of the time, this is clear mucous and the animal will open mouth breath, have bubbles coming out of the mouth and will weeze.

In a word. Manic. They have the attention span of gnats and a supply of energy that could run New York. Think long and hard about this. They are a lovely looking dog, and have a wonderful temperament. But they are sight hounds and closely related to Greyhounds. Once they spot something that they are interested in, everything else becomes non-existent and you will have to run long and hard to catch up with them.

BUT, if you do decide to get one, then make sure you have the time and family commitment to train it. All members of the family have to be on the same wavelength to achieve this, so children and parents both have to attend the training sessions or be willing to learn from the person doing the training.

You will also need to be able to put the time aside each day for grooming or the coat will become matted. This will need to be done every time the dog is outside also, as it will pick up grass seeds which can injure its feet or ears (you will need to check both areas closely every time it has been outdoors) and you will also need to be able to take it for exercise, daily.



Enrichment toys to keep it busy if you are out at work. And very high fences...

Do not let it off leash until you have taught it come back or the last you will see of it is a red flash diminishing in the distance.

Maybe if you take him to a zoo of some sort and teach him all the great things about snakes, he'll understand them more and won't be afraid of them as much? Many people are afraid of what they don't understand. My parents were afraid of my beardies, but when I showed them how loving and affectionate they are, they broke down and now they even baby talk to them like I do! It's awesome.

Well, first, think about this from your Dad's point of view.  How afraid of snakes is he?  A LOT, or just a little?  And then, think about if it was YOU afraid of something to the same degree, and your DAD brought one into the house.



How well would you sleep, knowing it was there, in the next room (you hoped)?

(If you're thinking Burmese Python or something which gets HUGE - you most likely won't succeed.  Look into Ball/Children's Pythons, Kings, or Corns, for your first time snake).

If your Dad is just a LITTLE afraid; you might try convincing him by researching the snake you want to get, working up a list of all the equipment you need for it, and the cost of everything.  Make sure you feed frozen/thawed, so your Dad doesn't have to worry about loose rodents, too, and tell him you'll use ratchet straps on the tank, instead of locks, so there is NO chance of escape.

Be responsible, and do your chores without having to be asked.  You can impress him by doing a few extra chores, to prove that you can handle more responsibility than you presently exhibit.

I'll post a few links here to start you on your quest.

Good luck, and I hope this has been helpful.

You'll have to do what I did-- wait till you're an adult and get one then. If he's afraid, he's afraid and since he's the dad, his word goes.

I had the same problem then we found a live mouse in the house. I told my step mom and dad that a snake would scare them away.

I would suggest you try and find a friend who has one, or a breeder where it's best to buy one from anyway.

This way he can see how harmless they are, and may be even handle one, try a Corn Snake or a Royal Python like mine, they are both non poisonous and are not harmfull to anything bigger than a baby rat.

I've just given one to Monty, he eats one a week so they are so easy and cheap to keep, ask your dad to make you a vivarium, it might get him interested, I made mine out of two bedside tables.

Get a snake that is non poisonous and keep it out of your dads sight. it works. my mom hates my iguana so i dont let her see it. Tell him that youll keep it in the container at all times.

When my dad was younger he had a big python (not sure which) and he liked snakes then but a few years back he went to India and had a few bad experiences with snakes and now my brother has 3 snakes ( 2 lizards and a turantula, also ) and he will not visit at all!
Because now he is scared of them but i guess in a way i can understand :)

Buy a tiny baby cornsnake without telling him. You'll get in trouble but he'll soon get used to it because it's just so insignificant and they're really docile.

Baby red tailed boa questions?



I'm going to get one and i was wondering if  i can keep it in a 40 gallon tank until its at least 3-5
because I'm getting a ball python too and i will move the python to the 40 gallon when full grown so i dont have to buy another tank and make an enclosure for the boa?
Also can i keep it on aspen shavings?

If you meant 3 - 5 years then no, on a normal feeding schedule it will have out grown a 40 gal. by then, if you meant 3 - 5 feet then yes, at least until you get the new cage built. You might want to get a sexed male boa, they stay smaller and slimmer bodied then the girls. Aspen is suitable.

If your going to keep your snake in a 40 gallon when he/she's 3-5 feet that's ok. but as soon as your snake gets any bigger you will need at least a 4' X 24" X 24" enclosure. They usually get as big as 10 feet. I found a great caresheet in the link below.

Although this is the wrong section, I'd think you'd look great with snake bites. They would really go well with your style. Just make sure you really want them before you get it done :P

please let it go in the same area that you found it.  you have no idea what you even have so you cannot possibly care for it.  if you keep it, you will kill it.  if you want a turtle, get one from a reputable reptile breeder or at a reptile show.

You really can't expect an accurate answer to this question. You need to post a better description photo, and locality info. before anybody can identify it for you. Then, you need to research proper care of whatever species it is. Turtles require fairly large investments in housing, and specialized food. They are not easy to keep, for people with no knowledge of them.
If you try to keep this turtle, it will most likely die. You should release it where you found it (not ON the road, though), as soon as possible.
