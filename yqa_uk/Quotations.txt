This is metaphorical.  Clearly the "her" in the sentence can't shatter as glass would.  So, it is comparing (without the words "like" or "as" - metaphor)  how the separation affected her to something that would shatter.

You must concentrate on becoming fluent in English, first of all.  Continue with the school you are at, but DO e-mail the college and ask for information about it.  The more you know about where you want to go, the easier it will be to decide. 
Go for what you want!  :)

we all die and nothing can change that fact, especially not social status or wealth or the lack of it, but death can come to us in many ways...accident, murder, disease, stroke...therefore death is a great disguiser and we do not know what our death will be or how or when it will appear..

"O! death's a great disguiser". Shakespeare - about a false death, when the duke is talking about switching heads to save Claudio (to hide identity)

"pale death kicks his way equally into the cottages of the poor and the castle of the kings" - the death of plagues and other illness does not discriminate.  By any measure, none of us get off this planet alive.

René Descartes (French pronunciation: [ʁəne dekaʁt]), (March 31, 1596 – February 11, 1650), also known as Renatus Cartesius (latinized form), was a highly influential French philosopher, mathematician, scientist, and writer. He has been dubbed the "Father of Modern Philosophy," and much of subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings which continues to be studied closely to this day. (French: Je pense, donc je suis; English: I think, therefore I am; or better, I am thinking, therefore I exist), found in §7 of part I of Principles of Philosophy (Latin) and in part IV of Discourse on the Method (French).

A mangle. Just imagine you have 10 kids; Hubby works down the pits and you have to wash using a dolly tub, a scrubbing board and then rinse and wring all the family wash out by hand.



Imagine the joy of a wringer or mangle. I used to have to turn the mangle when I was a kid. saved on the ironing though as you could always square and fold the clothes neatly before hanging out to dry on the washing line using dolly pegs.

Nothing that was called the best thing since...

Bisto?  to make gravy quickly.
Escoffier developed the first stock cubes by dehydrating stock he had made.
Jelly cubes, custard powder?
Gelatine had been made from boiling collagen from connective tissue (collagen holds the bits together to put it simply!).
Custard had been made from milk or cream with eggs. Not everyone had the patience or the knack.

Going way back, bags of flour as opposed to grinding your own.
 The precurser of that bread baked by a baker as opposed to yourself, some of which was later sliced!

Just read above posts, some good ones (water, mangle).  I took the food element literally.
Glad I'm not the one having to choose.

every living creature dies alone.

focus on humans.

and to me, it means exactly what eveyone has said except for the guy who talked about bombing deaths.  you just die alone, nobody experiences it with you, all that you do in life is pointless, because at the end of life, nothing matters, you dont die any differnt than anyone else, you just die alone.

and for the bombing, you may die around people, and are not alone in that sense, but you die alone, they dont know how youf feel.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



If you're talking about the Twillight saga by Stephenie Meyer than I can help you:

Twilight
--"It doesn't rain there much, does it?"
"Three or four times a year"
"Wow, what must that be like?" He wondered.
"Sunny," I told him.
"You don't look very tan."
"My mother is part albino"

-"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight.' Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly much more evident as he continued. 'To be perfectly honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offense. And I'm sorry about your evening.'"

New Moon
-“Time passes. Even when it seems impossible. Even when each tick of the second hand aches like the pulse of blood behind a bruise. It passes unevenly, in strange lurches and dragging lulls, but pass it does. Even for me.”

-“Even more, I had never meant to love him. One thing I truly knew - knew it in the pit of my stomach, in the center of my bones, knew it from the crown of my head to the soles of my feet, knew it deep in my empty chest - was how love gave someone the power to break you.
I'd been broken beyond repair."

-Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars--points of light and reason...And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by the light. I couldn't see the stars anymore. And there was no more reason for anything.



-This made no sense. “But they can still find you,” I reminded him.
“And I’ll take care of myself.”
Emmett laughed, and reached across the table toward his brother, extending a fist.
“Excellent plan, my brother.”
“No” Rosalie hissed.
“Absolutely not” I agreed
“Nice” Jasper’s voice was appreciative.
“Idiots” Alice muttered
Esme just glared at Edward.



Eclipse:
-“You’re not really that good a mechanic, Edward. Maybe you should have Rosalie take a look at it tonight, just so you look good if Mike decides to let you help, you know. Not that it wouldn’t be fun to watch his face if Rosalie showed up to help. But since Rosalie is supposed to be across the country attending college, I guess that’s not the best idea. Too bad. Though I supposed for Mike’s car, you’ll do. It’s only within the finer tunings of a good Italian sports car that you’re out of your depth. And speaking of Italy and sports cars that I stole there, you still owe me a yellow Porsche. I don’t know that I want to wait for Christmas…” (LOL THAT IS THE FUNNIEST PARAGRAPH IN THE ENTIRE BOOK. Alice is amazing!) :]

-“When it comes to all this enemies nonsense, I’m out. I am a neutral country. I am Switzerland. I refuse to be affected by territorial disputes between mythical creatures. Jacob is family [ha, ha, so true in BD]. You are… well not exactly the love of my life, because I expect to love you for much longer than that. The love of my existence. I don’t care who’s a werewolf and who’s a vampire. If Angela turns out to be a witch she can join the party, too.” [Well said Bella, Go Team Switzerland!!!]

-"You know, Jacob if it weren't for the fact that we're natural enemies and that you're also trying to steal away the reason for my existence, I might actully like you."
"Maybe...if you weren't a disgusting vampire who was planning to suck out the life of a girl I love...well, no, not even then."

Breaking Dawn:

-"I mean it makes sense. And if it helps Bella, it's a good thing, right?
Both Leah and I stared at him.
What?
Mom dropped him a lot when he was a baby. Leah told me.
On his head, apparently.
He used to gnaw on the crib bars too.
Lead paint?
Looks like it.
p. 267

Okay, that was probably more than you wanted, but you're bound to find one you like in there!  Happy Twilighting!! : )

In My Sky At Twilight



In my sky at twilight you are like a cloud
and your form and colour are the way I love them.
You are mine, mine, woman with sweet lips
and in your life my infinite dreams live.

The lamp of my soul dyes your feet,
the sour wine is sweeter on your lips,
oh reaper of my evening song,
how solitary dreams believe you to be mine!

You are mine, mine, I go shouting it to the afternoon's
wind, and the wind hauls on my widowed voice.
Huntress of the depth of my eyes, your plunder
stills your nocturnal regard as though it were water.

You are taken in the net of my music, my love,
and my nets of music are wide as the sky.
My soul is born on the shore of your eyes of mourning.
In your eyes of mourning the land of dreams begin.

Pablo Neruda



Song lyric Twilight time

Heavenly shades of night are falling, it's
twilight time Out of the mist your voice is
calling, 'tis twilight time When purple-colored
curtains mark the end of day I'll hear you, my
dear, at twilight time

Deepening shadows gather splendor as day is done
Fingers of night will soon surrender the setting
sun I count the moments darling till you're here
with me Together at last at twilight time

Here, in the afterglow of day, we keep our
rendezvous beneath the blue And, in the same and
sweet old way I fall in love again as I did then

Deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me like
days of old Lighting the spark of love that fills
me with dreams untold Each day I pray for evening
just to be with you Together at last at twilight
time

Frenesi

And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by



Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
A paradise where roses bloom
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain

I assume you mean from the book Twilight?



His face startled me — his expression was torn, almost pained, and so fiercely beautiful that the ache to touch him flared as strong as before. My goodbye stuck in my throat. He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was alarmingly warm — like I’d been burned, but didn’t feel the pain of it yet.
Bella Swan, Twilight, Chapter 11

Yes, genetics & physiology strongly influence behaviour, emotions, reactions, etc. Scientists have now found genetic basis for homosexuals too. 
some of the things i find biologically different between wo/men is their sense of humour (women are not that humorous - note the dearth of female stand-up comedians; what few there are are mostly gay); women take life very seriously;
men are of course physically stronger;
men are better hardwired for mathematical & spatial tasks/abilities;
women are better hardwired for interpersonal & artistic abilities;
women are more intuitive & have better instincts (especially in interpersonal situations);
approach to sex & romance is again conditioned by hormones - women tend to be more romantic, craving love then sex...
women tend to brood more & take things to heart & don't easily forgive & forget ...

most of the above observations have scientific basis now & i have personal experience of the above.

However, environment [family, school, society, culture, country, religion....] plays a role too. It can intensify the difference or a balanced upbringing can give a better, well-rounded personality. a girl or a boy can be made painfully or exclusively aware of their gender so that they approach & react to the world through gender-blinkered vision. Or, they can take their sex & sexuality in their stride & approach the world on equal footing.



I am a woman & proud to be one; but am not blind to our faults/limitations as a gender - everything/one in this world has its pros & cons.

I'd give a much higher weightage to biological factors & a lower one to environmental ones but you can't disregard one or the other.

I used to think that this idea was completely wrong.  I thought that if I raised my daughter in a very gender neutral way, she'd think in a non-traditional way.  Well.....we bought her trucks and building toys when she was 6 months old, and when she was a year, she used the blocks to "make soup" in the truck.  Then she put her teddy to bed in the back of the truck and tucked him in.
I now believe that there is an anthropological basis for the male/female differences and roles.  As a species, we need males to fight/protect and females to nurture and procreate.  Sorry, ladies, but it seems to be true.

If you just put "Six Million", then it would be like a thing that you'd have to explain, which is always fun.

Picture this:

"Lee-Anne, what's that that say?"
"Six Million"
"I know what it says, but what's it supposed to mean?"
"It's a slightly obscure reference to the mid to late 70s television programme, entitled 'The Six Million Dollar Man. You see, I've recently been through a metamorphosis of sorts, and feel like a better, stronger woman."
"Oh, and that's like an allusion to the opening sequence to 'Six Million Dollar Man' where they bang on about him being 'better, stronger. faster' than ever before?"
"Yup."
"So you want yourself, and everyone else, to think of the 'Six Million Dollar Man' when they see that tattoo?"
"That's the general idea..."
"But you're a woman."
"What?"
"You are not a man. You are a woman"
"Yeah, I thought I might run into that problem, and considered a 'Bionic Woman' thing, but she lacked a catchy phrase from her opening sequence."

So, maybe my idea isn't the best idea. Maybe.

It is 82.43 weeks.  The number of months is a little more complicated to determine since the number of days in a month is not constant.  However, based on 365 days per year divided by 12 months, there are 30.42 days in each month, therefore 18.97 months in 577 days.

This is interesting, but other than a simple math exercise, why is it important?

I think its trying to say that he who has little is rich in other ways and grateful for what he has spiritually and that materialistic things arent important,he is rich in love,joy and contentment

and that he who wants more doesnt value what he doesnt have materially and is driven by greed for material things,but poor in sense as he doesnt realise what he has spiitually and how priceless it is..

thats what I think about it personally maybe Ive read into it to much but I think thats the point being made in short

The poor man knows his limit but the other man can never be satisfied, no matter how much he gains. It is like a bottomless pit, you can never fill it up. The more some people have, the less happiness they will have. It must be awful not to ever be satisfied with what you have. I would not want that life.

Someone who is content with what he's got, always has enough.
But someone who always wants more, never has enough.

However, there's no harm in ambition - to do more, have more, be more by one's own efforts- so long as it doesn't make a person miserable in the process ... or indeed in the end.

If you are doubting whether or not it's acceptable, it's probably not.
It is hard to answer this without more details, but my guess would be no.
The more sources and quotations you can get to support your thesis the better, using the same one twice will probably come off looking lazy...
Sorry, Good Luck!

What is the meaning of life? To be happy and useful. - The Dalai Lama

If you were all alone in the universe with no one to talk to, no one with which to share the beauty of the stars, to laugh with, to touch, what would be your purpose in life? It is other life, it is love, which gives your life meaning. This is harmony. We must discover the joy of each other, the joy of challenge, the joy of growth. - Mitsugi Saotome

"In a little while you will be alone in shoreless space, to wander its limitless solitudes without friend or comrade forever--for you will remain a thought, the only existent thought, and by your nature inextinguishable, indestructible. But I, your poor servant, have revealed you to yourself and set you free. Dream other dreams, and better!...You perceive, now, that these things are all impossible except in a dream. You perceive that they are pure and puerile insanities, the silly creations of an imagination that is not conscious of its freaks - in a word, that they are a dream, and you the maker of it. The dream-marks are all present; you should have recognized them earlier. It is true, that which I have revealed to you; there is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a dream - a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thought - a vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities!" - mark twain

I love it! At first it seems like he's doing overmind relating but then he sets the reader straight.He gets very existential here, long before it was fashionable to do so. Can you imagine what a sh*t-disturber Mark Twain must have been back in the day? I think he is America's most brilliant writer. No comes near him for touching the pulse of Americans with plain language and pointed sarcasm ever so subtly wrapped in humor.

This is my all-time favourite quote. It's by Sir Winston Churchill:

Bessie Braddock (to Churchill): “Sir, you are drunk.”
Churchill: “Madam, you are ugly. In the morning, I shall be sober.”



There are many other Churchill quotes that I like. Here are a few:

Nancy Astor (to Churchill): “Sir, if you were my husband, I would give you poison.”
Churchill: “If I were your husband I would take it.”

"History will be kind to me for I intend to write it."
- Sir Winston Churchill

"The price of greatness is responsibility."
- Sir Winston Churchill

"He has all the virtues I dislike and none of the vices I admire."
- Sir Winston Churchill

"The empires of the future are the empires of the mind."
- Sir Winston Churchill

"I like pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals."
- Sir Winston Churchill
