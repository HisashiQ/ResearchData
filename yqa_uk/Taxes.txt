How do i work out holiday allowance for part time work?



I work 4 half days and 1 full per week, so basically i work 3 days per week. My boss gives me 17 days paid holiday per year worked out due to my part time status. I have previously worked out holiday as per my 1/2days and full day ie. if i take a week off it is considered 3 days out of my 17, if i take 1 day off it is a 1/2 day out of my 17. Suddenly my boss has turned round and said that this is incorrect. that if i take a day off, that is a full day out of the 17 and like wise if i take a week that is 5 days. Please help is this correct? I don't see how she can be right.

Do you have an HR department you can go to for advice?  If so they should have the guidelines for what you're experiencing with your boss.  Don't give up without a fight though, you can use the fact that you were being treated one way and now differently to your advantage.  But in the end, if your happy with where your at and don't want to find another job then you will have to accept whatever the final decision is.

i think yr boss is correct however the fact that u work one full day and the rest part days does complicate it a bit.  i used to work 4 mornings a week so my holiday entitlement (4 wks) was 4 x 4 mornings off - 16 mornings off.

Okay, so he's griping about the 6 cents (deductible to him when he files his tax return).  Big deal.  Many companies won't even pay the mileage to their contractors.

BTW, Do you have him on an accountable plan?  If not, what til you give him a 1099-Misc that includes all of the mileage reimbursement--he'll scream even louder then...even though he can deduct the full 58cents on his schedule C.

The IRS rate per mile is 58.5 cents.  It is not reflective of the reality of mileage expenses.  However, if more is paid, the IRS considers the excess as income.

I believe that they can only pay you in advance. They would need to be a licenced money lender to actually lend.

There are some allowances which may be tax free, but in reality an accountant would need to know the exact circumstances to tell you what you can do.

Tobacco -- Your $400 duty-free exemption may include up to 200 cigarettes and up to 100 cigars -- more than that and you'll have to pay duty on them, even if you haven't gone over your total exemption. (You may also have to pay state or local taxes on tobacco products.)
Only take a few - they are much cheaper over there.

If you go to a shop and buy a carton, open it, smoke 3 packs, leaving 7 un-smoked/un-opened, then technically you are suppose to declare them when you come into the states.

I suggest you don't buy any until you get to the duty free and then buy the allowance of 200.

When I flew from London to Atlanta I had 1 pack already opened in my purse, and they didn't say anything, and I had 2 cartons in my carry-on.

US cigarettes are distinguished by a tax stamp indicating the state where they were purchased.  I believe we Yanks are still permitted to also bring 200 (a carton) into Canada supposedly for personal use without question or duty and return with a carton of UK ones duty free.  I shouldn't think you could be charged twice for taxes already paid in the one country, but best check on that.  If you are unsure, smoke up your UK ones or leave them at home in the fridge for freshness as smokes are cheaper in US than UK from what I've heard.

I have a 2 year old daughter (not british) and Childcare costs are very high. I am a tax payer and I understand tax credits are available to help people who are working to cover their childcare costs.  I am not technically a british resident so am I eligible for these credits?

i think you would be on very shaky ground with the tax man, your wife would have to declare the earnings either by setting up her own "lease" company, she would have to let the inland revenue know that she was earning extra money, with tax you can put whatever you want in your return, its only when they start asking questions that you have to be pretty sure you are not avoiding or evading them!

You can, but then your wife would have to declare that lease income as income on her tax return.  She could lessen that income burden by claiming depreciation expense, but you'll get in a sticky situation if she or you also use it for personal reasons.  You're probably better of just deducting miles on the per mile expense allowance.

Rubbish answers so far.
You can pay her 40p pm for the first 10,000 miles and 25p pm thereafter for suing her car on company business. She would need to complete an expense claim form which you will file with your other invoices. This will not be taxable. Round sum allowances are taxable, however.

Provision for depreciation is subtracted from the Net book Value (NBV) of the asset under Assets to get a new NBV for the year.

Value = original cost
Depreciation = depreciation to date
Net Book Value = Value less Depreciation

Bad debt may not shown on the balance sheet. You total the outstanding debtors less bad debt and show that figure on the balance sheet as the outstanding debtors (Assets). The only adjustment usually shown to the debtors on the balance sheet is the adjustment for doubtful debts.

Provision for bad debts is also called Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. it is a Contra asset account listed below Accounts Receivable.



In your question, I think provision of depreciation means Accumulated depreciation. This is also a Contra asset account listed below the asset the depreciation is for.



A Contra account is an account that usually has the opposite balance than other accounts of that category.



For example: Assets normally have a debit balance. A Contra asset has a credit balance.

example: Record Depreciation of $1000.

Debit Depreciation Expense $1000
Credit Accumulated Depreciation  $1000

Balance sheet would look something like this:

Equipment $3000
Accumulated Depreciation  ($1000)
Net Equipment:



$2000

Record $3000 Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Bad Debt Expense: $3000
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ($3000)



Balance sheet for A/R would look like this:



Accounts Receivable $10,000
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts ($3000)

Net A/R: $7000

Entry to remove $1000 uncollectable account would be:

Debit Allowance for Doubtful Accounts $1000
Credit Accounts Receivable $1000

Unpaid taxes after leaving the UK



Hi! I had been working in the UK for 5 years when I left the country to work abroad indefinitely. I did claim a tax return but instead I have a tax debt of 1.500 pounds from what I think is a wrong tax code, but they didn´t give me any explanations. I don´t know what to do next and if I pay, am I entitled to a refund because I´m not working there any more? Please I´d appreciate if you could give me some advice.
Thank you.

You are not necessarily entitled to a repayment just because you left the UK. It's only if you have overpaid your tax in the year of departure, which comes from not working the whole year. If you owe tax under PAYE then you have obviously been on the wrong tax code, and not enough tax was deducted from you at source.



I would suggest you contact your HMRC office and ask them to tell you why it has resulted in an underpayment and from which year.

I assume tax office will have sent you computations if you are underpaid. There should be an explanation in the notes section. Failing that would need to know figures shown. Or potential underpayments would be shown on notices of coding.
If you are an UK National who started work 5 years ago, I would also need to know what code numbers employer used. You will still need to do form P85. Tax Returns will not be of any use in your case.

They should remove his dick & testicles with a rusty hacksaw and then force feed them to him thru a tube after he has watched them being mashed by a food processor.

Then they should hang him from a lampost on the nearest street corner so that the public can throw bricks at him.

Then they should take his almost lifeless body and cover him in hot tar and feather him.

Then when his demise has arrived - dig a big hole and drop him in it - cover it and forget about it.

Now that Human Rightism has established itself as our national religion, our govt will be more concerned on safeguarding his human rights than anything else.

It is none of your business, the person is not defrauding anyone.

Your thinking is years out of date - you are thinking back to Poll Tax! Where each occupant over 18 was individually charged.  Long long gone!  Council Tax comes in bands based upon the property value and is paid by the property owner - or legal tenant in a rental. Someone additional living there makes no difference one way or the other. (well unless the Tax payer is claiming a sole occupant discount - in which case he would be the one at fault not the person you are intent to persecute!)

No definitely not right, that sounds like you were maybe charged the kilo price for one tomato and they weighed the mushrooms on 1/4 or 200 grams setting,whatever it is, but entered the kilo price - how do I know?......I realised my mistake years ago when someones 1/4 mushrooms ended up coming up, price wise, at a ridiculous amount!.....I knew it was wrong! They weren't prices but mistakes - beef tomatoes generally about 3.60 per kilo

In our small business, taking assets to less than 50% use because of reduction of businss, must we recapture?



My husband's business has been cut back about 75% because of health issues.  I am changing the percentage use of some equipment he was depreciating  to less than 50% use to be realistic with his current business.  The items will now be used for personal use.  This actually takes them where we no longer are depreciating them.  One instance is an older computer that is no longer in use, and we may give it away.  We certainly won't sell it.  Must we show some sort of recapture?



We never claimed section 179 on anything.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



"Listed items", such as computers, automobiles, and telephones, may be subject to depreciation recapture if business use goes under 50%.  Computers, for example, become retroactively depreciated at straight line at 12 years.  (There's no problem if there is NO non-business use.)

Otherwise, only the section 179 in the 2001 and Katrina "special allowances" need be recaptured.

Aside from that, converting an asset to 100% personal use has no tax consequences.  Selling it may have tax consequences if sold for more than what the remaining basis would have been after depreciation recalculated as if 100% business use, but that doesn't sound like a problem.  Giving it away seems to be equivalent to converting it to 100% personal use.

We do have quite high taxes but definitely not the highest on earth.
Our higher rate income tax is 40% whereas Denmark's basic rate is 42% and higher rate is 68% although presumably they probably receive better services.

The simple answer is because many of the top dogs are overpaid, and the government doesn`t know how to stop wasting money, so they just want more and more.  It won`t end.

Have you heard the saying `expenditure rises to meet income`....maybe the tax  rises  to reach the bottomless tax pot.

I also believe the government does not want too many people to get `rich`  .  They think it would make us lazy, and not want to work.
After all, many successful economies are driven by poverty.
ie, `take it off `em, it`ll keep them working`!

If you are on the wrong tax code, you need to ring your tax office and ask them to sort it out. Otherwise, if you are still working, I can't see how a refund will be due.

The provision for depreciation is the amount set aside in a particular year to allow for the eventual replacement of assets.

The accumulated depreciation is the total sum of such amounts set aside in previous years.

Do you mean provision FOR depreciation? I don't know what that means. The only thing I can think of is that is an account a business would use to set aside money for the replacement of depreciable assets.

Accumulated depreciation is the account used to show how much depreciation was recorded against assets.



Because you want to keep the cost of the asset intact, accumulated depreciation is a contra asset account to record all depreciation of an asset.

By the end of October you will only be able to claim IS until your youngest starts primary school. After that you will automatically be put on job seekers allowance where you will have to prove you are definetely looking for a full time job. 
If you dont get a job in the first 6 months then you will have to do UNPAID work in the community or lose your benefits.
These measures have been introduced to keep stupid little girls sponging off decent families like my own.

i am a single parent too and can tell you that you will be able to claim indefinitely. You will have to attend work based interviews every 6 months for a review of your case. If you wish to earn a little extra you can earn £20 per week without it coming off your Income Support. You can also attend college if you wish some courses allow you to work part-time on a course while still claiming Income Support and colleges can help out with childcare. I found this a healthy relief from parenting!!

Don't listen to the people leaving negative thoughts on this! Income Support is there for people like me and you and they obviously haven't had the need to use it but unfortunately many do and we would end up a third world country without it.

How do you get a p60??



I never worked at the end of the tax year and havent recieved a p60 which I need to get into uni.. I was wondering whether there are other ways in which to get a p60 without asking an employer for a duplicate as i didnt have one..

P60 is issued by your employer at the end of the tax year.  Normally, you should be able to receive it by the end of April or at the beginning of May.  But you would not be getting one if you have left employment before week 52 or month 12.  Neither will you be getting duplicate copy if you had lost the original.  Like the P45, these documents are issued once only.

As other answerers have said, you only get a P60 if you were in employment at the end of the tax year. I assume you need this info for Student Loans or to assess your Uni fees. There must be other evidence they will accepy, such as a P45 or a letter from your employer setting out your pay and tax.

Only employers should give a P60. If they did no give you one then they should have and you are perfectly entitled to get in touch and ask. If you have moved house or anything they may not know how to get in touch with you or it may have been sent and got lost in the post? I'm a bit puzzled as to why you need it to get into uni? It shows tax and earnings which uni should not need.

Hi can any one tell me about how to import goods to uk? in bulk like in 1000kg? please?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You contact a shipping company.

1 tonne is not much - depending on how bulky the goods are, you may get away with a single Container.

To avoid Customs issues on arrival, you should have the goods inspected and the container sealed at point of departure and get the Customs documents sorted well in advance ..



Most likley you will want the Container delivered to some storage facility (even if it's only your garage :-) ) where you will unload it.

What you get charged is based on the total distance traveled / time taken (= how long you need to hire the container for). If it gets stuck in Customs (or you spend a week unloading it) you will get charged extra.

Tax Credit Owes me for 1 year?



I applied for Tax Credit on the 1st August 2007.  On all my applications I stated that my childcare cost for the DAY is £36.80, but to my surprise and all along they have been paying the childcare costs as an amount of £36.80 for the whole week.  Now I am not too sure whether they would backdate this, as it has now been just over one year. Could anyone help me here please.

Yes, if they have made a mistake they will have to backdate and repay, ive just had £1750 paid to me from last year. I had to fight for it though.

Your first port of call is to call the helpline and make a complaint (make sure you state that you want to complain that you have not received the correct amount), if you get no response, write to customer complaints at head office (preston, the address will be on the tax credits website) and ask them to look into it. If you dont get a reply then write or send an email to your MP. My MP was brilliant, had my money paid within a month.

on tax credit re-newel forms it does ask for your average childcare costs per WEEK, therefore if you have filed in the form incorrectly they can only go on the information you have provided them.

You'd best speak to the tax credit people and see what they can do, i'm guessing that they will ask you to provide receipts or another form of proof that you have paid £184 a week.



Good luck, i hope you get the cash back.

I think you should tell them what has happened.
They will refuse to back date to start with.
Tell them to prove that you didnt tell them it was the cost per day.
They may have a record of your claim form or your telephone call.
Keep demanding it and eventually you may get a result, if they cant provide evidence that proves you wrong it their problem and they should pay you.

Did you not check how much they were paying you to start with, and did you not realise u were not being paid enough?

It seems that was a long time to go before you realised something was wrong...

Its worth a try anyway.

Well now i want to know why just the Scottish people have to pay for the Glasgow commonwealth games. (no one else just Scots) but when something is held in England everyone has to pay?? Scotland is part of Great Britain so why isn't the door swinging both ways? We help pay for commonwealth games in england they help pay for it in Scotland.

You don't have to file a tax return unless your affiars are complicated, eg you are self employed, have rental income, other untaxed income or a higher rate tax liability. If all your tax liabilities are deducted at source, you don't need to self assess and you should stay out of the system as once in, it's hard to extracate yourself.

I'm no longer self-employed in the UK and don't live there since 3 years. How do I stop paying Tax Return??



I have left the UK in 2005 (came back to my country), and only now received from a friend that still lives there an old penalty letter that the "HM Revenue & Customs" have sent me because I haven't sent my tax returns for year ended 2007.

I have already canceled paying my National Insurance Contributions (2 years ago) and thought it means I officially stop being a self-employed and no longer need to send tax-returns. Isn't it?

Could someone help me understand how it works?? How can I cancel this "Tax return" thing?? It seems very confusing.

Many thanks!

You can't cancel a tax return once it is issued - all you can do is to fill it in. As you will have no UK earnings to declare, it will just be a question of signing it. Put a note on the back to say you left the Uk on xxx and they should then stop sending returns to you.

How much tax will I pay on my car allowance?



I have been offered a salary of £34,000 plus a company car or car allowance of £4980. I have my own car so will probably take the car allowance but would like to know how much of the car allowance I will actually 'take home'. Thanks

</answer from>



<answer>



The basic rate band is £34k of taxed income, so you could say your car allowance is covered by your tax free allowance, effectively making it taxable at 20%.
Don't forget that you can reclaim 40p pm for the first 10,000 business miles and 25p pm thereafter against tax.

Help me with a tax related question, please!?



So i haven't worked since October last year (2007) and i was at University. I left University  in January, but continued receiving my Student loan until about May.So i didn't really HAVE to work. I wasn't even receiving any government benefits or that!

Anyway, i now have a new job, and as you can see i haven't worked AT ALL this new tax year, so I really shouldn't get taxed at all, considering the allowance of £5k you get. However i did NOT receive a P45 from my last employer (from October) thus had to fill out a P46 when i started this new job.

I REALLY don't want emergency taxed (ouch!) but i don't know what to do. I have no payslips from my previous job as i used to get all those online, and they've disappeared now! I don't know who to phone, as the hmrc website doesnt help, cos i dont know the code for my tax office!

PLEASE give me some advice. ANY advice is appreciated!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



A P45 won't help you because it will relate to the previous tax year.
You will be on emergency code until you contact the tax office. Your employer will give you the address and phone number. Simply ring them and ask them what info they need to put you on a cumulative code number.
E code does give you a tax free allowance of £105 each week - a cumulative code will backdate that to 6 April and your employer will refund tax overpaid since you started with them.

Your employer can only make you redundant and in order for you to claim redundancy you must satisfy certain conditions:

1. You must not be passed the normal age of retirement;

2. You must have worked for at least 2 years prior to redundancy; and

3. You must be in a genuine redundancy situation. That is either that your job no longer exists, your place of work does not exist, or your employer does not exist. You must fall under one of the three types of redundancy situations.

After you have satisfied the above, there are various other issues that must be considered and these can be complicated and you are advised to consult CAB or some other organisation that can assist you in this respect.

They automatically calculate the withholdings based on the amount that does NOT go to retirement.  You should not change the number of exemptions on your W-4.

If you want to tweak your w-4, the IRS has a withholding calculator that makes recommendations for the rest of the year.

Clearly you goal is to reduce, but not eliminate, your refund.

Unless you are a dependent, you should be fine.  If you are single with no dpendents, and no extra deductions or credits, and are not a dependent, then you'll come close to even with 2, and will almost surely owe with 3.

Not sure what you're asking here. The temp agency must pay you for the work you've done. They cannot and will not dock you because you resign.



However, if you're asking whether you'll get severance pay, it's not likely unless it was part of a contract you signed with them or with the client.

For most trades there is a fixed rate deduction. Go to www.hmrc.gov.uk and search for 'fixed rate deductions'. There is a list of all the main trades and the amount which is allowable. Just ring your tax office and ask them to include the allownace in your code number.

Yes it will. You will need to inform the DWP that you have received this money. They make take back some of the benefits paid to you.  It will depend on the type of compensation awarded.

Hi

It depends what you mean by 'tax' (typical accountants answer there!)

The 'personal allowance' which is free of income tax is currently £6035.

However if you are aged 65-74 it is £9030 and if you are over 75 it is £9180. If you are married but aged born before 6th April 1935 but aged under 75 you get £6535 married couples allowance. If you re married and aged over 75 you get married couples allowance of £6625. however if you earn over £21800 then these age related allowances get reduced.

What this doesn't tell you is that if you earn between £5435 and £6035 you still pay tax! Except that the tax here is called National Insurance.

So the real tax free earnings limit is £5435.

I am assuming you are now in the UK. The tax year goes from 6th April to 5th April. When you say at the end of the year, I assume you mean December 2008? 
When PAYE is operated correctly, the right amount of tax should be deducted, so it is unlikely that any refund will be due for a couple of the back years. You can go back up to six years, and ask HMRC to check your tax position. What happened the year you started work? Did you come from abroad? There may be some unused tax allowances then, it will depend on what you were doing from the prior 6th April, until the date you started work. If you came from abroad, form P85 should be completed to establish your residency position, and to see if you are entitled to British tax allowances.
From the period 06/04/08, until you leave your job, you will get a form P45. Send it to the tax office with form P85, to claim any refund due for this tax year.

Hi Emma,

Do you mean the cafe is in Ghana as in West Africa??  If so, then it would be up you to ensure that the business is compliant with the local tax regimes applicable in that country.  VAT is a sales tax that is operated within the EU only.  However, if the cafe is in the UK then it would be providing services that are wholly taxable at the rate of 17.5% so yes, your prices should include VAT.  Also, food is taxed at the full rate depending on if its hot or cold or takeaway.  Food and VAT can be very complex but if you check the HMRC website and in particularly the Public Notice relating to Food and Takeaways this should make it clearer for you.

Hope this helps.

Get real.

If HBOS were allowed to go under then we would have a run on all our banks - they learnt from Northern Rock that a Bank of England bail out would exacerbate the problem and Lloyds - who were not as exposed in the mortgage market as HBOS are - were persuaded - coerced who knows to mount a private rescue plan.

Look at 1929 under Mellon in the USA - that lesson is still at the heart of what is happening.  Aloow one bank to go under and everyone starts putting money in their matress - so bringing every other bank down.

The carrot for Lloyds is that they would not normally be allowed to entertain the idea of a merger of this size except under the rather exceptional circumstances which currently exist - Panic in the money markets.

Yes it is not good for competition but far worse for all the competition would be to allow HBOS to go bust and create an avalanche of deserters from the banks - so bringing the whole banking industry to its knees.

The monopolies commission can look at this once the markets have calmed down.  Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and the USA can't rescue them all because the USA is virtually bankrupt.

They have a war which has drained billions from the US Treasury coffers to enrich oil magnates and arms manufacturers.  The economic stupidity of that decision is now having a domino effect on their financial markets.

Political change has to come.  People have seen the boom years bring little material benefit to themselves - they have merely seen the fat cats getting fatter.  People are beginning to recognise this as a form of theft - see Vince Cables speech to the Liberal Democrat Conference.  Frankly with Vince Cable at the head of the Lib Dems they might stand a chance of being a real political power in this country.  The wishy washy leadership of the Lib Dems means we have to consider voting for real independents on both sides of the Atlantic and stop being suckered into thinking we have only two political choices to make.

The alternative was to let the bank go bust. I think Brown should have nationalised it, the same as with Northern Rock.

It is a myth that free market competition works - it works in the short term, but after a few years companies buy each other up and you end up with a monopoly. Look at bus deregulation - initially there were lots of small bus companies competing with each other, but now there is only First, Stagecoach and a few others.

first off, are you working in the UK more than 6 months a year? if you are then you will be paying tax and NI this will be around 25%  but will vary depends on your tax code and other factors 3500 it sounds like you will hit the higher tax bracket in which case they'll be taking 40% of your gross pay your best off contacting your local tax office to get the correct rates that apply to you as no matter what someone tells you on here the tax man is always write you'll rarely beat him/her!

You are effectively self employed so you must register as such. You will then fill in a tax return once a year and pay tax in two instalments according to the details submitted to the tax people.

Get in touch asap with your local tax office.  You are NOT self-employed and will need to apply PAYE and NI yourself.  The tax office will give you all the stationery and calculation tables that you need, and will be happy to help you until you get the hang of it.  It isn't difficult when you follow the step-by-step instructions they provide.

HMRC does not have to prove anything - the onus is on the taxpayer to prove that his returns are correct. In the absence of stamps in your passport, you might produce evidence from an overseas employer, rent or utility bills, travel documents or other correspondence.

For 2008-09 you have Personal allowances of 
(a) £6.035 if you are under 65
(b) £9,030  for between 65-74 and 
(c) £9,180 if 75 or over 
plus another £1,800 if you are registered blind, This amount of your total income is therefore tax free. On top of that you can have a further £34,800 taxed at 20% and then (subject to some particular situations where basic rate is extended - charitable donations etc) anything over that is taxed at 40%. OH yes forgot to say that in addition to this you will also be paying Class 4 NIC contributions of 8% if you are self employed and roughly up to 12.8% Class 1 NIC if you're employed. AND then why not help GB (Gordon Brown not Breat Britain) by paying 17.5% in VAT if you're self employment is from services and you earn over £67K per annum.
Who says we don't pay enough tax?

Claiming a higher number of allowances means that less will be withheld from your paycheck.  Your refund, if you have one, will be lower by whatever extra amount you got in your paycheck - if the extra allowances cause you to not have as much withheld as your tax liability for the year, you won't get a refund and instead will owe the difference at tax time.

It doesn't affect the total amount that you pay, just when you pay it.

Do you think you are due a refund of tax for 2007/08? If so, you just need to contact your tax office and ask them to do a calculation for you. Tell them who you worked for during the year - you dont need to send your P60's.

Report any changes to income ASAP because 2 reason 1 you tax credits might go up cos your owed it or the bad thing is if they keep paying you and its to much you have to pay it back and its not something you can run from cos its the government and you will never get tax credits again so tell them its more likely that they will owe you money and if you leave it toooo long the bigger the bill will get if you owe them :(

You should report any changes in circumstances within 1 month, but seen as how your income has gone down if you were to wait till your annual renewal in april you would get a lump sum if you have been under paid tax credits or tell them now and your payments would adjust immediately.
Hope this helps.

Yes, but you have to keep an accurate log of all your petrol purchases and business trips, by the date, time and mile -  also maintenance and insurance costs etc.There is a special section in the tax return form to fill in.  You can buy log books for this purpose in  most good stationers.

It's called FRAUD and if you get caught you might not be doing much for a few years if it has been worthwhile in monetary terms. HMRC Inspectors have a habit of "exchanging information" under the terms of the DTR agreements nowadays - they do move forward  - and you would also have to be very careful that you do not become the subject of money laundering reports...... if you don't realise what you have posed then don't even think about it

Agius is almost correct. Your new employer will make the refund provided you start a new job before the end of the tax year. If you are signing on, the Job Centre will make the refund at the end of the tax year, or when you sign off, whichever comes first. If you are not working or climing for 4 weeks, you can download form P50 from www.hmrc.gov.uk and send it to your tax office to claim your refund. No need to wait until the end of the year.

What were you doing from 06/04/08, at the start of the tax year, and when you started your job? If you were not working, you have a backlog of tax allowance from last April. Depending on whether you had a form P45 from a previous job to give your employer, or on how you complete a form P46, if you don't have form P45, you may be taxed on an emergency basis (which means your backlog of tax allowance isn't taken into account). If you have form P45, previous pay and tax will be included.
You can earn £6035 per annum now before paying tax, but that is proportioned out into monthly amounts, albeit on a cumulative basis. So if you have just started work, you will be paying less tax than you will when the new year starts.
You can look at www.listentotaxman to calculate your tax/NIC liability on an annual, monthly, or weekly basis.
Basic Rate tax is now 20%, not 22%.

take out your tax allowance, which is about 6035 now as they have just upped it, the balance of £10,000 will be taxed at approx 22%, plus national insurance so , you should take home approx £1114.00 per month, but that is a guesstimate!

Regardless of who's fault the overpayment was you will have to pay it back. There was a lot of fuss a couple of years back about this sort of thing, with some people going as far to say that this was not legal, but i don't think you'll find any way around it. As for repaying it, you should be able to organise a repayment plan that suits you.

This is one of the advantage of living in a democracy,as the government can screw you legally and you can not do anything about it, as it is the law of the land, but you try to claim anything that you are en tiled to and they make it as difficult as possible until you give up claiming.

Paying tax on ebay profits?



I am employed and I earn £34,000 per annum.  I have started having a clearout (all my own items, I do not go out and buy stuff to sell, so the selling will be short lived)  I have been selling unwanted jewellery, clothes, bags etc on ebay.  Am I liable to pay tax on what I make on this.

The way you are stating the situation, sounds more like you are having a garage/yard sale.

Now, if the items were sold for more money than you originally paid for them...that would be profit..

Just for fun, figure it out as a business proposition

Bought 1 pair of slacks for $30 sold them for $10...loss of $20
and so on and so on.  At the end of a year you would have quite a loss and could take that off of your normal salary



I'm in the US so I don't know if our laws differ, but if you are selling the items you own to clean out your closet-that doesn't sound like a tax thing.

But, the best advice is to always check with a business professional

There are arrears of post of 8-10 weeks in most tax offices. If you sent your claim in longer ago than that, then I suggest you either ring your tax office or get someone in the UK to ring for you (you will have to provide HMRC with authority to speak to your friend).

Do you mean that your take home pay went up this week by £55?  If yes, the answer above is telling you, in a subtle way, that its the payment that the government gave everybody following the removal of the 10p tax rate fiasco earlier this year and your taxes have been lowered as well.  This will also mean that you get more money every week. If not and you are down £55 then the above is telling you that you have been conned and so challenge this. Your tax codes will enable her to help you get your dos.

If your having a go by putting what I said - I don't know why?  I am just stating that the taxes have now been lowered back as the government put them up this year and removed the lower tax band making people worst off. They were forced to put them back down and issue one off payment 'rebates'.

As a rule of thumb, the cost of employment is 15% of salary, so the employer would fund something like £46k

However that can vary a great deal depending on things like pension contributions, health insurance, transport allowance etc. etc.

Your employer has to pay NIC contributions for you. He also has to provide certain standards for health and safety etc in the workplace, possibly employ someone else to do payroll. Even if he does payroll himself, it costs him time. It really depends on the size of the firm.
At one time, several years ago, it was estimated that the cost of employing was salary x 3. Computers may have reduced some costs, but safety and welfare requirements have increased massively.

Damien Hirst auction sale and tax: How does that work?



This is a question for all you tax experts.  Does Damien Hirst get taxed on the money he made from the auction of his works?  I mean, how does that work because you technically get taxed on income.  Is that income, in Hirst's case?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Yes, selling his art works is income for tax purposes, exactly the same as if someone sells their labour as a carpenter.
I don't know, but I imagine Hirst trades through a company, so he would only pay income tax on what he draws from the company, the rest being liable for Corporation tax.

Contrary to popular belief there is no such thing as "Emergency tax".  Simply there is basic rate tax which would be applied at 20% of your earnings.

your employer should ask you to fill in a P46!

Your tax would not change. Its only if its your second job you would get the tax code of BR!

Get back to your previous employer and ask them for your P45 as soon as possible. If you are on an emergency code, you will stay on it until the HMRC have all the details they need to change your code. Your P45 is the key document they use to do that, and your previous employer is required to give you it.



The emergency tax code is set each year and is a number followed by the letter L. The emergency code for 2008-09 is 603L. It's 22%.

Once HMRC have details of your previous income and tax paid for the tax year, they will send your employer (and you) your full (correct) tax code. Your employer will deduct the correct tax in future and refund any overpaid tax. That's why it's very important that you give HMRC any information they ask you for.

If you leave your job before you get the right code, or you want to claim tax back for a previous tax year, you can apply to HMRC for a refund. Just get in touch with your local tax office, you'll find their number in the telephone book, and they will give you all the info you need to claim it.

About your direct debits -- hopefully you will have enough to cover them even on the emergency code, but if not, the last thing you want is to end up having extortionate bank charges for them not going through, and possibly putting yourself behind for next month too as you try to pay them off. So if you are sure you don't have enough to cover them, I would think about perhaps asking your mum or dad or someone like that to lend you some money to cover them, just until you get sorted.

All the best; hope you get fixed up soon. And good luck in your new job!

Basic Rate is 20%, not 22%. You may have a slight problem as you will have a pay overlap between two employments for 1st - 18th Sept, thus you will have had two sets of tax allowances, and may be underpaid.
If your new employer has not had form P45, he should ask you to sign form P46, and then deduct emergency tax. That is the same as normal tax, but the code number is operated on a week or month 1 basis, instead of cumulatively. This means that without the overlap, the amount of tax deducted should be approximately correct.
When new employer gets form P45, he won't be able to put you on a cumulative code if it means deducting all the amount of the underpayment on one payday, so you may be on an emergency code number for the rest of the tax year until next April. HMRC will then send you an underpayment calculation after the end of the year, with any underpayment being collected by a restriction in your code number for the year 2009/2010.

Uk Tax code Question? Bit boring I know!?



This month my take home pay has gone up £50 (hooray), because my tax code has changed?

Is this a one off "bribe" from the Government or will I actually be £50 better off every month?

Hi

This is part of the government's (possibly) one off bribe this year.

Originally the tax free allowance set in the budget for this tax year was £5435. But at the same time they abolished the 10% tax rate (One of Gordeon Brown's actions whilst he was stiull chancellor but deferred until this year so he could blame AQlistair Darling). This made poorer people worse off (which is what you expect from a Labour government :-) but actually made political sense at the time as on the whole poor people dont vote so dont count as far as the political classes are concerned). However this caused a real uproar so the government did a one off measure to increase the tax free amount this year by £600 to £6035. (At the same time they reduced the point at which you pay higher rate tax by £1,200).

Because the Revenue is so efficient at their job, it is only now that tax codes have been adjusted for this tax change, which is why you have now felt the benefit. This month will be better than next month because under the employee tax system your tax free allowance is spread over the year. So this month you have an adjustment for the fact that you have been 'over taxed' for April through to August. Unfortunately you wont be £50 better off next pay day!

No it is a one off - it has been in the news for months.  The fact that your tax code has chnged mid year will have triggered the re payment.

Yes, it is a one off!! However, you will find that next month you will still be a little better off than before.

Employers do not pay tax purely because they are employers.  They will, of course, be liable to either income tax or corporation tax on their profits according to their status.

If you mean national insurance then contributions are payable on wages and salaries paid above the earnings threshhold which is currently £5,435 a year.

I estimate £25.18 tax and £13.76 national insurance. This is based on a take home pay of £191.20 per week. Gross pay £230.14 per week. 
It depends on your tax code and personal allowances, etc etc though, so the above figures may not be right.
