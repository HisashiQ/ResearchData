It's the Clark County Regional Justice Center on Fourth Street in downtown Las Vegas. The Strip is much further south of there and the Strip is not in Las Vegas. It's in Winchester and Paradise Nevada. However you can take the double decker "Deuce" transit bus north on the strip, get off at Bonneville Avenue and walk one block west to the Justice Center. If you get lost just look for the TV Satellite truck "forest".

The girl who was murdered in Brazil.......



Ok, I'm not judging the parents, but who here seriously would let there 17yr old daughter go half way across the world (or anywhere) with some strange boy they met in there home town? I doubt there parents 'didn't' know, otherwise there would be a huge hunt for the girl, and there wasn't.
Will this incident teach us as people to be more cautious and vigilant against people we dont know, and even people we do know. Of course we don't know what will happen around the corner, but people with authority such as parents need to be more vidulant and smarter.
What do you think?

I thought the same thing, this day in age its just not safe for 17 year old girls to be jetting off to another country with someone they dont really know that well. I am surprised at the parents for letting her go, i know its hard to keep teenagers tied down but really!! I know i would be scared to do something like that.Maybe they did try and talk her out of it tho and she just went off anyway as it does say that someone else paid for her ticket! Who knows, its so sad and this guy looks pure evil. So many sick people in the world now, it will get to the point people wont leave their houses.

Probably not. A lot of the festivals have had problems in the past with thieves sneaking in to steal from the tents while everybody is away enjoying themselves. They will probably issue all campers with a wristband as they go in - so I imagine you won't get far without one. :-)

well i belive the world is warming up in some places but i don't belive that it is due to humans. I think that the world heating up is just a natural anomoly of the earth, for when human kind was eveolving in Africa (before the ice age) where the sahara is used to be lush forest/rain forest/weland. So i belve it is justa natural phase of the earth, but seeing that humans now live in the areas that used to be where the water rose does concern alot of humanity of a rise in sea level of just over a meter could be devestating for major cities, as most are on the coast(not inland)

I've known about global warming since I was 18, and I'm 50 now.  It's nothing new.  Time magazine had an article 32 years ago and I've believed and been concerned about it ever since. So many people try to pretend it doesn't exist so they won't have to do anything about it.  It relieves some of the guilt, I guess. Sad that so many people are so unconcerned.

It's not a hoax, but the government and media are trying to get people to believe that it's mostly OUR fault that it's happening, to gain more control by implementing more regulations, and to gain profits.

Mars polar ice caps are melting, too!! So yes, we are doing damage to the Earth, but we're not the main cause for GW. Cow farts cause more greenhouse gases than cars fumes do.

Global warming is real. 
It is the emphasis on the reasons for it that is wrong. Too much attention is being paid to prevention, when, this is not going to be possible to any meaningful degree, i.e 4% human co2 emissions 96% natural occuring emissions.
More attention should be made on how to counter the effects otherwise the extremes caused by the warming will overcome us, eventually.

Tolerance is all well and good as long as EVERYBODY does it. Muslims are not interested in tolerance and want to kill anyone who isn't Muslim or even who isn't their particular brand of Muslim.  It is not, and never has been the Christians who cause the problems. Jews, are another story, but even they are not as violent or as dangerous as Muslims are. When Muslims learn how to get along with others, then and only then will the world be safe.

Look around who oppress tribe of different community with non-existence rights of original descendant with slavery in idol worshiping the dead Mummy of tribe of a Rudeness Tribe of failures and horrors of the past from the graveyards of different ghostly ancestor's culture and custom with self image of standing idol all over the land glaring under the sun, moon and stars even on cloudy and rainy days too in schools, in places of higher learning, at work, in public places,at home even in social lives too in own backyards? 
Luke 9.25,55-56,60
Even in having tribes of diffrent community eerily shrieking and wailing in ghostly kitchen's dialect with ghostly and deadly words from the graveyards of different ghostly ancestor's culture and custom as cheap-skate glory and success of National Identity of a Rudeness Tribe with great Asian values in kicking the butts of tribes of different community in own backyards?

I don't think this bombing was done in the name of ALLAH, but because of the USA's military presence. If another country came onto American soil and erected an Embassy, I'm sure American citizens would be less than pleased, too.

I am not saying what they did was okay, I'm just giving another angle of looking at it.

If it was a straight fight then obviously big Australians would kick the feathers right off those little flightless birds in a second.

Not sure how fast they run, but maybe the plucky little ornithological freak might win a 50 yard dash against a lumbering Ocker.

The big advantage would be in General Knowledge since clearly the kiwi possesses a far bigger brain

In the Navy I went to port in both countries. Sydney, Australia and ChristChurch, New Zealand. I found very little difference. But hey people will treat a Sailor with money to burn the same all over. I soon learned and so did the Commander of the Pacific Fleet that Sailors should be allowed to wear civilian clothes when on shore leave and not our uniforms to make us targets. Of course that doesn't work in some countries where just being an American makes you stand out. Attitudes have changed a little since the 1970's though. Kiwi's have the best sense of humor. Aussies are really laid back. No worries mate.

I think AIG is named as biggest Insurance company in this world. To make it short, I believe AIG has involved a big and high interest to pay out for sort of contract. It is so big a business giant world wide and needs a big amount of overheads. Due to the AIG huge investment including funds, particularly the hedge funds (a few websites described this is the sin fund), stock markets, life insurance, saving funds, real estates, pension funds, retirement saving plan, and many variety of financial activities. As the stock markets have crashed worldwide, AIG can't afford to pay off the those monies for their clients for insurance claims, pension plan payments, including high interest rates for giving away as well as the debts. The following website has provided the detailed information of what AIG it is, how they operate in terms of a variety of financial activities, winning and losing, falloufall outsthe whole damn thing.
