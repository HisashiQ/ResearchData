Christmas is not encouraged in a Communist country and the big celebration in Cuba is New Year's Day, which happens to be the Cuban national day. Two days of noise, partying, fireworks, eating, drinking, military parades and in the past, anyway, an unbelievably long speech on the TV by President Castro. You greet everyone you meet with "Felicidades" and get a cheerful "Felicidades" back from them. http://www.123newyear.com/newyear-tradit...

Christmas was eliminated from the calendar since 1969 by ( not president, but dictator ) fidel. He said that in Cuba, the holidays should not be in December, but in July.  Last Christmas was in 1968.



When Juan Pablo II visited Cuba, as a courtesy to him, Christmas was officially reinstated



As Caicos said, in a comunist country Christmas is not encouraged, but eliminated as it was for so long



We cook what we can get. Traditionally we cooked pork, black beans, rice, yuca, turrones, wine.
But now is what we can obtain



By the way, I don't remember seeing fireworks. At least not recently

Christmas was eliminated officially, as some people have already mentioned here, in 1968. Those were the last Christmas in Cuba until 1998, when they were officially reinstated as a courtesy to Juan Pablo II after his visit



Anyway, due to the official obliteration, many people lost the habit of celebrating Christmas. As somebody said, comunist countries eliminate Christmas due to be a religious celebration, and many people, after 30 years, took the habit of celebrating the new year.



What we cook ?
Whatever we can find. In the 1969/1970 I remember people saying that all they could find was chicken
We drink rum, wine, or a beverage we call chispa de tren. At certain times rum got very scarce and that was all we could get



Today, I am not well updated of the situation, but according to what the family tells me, not great difference

Actually there are sharks and barracudas in the water. In the Cayos they can be found as well as elsewhere...but when they take you out, they know for sure where to take you so that it is safe.



While swimming, there have been barracudas that swim by but they don't do anything.
I wouldn't worry about them though. You don't hear of any encounters with them.

Are there any restrictions for NON-US European) passengers to fly to Cuba from the US via a third country?



I doubt there should be a problem legally, but 1) would you advise separate tickets for the 3rd-country - Cuba leg? and 2) would you advise we didn't buy any souvenirs in Cuba given we'd be passing by the US again on our way back to Europe? Should we contact our respective embassies (or the US one) for clarification? Thanks!

There will be no problems as a non-US citizen. But it'll be easier for you to travel to Cuba from another country other than the US...it won't be the easiest route since you'd need a travel licence to get a direct flight from the US to Cuba. You can travel via Canada or Mexico (and other countries as well).



But you CAN bring your souvenirs from Cuba into the US because they have no jurisdiction over your travels being a non-US resident.



Don't worry...go travel freely and buy whatever souvenirs you want.
Enjoy your trip.

Hello Dear!
This is one of the biggest misconceptions held by Americans. Technically it is not illegal for any American to go to Cuba. It is, however, illegal for Americans to spend money and engage in trade with Cuba. Some may call this a mere technicality, but the regulations do allow for many Americans to visit this unique destination - with a little extra planning to comply with regulations. These regulations are controlled by the U.S. Treasury Department and its Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).



US citizens without a license to come to Cuba, follow these steps



All you need is a valid passport. You can pick up a Cuban tourist card at any airport counter outside the US that has flights to Cuba.Air tickets to and from Cuba.You should make your flight reservation to a third country in such a way as to make a connection with one of the frequent flights from there to Cuba. A Canadian or Mexican Travel Agency can take your reservation online and have your pre-paid ticket and tourist card ready when you arrive at the third-country airport like Cancun,Toronto,Montreal or Mexico city
Best of Luck Hun!

Tropical  and  JC  have  given you  good  facts so  I  wont  open  my  pie  hole  for  a  change  and  answer  something  that  has  been  already  answered



for  the 1000 th  time , as  one respondant  alluded  to ,  but , I will  share  my  personal  experience  with  you.



Ive  spent  the  last  2  years  living  in  the  Dominican  Republic



and  flew  to  Habana  from  Santo  Domingo  where I live .  PROBLEM  #1.  THE Dominican immigration officers and customs officials working  at



other  3rd  party gates of  escape  have  caught  on  to  the  embargo game  and have  started  to  CAPITALIZE  ON  THE  CAPITALISTS



that  wish  to  pee on  foriegn policy and  think  theyre  smarter  than  Uncle  W. and  the  boys.  TRANSLATION .  IT  COST  ME  50  U.S dollars  to  keep  Pedros  whistle  in  his  pocket  and  his  companero that  had  an  article  from  the  Miami  herald  in  his  pocket about  a  gringo  busted in  Miami coming  from  Cuba.  (THEY  ARE  READY  AND  WAITING  FOR  YOU) .  PROBLEM # 2 . BECAUSE  YOUR  AMERICAN , ITS  HARDER  to  research  and  plan  your  trip  to  Cuba so  one banana  peel  in your  path  could  be  your  end . For  example , When I  entered  Habana  airport  I did  not  have  a  visa  which  subjected  me  to  a  lengthy interrogation  from  Cuban  officials who  after  finally  convincing  that  I  only  was  there  to  find  out  if  fidel  could dance  salsa  or  not  and  I  wasnt  a  spy ,  sold  me  a  visa  , and  let  me  go without  stamping  my  passport  . RETURNING  was  no  problem  but  no  less risky  and  much  more  nerve  shaking  because I  didnt  know  if  I  was  going  to  have  to  pay  off  another  official  coming  in  as  well .  AGAIN , THE  TRAVEL  BAN  IS  UNCONSTITUTIONAL , but  at  U.S  customs, unless  they find  cigar  boxes in your  bag  or  pictures on  your  camera  of  you  standing  next  to  the  che  memorial  with  your  Viva  Cuba  tee on  , its hard  to proove  you  went  there.  (  Let me  add  my  friend , that  if  your only  going  to  Cuba  for cheap  thrills  and  chills  down  your  star spangled  buttcheeks , please  go  to  to  disney  world  instead  ).  EDUCATION , YES , VACATION  , NO......Cubans  are  justifiably  offended  by  extranjeros using  thier  homeland  as  a  giant  water  slide ................................(...a message  to  physicia ) ,your  dead  right  on  my  friend  as a  communist  regime  has  nothing  on  this  site  when  it  comes  to  freedom  of  speech  and  censor  ship . i  cant  believe  how  many  of my  responses  and  questions  have  been  removed  .  what  really  smacks  me  in  the  face  is  that  the  ones  who  so  boldly  complain  about  communism  and  accuse  us  of  supporting  it  are  the  very  ones  responsible  for  these  actions  as  they  cant  seem  to  be  able  to  handle  painful  truths .

The most common gateways to Cuba for unlicensed US travellers are Toronto, Montreal, Nassau, Cancun and Mexico City, and less frequently used Santo Domingo and Montego Bay.



Mexico, and in particular Cancun, appears to be the gateway that offers the least risk of detection. This is because:



Unlike Canada and the Bahamas, a traveler leaving from Mexico does not pre-clear US Customs and Immigration. You will not clear Customs/Immigration until you arrive back in the US. In Canada and the Bahamas you will go through US Customs and Immigration at the airport in Toronto, Montreal or Nassau.



Cancun is the most popular destination for US tourists in the Caribbean. There is absolutely no reason why US Customs/Immigration would suspect you have been anywhere else but Cancun.



You can enter Mexico and re-enter the US using only a certified copy of your birth certificate and a government issued photo id, such as a driver's license (BC/DL) In other words you do not have to show US Immigration your passport upon re-entry to the US. Probably half or more of US tourists who travel to Cancun use this alternate form of identification as their travel documents.

Hi Bailarin...yes, religions are open and free there. They're not afraid to talk to you about God and religion. There is great interest with many Cubans about the Bible.



Catholics, Protestants, Jehovah's Witnesses, among others are very well-known there and are open about their beliefs despite Cuba being under communist regime.
If you were talking about religion and politics in the same breath, then sure they might be wary...even though religion has opened up in Cuba since around 1998, because of the situation in the country, naturally many would exercise caution with certain topics.

Best way to call Cuba?



Hello. My boyfriend lives in Cuba, and so I make loads of calls to the island. I've been calling using international calling cards, but the connection is bad and most of the times i don't get the minutes i'm supposed to. The call however is very cheap by this method as I end up paying around 20p/min when the card gives me the minutes it's supposed to. I just wanted to know if anybody knows a better way to call Cuba which is also cheap as most companies charge around 60p to £1/min. Thanks a lot for any advice.

Cuban National Holidays:



The following days are Cuban national holidays. In most locations, shops are generally closed, and local transportation is scarce.



January 1: Liberation and New Year’s Day, known locally as Triunfo de la Revolucion (Triumph in the Revolution).



May 1: International Worker’s Day, known locally as Dia de los Trabajadores.



July 25-27: Commemorates the day before, the day of, and the day after the National Rebellion. July 26, the day of the revolution, is known locally as Día de la Rebeldía Nacional. Not all of these days are national holidays in any given year, but it’s wise to expect that at least two of them will be.



October 10: Día de la Independencia—Independence Day—commemorates the day in 1868 which led to the Independence war against Spain, and eventually the Ten Years’ War.



December 25: Once a normal working day, Navidad was reinstated as a national holiday following Pope John Paul II’s official visit to Cuba in 1998.
--------------------------------------...
Liberation and New Year’s Day is the first of the year’s Cuban festivals, occurring on January 1st. All over the country, Cubans take to the streets, with enormous street parties held in every city and town. In Havana, this day is celebrated with outdoor concerts and other events.



Dia de los Trabajadores is held on May 1 and celebrates the ‘working man’, as Labor Day does in other countries. On this day, enormous rallies are held countrywide, in Plazas de la Revolucion.



Feria Internacional Cubadisco is more or less the Cuban version of the Grammys. This event is held in Havana during the second week of May, and features a huge variety of exceptional musical concerts and events.



Festival del Caribe and Fiesta del Fuego is held in Santiago de Cuba in the first week of July. This rowdy and raucous week-long Cuban festival is a celebration of Caribbean music, dance, and religion. Free or inexpensive performances of dance and music are plentiful at both indoor and open-air venues.



Día de la Rebeldía Nacional is commemorated on July 26, and is a Cuban national holiday. This day commemorates the 1953 attack on Moncada Barracks (initiated by Fidel Castro), and the celebrations are centered in a different province each year.



Carnaval of Santiago de Cuba is held in the last week of July. This is Cuba’s largest and one of its oldest festivals, and includes parades, dancing, music, street performances, and plenty of beer. Bring your own cup and you can fill it up on almost any street corner in the city.



Festival de Rap Cubano Habana Hip Hop is held in Havana in mid-August, and celebrates Cuban rap and hip hop. This is a relatively new international event that has quickly become an enormously popular and successful one, attended by scores of rap and hip hop performers from Europe and the Americas.



Festival Internacional de Ballet is celebrated in Havana, and has been held in mid-October of even-numbered years since 1960. This huge event is packed with stellar performances from international ballet companies from all over the world, and in the past has featured companies from Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa.



Festival Internacional de Jazz is held in Havana in the first week of December, and features incredible jazz performances from international acts in an astonishing variety of jazz genres.



Festival Internacional de Nuevo Cine Latino-Americano is Cuba’s answer to Cannes—a showcasing of new Latin-American long and short films. Held during the first week of December, this festival features hundreds of screenings of new films.



Las Parrandas de Remedios is held on December 24 in the city of Remedios, and features a parade with outrageously extravagant floats, fireworks, and an evening of music, dancing, and fun. While the Remedios festivities are perhaps the most famous and the most popular with tourists, many other Cuban cities and even smaller towns have some form of celebration on this date.

Religious holidays, the most important is the 17 December, the day of San Lazaro. I must specify that, due to sincretism, many people associate this saint to babalu ayé from the African beliefs . Many people go to the Sanctuary of san Lazaro since the day before.



We also have el dia de la Virgen de la Merced, 24 September. The day of Santa Barbara, the 4 December



These are days of popular beliefs



And of course, we also have the Holy Week and Christmas

Well, we have the day of San Lázaro ( the 17 December ). He has the greatest number of followers, due to the combination of Catholicism with African beliefs since times of slavery.



Also, the day of Santa Barbara ( the 4 December ), the day of yemayá ( I am not sure when ), and, of course, Christmas and the end of lent

Most likely not, as Beardo said. My suggestion is contact the resort directly to be sure of anything. However, any hurricane effects at the resorts have already been worked on.

Here are the most recent reviews after the hurricane from the resort...sounds like there is nothing to be concerned about.

If you are coming to visit in October, then the very best things to bring will be insect repellent with deet - to take care of the mosquitoes.  You really don't want to get dengue. If you are staying at a resort and will only be eating food from there, then you should be ok, however, if you are planning on running around the island and being adventurous, make sure you keep some anti diuretic pills.  If you are here and you get an amoeba or something like that, you can find pills for that at the resort or at any farmacia.

I've lived here for 2 1/2 years, and haven't come down with anything too serious, so you should be ok.

2 hepititus jabs I had last year.

Just ring you're local doctors surgery and ask them - they'll be more than happy to help.
Just remember the jabs have to be done like 6 weeks before you go or something so get intouch with them as soon as possible.
