Someone who knows you, a previous landlord, your boss at work, a college or university tutor etc I think even your parents can write you one too, but just check that.
 Its not a reference just something to assure the estate agents that your going to be a good tenant, well behaved, etc

A character reference from a family member, relative or friend is not worth the paper it is written on. You need to look for some professionally qualified person or established Business owner who has known you well for a couple of years or more.  Suitable people could be your School House Master/mistress, a Manager in a previous employers, a Minister of the Church, Lawyer, Doctor, Policeman etc.

On more than one ocassion in the days when i was hiring, i saw handwritten character references where it was fairly obvious that the signature was not in the same hand as the reference its-self.  Some friend had presumably said you write it and i will sign it.

If we no longer depreciate our home for small business, will be need to recapture eventually when we sell?



Because of heath issues,we are cutting back and may not claim home office at all.



We have depreciated the house about $6000.  If we sell it in 10-15 years, will we need to recapture the depreciation?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Yes, it doesn't matter that you stop depreciating.  The depreciation (technically "cost recovery") you have taken has reduced your tax basis in the property.

When you sell, you will calculate your gain by subtracting the basis from the sales price.  The portion of the gain that is due to cost recovery will be taxed at ordinary income rates, the rest will be capital gain.

At least that's how it works now, who knows what the tax law will look like 10 - 15 years from now.

We sold a truck from small business that we didn't depreciate, only claimed mileage. must we recapture any?



I am thinking since we claimed only mileage and did not depreciate the truck, we don't need to list it when sold.  Is that correct?

The truck was a capital asset of the business. It should have been shown in the accounts as a purchase when it was bought (i.e. as a business expense). You may not have paid in full - you may have bought the truck in instalments. However you paid for it, the expenses of buying it and running it were legitimate business expenses chargeable against profits.



But, all vehicles depreciate in value and the cost of depreciation is also a charge against profits, because the tax man recognises that you will have to put something by to replace the vehicle.  Therefore the capital value of the truck should have been shown in the accounts and depreciated in depreciated in accordance with accepted practise. Your accountant will advise the best treatment for tax purposes.

The standard mileage includes a lot of things like gas and oil.  Part of the standard mileage also includes depreciation.  So, yes, you will have to list it and recapture depreciation.

Gas and electricity budget for £75 per month. Your landlord will probably pay council tax and water charges. You should think about insurances for your belongings such as laptop, Hi Fi as with 3 of you going in and out there is always a chance that windows, doors etc are left open.

Things don't look good, and although nobody knows for sure, I would expect prices to fall for at least another year or two except in places where there is a high turnover such as central London.
During the bubble over the last few years, UK houses have reached prices that are way out of line with the rest of Europe, and things in Europe have a knack of evening themselves out.

Well, my personal opinion is move out.  Find somewhere else to go and live - these guys don't seem too bothered about anything.  You didn't do anything wrong, I guess you are just a normal person  a bit concerned about the state of the place - as would most of us be!  Why did you agree to take the room if it was in such a bad state?

I would look for something else, take it, then explain you are moving out - before the place burns to the ground!

I suggest that you get the advice of a mortgage broker.  You can find ones which give their services free and they get their money from commission for signing you up to a mortgage.  Most will have hundreds of different mortgages available and will hopefully find the right product for you.  You could also go to your bank and ask to see their mortgage adviser, but generally banks are more expensive than some others.

To answer the question based on the information you have given is very difficult.  Is the amount you have steted for your husbands wage what he takes home (net earnings) or is this what he is paid before tax and other deductions (gross earnings) this will make a difference because although lenders will base their  loan on credit and affordability they do take into account income multiples. How long are you going to be a student? etc..... The previous poster is quite right you need to speak to a mortgage broker, make sure they are able to source the whole of market to ensure you get the best possible rate for your circumstances.
Hope this helps.

your credit ratings will be taken into consideration but more importantly is the lender will need to know of earnings to ensure that the amount you need is repayable basically.Also the  mount of deposit you have available is vital....as we all know lenders are very much more cautious now

Straight forward enough if you have a deposit. Some lenders are asking for a 5% deposit but most 10%. Getting a mortgage is a combination of credit rating, deposit, outstanding loand and income. If you fit the picture no problem. I am a mortgage adviser and the problem most first time buyers have is a lack of deposit.

Everything's relative - the UK market is ridiculous, especially in London, and the dollar is currently quite cheap in pound terms, but that could well change.
The flats are not for sale at $5000. That would be rent or mortgage payments.

I really have no idea, but here is a guess!



I also have no real idea about the leases in USA, the rent to some extent would depend upon  how long you could live there, so would the price of buying.



The prices of the other places, over 300k$ look far more interesting
If you compare these prices with  say UK London , Harrow, you just wont believe it!
But your question is why are they so cheap?
This latest credit squeeze has hit us all,, maybe USA most of all?



If only  I had a few millions to invest I would put the lot into housing, I am convinced these prices will get back to the original prices, maybe take 2 or 3 years but they will.



Why wouldn't they? No one is building any thing.  No money in it!



My answer remains the same, I really have no idea  and without knowing what the lease laws are all about, I cant really help.

I'm sure there is fine print somewhere "listings not guaranteed" because those are: wrong.

The prices could be per month, for rental. Some people who are relocating are willing to take a rental lease, at least they can mitigate their expenses and sell later.

Potters Bar, Cuffley and Epping are areas in the immediate countryside outside London and so became desirable commuter areas, and some quite expensive houses were built. Cheshunt and Waltham Cross are joined on to London as it were, and tended to be settled by people moving gradually up from the East End along the Tottenham/Edmonton corridor often into council housing schemes or being able to buy small houses that were once relatively cheap.  A lot of small houses were I think built in Cheshunt and Waltham Cross because there used to be a lot of factories and light industries in the area and they became more defined as working class areas, whereas Potters Bar etc, would be more for people with posher jobs commuting.

As the executor legally she can do this.  Morally/ethically she shouldn't if it's against the family's wishes.  Was there a will and is she acting against what was said in the will, if so I believe you can challenge it in court and either force her to sell the property or change the executor.  Check with a lawyer for specific details though.

If the house is not being sold then it should be registered into all the beneficiaries names. Obviously any rent should be shared between the beneficiaries and there should be interest on the rent already received. Make sure the tenant is paying the proper market rent even if he is a friend or relative. Write to your aunt and suggest you have a meeting. If that doesn't work get a solicitor to do ir for you. It has nothing to do with feelings etc. It is partly your property and all beneficiaries must agree before anything is done. Be firm but not akward or nasty as you don't want things to get worse.
Mike D, if there is an executor (in fact the aunt is the Executrix) there must be a will. She is not right, she has a legal duty to distribute the assets to the beneficiaries according to the will, which she has not done.

You, and the relatives who think similarly, should seek legal advice jointly. My own view is that as you have a share in the property you should have benefited from it as your uncle intended. The letting of the property should not have been done without the written agreement of all parties. A good solicitor will sort it out, if a meeting with all parties cannot do so.

I can understand that she does not want to jump into some quick decision making on selling the property. Renting the property out is not a bad idea until then ALL money earned should go into an account set up for the estate. 
As a heir you have a claim to the rent that the estate is receiving.

<question>



Is anything affected by a change in property management?



I currently rent one room in a share house.

I had been renting through a lettings agency, but yesterday I received an email stating that effective tomorrow, they would no longer be managing the property and the landlord himself will be responsible for it.  They stated that we must cease paying rent to them and the landlord would be in touch to give us his bank details so that we can pay rent directly to him, and that they would be returning our bonds to us which we must then pay to the landlord straight away.  So that all sounds cool ...

But I was just wondering if the landlord can now introduce any changes at all, including raising the rent?  Our rent is inclusive of council tax and all utilities bills - will this continue to be the case?  Currently I only have to give one month's notice to leave (I believe standard is two) - again, can this be changed?

I had signed a "rolling contract" - so there is no official end date, if that makes a difference.  I had to stay there three months from when I first moved in (December 2007) and then it just continues on until I choose to terminate it.

He can ask for what he wants (within the law), your right is to tell him to stick it. 
So you have a choice, pay him, or go elsewhere.

Specifically there is no law saying when the deposit is taken. Most take a deposit of sorts when you confirm your interest. Your landlord wants the full deposit at this early stage. Thats his choice.

It's so the property can be reserved for you and you don't back out at the last minute, leaving him with no tenant and having to waste time looking for another.  If you dont want to pay it, look for something else, but the landlord needs to know where he stands.

So, before you move in one month rent in advance + the deposit.

120 euro withheld for painting in student accommodation?



I just recently received my deposit back from having lived in a student apartment with 120 euro having been deducted for painting...that would be 580 for the whole apartment (ie between the 4 people that lived there). The apartment was dirty when we moved in with lots of short cuts in painting and cleaning evident. We made an oral and written complaint to the landlord. What rights do we have? Any painting that needed to be done was only normal wear and tear, we were actually 4 really clean girls.
Help please?!

I am buying a house with fire damage and awaiting the surveyors report?



there was a fire in the bathroom caused by the boiler, there has been a new  boiler fitted, but the fire looks worse than it is. mostly smoke damage. But it has burnt a few fittings like light fittings. would i need to re-wire the whole house or could just the few switches be fixed.

<answer>



Wait for the surveyors report, if the house has been rewired in the last 20 years then just repair whats broken otherwise get the whole lot done.
You can redecorate in the bathroom, but you need to know what damage has been done say to the walls and roof joists. You might need to replace plaster-boarding.

No, they just take your gross income.  Children "off paper" can be a liability as far as mortgage companies go, because they are expensive.

Even though it isn't truly legal to do it on family status, each member of the family has a certain part put in the expense column, and they make kids really expensive.

Im moving into a shared house in london so it will be 6 people in total, does anyone know how much bills: gas, electric and water are on average and how much each would probably have to pay? Im a student so dont have to pay counsil tax but im pretty scared the bills are still gonna be huge. Will £50 a month each be fine?

I have a student friend living in London. She firstly had a very small room, costing £50 per week, including all bills. This was too small for comfort, so she moved to another address, with a decent-sized room, costing £280/month. She was told it was all-inclusive, but was later asked to pay extra because of high electricity bills. She has moved again, to Erith, which is further out of town. She is now paying £270/month, all bills inclusive.She has to pay for her own cable TV and broadband internet connection. Some landlords do require tenants to share the cost of gas, etc. Costs for this will vary, depending on the number of occupants, but £50/month would be around the minimum.

That sounds about right.  The house that I currently live in has bills included so not exactly sure, but about two years ago I was paying ...

£55 per month for:
- Council tax (cheap though, as it was an old, crap house)
- Water
- Electricity
- Gas
- TV license
There were five of us in a five-bed house.  We occassionally (maybe once every three months) had to put in an extra tenner, especially in the winter when the heating bills are going to be larger.

Now, this was a couple of years ago and costs have gone up since then.  But since you're not paying council tax, £50 sounds about right!

That said, if I were you I would try to save a little bit of extra money in case you are suddenly faced with a bill that you can't afford.  Or at least have some kind of back-up - maybe a parent will help you out until you can afford to pay them back.

So, £350 is reasonable. I AM EXTREMELY careful with light, heating...

I also recommend you to ask BT for the call barring option. It cost £1 something per month, but it will let you out of trouble regarding high phone bills and trouble to recover the money from your flatmates.

If your flat mate want to call, they use prepaid card and call the 0800 on the card, use their mobile or their skype

All the best

Dying & Leaving council property to an 18 yr old son



Bit of a strange situation here, 
A friend has recently found out he has bone cancer & has been given under a year to live. He has 3 children (he's divorced from their mother by the way) one has their own property the other 2 (both are males) are still at the moment living with their mother. The mother is happy for the youngest (age 18) to stay at home but asked the other one (age 21) to leave as she wishes to move to smaller property.



The father of the boys wishes to leave his council property to the youngest boy & is arranging to have the youngest boys name put on the tenancy.......however, the 21 yr old has now asked his father if he could live at his home as his mother has asked him to leave. The father has agreed to that but he's now worried as to where the youngest boy's legal rights would be in the event of the 21 yr old refusing to move out.

Geez! I hope this is making sense to you.

Basically can my friend even have it arranged for him to leave the property to his 18 yr old & what rights would the 21 yr old have after my friend dies.

I've been asked to see if I could do some research into this for my friend but can't find any info on google.

Would appreciate any feedback I could return.

BTW the 21 yr old has a good job & can afford to go private, the 18 yr old is just trying to start out having recently finished college.



</question>



<additional details>



I believe my friend is going to say the 18 yr old lives with him along with placing him on the tenancy.

Thanks for the input so far....I'll let him know



The flat is for a single person anyway....sorry! forgot to mention that.

A council tenant can't leave his tenancy to anyone.  The tenancy passes with the tenant, unless they are married and even then the surviving person may be moved into smaller accommodation.

You cannot deed what you do not own to anyone else,the property belongs to the council.The father may ask the council to consider his son being given the tenancy agreement,providing the son also applies and agrees.The council have the last word on tenancy but are usually very sympathetic to individual cases,but may downsize a single person.

I would phone up and check with the council about this one. I think that as long as the 18 yr olds name is on the tenancy agreement he could take over the rent when his dad dies. The 21 year old could stay there if the 18 yr old was happy to let him otherwise I guess he could get the council to evict him. The council may ask the 18 yr old to move to a smaller property too. If you don't want to ring the council you could ask the CAB.

You can't leave a council house to another person. It will be taken back by the council and placed back on the list of properties available for waiting families. Only under extreme circumstances will the council property be transfered to a relative/selected person.

You cannot 'assign' a Council House tenancy.  You can apply to have the tenancy transfered to another family member but your local council housing department could well consider that the 18 year old has no more right to the property than other people on the Councils waiting list. As neither of the boys are currently occupying the premises' officially as part of the tenant's immediate family I think that the most likely outcome is that the house will go back into the councils housing pool and will be offered to whoever is at the head of their waiting list when the houses' current official tenant dies. neither son has any right to a tenancy in the property, the father's only right is that of occupation whilst his own tenancy is in force. he is forgetting, it is NOT his house, it is in Public ownership, he merely rents it.
Some of the people answering are missing one of the most important aspects, neither of the two sons live in the house with the father so there is no evicting of them as a factor. Neither of the sons have ANY rights at all for being considered before people currently on the waiting list.

So long as your income now is provable and you have been in the position for between three to six months, and you did not incur any CCJ's you should be fine. If you job can cover the rent and you have no CCJ's you will pass the quite rudimentary credit checks that are done.
They may ask for a guarantor or you could offer an advanced payment upfront of three to six months rent if its within you scope to do so.

For easy access to/from the UK I'd recommend:
- Brittany
- Normandy, Caen.
- Le Havre
- Calais (there are better places though).

As for cheapest, I'm not sure as I've never looked into buying in France. However I would recommend you go on a short holiday to the above places, I have been to Brittany, Normandy, Caen and Calais, along with Nantes and a few regions in the south.

Here are some links to French homes for sale:
Normandy:

Brittany:

Caen:
http://www.enjoyfrance.com/directory/sub...

Calais:
http://www.1st-for-french-property.co.uk...

Nantes:
http://www.frenchpropertylinks.com/Paysd...



As for the best areas to buy in, Brittany is so scenic and beautiful, whereas Normandy's beaches aren't as clear BUT it is a very historical region, which is why it attracts so many American & English tourists. The weather in Normandy is similar to England, but there is SO much to do, so many museums to visit.
Calais is exactly like England, a lot of Brits go over there to get cheap alcohol, property seems to be slightly cheaper, but Calais isn't the best place to move to.

I'd highly recommend the Nantes area, it isn't close to the UK, but it is very sunny, gorgeous beaches, great shopping facilities and friendly people.

Good luck with the move.

Fastest growing area is Languedoc. It is cheaper than Paris and Provence, Cote d'Azur but has Mediterranean weather and lifestyle.

It is also easy to get to (60+ low cost flight routes). These days the flight and car rental costs are less than the ferry, fuel, tolls and hotel costs of driving down. And you are on the beach in 2 hrs !

Council housing/homeless?



My partner and I are separating, would I qualify for a council house? Or could I declare myself homeless (as I will be)? I don't earn much a month and I will struggle to pay rent for private lettings in my area.What help, if any, is available to me? We have no children.

Just to add, we own the property (jointly) that we are living in but neither of us can afford to pay the bills/mortgage etc. alone so it will be sold. This will leave us still in debt as we have not paid enough of the mortgage off to be covered by the house sale.

By all means you can go to the council and sign onto the housing list, but it will take a very long time for you to get a place through the council, probably looking a good year, depending on your area.
Reason for this, as there would be people on the housing list that are in more "need" of housing, such as mums etc.
You wouldnt be classed as homeless either, as technically you are making yourself homeless, and as you are working (even though not bring a lot of money in) so you do have ways and means of paying for your place.
Good Luck.

You should claim of the government as benefits. You should also try to save up all your money and don't spend it on unnecessary things that you don't really need.

You need to inform the council that you are going to be homeless, you then get placed into a homeless hostel and will be placed on priority housing, but you will still have to wait months for your own one bed flat.  Depsite popular belief you will not just be given a place straight away or even in weeks.

you probably will be entitled to housing benefit,  You need to start making enquires ASAP.



good luck.

You may be eligible to join the council waiting list, but as a single person with no dependants the chances of you getting a home are very slim.
You could also phone round housing associations but again, you are unlikely to get something.
Have a look in the local paper for flat shares.

having kids is not always the answer to getting a coucil house,i was the housing list for four and half years with a child under six and they left me to just doss around anywhere for that many years. so i went to the council, i went to all the places they sent me, in the end i had to register for homeless, and then to my suprise, or shock if im honest. they left me on homeless with my child homeless for another three years, 7 1/2 years they left me homeless, i slept on peoples sofas, spare beds for years. i had to private rent a few times, but as a single parent and the only one working it was hard to pay the amount required, i work full time. (it wasnt like i was asking to be housed in a posh area, or at least a nice area. i live in sheffield and i come from the most deprived area in sheffield, the houses are boarded up on most streets)

The council will leave you to rot if your a single person in britan. unless you go down there everyday and get people to support yoiu with letters etc, then they wont help you.



we just helped a friend get her house. but she was there every morning, she had supporting letters from doctors, citizens advice centers, plus from us- her freinds. we all have good jobs within the NHS, youth service and community projects, together we collectively wrote letters about her describing her as a person, what she would be like as a tenant and neighbour, her as a friend. they actually said that who ever wrote the letters got her the house. so its all about what energy and how much of it your willing to put in.

You haven't said who owned/rented the property you were living in before you separated. Also you must have been living somewhere before you formed your partnership and how long ago was that. It's unfortunate that the different reasons for homelessness aren't separated from one another. They range from intentional homelessnees, through accidental and beyond control homelessness to self inflicted homelessness. In my opinion only the middle category should have priority.

If you are over 18 and have no menal health problems or disabilities you will not be classed as homeless in priority need, so the Council do not have any statutory duty to help you under homeless legislation I'm afraid.  You could apply (as can anyone) and go on a waiting list but it may take a while and won't solve your immediate problem.

Some Councils have a rent deposit/ bond scheme to help you access the private rented sector - if you have nowhere, they will pay the bond for you or issue a certificate of guarantee to the Landlord, so the bond wont be a problem.  Then as you are on a low wage you could get help with rent through housing benefit - to see if you qualify just ring housing benefit up at the Council, or they should have an on-line benefit calculator.  Then if you qualify - even by just a little - ask about discretionary housing payments.  All Councils have a discretionary fund to top up housing benefit if you fall short of the rent level.  Not many people know about this fund as they dont advertise it, but trust me all Councils have this fund. The private rental sector should then be within reach.

Good luck.

you will go back to the mortgage advisor who will work out the mortgage for you, and once that goes through you can start to worry about surveys, stamp duty, fees and solicitors. I suggest if you dont have one already to get a solicitor, they do all the hard work for you, ie surveys and hips.
If your offer has been accepted you can sit back and relax, unless you get guzummped the house is yours!

Assume your in the UK.

The estate agent will send you the agreement in writing. They will also want details of your solicitor. Again check round for a good deal as prices do vary..

You need to shop around for a mortgage.
Try http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/

There are still plenty of deals out there. i found it cheaper to do the searching myself. A mortgage adviser does not do the job for free...
Look at the deal the adviser offers to see if its better than any you find your self.

Once you selected a mortgage company, you'll pay a deposit / fees etc.
They will carry out a survey, if they find anything wrong this gives you a second chance to haggle. After final agreement you arrange a day to exchange contracts and  move in.

Your next step, after you have a signed contract, is to start the loan process by giving the mortgage company your personal information.  Surveys and appraisals are done closer to your closing, since these folks don't get  paid if the loan doesn't close.  They will want to know that you are approved first.  Congratulations!

I don't know this part of Manchester but it seems a very good price for the size of the house. There is need of a little modernisation as it seems a bit old fashioned but the rooms look big, light and airy. I would not go much less than the asking price, why not have a valuation done and if it comes out at less than the asking price, offer them that.

Good luck.

If the estate agent actually puts "requires modernisation" on the ad, then it will need A LOT of work doing.  You can see from the pictures that it clearly requires redecorating and might want a new kitchen, but is there more than this to be done?  Is it in good structural shape?  What's the roof like?  What about the electrics - does it require rewiring?

I live in London so I'm not familiar with Manchester and the different areas and prices, but I think the price probably is quite reasonable.  But, make sure you're fully aware of what work needs to be done to it.  Get professional estimates for how much this work will cost, and make sure you're not biting off more than you can chew.  Remember though that if the problems are structural, it could be that the bank won't agree to mortgage it.

Before you make an offer, you need to ask what is meant by "requires modernisation." Maybe it's just the decor, maybe it's plumbing/ heating/ air. If you're okay with what they say, you should still have a home inspector evaluate it.

If your ex sets up a proper tenancy agreement with you and maintains the tenancy on a business level only, then you should be able to claim housing benefit.  Yes, the local council will need a full declaration of the situation and will need to look closer at it to ensure that it is not a contrived tenancy.  Problems may arise if your ex remains part of your life in any way, i.e. he pays some of your bills, he stays over, you act as a couple in any way, shop together etc. And remember, he has to agree to evict you, just like any tenant, should you not pay the rent. The benefit department would need to be convinced of that.  Under the new Local Housing Allowance laws, the rent must come to you and you have to be responsible to your landlord in full payment, ex partner or not. You may also not receive the full market rent so your ex has to set a rent that is fair. But the bottom line is that the situation cannot be contrived in any way .. that would be benefit fraud.  Steer well clear of that and I cannot see a problem .....

well providing you are splitting up and this is not just some way of getting more money coming in.
he would have to register as a landlord and you would have to provide proof that he's not living there or staying there.Chance are you will get one or 2 neighbours 'grass you up' and they will investigate, so it's not something you want to lie about, a women i know did something similar now she has a huge fine and criminal record.

My landlord has screwed shut the patio door at the back of my 3 bed semi private rent house, is it illegal?



His agents, Whitegates, put it on inventory, surely if it were an illegal fire hazard etc they would have noticed? My mother in law is convinced it is illegal to only have one exit/entrance on the property, this seems to ring true. I don't know though. Does anyone else? There is a fire escape window on the landing (the type of window which doesn't open at an angle so you can climb out easily) and everything else seems to be in order (we have relevant gas inspection papers etc). the patio/sliding door is screwed shut, maybe due to it being faulty or just a way to stop vandals/burglaries when it is empty. Can anyone help??



</question>



<additional details>



So we only have the front door as access. Sorry if I didn't make this clear!



I am in the UK btw.
Yeah, I was gonna get the fire officer around. When I lived alone in Council housing they came over to do a free check and told me not to block the back exit with a washing basket as it was fire safe, so I am certain having the doors screwed shut is worse. I have purchased a glass hammer which I keep in that room until the matter is resolved - I have 2 kids and another on the way and since my partner works nights, it is very worrying :/



I have just booked a free home assessment with the local firebrigade. Many thanks.

I am sure that this needs to be fixed. You can do a simple search in google for your state laws. I searched for rental property egress laws and found this site http://www.great-landlord-info.com/egres...

You should have two ways to exit the premises in case of emergency. I would ask the landlord to fix the door.

If there is no other exit to the back of the property downstairs then I think you might be right.  Our local firebrigade come round and do a free safety check on your property, I'm sure if you contacted your local station they would point you in the right direction if they do it for your area (added bonus of firemen in your house for an hour!!).  Also it could be worth telling your agency and find out if it was an oversight when you moved in.

Owning a second house to rent out regulations?

<answer>



Generate a PROFIT in the first year?  To generate a profit you have to have income exceeding outgoings. Your out going would be the whole cost of the house. Your income sure is not going to cover that.

If you are thinking of buying the property on a mortagage you will find buy to rent mortgages very hard  to get at the moment. The income you get from rents is taxed by the inland revenue so your net income is well less than the actual rents paid. Buying to rent is a long term thing, you hope to get an after tax rental sufficient to cover the mortgage payments so that your renters are effectively buying the house for you. It is a very long term thing.

I let properties and can tell you there is no specific cost.

London is massive and prices are different based on location, quality, decor, etc. It is usually not dependent on number of people.



What is affected by numbers is the Council Tax if more than 1person, Water if metered, Gas, Electricity, etc.

Generally, East London is slightly cheaper - between 750 - 1000. West London possibly 950 - 1300, Central 1300 - 3000.

I was in childrens homes as a youngster along with my brother. At the time it was the worst place on the planet. Some of the homes we were in turned out to be good fun though. went from assessment centre to homes in the cotswolds, moved to community home living with three other guys in south london, went to another home in hertfordshire, pretty cool, still in touch with others from there. It was a home with a school, gym, bandroom, swimming pool, football pitch and tennis court. So overall, not bad. As you get older you wish you used that time better though. It was the same at school, some people you got on with whlst others you simply kicked the feck out of! (not really)

In high school in Ontario, I patched up a few group home kids... hit by others, locked in or restrained by the adults, cutting, etc.

One girl, I stepped in and defended her when someone else was spoiling for a fight. She never was involved, me and the other girl fought (high school junk, mostly hair pulling and a couple of punches)

The other girl was suspended, I got an in-school suspension, sent to work in the library. The kid I was defending, who neither instigated nor took part in the fight, was grounded by her group home for a month, for being involved at all. No explanation... her name was associated, they came down hard. I remember being shocked... the two of us who actually hit each other were done in a few days and she was paying the price week after week.

They had locks on the cupboard and fridge doors... assumed all the kids were thieves, so nobody could go get a drink or muffin, etc. Lowest common denominator, I guess. All these kids, many removed from home for their own protection from an abusive or irresponsible parent, wound up treated as juvenile offenders and of course in that environment at an early age, lived up to the label pretty quickly by learning from each other. Peer pressure, frustration and now identified as problem kids... nowhere to go but down.

I lived in a children's home with religious affiliation for about two months or so. A person's experience within the home can vary depending on the reasons they're living there (traumatic loss of a parent can make adjusting difficult), age remains a factor, with younger children adjusting better, etc.

From personal experience, it was both relatively stable and yet difficult, too. You cannot, by definition, receive the normal kind of care and love from house parents that you would from family. For one thing, there are a lot of other kids there with often the same desire for attention. I hated it at the time, but there was a lot of factors involved. My younger brother, on the other hand, adjusted very well and (at least while he was still young) enjoyed living there. The children's home I was in was actually fairly good, looking back on it. They had fair rules you were expected to abide by, with incentives to do so. It's an extremely regimented life (you eat when and what they tell you, play when and where they tell you, sleep when they tell you, etc). But because there are also a lot of other kids in the home, a lot of this went beyond simple parenting and into a kind of unbearable lack of choice and freedom (if all you want to do is stay inside one day, or stay in your room another, you weren't given the option). The biggest problem, I think, was simply living with a lot of other girls my age (pre-teens and teens are so catty to each other sometimes). That and a certain amount of isolation (it's simply not a family environment).



So, yeah, I hated it. But it wasn't nearly as bad as state group homes (from what I've been told by friends). I suspect the children's home I was in was a bit like being in the Army - you did what you were told, didn't backbite and they'd treat you well (at least stateside, they will, ha).

With solicitors fees, you have their profesional fee, plus vat, miscellaneous fees, plus vat, and land registry fees, and search fees. Depending on if your a first time buyer, you could have stamp duty charges. Haggle with your solicitor about their professional fee, thats the only one you can almost control. I wouldn't give them anymore than 1100 plus vat. 
Valuation fee with the bank, which is refundable if you kick up. around 150
Structural surveyor, anything up to 500e, but can get cheaper.

Deposit for the house in the auctioneers, depends what they want, i bought my house for 175K and they wanted 3.5 in the auctioneers.
ring every solicitor in the book til you get a price your happy with. You'lll also need a '10%' deposit for signing of contracts, but you can negotiate this with the vendors. Ask them to accept your auctioneers deposit as a booking deposit, although with the current climate, not many vendors may accept it
Land reg fees you can't negotiate
Valuation is the set price by the relevant bank
Structural you can negotiate with the engineer.

Happy house hunting.

ok so you first of all need to find the property, do this by looking on the internet at local estate agents sites or by looking through the local paper and by going into the estate agents and asking what properties they have avaliable, they will probably put you on a mailing list to keep you informed of up and coming properties.

Once you have found a house that interests you, call the agency and ask to arrange a viewing on the property, they will then organise a time and date with you.

After your viewing you should think about whether or not you are interested in going further with the house and if so you contact the estate agents and tell them you would like to place an offer on the house.
The estate agent will negotiate with yourself and the vendor (person selling the property) to see if a price can be agreed upon!

Once the price is agreed you need to appoint a solicitor who will then carry out all the necessary paper work and checks to complete the sale of the property! 
Solicitors costs do vary dramatically so it is a good idea to ask the estate agent if there is any solictor locally that they would recommend and you can always call up local solicitors and ask for quotes!



If you require a mortgage it is a good idea to have an appointment with an advisor to see realistically what price of property you go for. Go to a few different mortgage advisors as they differ in what deals they can offer you.

If you are having a mortgage you have to pay for a survey which means a valuation will be placed on the property you are purchasing to ensure that the property will hold its value as a safety check for the lender.

Once the solicitor on your side and the vendors side are happy, an exchange and completion date will be set! Exchange is when the contracts are exchanged so you will have to sign them prior to this and completion is when all the monies get sent and you can have the keys!

A good website for looking at properties is www.rightmove.co.uk, you can search the area you want too!

Good luck in your search xxx

Help Please - My Landlord tell me yesterday to move out tomorrow! ?



Hello there,

I have just found out that the flat I have rented for the past five months is to be repossessed by the lender. I found this out last week when I received a letter addressed to "the occupier" at my address from a firm of solicitors representing the lender, stating that my landlord has defaulted on the terms of the mortgage and the court date has been set for 17th September.
I contact by email my landlord strait away, but he don't reply me back until yesterday.
He tell me "Unfortunately for various reasons I have not been able to stop the repossession of the apartment on 17th September and am currently making arrangements to have all my possessions moved out on Monday/Tuesday to comply with the Notice you have received."
dated 13 september  2008 15:28



He can do that? Is That Legal?

How am I supposed to find another house in 3 days? Its weekend and let agencies are close, and you cant find many private landlord in web sites on-line.
Where my 3 years old daughter is supposed to live if i can t find a house until tomorrow afternoon?



Please tell me if I can do anything else to sort out my big problem!



Thanks for your time!

See if you can find an email address for the lender's solicitor or the lender themselves; send them an email explaining your situation and politely as for an additional grace time, (say a 10 business days) to occupy the housed while you search for suitable housing for yourself and daughter.

Unfortunately quite a few tenants are finding themselves in this position. Following the credit crunch some landlords are finding it tough to keep mortgage payments up. It is deplorable that he has failed to inform you of this problem before it reached crisis point. You would have a strong case against him for damages but he probably doesn't have much money - otherwise he would have paid the mortgage. I fear that the only course open to you is to seek alternative accommodation as a matter of urgency. That is the obvious priority at the moment.

Unfortunately, I can not tell you whether that's legal or not, because I don't know. However, I cannot imagine that doing this to tenants is legal. Why don't you post a question asking if it's legal to get a notice to move out in just 3 days? I know you did, but some folks don't like to read long explanations and skip to the next question.

Do you have the possibility to move in with family and friends until you have found another place to stay? I am so sorry to hear all that. Perhaps you can sew your landlord for not giving you an earlier notice since this way you would have had lots of time to look for a suitable place. Perhaps, you won't have to pay part of your rent or even get reimbursed for a potential hotel stay. The best of luck.

Hi, first of all do you have a tenancy agreement? if you do, do you have something called a section 2 ground 2 notice. If so this protects you against this. By rights your landlord has to serve you a one months written notice, or check your tenancy agreement incase it states 2 months. but this is not legal. I would advise you speak to citzen advice. but I am a letting agent and this is the law in england not sure if wales have the same law.

First of all, stop panicking!  You have not even had a legal eviction notice yet.  Don't bother about CAB for this, phone your local council and talk to the Private Tennants Officer who will be able to help and give you the correct information.  Do this NOW!!  Get down to your local council and get on the housing list and show them the letter so they can begin to sort it out.

Someone might come out to see you today or arrange an emergency appointment.  As this is not your fault.  it is very very important that you do not leave the property or you could be seen as making yourself intentionally homeless.  The council will put you into temporary accommodation again, don't panic!  Usually, when you have small children this is a temporary flat until they can find you somewhere permenant.



Yes, you will have to leave but not for at least two months.  Do not pay any more rent until you know your position.  It is very unlikely you will get your deposit back - unless it has been put into the Assured Deposit Scheme so that could be lost money.



Do attend the court tomorrow as they need to know that there is a tenant who has not even been given the correct notice.  I suspect the mortage company are trying it on as so many do not know the law.

Edit:  Please do not go and live with friends and family.  Although this is tough on you at the moment, it just could be a blessing in disguise.  You have a young child and need security.  Your best interests and your child's would be to be in a property where you know you are not going to have to go through this again.  Let the council help you now.  You are one of the people who are not taking the pi**.

It is legal. The interests of the mortgagee (lender) over-reach the interest of the landlord and you as tenant upon reposession. The bailiffs will arrive at the house on the morning of the repossession, remove you and change the locks. You will be given seven days to remove your belongings but have to make an appointment to enter the property to do so.

The only way to do that is to get the mortgage holder in on the deal so that you have some protection. There needs to be an attorney present during the closing, do not do a "brother in law" deal where you say you trust him and so forth. 
If he is not willing to have an attorney present or have the mortgage holder involved then I would not do it.

You and everybody else!

Basically houses are overpriced.



Due to cheap money for a few years, excessive immigration (needing housing), shortage of houses due to Government incompetence, demand exceeds supply, therefore as with any scarce commodity prices rise.



Houses are unaffordable on normal criteria (typically 90% mortgage based on 3 - 3.5 times salary).  Therefore to keep making money by giving mortgages the banks/building societies have had to stretch the limits by inventing ways to give people 5- 6 times salary.

The day of reckoning has come because the same thing in the USA has resulted in huge bad debts which had been re-packaged and sold (as high profit / high security investments) around the world.

So houses are now falling in value until they reach a more affordable ratio of  salary earnings/house price.



The banks have no money to lend at present as they are all up to their  eyes in bad debts and will not lend to each to each other either!

Assume 4/5 years before everything stabilises with prices at a much lower level and mortgages are available.

If you have cash (or can get a mortgage promise because you have a big deposit) now is a good time to buy a house by offering silly prices!  Someone is going to be so desperate they will take 25% less than they are asking!

Hope this simplified summary helps!

UK housing prices are at record low since the housing slump of the 1990’s. The current housing market crash has been driven by the low availability of credit for new mortgages. Conversely, high levels of unemployment and high interest rates caused the low housing price reported in the fourth quarter of 1990. Regardless of the reasons behind the housing crunch, reports suggest that cost of housing in the UK is not expected to rise any time soon. Rather, speculation is that the prices will continue to fall on average 2% per month, making any quick recovery from this slump unlikely.

The reported annual fall of housing prices has reached 10.9%; the first time a price decline of this intensity has happened since the 1983, which was the last time price decline was in the double digits. This decline began first with price drops in the London housing market, with the price of prime country real estate, and other rural areas soon following. The decline in the market price of UK housing stems from many different factors, these are factors currently that are also affecting the overall UK economy.

The leading cause of the housing crunch comes from a shortage of Mortgage Finance available in the UK. After the United States experienced a large amount of defaults on sub-prime mortgages, the mortgage approval process became much stricter worldwide. In addition to the lack of credit available, the ratio of housing prices to income is at an all-time high, and most first-time buyers are unable to afford housing prices despite their all-time low.

That is pretty much the definition of part exchange, yes. They will normally offer below the market value, but you will have the bonus of a guaranteed sale, no chain and a completion date that suits you, so if that's a trade you can afford to make then go for it and good luck.

Yes it works.  I did the same thing a few years ago and it saves a load of hassle in selling your house and paying estate agent fees.  The key thing is to make sure you get a good deal and know what your house is worth as they will try and offer you as little as they can.  Get a few realistic prices from estate agents to get a good idea and ask where the price really is - no point getting an aspirational sales price from them that no-one will pay.  The other key thing to remember is that the main thing that really matters to you is the relative price difference between the two houses not so much the price that each is going for so make sure you work both sides of the deal - there is no point getting a high price for your house if you dont get an appropriate discount on the house you are selling.  Just ensure you are realistic overall, its a tough market they want to sell (but will be finding it hard to) and you want to buy but be realistic about what your place is worth.

Some house builders will. This is a depressed market and you will get less from the house builder than on the open market, even now. Remember, the house builder knows that he has to dispose of your property in a bad market and will build in a risk factor to avoid possible loss. My guess is that you would be offered 10 - 15% less than market value.

It is different in all cases.

A true studio should be completely self contained, like mine.

However, some of the more 'enterprising' landlords convert a two-storey house into two seperate flats, to maximise rent, and this can be where you have a shared bathroom.

If in doubt, arrange a viewing.

Normally it is acres but this is to be banned under a new EU directive from  January the 1st 2010 to land being sold or registered. It will then have to be sold or registered in hectares to bring the UK in line with other EU countries. Madness!

a realistic offer is a combination of what you think it's worth to you and how much you can afford.

unless you HAVE to have it, hang on for a while, it'll go for less than 229 eventually

I am thinking of part exing my property for a new build. However, as I do not have more money to put down as a deposit, I was wondering, do you think the new build company would accept the equity in my house as a deposit?

Any suggestions greatly appreciated.

How can I prove that my apartment is too loud?



I live in Los Angeles, I moved into a 2 unit building.  My upstairs neighbor aren't loud, but because I live in an old building, I can hear everything.  I feel like the building was never soundproofed, because I hear their conversations, their TV, their microwave go off and of course their footsteps.  I'm up every morning when they're up. I spoke to my land lord about it, and he said he never had any complaints about this.  I had friends spend the night, they were woken up by footsteps.  I spoke with my neighbors but I can't ask them not to talk to each other anymore.  What can I do about this if my landlord pretends everything is perfect, when it's not?

It may not be perfect, but it is what it is.



The building was built to codes of the time period in which it was built.



There is not much that the landlord can do and he is not required to soundproof.

It's an old building and the noise you describe is considered normal in older multi family home.

maybe, if people already have mortgages and they can't afford them the rents may go up though, also renting isn't going to be so safe as landlords may have their buy to let properties repossessed - if things get worse, I'd go for it now.

Most likely, the opposite will happen. It's the law of Supply and Demand. With two million homes in foreclosure that's a lot of people who are no longer homeowners but will have to rent. More demand for rental housing tends to drive rents up. We're in a recession too, so that could tend to negate some of that effect. It's highly unlikely rents will drop, however.

The opposite due to supply and demand.

More people are going to be re-possessed/divorced/have to move due to job change etc.



Also the supply of new houses is now virtually nil and it is impossible to move as you can't get a mortgage therefore rents are liable to rise!

I am a real estate professional in NJ ans I will tell you that lower home prices usually mean higher rents.  Home prices are low but banks are really strict on who they will give a mortgage to.  That being said there is a high demand for rental properties right now and with the demand high, rents that are charged will be high.



That's why if you can, this is the best time to buy a home.

no.  rent will go up for the following reasons:

1.  increased competition and scarcity of apartments.  all of those people who can now not qualify for mortgages have to live somewhere, right?



2.  decreased equity, increased property taxes, utilities, and fuel mean that landlords must absorb additional expenses.  those expenses will be passed off to the renter.



renting and buying are converse forces.  when the house market rebounds (and it will eventually), you will see rent decrease.

If you there are a large number of empty rentals rent will drop, if there few rentals price goes up.  It may or may not depend on the sale price of homes.



Like others have said those who lose their homes have to rent, those who can't qualify have to rent.  Those two factors should create a greater demand, lower the supply and raise prices.

Supply and demand applies to EVERYTHING.

For those that complain about greedy landlords the way to fix it is become a home owner instead of a renter.  I own rental and taxes went up so I will raise my rent.  The bottom line is the bottom line.  We are in business, and just like anyother business we want to make a profit.  As for quailty of homes going down that is usually the fault of those living in the home.

As greedy as landlords always are, rent goes up every year and quality of housing goes down. Two years ago I was paying a comfy $400 a month for a two bedroom house. Now I cant find anything less than $700 for a tiny 2 bed apartment. Ridiculous.

The mortgage loan crisis is forcing millions to lose their homes. When that happens they move from being home owners to finding a place to rent. It's the law of Supply and Demand. This causes the demand for rental housing to go up, hence prices will probably go up. There is a recession, however, so that could negate that effect. Hard to tell when it will end but I do believe the end is in sight.`

There are several effects. The net of all these seems to be a short-term sharp downward spike in rental prices. Rental prices will probably inch up as housing prices do.

1) People who lose their home need to rent one. (Pushes rental prices up.)

2) People who can't sell their home may try to rent it out. (Pushes rental prices down.)

3) People who might have rented a home, but have money, may now buy one because they're so cheap. (Pushes rental prices down.)

4) People who buy cheap homes for investment purposes may rent them out until the market recovers. (Pushes rental prices down.)

5) People who shouldn't be buying homes but might have done so due to predatory lenders now can't get suckered into buying homes. (Pushes rental prices both ways.)

And so on.

End of Lease.. NEED HELP! Does this automatically go to a month to month tenancy?



Okay, so..
We are closing on a house on 9/30.
Our yearly lease for our apartment ends on 9/30.
The yearly lease requires a 60 day notice to vacate the property.
I called the management company for over a month and a half because I wanted to know if they would be able to prorate a week after the 30th so that we would be able to move all of our things into the new home and clean our apartment as necessary.
The lease manager NEVER called me back, and I finally had to ask to be put on hold for a good 30 minutes before I could speak to the property manager.
Because I waited to speak to them about the prorate issue before I sent them a 60 day notice, that time has passed and I am required to move onto a month to month lease which is $150.00 more than our rent. ($300.00 more than our mortgage)
I know this may have been stupid on my part for expecting the leasing manager to call me back in a timely manner after I left her NUMEROUS messages.
but, Our lease states that if we fail to vacate at the end of the lease, WITH a required 60 day notice, then if they accept rent we will be deemed a month-to-month tenant. This also states that we can terminate the month-to-month lease as of the last day of any calendar month by giving one month's written notice. So, I figured that if we paid them rent, we could just give 1 months notice to vacate the property (which is still 1 months worth of rent we wouldn't have had to pay had the lease manager called in a timely manner)
Today, I called the rental office to find out the exact amount we would have to pay for October. They said that we would have to come down and sign a month to month lease(which we weren't informed of) to be deemed month-to-month residents. FINE. Except the small detail that we would have to give a 60 day notice to vacate the property when we decide to leave. 
I really don't know what to do, I know I obviously made mistakes by not providing them a 60 day notice when I was waiting for their call, but now we are stuck in a situation we absolutely cannot afford because if we do sign the new month to month lease, we need to pay for October and November. November is when we start making mortgage payments too!
I mean I know I may sound like a shady resident, but this place is horrible! There were things when we moved in that needed to be fixed, and the maintenance crew didn't even come to fix until July and we moved in August of '07. Not to mention there have been times when the Maintenance people came and didn't even knock.. Our water was shut off today even though it's suppost to be included in the rent payment.. and I have an infant son.. I need water to wash and prepare his bottles! I am just so fed up with their shoddy performance of management and although I'm trying to get out of here as soon as possible, I'm also trying to do it by the book as well.

Is there anything we can do that anyone would suggest??

<additional details>



It's also stipulated in the lease that if we move to a month-to-month tenancy that we would only have to give a 30 day notice.

I realize that the 60 day notice is my fault but they are saying that in order to be a month-to-month tenant I will have to sign a new lease stating I will be a month-to-month tenant which I did not know.. It seems like from my lease I would automatically be deemed a hold-over tenant and only be required to give a 30 day notice to vacate.



I CAN'T sign a 1 months lease and give a 30 days notice from there because they said that if I sign a 1 month's lease, then I'll be required to give a 60 day notice.

DO NOT SIGN THE NEW LEASE for the M2M tenancy.

The only thing it does is require you to give 60 days notice.  You don't have to sign a new lease.



If you don't you automatically become a M2M tenant under the terms of the original lease except that the 60 day notice becomes ineffective because you are a M2M tenant.  Give them written notice by certified mail that you will not be signing a new lease and that you will be out on October 31st.  (You can turn in keys earlier but still owe rent till then).

It's all in the fine print..  just like you said.. YOU made a mistake... Never try to make a verbal deal anyways... they can just say you never called..  Since you didn't let them know in writing 60 days prior.. you'll have to do a month to month.. so you'll have 60 days from when you get them that letter..which means... having to pay for two months you won't even be there.. Technically,  they can take you to court over this... since it's stipulated in your lease.. and you didn't follow through... they'd win.... sry..

They may forget about it if you can get someone to rent it out asap so they don't lose any money...

Get a consultation with a lawyer - it sounds like you should be on a month-to-month lease with 30 day notice as per the terms of your agreement and that they are trying to get you to sign something less to your favor.

Your present lease should govern. They cannot MAKE you sign a new lease. You should go by the terms of the old lease where it talks about month-to-month tenancies. State your intentions IN WRITING and keep copies of all of it. Let them take you to court if they want but it will not be worth the hassle for them.



The only sticking point I could see is that you have given them termination notice, so they could argue that they were honoring the termination you gave them and try to kick you out early. However they can't argue both that you gave them notice AND that you didn't give them notice. It has to be one or the other.

Can my late mother's creditors place a lien on MY property?



I bought a HUD home that needed fixing.  My (late) 86 yr old mom came to live with me.  She had no property and her only income was Social Security.  The HUD home needed some fixing up and the company that did some work said they worked with a credit company that would loan the money to do the work.  I asked if my mom and I could get a joint loan (I am disabled and my credit is not great).  They refused a joint loan BUT gave my mother (86 yrs old) a loan on her own (she had NO assetts, nor any estate - clothes on her back and nothing else).  She died unexpectedly (as if an 86  yr old woman's death is TOO unexpected but her last check up 1 month before the loan showed her to be in "good health", no imminent death even considered).  Now, I OWN the house, I am the only one on the mortgage, my mother did not have ANY interest in my home except that she lived with me for a very short time and she had no assetts..BUT the loan company wants ME to pay for the loan!  Can they get away with this?  Everything done was done in good faith!



</question>



<additional details>



the WORKMEN (COMPANY) got paid in full - this was a "credit card" type company that gave my mother the loan.  I wanted to be responsible and co-sign the loan but they would not permit it!  They - the credit card people - have offered to "settle" with lower and lower amounts, but if I don't have any extra money.  My mother did make payments until her unexpected (and for me tragic) death.  Just as an aside, (and very poor joke!) that same credit card company keeps sending me offers to give me a credit card!!!!!!!!!!!



no lien has yet been placed...they are just threatening - and they do keep saying that her credit will be ruined.  And, since I don't plan on leaving this home, unless it is feet first, does this lien really matter?

Your story is a little hard to follow but if I understand it right the company which actually did the work on the house was paid in full by an unsecured loan your mother took out.  You are not a co signer of the loan. If that is correct then they would not be able to put a lien on your house since the loan is unsecured and in your mothers name only.

Sounds like they placed a mechanic's lien on your house. Check if the loan is to her personally or on the property as well.

You may also want to check if there was an insurance policy on the loan that pays some of the balance.

Almost certainly, yes.  The work was performed on your property regardless of who contracted with the vendor.  Also, let's be honest... you were the one that wanted the work done so ethically you should pay for it.

Just in case I am missing something here, and the work was actually on your mother's behalf without your consent...  If you have not missed your opportunity to do so, see if your state allows you to file a "Notice of Non-responsibility" for the work performed.  Frequently a tenant/occupant of a property will hire workers without the involvement of the true property owner, and a notice of non-responsibility is the true owner's way of putting the contractor on notice that the property should not be liened for work performed on behalf of the tenant.

Go see an attorney, ASAP.



What are terms of loan your mother got?  Normally, can't get a home improvement loan for a property without being an owner, in title.  So if this was HELOC, and lien on your property, you're liable.  But seems strange, as if she's NOT in title, shouldn't be able to lien your property.  They may have screwed up.  If it was just a personal loan--can't understand why anyone would do so, give loan to 86 year old.  Now if they gave a loan for work on the house, and they weren't paid, the workmen can impose a mechanic's lien, and again, you could be held liable for that.

Not to be unsympathetic, but YOU are reaping benefits of loan, living in home which was improved, and YOU really should be liable for repayment.  Acting in good faith, ethically  and morally, you'd be repaying them.  You being disabled is irrelevant.  Contractors did work and deserve payment.  You got benefit and should pay.  They're not "trying to get away with" anything other than payment owed them for work they did in good faith.  Suggest you rent out a room in the house and use rent to pay this loan off.  The longer you delay and fight them, the higher the amount owed becomes.

If the company did work on the house, they need to be paid for the work they performed "in good faith". You are living in the house and enjoying the work they did, right? Did you really think it was free?



What they can do is place a lien on the property which will have to be paid when the house is sold, or auctioned. It's called a Mechanic's Lien and it will be the first thing paid after the outstanding mortgage and taxes. It was adjudicated because of people who try to shirk their responsibilities, and avoid paying hard working contractors for their time and materials.

I'm amazingly ignorant here because I'm new to the UK and have been away for over a year.

As long as u can keep up with the payments, it's safe. Property values in Scotland have held better than those in England and certainly far better than in the states. You may find if u bought say in the last 2 years (2006) and were able to borrow 100% that u are in slight neg equity or ur equity has dropped. This would only be of any concern if u were seeking to raise a loan based on the value of ur home or selling it on the market. There's a free site u can register on..think its called www.housepricespy.com which will tell u the current selling prices of the houses in ur street.

Sure, that can happen but not for the reason you've mentioned. If there's a mistake (or fraud) in the loan application this could happen. However, it's extremely unlikely WaMu's situation will affect the loan. WaMu is still in the business of making money so it will want to close this loan.

If WaMu does go under the loan will just be sold to another bank. Mortgages are investments (just like stocks and bonds) to big investors so they're bought and sold all the time, even when banks are in good shape. So you can relax. You have nothing to worry about.

Yes, in fact sometimes a lender will make a final phone check to make sure all the facts are still right and if something changes, they can cancel it.



If you are buying your first home and you qualify I wouldn't be too concerned.  WAMU isn't going out of business anytime soon.  If they decide to pull loans because they run out of money (not likely) then they are more likely to pull your friends loan on the second home.  A home for a second home is a riskier loan.

Probably. At some point, the bank makes a formal commitment to make the loan. Before this, they can pull out just because they changed their mind. After this, they have to provide some justification, but unfortunately they can usually find some justification if they really don't want to make the loan.

I'd advise your friend not to waste any time completing the loan.

what do you mean charge?
where is this prop?

recover?

ARE you using British terms?

seek a title company report on the property.
if needed, hire a real estate attorney since your

Hello Every body,



I live in the US and i really have never seen goodness shown to me this
much in my life as i am a struggling mum with three kids and i have been going
through really rough times in my life and my name is Helen
Peters and in all this hard times, a worse incident occured in my life as i
lost my job which was my only means of survival and things became really bad as
i had bills to pay and my last son suffered a knee injury incurred when he fell
from a tree house and the doctors informed me that he needed a surgical
operation for his knee so he could walk again and at this point, life was
useless to me as i have no family and no one to run to and each night, i will
sit down and cry till the break of dun until one day, i read an advert on yahoo
answers of man that stated that he could help people in my shoes with loans and
in my desperate situation, i had no choice but i had to try and so shocking and
suprising, it was like an impossibility becoming a reality, i got a loan of
$75,000 USD even with my bad credit within 48 hours and my sons surgery was done
and thank GOD it was successful and now, i am okay and living in comfort with my
kids and i said to my self, i have never ever seen this kind of wonder in life
and i decided i will tell it to the whole wild world and i need every one to
thank GOD for Mr Patrick Harvey, the man GOD used to rescue me and my family
even when all hope had been lost and gone and i will say to every one, no matter
how dark and sinful the world is today, there are still GOD fearing and reliable
people on earth and if you are in my former situation or require a loan
legitimately, i will advice you contact this loan lender and you can reach him
via patrickharvey12@yahoo.com and i want you all to pray for this man for me.

Yes. If you put them up, especially using nails, you could cause damage to the wall that will need to be repaired. The cost of that repair will be deducted from your deposit.

You can get mirrors which you can attach to the wall without nails, plus you can get stand alone mirrors as well. So there are alternatives to knocking holes in the walls

The best thing you can do is negotiate with him. Wait a couple of months until he trusts you and then ask him again. Once he knows you are trustworthy, he will be more amenable to the idea

Yep, his house, his rules.



Mention the lack of bathroom mirror, say you are willing to purchase one (that you'll take when you move) but you would like him to arrange it's fitting - he may charge you stupid money for this though.

Most landlords have such clauses in the contracts after tenants bashed up nails and hung pictures, moved out and left great big holes in the walls.

if it's in the lease, he's perfectly within his rights to do so.  too many holes means hours upon hours of spackling, sanding, painting, etc.  that sux big time.  your best bet might be to play ball with him on this (or get those hooks that don't mark up walls).  otherwise, you can bet that he's going to dock your security deposit for each and every hole...especially since he specifically told you "no".

Basically you cant hammer in nails into the wall or use anything that will ahrm the wall (like blu tack..even though that wouldnt hold up a mirror) you can buy special hooks that stick to the wall with a strog adhesive that wont hurt the wall and will support a mirror. You can find these at any hardware store.

Well thats why he has put that in the contract. I would be careful though because if you do this, you wont be damaging the walls but it is still a breach of your contract and if the guy was a bastard he could fine or evict you.

The contract between a landlord and a tenant may specify certain conditions that must/may be observed by each party. This may include as you say not affixing anything including extensions to the building. But there are necessary conveniences that are important for comfortable and peaceful enjoyment of the property which include mirrors, portraits, pictures e.t.c. This should not be denied otherwise you will be residing in the premises without enjoying your peace hence denying you some of your rights as a tenant. You therefore can affix pictures and mirrors using adhesives and not nails e.t.c.

mirror is a tough one, but pictures can be put up using 3M products available from most supermarkets and hardware stores. ask if he will allow this, also offer to demonstrate that it will not leave any residue. 
i have never asked, i've just done it and theres never been any problems after i moved out cause they can't tell, they're that good.
i've even used nails and painted over the hole, most landlords leave a touch up can of paint in the linen closet or garage.

While it’s the landlord place and thus the landlord can establish the house rules, within the scope of your state’s statute/ case law, I believe the landlord is a control freak and is whacked.



Every landlord hates to have to repair and repaint the walls but at the same time a little common sense if you are seeking a long term tenant which is the goal for all landlords, then you want that tenant to feel as much at home as possible, not saying every square foot should have a hanging picture etc, but not to even have a mirror in the bathroom

Hey that is why they collect a security deposit



Tell the landlord you need mirror in the bathroom, if the landlord balks put one up. Let the landlord go in front of a judge and argue that is a material breach of the lease, the Judge will laugh that landlord right out of court

Pretty much so. He's obviously had the place trashed by a previous tenant and it's cost him money. A bathroom mirror is a very reasonable request though. Why don't you ask him to fix one up for you? Perhaps offer to buy it yourself.

They can refuse to let you put holes int heir walls, which is fair enough. You can get hooks from 3M though, they are put up with a sticky part which does not damage the walls. But basically, if you want a house in which you can do anything you want, buy one, until then, deal with it. 
And by the way, of course he is allowed to do that, he owns the house.

you read and signed a contract(or you should have read it more thoroughly)that stated these rules,so you don't have a leg to stand on.If you do put things on the wall and when you signed you said,you wouldn't,you will be in breach of contract and could even get evicted,for the breach.Talk to him and ask him to put one up if you pay for the fittings.Many homes have had a lot of damage done by thoughtless tenant's,who knock holes in walls,or use tape or horrors of horrors use glue.The landlord them has to redecorate,fill in holes and repaper and even carpet again,now you being the next tenant would rent accent a rent rise to pay for this damge or does it have to come out of his pocket,as often the deposit paid does not always cover damages caused,think of it from his side to.My brother rented his house out and lived at his partners house,not only were they always late with the rent,my brother had to pay hundreds out of his small pocket to repair the damage to house and garden.

he is allowed to do this. If its in the contract. We had this in our contract, but there were already things like bathroom mirrors up. Ask him why he is so objecting to putting up a bathroom mirror, if he says he doesnt want you doing it, ask him to put one up! its a simple and fair request, but he is legally within his rights to say you can't.

Yes he can.

Nail holes are generally pretty cheap to fix though. If you just leave it, it will count against your security deposit, or just fix it yourself before you leave if it's not a big hole.



Having said that, if yours is a situation where the landlord inspects your area on a regular basis, if he notices everything on the wall then he does have a right to demand that you take them down, and to consider you in breach of the lease and even evict you. Most would not but some are just jerks.

What are the specifics of month to month renting?



We are currently moving and had a six month lease that expired in May of 2008.  So we were assuming we were on month to month because they keep accepting our rent.  So we want to move in October, but in the lease it said that if we are paying month to month, then we have to get 60 day notice.  I don't want to have to pay two months worth of rent when I'm not going to be living here.  Now even though the 6 month lease said something to that affect, it is basically expired.  Wouldn't that make it null and void and would fall on the Utah law of month to month which is 30 days notice of vacancy but the landlord has the right to raise the rent every month?

The lease has wording to the effect that the 6 month lease converts to a month to month upon expiration, all other terms and clauses remain in effect. You are required to give 60 days notice.

The state law is the minimum required notice, the notice period can be longer as long as it is stated clearly within the lease.

I think it already happening, although it can be argued that at the moment much of this is a correction caused by overinflation, which can be attributed to short-sighted government policy and encouragement from the so-called "property porn" programmes (Location Location Location, Property Ladder, A Place In The Sun - you know the ones).

However a full-blown "crash" will probably only occur when the number of repossessions skyrockets to mid-90s level, when negative equity starts to kick in for people who have owned properties for 3-4 years or more.

I have sold a house 4 times over the years and took the policy that everything is negotiable. Typical costs are 2.5% of the selling/sold price.
I have never paid more than 1.75%. I just say that if they wish to sell my house they accept the price I say and not assume that I will accept theirs. I start low and finally suggest that a further 0.25% is available an offer is made within 30 days and sold to that buyer. 
You are always in the driving seat as it is your house. Stick to your guns and you will get a good price. Also you can use the reductions to contact other agents to get the price even lower.

I would look to the agents that are active and know your neighbourhood. They are the ones with clients calling them to search for a home in that area.

The cheapest price for the sale of your home results in the agent cutting corners or providing a lack of service and marketing.

The most successful agents are not the ones working for free.  Technology is changing and we as an industry need to embrace it.

They are looking to mess you about - I doubt if they will even
 check your references.

I always check references before I entrust my property to a tenant.  I want to know if their job is stable, how they cared for their previous homes/apts., and how they pay their bills.  I also want to know if they engage in illegal activity.

If you are a responsible person, you have nothing to fear from this process.

They check to see if everything on the application is true. They check your credit/criminal history.
