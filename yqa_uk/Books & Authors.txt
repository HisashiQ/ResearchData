Opinions bad/good please?



Notice how she doesn't send you her thoughts in sound anymore?
Yes I do...
Notice how she does not send you written feelings anymore?
Yes I do...
What can you do about this?
A lot of things but the results will mean nothing.
What do you think?
I believe that this is how love is, it comes to you inevitably and without warning, it strikes the heart, conquers it, makes itself comfortable inside, sleeps well and when the morning light bothers its eyes leaves without a saying,  a note on the table or a good-bye kiss on the forehead while you sleep. Nothing sweet to leave behind just the dull loneliness and the silence of the room that you both used to sleep in, reminiscing on every single moment that at that time did not seem so special but now that you cannot experience them again you feel like screaming at the sky in hopes that it will scream an answer back or at least make the clouds mad and receive a lighting so that this pain and agony will perish.
What do you feel?
I cannot truly describe all of my feelings as they are deep inside and unreachable, the pure sight of my face can describe everything, the pose of my body, my staring at the floor and if you look deep into my eyes you would find yourself falling into a bottomless abysm where the dark is pitch black and the coldness hurts the bones, you will feel my torment and mourn with me as well, but I do not wish for you to feel what I feel.
So why do you love?
I do not love anymore, and for that I am about to perish, we have to love someone or at least something in order to keep living and keep going forward, love took us to where we are at the moment, if you did not love asking questions so much you would not be here at this moment asking them to me, and the answer to all of your questions should be "love", love or be loved, it does not matter, as long as love is present in your life your blood will be warm, your heart will keep pumping and your lungs will still drink the air outside, love, be loved or perish like me...

What do you think of this plot?



Title: "The Rich & Poor"
This story is basically about a teenage girl just out of high school who had to take care of her little brother since her parents died. Now there is the guy across the street who secretly has feelings for her and helps take care of her. He is in his mid 20's. He has helped her out since her parents died. Anyways rich guy comes in the picture and finds her interesting and soon ends up falling for her. Now his parents are all like some poor street rat, where too high powered for that so he makes up an excuse and says that her little brother is his son and they have been together secretly for a long time which causes trouble and drama for the mid 20's guy and himself. Soon she tells the truth because she's not that type of girl to lie and things have to end.



But I'm thinking of a sequel about she had a kid w/ him but the she says that it's the mid 20 year old guys kid.



So I need help too maybe change it up a bit if it doesn't sound good or interesting, things you might think that she be added in? Names and suggestions? Plz I need help with this one. XI

What should I title my book? ?



Haha....I've asked this question about 300 times but I'll ask it again....
I need some help coming up with a name for my book. It is temporarily called The Violet Eyes but I would like something a little better. Okay, I'll post a link for the first five chapters of it . I want the name to be a little gloomy but beautiful in a strange way.



http://www.fictionpress.com/s/2581604/1/...



Here is a summary, though I would so much rather you jsut read the book becasue I suck at summaries and reading the book will help you get a better gist of the kind of mood I want to set:
The book is about a girl named Lily who has just escaped from a school that trains witches from birth to be cold-blooded killers. She meets a young man and begins to fall in love with him but then realizes that he is a vampire and that she has been trained to kill him her whole life. The young man sees her eyes (they are violet, the sign of a witch) and begins to attack her. Lily doesn't fight back becasue she feels that she deserves it and she lets him bite her (she becomes sort of a half-vampire, she is only a vampire at night and she bites herself rather than hurt anymore innocent people) So then a Master at the school that she jsut escaped from tries to kill the vmapire and Lily throws herself in front of him and gets injured really badly. She collapses and William pulls her into her arms and kisses her becasue she just saved his life. Um...when she wakes up he is gone but she still has feeling for him...and a bunch of other stuff happens.
Thank you, and sorry for that horrible summary



Oh, I almost forgot, I recently discovered that there is already a book called Violet Eyes, so, yeah......That one is out



</question>



<additional details>



Before someone says something, let me clear one thing up...THIS IS NOT A TWILIGHT RIPOFF! Just becasue a story includes a freakin vampire doens't mean that that person stole the idea from Stephenie Meyer. There were plenty of stories invloving vampires before Twilight and there will be many after. Now if William (the vampire) sparkled, had no fangs, attacked animals, was pale nad beautiful then that would be a Twilight ripoff. If Lily was clumsy, blushed alot, and hted parties then yes that would be a Twilgiht ripoff! Sorry I blew up liek that but it jsut really ticks me off that people judge you before they even have read the whole story. And another thing, I started writing this ages before I'd even heard of Twilight.....



Oh! I'm sorry, I totally did not mean you. I know that you weren't callign it a Twilight ripoff, I jsut wanted to make sure that no one did. Thank you for your honesty and sorry for the misunderstanding. Also thanks for calling it an accomplishment. To be quite honest, I'm a little tired of the vmapires myself, but I promised myself that I would finish this one and I am sticking to it

Edit: Woah there, chill out. I never said that you were writing a "Twilight rip-off". I just think that the whole forbidden vampire love story is a little bit over done. Still, it's good that you have written five chapters on it already, that is a huge accomplishment.

Eragon-Angelas Prophecy?



What do you think it means when it says in the prophecy when angela tells Eragons fortune when she says that at a time he will leave Alagaesia and never return, where do you think he will go? I think he will go to the island to the north-east where the riders used to life, what do you think?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I think he will either go there, or just to Ellesmera, and stay there with the elves. I think that seems like a pretty cool place, and in Eldest, the second book, he seemed to like it there. Although, he might go to that island, too. It's obvious he has to go there sometime in the series, and it seems like a good place for him to finish. I'm not sure, one of those two places. If he and Arya end up together, which I have no idea if they will, he might go to live with the elves, if not I'd say at that island, I can't remember what its called.

That would be stealing from Stephenie Meyer because she is not giving the book away for free.



Yes pirates have stolen Stehenie's books before. But if you read her book on a pirate website, you are a pirate too.



" In a civil suit, an infringer may be liable for a copyright owner's actual damages plus any profits made from the infringement. Alternatively, the copyright owner may avoid proving actual damage by electing a statutory damage recovery of up to $30,000 or, where the court determines that the infringement occurred willfully, up to $150,000. The actual amount will be based upon what the court in its discretion considers just. (17 U.S.C. 504)



Violation of copyright law is also considered a federal crime when done willfully with an intent to profit. Criminal penalties include up to ten years imprisonment depending on the nature of the violation. (No Electronic Theft Act, 18 U.S.C. 2319)"

Help about INVICTUS of William Ernest Henley?



Invictus
-William Ernest Henley



Out of the night that covers me,



Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be



For my unconquerable soul.



In the fell clutch of circumstance



I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Beneath the bludgeoning of chance



My head is bloody, but unbowed.



Beyond this space of wrath and tears



Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years



Finds and shall find me unafraid.



It matters not how strait the gate,



How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate:



I am the captain of my soul.



Help me explain each stanza pleeeaaaaaaasssseeeeeeeeeeee...

Do you want actual facts or our opinions?  And there are so many types of vampires that it's hard to tell. I think it depends on how you look at it. I think  they could keep their powers. Because, it's not like they're dead right? But even if they didn't keep their powers they would obtain vampire powers. If that's the case then then i would say no. I mean, having vampire powers and witch powers is just not fair. ;-D

My friend, your question is too obvious. Of course, if the book you're reading was kinda boring and uninteresting, then you have to grab another book that would eventually get your taste and attention. Don't waste your precious time reading something that aren't good. Me,I only read some books that really gets my attention because I have a very hectic time and I don't want to waste my reading time reading some stupid and boring books. It was as simple as that...

The killing of the Albatross is at the very end of Part 1.  There was no need to drag it out and make it a long drawn out part of the peice.  He killed the Albatross and moved onto part 2 where the fall-out from killing the albatross starts.  There just wasn't a need to write a long passage about it.  The killing of the albatross is not as crucial as the effect it has.

Conan Wolfe is good.  The rest sound made up.  I'd shoot for real names and use unique names (like Conan Wolfe) sparingly.  Google a baby name finder, that may help.  There's a program where you can set some parameters on names you like or are interested in and they will suggest more options.  Traditional or time tested names are great.  Also, it helps to connect the name of the person to the characters personality/disposition.  For example, the sort of nerdy, lonely, not in shape character from "Lady in the Water" was named, appropriately, Cleveland Heap (sp?).  Jane Austin's Elizabeth Bennet was a name of the time, Victorian and English.  And finally, mono-names like Gage are only for superheros.

Aveline Elizabeth:



Sounds unique, and slightly olden-dayish.  I'm thinking a responsible, traditional person with a solid set of values.  Make her either really old or and quite young.



Keilana Beth:



I think that this one sounds like a teen.  And a rebellious one at that.



Jadalyn Kristine:



Another teen ... maybe a little bit mature for her age.



Conan Wolfe:



Either really popular or really mysterious and dark.  A young adult or late teen.



Gage:



This guy sounds like a drug addict lol.  Mid thirties.  Sneaky, sly, likes to bend the rules.

The Great Gatsby and 13 virtues!!? english - HELP PLEASE!?!?



Prompt:



Jay Gatsby owned a book in his youth titled Hopalong Cassidy, a western story with a romantic vision. In this book, he wrote a list of virtues by which he would live. These guidelines closely resemble Benjamin Franklin’s Thirteen Virtues. Based on your knowledge of Franklin’s work and your understanding of Gatsby’s character, argue whether or not Jay Gatsby has lived up to his boyhood vision of a well-rounded man. Discuss Franklin’s purpose in writing his list in comparison to Gatsby. Also, include in your argument the element of romanticism, meaning was Gatsby’s romantic vision (his idealism) possible within the setting of the story?



This was my teachers exaple of a thesis



Jay Gatsby lived in a time of moral decay where it was impossible for him to realize his boyhood dreams because he got involved in illegal activities, neglected his original plans, and became over taken by his love for Daisy.

What do u think of Martina Cole books?



I love them. Two Women is my favourite so far I thought it was amazing. The Ladykiller was really good although I didnt like the what happened to George at the end it seemed a bit of a cop out. The Take was ok thoguh I felt it wasnt all that eventful. I liked the Runaway but not the whole part about Eamonn in America. The Know was good. And Im know halfway through the Jump and loving it.



Only criticisms - the titles of the book are rubbish!And I hate how she alwasy uses the terms 'proverbial' and 'he's a face' its really annoying!

"To My Dear and Loving Husband"



By: Anne Bradstreet



_If ever two were one, then surely we.



If ever man were loved by wife, then thee:



If ever wife was happy in a man,



Compare with me, ye woman, if you can.



I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold



Or all the riches that the East doth hold.



My love is such that rivers cannot quench,



Nor ought but love from thee, give recompense.



Thy love is such I can no way repay,



The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.



Then while we live, in love let’s so persevere



That when we live no more, we may live ever.

I waken'd was with thund'ring noise
And piteous shrieks of dreadful voice.
That fearful sound of "fire" and "fire,"
Let no man know is my Desire.
I starting up, the light did spy,
And to my God my heart did cry
To straighten me in my Distress
And not to leave me succourless.
Then coming out, behold a space
The flame consume my dwelling place.
And when I could no longer look,
I blest his grace that gave and took,
That laid my goods now in the dust.
Yea, so it was, and so 'twas just.
It was his own; it was not mine.
Far be it that I should repine,
He might of all justly bereft
But yet sufficient for us left.
When by the Ruins oft I past
My sorrowing eyes aside did cast
And here and there the places spy
Where oft I sate and long did lie.
Here stood that Trunk, and there that chest,
There lay that store I counted best,
My pleasant things in ashes lie
And them behold no more shall I.
Under the roof no guest shall sit,
Nor at thy Table eat a bit.
No pleasant talk shall 'ere be told
Nor things recounted done of old.
No Candle 'ere shall shine in Thee,
Nor bridegroom's voice ere heard shall bee.
In silence ever shalt thou lie.
Adieu, Adieu, All's Vanity.
Then straight I 'gin my heart to chide:
And did thy wealth on earth abide,
Didst fix thy hope on mouldring dust,
The arm of flesh didst make thy trust?
Raise up thy thoughts above the sky
That dunghill mists away may fly.
Thou hast a house on high erect
Fram'd by that mighty Architect,
With glory richly furnished
Stands permanent, though this be fled.
It's purchased and paid for too
By him who hath enough to do.
A price so vast as is unknown,
Yet by his gift is made thine own.
There's wealth enough; I need no more.
Farewell, my pelf; farewell, my store.
The world no longer let me love;
My hope and Treasure lies above.

Can you tell me the name of this book (poss. Enid Blyton)?



It was about a group of 'naughty' children living in some awful city whom threw stones at dogs and other animals. When they were mean to this man he made their 'burdens' appear physically on their backs (from what I can remember, they looked like a round fur thing with claws to hold onto their shoulders). The burdens were basically all the evil things the children had done in their lifetimes, and when they complained to their parents/friends/ other people all these people ended up with their own 'Burdens', and as all these people were so naughty they also were large and awful type things. They then go and ask the man that caused all this how to get rid of these burdens, and it ends up in a quest to this city, with many trials (Against people very unsubtly named things like 'Haste' and 'Hurry') along the way so eventually only a few people are left. When they reach the city this man takes their burdens, because of course he is Jesus taking what constitutes their sins.
I remember it as being an Enid Blyton book, although that could be because it was when I was reading a lot of that type of book.
It would be really great if someone actually knows that book so I could finally get the title, thankssss.

I'm not familiar with Gregor the Overlander, but Brisger and Twilight are in the Young Adult section of my library.  If you're ready to graduate to the adult side, check out anything by Terry Brooks.  Don't worry about his books being inappropriate or too adult--they're all very clean.  His series include Word and Void (3 books), Genesis of Shannara (3 books so far), Shannara (14 books: 4 independent, the rest sets of 4, 3, and 3, in that order), and Landover (5 so far i think, with a new one on the way).  If you love series, you'll love the fact that Genesis of Shannara is in the process of connecting the Word and Void world to the world of Shannara.  Start anywhere you like though.



If you don't want to dive in there, you could always try the Pellinor books: The Naming, The Riddle, and The Crow, with a fourth coming out eventually.  Those are Young Adult books.



Sci-fi... basically anything Star Wars, found all over the place by different authors.  A good sci-fi/fantasy mix would be the Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne McCaffrey.  Most of hers are on the adult side, but there may be a few in Young Adult depending on your library.

I hate to state the obvious, but it is about Pride and Prejudice!



Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy are both too proud and prejudiced without any real foundation. Elizabeth is prejudiced against Darcy and for Wickham - a mistake that costs the family dearly. Darcy is also prejudiced against Jane because of her social position. It is not until they see the truth about each other and the other characters that they can change and fall in love.

The book has 3 main themes:
Pride, Prejudice & Marriage.



So basically the idea of the book is how these different people with varying amounts of Pride and Prejudice about other people must overcome that to have...uh.. Marriage.



This can be shown by the three marriages of



Charlotte & Mr. Collins



(neither has a great deal of pride and no prejudice)



Jane & Mr. Bingley



(the prejudgment of the Bingley family made the Bennets look forward to Mr. Bingley from the beginning, and neither parts have a great pride to stop them from marrying)



Elizabeth & Mr. Darcy



(Both have negative prejudgments about the other, and consider their pride more important--this pride is what make Elizabeth turn down Mr. Darcy's first proposal)



I hope this helps. ^ ^

The writer comes from another planet and has assumed human form. It/he/she finds it difficult to maintain this form since it takes so much of its energy. Each day it experiments with the form it should take but meets people from the previous day who comment that they feel that they have seen it somewhere before. You can imagine the trouble it gets into in bars, when it appears as an attractive female but does not comprehend what the dudes are after. Or when it appears as a helpless old male/female and some muggers attempt to rob it only to encounter a superhuman strength and agility.



There you are! Have a go at that and remember that the diary or report will have a style all its own.

Perhaps you could post the details on whatsthatbook.com to see if anyone there knows the title.

Need help on book character names in my interracial novel?



I'm writing a series called Autumn Falls that faces satire, gay relationships, interracial relationships, and problems that teens in real life face. Anyways, my story centers around this African American girl who moves to a new area and meets this girl who is bisexual and a guy who has tragic problems. The guy is a real tragic character who is afraid of water, people, and life. He substitutes it with anger and tormenting this guy because he reuined his life so many times. I'm thinking the bisexual girl should be named Brogan Alexander or Meghan Hanlin. And the guy should be named either Robin Wilkes or Wally Scheider. The African American girl should either be named Crystal Collins or Arlene Glick. The guy she eventually falls for is white and he's the one that bothers the guy with the problems. He's really smart, but likes to torment several people and always tackles him during football practice. He's suppose to be really conceited, preppy, and tough with a kind soul hidden in it. I'm thinking between the name Carter McPhee or Andy Atkins. I can't decide, so can someone please help me on it?

It's been a very looong time since I've read this strange book...



1) She got scared of what she had to experience, and so she requested (and was) "released" (killed).
2) No Idea...continue to train them?
3) The older Giver who trains the new Giver
4) When he saw the colour of the apple (cause everyone esle sees in greytone) (and has "Capacity to See-Beyond")
5) I guess they must be young and be different?
6) Having to experience really bad things (i.e. coldness, despair)
7) No Idea...



Ok so not really helpful. It helps best to read the novel or asked someone more intelligent about it...

What predictions expressed in Farenheit 451, Harrison Bergeron and The Pedestrian have come true today?



For school I read these three works. Now I have to write an essay describing THREE predictions from these works (each prediction needs to be written about in atleast two of the three stories) that have come true in modern society. Their are plenty of options but I am having trouble thinking of predictions that appear in two of the works and have come true today??? Also what are some arguments and examples I could use from both the works and modern society???

You will write your own ideas best. It is really hard to write other peoples and you shouldn't take ideas



If you get stuck with the start just keep rewriting it until you get it right.



Write down key words and phrases and build on them. For the start maybe describe a character or two and the setting. Set the mood for the rest of the story

I think most people won't be willing to share ieas because they'll want to keep it for themselves. You could try using a short story template, start off writing gibberish and work from there. You can also try to find a sentence starter (google it!) and work from that, possibly changing it slightly to adapt to your story.



Hope i helped!

I'm an adult looking for funny books.



What I'm looking for is a funny book that is a story or stories not articles or essays.  It doesn't have to be too clean, but not filthy either I suppose. I'm not into chick lit. If you could please offer some suggestions and maybe a line about what it's about I'd really love it.

Try "Jane Eyre" by Emily's sister, Charlotte Bronte, or her "Villette" which is dark-melancholic. "The Tenant of the wildfell hall", by Anne Bronte has a lot of dark-alcoholic moments. As you can see I am addicted to the Brontes.

Waiting across the street for Demetris to arrive, Aniela sat in the shadows of the dark alley, unseen by any passers-by. She crouched low as a large delivery truck drove past,  splashing mud on her light jacket. She, being now frustrated by the lateness of  Demetris, brushed off the mud, eyes narrowing.



The man with the brief case strolled down the alley, looking not afraid, but very aware of his surroundings. Aniela stole out of her crouch and slowly tip-toed towards the man, her eyes on nothing but the case he now held against his chest.



“Is that the file?” Her cold voice rung throughout the street, echoing off of the empty trash bins nearby.



“Y-Yes,” the man stuttered. His eyes now shined with fear, greatly exempting their dark brown color.
Aniela held out her pale, long-fingered hand. “Give it here.”
“I-” The man swallowed, making strange gulping noise. “I want to be sure of our deal. I-I need to know nothing happened to my son.”
“Trust me,” Aniela said, snatching the solid case from his enclosed hands. “You will know soon enough.”
She turned and stalked down the dark alley, seeming to disappear into its depths.
*
Aniela arrived in Switzerland at exactly 12:01. Late, she thought. Again. She marched through the busy streets of a small town, covered in a light snow, glaring in a straight haze. Many tourists, laden with shopping bags and fudge, were pushed lazily aside.



Demetris was perched against a telephone pole, his back towards the bustling crowd, talking fluently in what sounded like French on a tiny cell phone. Aniela, feeling her anger returning, launched herself at the unaware man’s back, knocking him upside the head.



“You idiot! You imbecile! You didn’t show!” Aniela pounded her fists furiously into the tall man’s back, struggling to keep her voice low.
“I know. I had to take care of some personal business.”
Aniela glared. What sort of ravage fool would leave his partner?



“Doing what?” She asked, her voice smitten with rage.
“Never you mind. Now, please follow me. Master is waiting, and might I add he is not pleased with you.” Demetris kept his face expressionless, though clear joy was etched into his deep blue eyes.
The pair quickly rounded the corner, still miles from their destination. Miles they could make up easily, of course,  once the grubbiness of this low-class town was left behind. Demetris led the way, only glancing over his shoulder when a pretty girl passed. “Oh, please!” Aniela whispered, still following the mysterious man that was her partner.



The last building on the road was nestled near the silent woods. The building was shabby, obviously not used in a few years, and in need of some major repair. Few people lingered here, nor were many on this particular block. Demetris pulled a tiny key from his breast pocket, and slid it into the door.



The inside of the deserted building was exactly how Aniela pictured it. Small, dusty, and cramped, with covered antique furniture hidden in the shadows. The only item that appeared to be left untouched was a small wood desk in the middle of the room.



The chair behind the desk slowly turned, showing the face of their Master. Aniela and Demetris both cringed, seeing the mangled face.
“Enter.” The harsh voice called. “Both of you. Quickly.”



Aniela pushed Demetris further into the room, slamming the old door behind her.



She glanced at Demetris, whose smug expression was entirely gone from his topaz eyes. Aniela stood slightly behind him, keeping herself slightly distanced from the chair.



“Aniela, you’re late. Again. Is this becoming too hard for you?” The chair swiveled again, to the right this time. It moved forward, towards to two standing motionless near the door. “Because, if it is, I can easily fix that.” The man in the chair pulled out a long stick, seemingly flicking it through his fingers.



“No. No I can handle it. But, sir, I need more time, the nuisance of a boy knows we’re after him. He’s running, and he is quick. He’s got the two others with him, both experienced and ready. Its unlikely I’ll be able to capture him while he is being guarded by them.” Aniela’s fear made her voice quiver.



“We.” Demetris glared forward. “We will catch him.”
Aniela disregarded this comment, not letting his stupidity cost both of their lives.



The man in the chair flicked his wand at the creaky door, making it fly open. Taking it as her cue to leave, she pulled Demetris by the back of his long cloak. “Yes, Master. It will be done.”

The cure for writers block is the following:



sit down and keep writing, no matter how bad you think it is because eventually something worthwhile will jump onto the page.



The only way to get better is to practice, the only way to practice is to keep writing.  I think you should finish it.  It may not be your finest work you will ever do but it is a beginning, and every writer needs a beginning.

You could try, if there's nothing said about not being able to print it out, there's no reason you can't - you're not going to use it for anything but reading it, so if you can, you should if it'll make it easier to read.

Sometimes that is a good idea, but it's the kind of thing you really need an expert to evaluate for you.  Look in the yellow pages of your telephone book for Antique print dealers. If you can't find that specific listing, look for Art dealers, or Book sellers, and they may help you find the right expert.

Several reasons:
Firstly, it would have introduced more overt sexual tensions in the book (if you read it, they do exist a la the pig-rape scene; however he mains them subtly) which would have been detracting from the overall message.



Secondly, he was raised in British single-sex education, so the amount of explaining needed to include girls would have been greater than any need to have them in there.



Thirdly, LotF is in part a dissection of war and the abstract societies that grow out of conflict and founding. Typically, war and exploration have been carried out by men.

From Shmoop Literature on Lord of the Flies



http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/w...



In A Nutshell



The whole boys-being-stuck-on-an-island thing is nothing new, and it seems Golding used this scenario to respond to another novel, The Coral Island, written by R.M. Ballantyne in 1857. The Coral Island depicts some white, European boys who end up on an island and use Christianity to “conquer” the “heathen ways” of the Polynesian natives. Naturally, this was a huge success in Victorian England. Golding read it and got all fired up, and wrote Lord of the Flies using many of the same names for his characters that Ballantyne did. Unlike The Coral Island, Lord of the Flies shows the British boys as savage and, to use a technical term, rather “sketch.”



From Character Clues



http://www.shmoop.com/character-clues/li...



Names
At the beginning of the novel, before the reader is told the boys’ names, Golding uses labels as a characterization tool, such as “the fair boy,” and “the fat boy.” At first, we’re bothered by these labels; it doesn’t seem right for the boys to be without names. But then we realize that “the fat boy” is not very different from “Piggy,” and that even names like “Ralph” and “Jack” are just descriptions (Ralph means “counsel,” by the way – nifty, isn’t it?). In other words, what seems “primitive” to us is really just a slightly skewed version of what we do in “civilized society.” Oh, also, Simon is a name from the Bible to reflect his spirituality.

<answer>



In the Andrew Marvell poem, the speaker is urging a woman to have sex with him personally.  The Robert Herrick poem is addressed to young women in general, advising them to embrace their sexuality.  In doing your comparison and contrast, some of the things you might look at are the arguments that the two poems make in favor of sexual activity, and the language they use (including metaphors and other figures of speech) to discuss such topics as sex, love, youth, old age, and death.

Do you know this childrens book?



it's about an African girl who gets kidnapped by the sea on her way to get a conch shell and is stolen by someone/thing and put into a drum. They take the drum to villages and get rich because they hit the drum and make her sing, and the people think the drum is magic.
In the end, the little girl inside the drum knows she is in her own village and sings a song about herself while her captors are away so the listeners know that she is within the drum, kidnapped.
The villagers take the little girl away and fill the drum with sand so it is heavy and the bad guys don't know she's gone.

I thought it was...ok.
A bit of a letdown. There was NO action in it. NO big "drama".



All it was was lovey-dovey.



It got boring after a while, imho.



BUT overall, it was a pretty okay story.

I found the first 12 chapters online, and was horrified and thought they'd be fake.



But in the end, they were real. After reading the WHOLE THING, it wasn't a terrible letdown. It wass pretty good. This December a guide's coming out, and on Nov. 21st the movie's coming out.

I actually loved it.
I was, unlike most people, really enjoying it.
Yeah, maybe it was too graphic, but Edward and Bella are in LOVE.
Didn't you expect it to happen?
I loved it immensely. It brought the story full circle. Bella's a vampire, Jacob finally gives up on Bella being his soul mate idea, Renesmee is born, and now Edward & Bella can live eternally in peace.



I looked at it as a very twisted fairytale with a happily ever after.

It sucked! Everyone was way out of character and Stephenie spent like 600 pages of lead up to some huge fight scene. And, yah, absolutely nothing happened (these terrifying Volturri people were just going to forget about it? Okkkk?). And Jacob imprinting on the demon spawn. Um, that's gross. What's this kid going to think when she knows how Jacob used to fantasize about her mom? It was awful.

I lost my passion for writing!?



I used to write (and read) almost non-stop. Then a bunch of drama happened in my life over the course of 10 years. I'm now 21, and I can't get back to that passion. When I sit down to write, it's literally like I can't even go to that place any more, there's a concrete wall. Absolutely no ideas. Have I lost it forever? What can I do to get it back? When I did write, I'd write for hours, endless and beautiful things... I know if I could just get past this permanent block I'd do good things with my writing. HELP!

The only cure for writers block is to write.  write ANYTHING.  write in a journal, write what the kids are doing in the street outside your house.  Just write.  Who cares if it's garbage, just write.  It will get you back in the swing of things in no time.  To begin with it's not going to be spectacular and beautiful, it's going to be ugly most likely, but no one has to see it and at least you will be writing.  Eventually your muse will come back.

Writingg,



Sometimes things happen in our lives that are very weighty. It seems the world has settled on our shoulders and no one is around to help bear the burden. The first thing you need to do is get over whatever it is that brought on your 'writers block' caused by a mild case of depression over your predicament. This is more important right now than writing. This is your mind. It needs a rest right now and a way to get over whatever it is that's bothering you.



You're young at 21. You have a long way to go in life and you should look forward instead of backward. Everyone can offer their help here on YA, but you can only really get that help from someone you can reach out and touch. If your problems become that bad, then you need to reach out to one of these people.



Take your time in getting back to writing. It will come.



I wish you well.

Remember when you first discovered the magic of writing?  It was when you finished a book that you'd remember forever, wasn't it?  And you said to yourself...I want to be like that one day.



To find that flair again...it's easy.  First, don't think that it's hard to get back or it will be.  It's like jumping from a big rock to the next big rock...if you tell yourself that you might not make it (and you believe that you might not make it) you're going to fall.  You have to know that you're going to make that leap and you're going to be okay.



What happens when we mature is that we become better and better at reading.  We begin to realize that if we read faster...we get to enjoy more stories during our spare time.  This is great, because we get to ride along on another person's adventure...but it sucks, too, because we're conditioning ourselves to go through books as if they're passing by us on an assembly line.



Slow down.  Savor the words of whatever you're reading.  If something tickles your mind in a story that you're reading, go back...read it again.  Taste the words.  Feel them.  Find out why you like the passage so much.



It takes time to write.  Lord, do I know that!  And it's a great injustice when someone comes up to me and tells me - "I read your story in one night!  It was good!"



What?!  It took me six months to write that, and you gobbled it up in a single night?  :(



Think of books like the turkey on Thanksgiving.  It takes hours to cook.  Put all the trimmings with it, and gather your loved ones around.  Nobody wants to see a family tear through a Thanksgiving dinner in record time.  Savor each bite as a rare treat.  That's how you should be reading when you're a writer.  You should pause often and think...that was good, I'm going to turn back a few pages and have seconds and find out why that was so yummy! :b



When you slow down and learn to enjoy the language, you'll start to realize that the same flavors go into your own writing.  It won't be long before you're no longer writing...and literally watching the story unfold for you in your imagination.  Those are the best times! :)

Sympathy for the antagonist?



I have to write a brief script in which the protagonist and the antagonist are engaged in a conflict. The audience should sympathize with the protagonist.



Then I have to rewrite the script, and make it so that the audience sympathizes with the antagonist.



I'm a little confused on the second part. How do I make the antagonist worthy of sympathy if s/he is the "bad guy?"

The series isn't over. The last I heard Charlaine hadn't made and commitments to who Sookie would end up with. In the last book, she broke up with her boyfriend, who was an interesting guy, and Bill and Eric are both still panting after her. Of course, there is also ever loyal Sam. Charlaine once indicated that she didn't really know who Sookie would end up with but that was before the last book came out, maybe she know now, but hasn't shared it with us yet. She likes to let the story evolve. It could be someone we know or haven't even met yet. :P



Personally, I'm rooting for Eric.

You need to ask yourself if they show more than 1 side of their character. Did they learn anything? Did they change at all? Static characters don't change at all, they remain constant. Dymanic characters are like most people, there is more than 1 side to them and they are constantly learning and changing.



As far as John & Lorraine goes, I think they learned a very important lesson in the book. Do you?

<question>



Please tell me what do these words and sentences mean?



1- what does "convention of genre" mean? "Joyce Carol Oates' prodigious output(Gravedigger's Daughter) has become, these days, almost a convention of the genre." I guess convention and genre has same meaning, is that so?



2- what does "liminal child" mean?"Rebecca is born on the boat in New York harbour; a liminal child, distinguished from her family by the accident of her birth and from her homeland by the outlandishness of her family."
3-Does Hazel Jones have a special meaning?: "Hazel Jones, the name she chooses for her new incarnation, is a distillation of American apple-pie womanhood."
4-what does brought on in no small part mean? does it meant that it appears in so many ways, or appears alot?: "His mental dissolution, brought on in no small part by his loss of status when he reaches the US, is profound and harrowing."
4- what does"unravelling" mean?: "that's much better than being alcoholic, angry and unravelling."
I've translated this interview with Joyce Carol Oates, but I'm not sure about the above words or sentences, so your help will be much appreciated.

</answer from>



<answer>



1. Convention of genre, standard in the genre.  Meaning that within her genre, this amount of output has become the normal  to expect.



2. liminal, you probably recognize the word  subliminal.  liminal would be overt, noticeable.



3. Jones is a common name and so is Hazel, this is basically saying her new name was like John Smith, a common name for someone of English descent in america.



4. Pull a thread out of your sweater or shirt, keep pulling, that is unravelling.  Here it is used for someone who has a mental state that is frayed, becoming more scattered.

Has J.R.R Tolkien published a book of poems?



Has he written poems that are well known or published. I am doing a project and i need to pick a author that has written both novels and poems. I know He has written poems but my teacher said he might be hard to do because he doesn't think Tolkien has a published poem book or something along that line.

There's "The Adventures of Tom Bombadil," which is 16 very short poems. I don't think it's in print, but it has been included in "The Tolkien Reader" for well over three decades, and that appears to be in print.



That volume also includes a play in Anglo-Saxon-style alliterative verse, called "The Homecoming of Beortnoth Beorthelm's Son."



Tolkien also translated some medieval poetry into modern English verse, in print as "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, Sir Orfeo."



Of course, there's considerable poetry mixed in with the various works on Middle-Earth, too.

Well we would have remained governed colonies by the King of England. We would have remained their whipping boy, paying unnecessary taxes on all goods. England would have sent leaders over to govern certain areas of newly colonized land. A lot less freedom basically. Also would have had to sign up for the army to fight for problems not concerning us.A revolution was inevitable.

Freedom of Religion.
Your first right under the American constitution. This entitled everyone the freedom to choose WHAT to believe in.
England was forcing everyone, at that time in history, to believe in their religion. The people that became the colonists objected to this religion, and they wanted to believe in their own beliefs (Hence, the Freemasons). This is WHY the constitution is written with "Freedom of Religion" being the very first amendment. So to answer your question: If "the colonies" (by the way, they weren't called America yet) hadn't broken away from England as they did, chances are there would have been an English civil war over religion. Or: everyone who is an English descendant residing in what is now America, would have been Church of England in faith. Also, everyone who has come to America, raised children in America, taken up employment in America, would all have had nowhere to go to because there would be no America.

I am personally fond of the writing style of Dean Koontz. Look him up.



Best bet would be a paperback exchange or a library. You can always get cheap books there. I got a Koontz novel at my local library for just fifty cents. I think it'd be worth taking a look. Best of luck.

Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini (Eragon, Eldest, Brisingr) and Mortal Instruments Trilogy by Cassandra Clare (City of Bones, City of Ashes, City of Glass). Actually, my friend has been on my case to read City of Bones, so I started it recently. She said that Jace (a character in the book, a Shadowhunter) is so much hotter than Edward, and he also has golden eyes, and that's what sold her. But in my book Edward still rules, and I'm reserving judgement until I've read the whole series!
Hope this helps!

Actually,
Stephenie Meyer Said that she is too hurt to continue with it, someone betrayed her, people have to give her time over this. She is so hurt right now that she said Twilight might end up where Bella dies and James wins so I think we should have some patience. I know it sucks because Twilight is amazing but, what would you do in this situation? BUT, on her website Seth stated...



June 2008 Update: In response to the outrageous number of emails that I have received with questions concerning Midnight Sun, I talked to Stephenie this weekend and she asked me to let everyone know that Midnight Sun is her next project. She has not yet finished writing it (and there is no timeline set up, so we all need to put a lot of effort into being patient for a while longer), but she is definitely still planning on having it published. And, after Breaking Dawn comes out, Stephenie will have much more time to focus on writing Midnight Sun.



So actually she is continuing to make the book.



YAYYY!!!!

We read a short story, or an excerpt of a novel or something in middle school, with some really powerful imagery of socialism. In the story there is a beautiful ballerina who is forced to wear a mask, so that she is more equal to the other's whose beauty isn't as great. I think she was also forced to wear weights,because she was an exceptional dancer. Can anyone tell me the name of the story?

<question>



Has anyone read my book "Injustices of a Poetic Soul"? If so, can you please let me know whether you liked it?



I have written a very interesting book based on the trials and tribulations of my life. I have endured many forms of abuse growing up, and I wanted to educate others on the signs of abuse, and ways to acknowledge this. The book is full of poetry and stories explaining the poetry and giving detailed descriptions of all that was endured. I also offer sound advice on self love, self worth, self realization, and empowerment.



I often had hoped to help others who have the same or a similar situation to get through what they have encountered, and to help infuse their innerbeings with courage and love.
I have had little success getting people to buy my book or even give me a chance to make the change that I so hoped I could make.
I take my time out to talk to teenagers and motivate them to do something with their lives. So far I have changed some of their lives for the better, but I need to know what I am doing wrong as far as getting the word out there about my book.
I bust my behind sending copies to various talk show host, posting ads on the internet, handing out flyers and book marks, calling around, giving out free copies, and I even have a book signing event on Nov. 16 at borders.
I am not having any success, but I have spent a lot of money investing into promoting my book, and still I am not having any luck.
I even have a website that I pay for every month with very little visitors (www.injusticesofapoeticsoul.com ). Can someone please offer me some advice if they have any experience in this field. I would greatly appreciate this.

Uh, does anyone except you think it is remotely interesting, let alone "very interesting"? "Injustices of a Poetic Soul"? How "oh poor abused little me" can you get? Deeply pretentious. What are you doing wrong? You wrote a book nobody wants to read.



We all have lives with trials and tribulations. Not much interested in reading your version, or your platitudes on how I should live, thanks very much. If you want your book to be read, get it published by an actual publisher, not vanity press. If all you want is for it to be available, post it online. Fictionpress.com takes original fiction. But from your description I for one have no interest in even reading it for free, let alone paying to do so.

Wow, and in saying that am I supposed to get angry. That is your opinion, and as far as I can see you are very angry about something I have never done to you. If you have nothing postive to say, don't say anything at all. Didn't you learn any manners? I did not ask YOU to read my book! Someone will!

I love the books. They are some of my favorite vampire books. Charlaine Harris has such an interesting voice that comes through in all her works. I simply love her. She has such a nice down, home Southern voice and her Sookie is a lot stronger person than the HBO's Sookie. O, and "down home Southern" doesn't mean absolutely redneck idiots either. Gosh, the way HBO has Jason sound ignorant drives me up the wall.



The books are far superior to the show. Most people who I know that have read the books are pretty annoyed with the show. They have added and changed so much to make 1 book last a full season. Truly, they should have just done 2 books in a season or something.



They have taken some parts of the book that are only a couple sentences and dedicated large parts of several episodes to them, then major parts of the book get glossed over.



Jason's and Sam's characters are also very different. Jason is a male ho in the book, but he wasn't a blood addict or someone who would consider participating in a kidnapping. Sam in the book is pretty much a perfect sweetheart. He isn't at all creepy like they portray him in the show.



I was so thrilled when the series was coming out, but now I'm a bit sick over it.



Plus, in the books you get Bubba. Bubba is totally worth reading them if  you can't find any other reason. :D But I won't spoil him for you.

I read the first three books. They're at least better than the crappy HBO adaption. True Blood is so painful to watch. Disgusting sex scenes and  and strange pacing, along with lame changes... Bill's way of speaking is awkward, Sookie is annoying, and Sam is even MORE annoying than he was in the novels. Ugh, I hate everything about him. The vampire thing seems to be taking a major backseat to a sort of soap plot, with all these characters and their love (sex) lives. It's been a long time since I read any of the books, but I don't remember a lot of what I've seen in the first 5 episodes.



ANYWAYS, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy the books more than the TV show. They aren't my favorite books by any means, but they're decent enough if you're looking for something in the vampire romance/supernatural genre. (well, not enough to keep me reading, but enough not to regret reading the first few books)

I read it ages ago, but am sure you get the picture of wild and ghosts from the past. It is cold and dark and there is a sense of mysery. Heathcliffe and Kathy almost reach out to the narrator from the grave whilst he is trying to sleep in the creepy place he is staying. i think the owener tells him some of the tale.

well, according to Wikipedia, a yes man is . . .



The term "yes man" is typically used for an employee who agrees with every statement of his or her employer.[1] Some synonyms of yes man are flunky, stooge, butt-boy, suck-up, kiss-***, and sycophant; all of which have pejorative connotations.[2] Such a person may also be referred to as a lapdog.[3]



presumably, a "yes man" story refers to a story about a yes man . . .

I don't know about the rave, but I really liked the Harry Potter books for what they were -- well-written, enjoyable, original fantasy.



By the same rule, the Twilight books were badly written, cliched, with Mary-Sueish (i.e. to "perfect" to be real) characters . . . and thus definitely not fun to read.  Not that I read more than one.  Or even, in fact, made it through the first.  My gag reflex isn't that forgiving.

I don't like twilight. And before you accuse me of not reading the book, I WAS A Twihard back then. An absolute freak when it comes to Twilight. I surpassed a friend's obsession too- and to think that friend introduced me to it. I read the first book in one night. The second book in two days. The third in three, and the fourth in a week- due to exams. I scoured the whole area of Perth to look for the second book when it was sold out. I always check out SM's website and even planned to buy the bracelet Jacob made for Bella. I was THAT obsessed.



Then I came across this person who didn't like it. I read her points and I realised that they were right. I read another book and then went back to Twilight. That's when I started to realise how bad the book really was (in my opinion)



Even back when I loved the book to death, I started to notice how the book keeps going in circles. The fourth book creeped me out when I found out that Jacob fell for a freaking new born!



I waited and waited for a fight when the Volturi showed up, but every thing they worked hard for became useless when someone like Renesmee showed up and said that people like him aren't dangerous.



Yeah... yeah... we should rejoice that no one died. But it just didn't reach the climax! And all the sex talk? Pah-lease!



I don't think the book is appropriate for young people. I have a friend who saw a 7 year old reading Twilight!



Bella was so desperate to have sex with Edward!! It's like she's trying to rape the poor guy. For her age and for our generation it's totally okay, but that I think is just a bad influence!



Marriage at 18? Pregnancy at 18? I don't think that's a good thing... Bella is the worst heroine I have ever known.



Edward? Too over protective. Enough said.



I really don't get why SM had to make her vampires sparkly!



She overuses words like velvety and murmurred. It's getting annoying.



Very mary-sueish. Not realistic at all. I know it's in a fantasy genre, but to have a human character- you must at least make some of it believable!



And answer me this... HOW IN THE WORLD COULD BELLA ATTRACT SO MANY GUYS?!?



If she's plain and charmless as what SM initiated in the book, then WHY!? Remember the part when Edward said that he felt as if he needed to fight to date Bella and how she would be surprised at the number of guys she wanted to date?!



Please! SM is trying very hard to get girls hoping when in fact, none of that actually happens.



Dreaming is ok, but too much is very unhealthy!



How could you dream of something so passionately and not do anything about it! This does not comply with desperately praying that the twilight characters would be real!



I honestly don't care what you twilight lovers think. Go love the book for all we Twilight haters care. But we have the same right as to make a site for Twilight haters.

Deathly Hallows-Harry/Hermione question?!?



In the new book about the Harry Potter fandom called "Harry: A History" that was released yesterday, J.K. Rowling discussed the relationship between Harry and Hermione - as well as how the Harry Potter films' screenwriter Steve Kloves interpreted it in Deathly Hallows...Here's what she said:



Quote:
"I tried very hard to soften it, I suppose," Jo said. "Just because someone had a view on Harry/Hermione didn't mean they weren't genuine, or that they were necessarily misguided. In fact, I will say this, Steve Kloves who has been the script writer [on the Potter films], who is enormously insightful on the series and a very good friend, after he read book seven he said to me, 'You, know, I thought something was going to happen between Harry and Hermione, and I didn't know whether I wanted it or not.'



"I had always planned that Harry's true soul mate, which I stand by, is Ginny, and that Ron and Hermione have this combative but mutual attraction. They will always bicker, there will always be rough edges there, but they are pulled together, each has something the other needs."



I stared at her, sensing she wasn't finished, and a sense of foreboding crept in around the edges.



"[Kloves] felt a certain pulll between them at that point. And I think he's right. There are moments when [Harry and Hermione] touch, which are charged moments. One when she touches his hair as he sits on the hiltop reading about Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and [two] the moment when they walk out of the graveyard with their arms around each other."



I was holding my breath at this point. She wasn't done.



"Now the fact is that Hermione shares moments with Harry that Ron will never be able to participate in. He walked out. She shared something very instense with Harry.



"So I think it could have gone that way."



DID ANY HARRY POTTER FANS PICK UP ON THIS? I did notice something, but I still just saw as the brother/sister relationship. I can't believe JK Rowling said that something actually could've happened...maybe all the Harry/Hermione shippers weren't so off the mark after all.

I am doing a reread/listening to the audio book right now, and I'm just at the part where Ron is about to come back so this is all fresh in my mind.  Yes, I see it.  When they are alone together for so long, there are moments where they touch or hold hands or they seem almost like a couple.  If Ron and Ginny weren't in the back of their minds for that whole time I think it could easily have gone another way.  The stupidest thing Ron could have done was leave them alone together like that.  But he wouldn't be Ron if he did the smart thing very often.  I'm glad it turned out the way it did.

I completely agree with you. I think that's exactly what JK Rowling meant...that if Hermione and Harry weren't so invested in other people then something could have happened. And you don't even have to tell me how dumb Ron can be. lol. thank goodness he finally came to his senses at the end.

I was always a Harry/Ginny shipper, but of course there'll be Harry/Hermione moments, because, like Jo said, Ron walked out. So they still are hormonal (though on a different scale) teens with needs. So... something could've happened...

Absolutely not.



I think individuals have the right to choose what books they want to read, and to limit those choices because of content is completely wrong.  Besides, the First Amendment states "no law shall be made abridging the freedom of speech."  Banning books does not fit in with the First Amendment! Really, people who think books should be banned because of language content should just avoid the book; they can't ban others from reading it, though!

I don't think books should ever be banned.  People as a whole have the right to CHOOSE to read or Not to read a book. If its banned then that choice is taken from them. Even school right now allow students to substitute books from the required reading list if parents have a problem with them..
No one forces you to read anything, its a choice and in my opinion that choice is a right!.

if you like sci-fi definitely try Twilight Eyes by Dean Koontz. It's about this race of demon/monster creatures that take on human form,and nobody but, a few people with certain powers can see them.  They get pleasure out of seeing human pain & suffering. It's a reeeally great read. I couldn't put it down.

Well, lets see, what would be the theme of Pride & Prejudice...thats a tough one.  Maybe freaking PRIDE & PREJUDICE.  you dolt.



Lizzy is very proud, and her first impression of Darcy is her only one, and it gets worse, until he proposes to her the first time, then it gets better when she goes to his Pemberly estate.



Darcy is the prejudiced one, he doesnt like Lizzy because he thinks her family laughs too much, and her family (other than Jane) is rude and uncouth.  He loves Liz against his better judgement, and he thinks hes doing her a favour by proposing.  He saves Lydia and Jane with Bingly after, and he does it for Liz.  He loves her enough to save her family, after shes denied him, and he he says he will still love her if she denies him again, but he will keep quiet.



Both characters are so alike, although their reasonings are opposite, but that is only because both of them got their stories wrong, Darcy got Jane and Bingly all screwed up, and Liz thought Darcy was terrible to Wickham, when that wasnt what happened.  They are both very passionate people.

Can you read this, i'm beginning a book?



It was a long night on my way to Spoons, Kentucky. My name is Bebo Goose and I am from Arkansas. I used to live with my mom, Rambo. Then I fell in love with Osbert Cubin and his awesome family: Abyss, Ebbit, Emo, Carly, and Jackapir. Then I found out he and his whole family were robots. A bunch of scary robots named Vergyna, Jerksopf, and Laurel chased me around because I smelled like bubble gum and Doritos. Then Osbert left me because he didn't want to chop me into wee pieces with his robot arms. Then Jimbob came along and tried to hit on me. He was really hot but cried too much. Then I found out his whole family were space aliens. I got over him.Then Obsert came back and we got married, did it, and had our baby, Rambemo. Then Jimbob came back and decided he liked Rambemo, which makes him a pedophile.

Books to read in a life time?  Now there's a thought!  It depends of course, on you, your tastes, your course of study, your career, etc.



What is right for one person, would be different for another!  What is true universally, however, is that any list today, would be different tomorrow!  Knowledge is added to hour by hour, day by day, and thus your list will expand accordingly.



Any well-written book, read and understood, will contribute to the sum of learning that you will carry around in your head, and your interpretation of what is important in life.



So I would say this: read, enjoy and travel the river of knowledge wherever it takes you!  Bon voyage!

Also try to read somethings outside your normal realm of experience.  Pick up a true crime book written by a cop, or a mafia member. Read about the darker side of real life.  Read about places that you will never get to go yourself and broaden your life on the experiences of others.  Read a fiction/fantasy novel and discover places that exist only in the movie of the mind.  I do hope the "before you die" in the question is not urgent, best of luck.  The important thing to do is just to read something... and enjoy it.  Just because it is on a best seller list doesn't make it good.

Here's a good list of 1,001 books to read before you die, have fun! Most of them are classics and come well recommended.



You can join http://www.goodreads.com to keep track of how many you read and rate them as you go. There is a group you can join that is devoted to this list. Happy reading! :)



http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2222



I would suggest skipping the series and junk novels that most people are praising. Go for the classics and the best of the best, then if you want you can get stuck reading series books, which never are that great, mostly just time wasters.

I am very widely read in not only regular classic literature, but also in a lot of popular contemporary authors.  I am sort of a sci-fi, fantasy, horror buff.  Here's my list from that point of view because I think you'll get a lot of Shakespeare, Dickens, and Tolstoy from everyone else.  These are just plain fun to read and hang the snobbish fascination with the classics:



"Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card
Sci Fi/Fantasy Hugo/Nebula Awards, I recommend this book to everyone.  My sons love it.  (Anyone who has ever been a "gamer" will appreciate this book.)



Any book by Anne McCaffrey (but especially "Crystal Singer".) Sci Fi/Fantasy Hugo/Nebula Awards, This is probably my favorite and the most prolific author on this list--she's written at least 25-30 books, every single one has made the bestseller's lists.  Great message and great characters.



"The Earth's Children" Series by Jean Auel (Historical Fiction)  Those legions of us who are die-hard fans of this series are keeping our fingers crossed that she completes the final book in this series before she dies--she's been writing them for several decades now--very slow (usually 6-7 years between books) but unbelievably intricate and detailed author.  These are pretty thick though--you'd better really like to read to take these on!



"The Darwath Trilogy" by Barbara Hambly (all NYTimes bestsellers--sort of Horror/SciFi.)  She has also written several other very very good books.



All Tolkien--this really is a must:  The original Fantasy Classic.



"Mists of Avalon" by Marion Zimmer Bradley (exceptional re-telling of the King Arthur story from a woman's perspective.)



Enjoy!

Books by Piers Anthony, Douglas Adams, Roger Zelasney, J.K. Rowling, J.R.R. Tolkien, Garth Nix, read Little Women, Tom Sawyer, Romeo & Juliet, Taming of the Shrew, Ten Little Indians, read everything pertaining to Mythology and the Greek and Roman Gods.  Read biographys of anyone you feel is important, like Einstein, Lenin, Chruchill, Ronald Regan, Marilyn Monroe, Ted Williams, and definitely read about Mr. Kellogg, the founder of the known cereal, or Henry Ford, the founder of the auto construction line.



Whatever you do, read.  Whether it's a book or on the internet.  I've found it so disappointing when I see a 2nd or 3rd grade child who doesn't yet know how to read.

Everyone should read, but what should they read depends on what they believe. If you're religious, the Bible is a must read. If you're psychological, I would recommend "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" by Robert M. Pirsig. If you're a creative professional, "Cracking Creativity" by Michael Michalko is a book you can't miss. If you just like to read, then it doesn't really matter what you read, does it? :)

The Bible, definately.



There's also this interesting book called The Phantom Tollbooth. The entire thing is a satire and an example of life and the way people think. It's very hard to find the double meaning sometimes(I couldn't finish because it made my head hurt, lol), but if you just read it on the surface, it's really fun and crazy. Seemingly random but quite insiteful.

Obviously these are my favourites, but I also think that people should read them for fun, information, and just to experience great british literature



for fun:
any of the terry pratchett discworld series.. I would recommend "Guards, Guards"  - the first one in the ankh morpork city guard series



for Information:
'Why People believe weird things' by Michael Shermer... pretty much does what it says on the tin



For beautiful literature:



'Under milk wood' by Dylan Thomas -  a wonderful look at a day in the life of a small town in Wales



also, 'The canterbury tales' just for the sheer joie de vivre and insight into the common man, in medieval britain.
at one time I used to pick up a copy and have a look every springtime.... "when april with her showers sweet, hath pierced the drought of march to the root"

You should read Coldest Winter Ever
The Coldest Winter Ever by Sister Souljah is a thoroughly engrossing, simply riveting book that I am very happy to have read. It is like a tell-all story from an urban teenaged girl's point-of-view. From the drug life to the privileged life, the story takes you on a journey that you will never forget. There's so much that can be said about this book, but I'll start with the main character Winter. This girl is sooo real, so authentic that I wondered "Who is Winter? Where is she?" SHE EXISTS out there somewhere. Sister Souljah did an excellent job characterizing Winter as well as the others (Midnight, Lauren, Santiaga, etc.). The way the story was written you were allowed to know Winter's every thought, whether you agreed with those thoughts or not. Winter was defined by what happened to her and how she reacted to the things that she experienced (mother's accident, father's jailing, being forced to live among strangers, lack of money, love for money...). And the plot had many twists and turns, shockers and laughs. My favorite line is "Bounce, *****," which is what Winter said to a 'white man'. It was hilarious. Overall, I loved the story, the writing, the character, and some of the messages conveyed in this piece of work. It is highly recommended..

Everything by Jane Austen.
Everything by Shakespeare (especially Hamlet and Macbeth)
Harry Potter.
Charles Dickens (especially David Copperfield)
Emily Brontë (especially Wuthering Heights)
Stephenie Meyer (Twilight, etc)
Meg Cabot.



And one of my favorites: Austenland by Shannon Hale.



The Lusiads by Luiz de Camões it's a great book, too. Camões tells the History of Portugal mixed with some mythology. It's poetry. It's divine.



P.S.: For some Twilight fans: please, can you stop writing StephAnie? It's StephEnie. With an 'e'. Show some respect.



And please, can the other users stop with the thumbs down? It's annoying and unfair. Everyone has the right to express their opinions.

Hmm, I liked Robert from the beginning.
He's trying really hard with the accent. Being British myself and having to try to put on an Aussie accent, I know it's hard.
I don't really like Kristen. I don't like the way she says some sentences. It's too monotone and... just not Bella.



I LOVE the other characters... Nikki Reed is okay as Rosalie, though I think they needed a model or something.



But my fav actors have to be... (from what I've seen)
Cam Gigandet as James
Rachel Levefre as Victoria (lol thats me!)
Rob



Ashley Greene as Alice
Jackson Rathbone as Jasper
Kellan Lutz as Emmet



I do not like Taylor Lautner as Jacob. I mean, he has the six pack, but DUDE!! He's Sharkboy lol.
I just don't like him

The Red Tent..i forget the authors name. But an amazing book following the life of Hannah from her point of view,  who was briefly mentioned in the bible.
Eragon, Eldest and now the third book Brisinger is out. It's not a kiddy book just because its fantasy. Lots of action, love, and a all around amazing story line to all the books.

Yup. She gets married, gets pregnant from her wedding night, then gets turned into a vampire. She gives birth quickly since the baby (Nessie) grew at a quick pace, and Edward chews the baby out of her stomach. Then Jacob imprinted on the baby & she became his chosen mate. Jacob then dropped out of high school so he could live with Nessie & groom her from infancy so she could be the perfect mate when she matures in 6 years.

Trying to remember a book I read in High School?



This was a weird book. The main character lived in this town where everyone saw in black and white and took pills to keep from seeing color and falling in love. With the help of this old man with a job I can't remember makes him stop taking the pills so he can think clearly and see color. At the end of the book the boy runs away from his town with a baby that his family was taking care of, but would have been killed. This is a really weird book.

It's The Giver and oh my god how awesome was it!!! I didn't realise many people read it though, there's only one copy at my library and it's always there when I go in. Mind you I didn't realise the pills stopped them falling in love. What was his number? I think it was like 17 or 18....I can't remember. I last read it in 2007 and I read like a book a day, sometimes more, so....
It's so freaky you asked about that book coz I was just thinking about it the other day, wondering if I should go get it again. Haha.

Who was the author and what was his book that was in stream of conscious style?



I heard that he would staple or somehow make all these pages on big long massive page, put it in his typewriter and just write for hours in stream of conscious style, probably heavily drinking at the same time.
I wanted to know his name and book, I'm really interested in the idea.
Can anyone help?
Thanks.

No offence mate, but how about actually getting off you're **** and buying the book instead of cheating the writer. So if you liked twilight so much how about you actually support the reader and go and buy the book. Or if you can't get to a shop. Order it off the internet and PAY FOR IT!

Geesh just buy the book. As a true Steph Meyer fan I don't believe in finding free copies of the books. I would much rather pay for them. If everyone found free copies she would hardly keep writing them, would she? So please go and BUY a copy.

<answer>



In the bar, where he pretends to be a grown up so he can get a drink.. he always gets a drink there since he's so tall and he doesn't look like a minor.



Also, i think it was almost in the last part, when he was talking to his baby sister.. when he said he wants to be the catcher in the rye.. that was pretty mature..



i can't remember any other place, though.. maybe his conversation with his old professor in the professor's house, maybe that's mature already..

It seems to be the national craze. I, on the other hand, hated it. The writing is simplistic and - for lack of better word - just plain bad. Stephenie Meyer isn't as developed as she should be. She has a decent imagination, but in my opinion the story line is too likely.

You should! the characters' speaking lines are so good. they can make you feel so loved OR hurt. i love it! soooo much! i'm so excited for the movie. i know it's gonna be great...



and the story is so extraordinary, not like other series. i love the first book, twilight... okkkk new moon (the 2nd one) was a great work too but i don't like it coz bella and edward (main characters) are in "love quarrel mood"  and the story made me really cry.



i'm in the third book right now.

I think it depends on what you read.



I mean if you loved Meg Cabot's Princess Diaries and Boy meets Girl, seriously, GO FOR TWILIGHT.



But if you're more literary, Jodi Picoult, Margaret Mitchell, Salinger etc, Twilight is SO not the book for you.



Basically, I think its a book for regular, hormonal teen girls so they can fall head over heels for Edward Cullen.

It is an enjoyable read. That is, if you like teen romance, where the heroine is in love with two guys who are enemies with each other. And then there's the hot vampire as a hero. Really, I think it's him that is the main attraction of the book. Without the hero Edward, the book wouldn't be that good.



But I wouldn't call it great and I wouldn't say that it's "the best book ever" like a lot of people say. Why? The plot is not exactly something so different. It's not really a great love story either. The narration is ok. The characters are also ok, except for the hero. The love relationship between the hero and heroine... well, I've read books with better romance.



If you're into romance, then you could try it and see for yourself. Overall, I think it's the 1st and 3rd book are enjoyable. But I wouldn't call the whole series great. But it's all a matter of opinion.



Edit: Hey, I agree with Kady (person below me), except about New Moon. New Moon  sucks! The mood of the book is overall depressing. I get depressed reading it. And there's not much going on in it either.

Twilight (the first novel) is brilliant. It takes you into an great fantasy of vampires in human life and gives you a good perspective of a forbidden love between mortal and immortal. The characters are well written, their thoughts are original and the quirky banter between Edward and Bella is great to read. I love it heaps. 10/10
New Moon (the second novel) - Not quite as spectacular. If you read a few times, you can appreciate what Stephenie Meyer is trying to do with her characters, though at times it seems out of place the way she is throwing them around. Though it gives you a new perspective on Edward and Bella's romantic relationship and sheds light on the vampire world. Bella starts becoming annoying. 7.5/10
Eclipse (the third novel) - Worse than New Moon. Stephenie Meyer is once again trying to be creative with her vampire world and stretching a few boundaries.  Bella is edging over irritating. 6.5/10
Breaking Dawn - An absolute catastrophe. Stephenie Meyer has run out of ideas and stretches the limits of her vampire world to beyond breaking point. Characters and not recognisable and Bella becomes extremely hatable. It wasn't well thought out or written. Stephenie seemed to be in a rush to brush off the final novel. She wrapped up the series rashly and ended up losing the plot. 2/10



I think you should get Twilight and New Moon for starters. If you're brave, get the rest. :)

If you read 1984...help meeee!?



Can you answer these question?
Did Winston receive a better or worse treatment in the Ministry of Love? Describe the relationship between Smith and O'Brien. Why was Smith allowed to go in his heresy for so many years? Why did they let him go in the end?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



oh i read this 2 terms ago for an assignment....must have been one of the worst and confusing books ive read, sorry. Winston was brainwashed in the minisrtry of love so in a way he recieved a better treatment. But he was going to die anyway, at the end of the book...Oh dam this second question I had to respond to in an exam....ok... well put simply the relatioship was a father-son relationship...This is because we are seen to believe that O'Brien can see how Smith's mind works and he is seen to be a fatherly image by cradling Smith in his arms after torturing him...As for the final answer I guess the party watched so many of these people and studied them so that they can improve on the welfare of the party...sorta like lab mice really.... Hope that answers your question/s..if not good luck in trying to find a solution

The characters are amazing!  I also love the twists and turns in the plots.  It's interesting to read the books in order and see the progression of 20th century society in her lifetime.  I understand the problems with classism, sexism, etc, but each book is a reflection of what was really going on at the time it was written.  It's better than a history book!

I think she was a stand alone when she first started writing. I know they seem a bit cheesy compared to today's standard, but today's standard will become yesterdays and so forth. They were simple, well written, and the better ones did leave you guessing. For some reason they're just a good read, something to take with you anywhere.

Anyone know of a book where a hammer becomes a symbol of power?



My dad told me about a book he'd read once, about a group of people, who had no tools, or something, except this one man who had a hammer. The hammer eventually became their symbol of power and that's about all I can remember of the description. He can't remember the author or title but he does remember that he really enjoyed reading it, so I'd like to search for it.

The only thing i'm coming up with is the hammer of Thor, who was a Norse god. I know that Marvel bought the rights to all of the Norse mythology, so maybe he read a graphic novel by them? I don't know, i'm guessing here. It seemed to match.

The characters are a tad bit out of character for my liking. What happens in it is SO different from what happens in the previous three books. I think SM threw this wildly out of proportion. Bella meets this hot guy in school, they date then leading up to............them getting married?? I mean....the last book was completely rushed.

Bella's body, streaming with red, started to twitch, jerking around in Rosalie's arms like she was being electrocuted. All the while, her face was blank – unconscious.
It was the wild thrashing from inside the center of her body that moved
her. As she convulsed, sharp snaps and cracks kept time with the spasms.

...

Another shattering crack inside her body, the loudest yet, so loud that we both froze in shock waiting for her answering shriek. Nothing. Her legs, which had been curled up in agony, now went limp, sprawling out in an unnatural way.

"Her spine," he choked in horror.

There is a big controversy over Breaking Dawn and the Twilight series. The Media Center at my school does not have these books because the relationship between Edward and Bella is so intense. They don't want kids to feel that their relationships need to be like that. In New Moon, the sequel to Twilight, Edward leaves and Bella's life is turned upside down. She gets depressed and won't eat. She has screaming nightmares. They don't want kids to feel that way. Also, the book is a bit racey in the beginning when Edward and Bella go on a honeymoon.

for me there was nothing bad about it. I loved it entirely. everything. Sometimes it seemed a bit out of character but you have to realize Bella changed and so did Edward. they are married now and some of the boundaries and safeties were going to be crossed. I thought it was amazing. I liked everything about it and I used to hate Jacob. But now I have a new found respect for him and even liking. Most people didn't seem to like it because they have narrow closed minds and if something doesn't happen like THEY expect it to, the book automatically sucks. I found the book very interesting and intriguing. I loved it.

Its not that it was a bad book it just didn't fit the rest of the series. I mean, there was no action or anything like that. plus, stephenie meyers writing style completely changed throughout the book. Its about 500+ pages in before anything that seems like it could possibly be interesting happenea. And it disappoints  becuase its all happily ever after without anything really happening. I guess everyone says its so bad not because its a bad book but because they were expecting something alot better.

Yes it might be intense, but the story is a story, you can do whatever she likes. Some bits were dramatic but i loved how it was different and stronger in everything that happens. Like the book mimicking bellas tramsformation, her senses became stronger, so did the story.

I recommend anything from Stephanie Meyer.
The Twilight Saga is good. The order goes like this:
Twilight
New Moon
Eclipse
Breaking Dawn
or
or you read The Host which is also good.
Other books you may be interested in are:
Memoires of a Geisha (it's much different to the film)

You could try the Malorie Blackman books in this order:
Noughts and Crosses
Knife Edge
Checkmate

Have you read the DaVinci Code? That's good too.

Try some of James Herbert's books.  He is the best horror writer around at the moment in my opinion.  His books can be quite dark and twisted but they are genuinely good & creepy horror novels.

He wrote a trilogy of books about Rats & they are probably some of his most chilling novels.  They are called 'Rats', 'Lair' & 'Domain'.
I found 'Domain' to be the most creepy of the three novels because it is set in London in the aftermath of a nuclear attack & while the idea of bloodthirsty mutant rats might not sound very plausible - the events following the nuclear attack are very scary because they really are quite plausible.

'The Ghosts of Sleath' is very good and very chilling - at one point when I was reading this book I actually shivered with fear.

'The Fog' is also very good but one of the more twisted of James Herbert's novels.



'Once' is a bit off the wall - it's about evil fairies, goblins & sprites.  It's like the antithesis of a fairytale.

'Haunted' is the first novel I read by James Herbert and one of my favourites.  It's almost like an old fashioned ghost story in a huge haunted house.  It's excellent.

It could be anything, there are many outlines. You could have a web where you have a circle in the middle, and then bubbles coming out. Or you could do this:

Chapter 1- (Title)
a. Detail
b. Detail
c. Detail

You could also just write down your ideas, brainstorm, that's all a story outline.

Argh - really hard choice. My top three in no particular order are:

Gul Dukat from Star Trek Deep Space Nine:
I don't think of him as being completely evil through and through ... He can be charming. He can be generous. He can do the right thing. All of that somehow makes his 'evil' actions all the more despicable, because we know that there was the potential in there for him to be a better person. He's so versatile, you see the best of him, the worst of him.

Steerpike from Gormenghast:
He's chilling and cunning and downright manipulative. He manages to almost take over an entire kingdom, all through the powers of persuasion. He would have gotten away with it completely if he had been quicker off the mark killing flay.

Patrick Bateman from American Psycho (book not pile of sh1te movie):
He gets away with it all, he knows why he does it, because he is completely unhinged, but at the same time, he just wants to fit in. The guy is a master.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



So many great answers from everyone but your Gul Dukat answer sold it for me.  He's not only my favourite villain of all time, but you summed him up perfectly.  I might check out Gormenghast based on your recommendation.

Mistique from the X-Men.
She can transform into any person at any time and she even can change her DNA stucture to gain their powers or say if she needs DNA to get into a safe or a govnerment place, she can get in that way.
If she goes against a superpowered apponent she can use their ability against them and even know their power's weakness at some point if they have one.
Let's say if she transformed into Superman, even though they're from two different Comic places, she will have every power of superman but most likely NOT have his weakness since technically she's not superman, just a copy.
Back to Marvel:
If she transformed into Jean for instance Im sure she will have most of her powers, perhaps not all, and be at quite an advantage.

Mistique is just my favorite because her ability to change her DNA structure to become anything and anyone she wants at any time XD She, I think, is the ultimate villain, but loses so many times because of stupid plans &gt;_&gt;;

Okay, I just watched War with Jet Li in it. He's like the hero slash villian so he's more anti hero.



What did I love about him? What did I love about him? Oh my gosh, I was rooting for him even though I was supposed to be rooting for the good guy! He was the most awesome, greatest villian ever!! He killed ruthlessly. Okay, what I hate is when they say "any last words" and take such a long time to kill the hero because, let's face it, reality doesn't work like that. If someone wants to get rid of you they don't wait it out until you have a chance to escape.



That is so friggin' stupid when they do that. Jet Li didn't do that. Nope. Not at all. He didn't really talk throughout the movie but he beat EVERYONE'S butt even the good guy. He was the silent killer. The quick and clean killer. He was the best villian EVER!! If I were to ever write a book with a villian that great, I sure hope my readers enjoy it the way I enjoyed the movie.



He just went in there with a clean cut suit and three seconds later he came out and behind him were a bunch of bodies. No screaming. No stupid "any last words" and definitely no struggles. And not a drop of blood on his suit. It was AWESOME!!

It sounds completely evil, but we're talking about villians here.

first prize goes to gollum from lord of the rings. i just love this guy! you can find yourself pitying him because of all that he's gone through, (just like frodo) but then he does something awful (i.e. betraying frodo to be eaten by a giant spider) because the lure of the Ring is too strong and he has no will left. He's just such a shaded character...he's a great literary creation. he's my PRECIOUS!!!

second prize goes to the joker from the dark knight. he's just insane and hilarious in a sadistic sort of way...and he's just so much fun to watch. you're always guessing what kind of weird stunt he's going to pull next. why so serious?



third prize goes to darth vader. he's just iconic. every time i see empire strikes back, all i'm waiting for is the 'luke, i am your father!' scene. and he has the awesome voice and the breathing...but in the prequel you see that he really was a nice guy, and actually went bad with good intentions, and so he does have a redeeming quality, which makes him even cooler than he was as a dark lord who was just evil because he was. the dark side conquers all!

actually, these are all so great, i like them all equally. they all get golds!!!

I think that the murderer in the movie Seven (Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman) is the best villan. He had a truly sick mind, saw his murders as completely justified, and was completely unafraid of repercussions. He spent hours and hours writing in those spiral notebooks in his apartment, which was a disgusting place to live, and yet he was very knowledgeable in several areas and could even have been considered quite intelligent, judging by the way he spoke after they found him. What he did to Brad Pitt's character at the end was the most evil thing I've ever seen in my life, and yet the character still saw it as fitting in to his plan and therefore completely brilliant. It took me a long time to forgive Kevin Spacey after that, and it was only a character!

The best villain of any book/movie/tv series? That's an easy pick for me. Jack Nicholson, in the Shining, had to be the most demented I have ever seen. I literally pulled my legs up under me and made sure all my doors were locked.  When he walked those halls with the axe and had that **** eating, grin on his face, I was terrified for his family. Yes he can transform himself into one scary villain.

Annie Wilkes from Misery by Stephen King. I think she's a great villain, because of the extremes she goes to, just because of her obsession with Paul Sheldon's books. You actually begin fear for Paul Sheldon, and hate her. A true villain should always be hated and the reader should always be desperate for their demise. Annie Wilkes is that character!

Mrs. Coulter from 'His Dark Materials'!! She is undoubtedly the best "villain" in children's literature anyway.

Two (main) reasons why:

It's incredibly important not to depict a character as purely evil (as the majority of the "villains" offered here are) because life isn't black and white and "evil" is subjective. Mrs. Coulter, while being power-hungry, selfishly cruel, and insensitive, is genuinely a loving mother and ultimately sacrifices herself for her daughter. Her character is so rich and layered and nuanced that our reception of her changes with every page. She is totally unpredictable, and we feel she may turn upon and viciously murder Lyra at any moment.

Mrs. Coulter is unspeakably beautiful. She exudes charm, glamour, and luxury, yet beneath this we detect something cold, powerful, dangerous and extremely unnerving. This is yet another important portrayal: beauty does not correspond with goodness, and ugliness does not correspond with evil. Too many villains, and a glance at the comments here speaks volumes, are ugly and repulsive while the central and "good" characters are healthily attractive. Again, life is not like this, and it is misleading and dangerous to depict it as such.

Mrs. Coulter! Woop woop.

Ok, the numbers are for words
10,000-40,000 - Novella
Over 40,000 constitutes a "novel." However, 40,000-60,000 - Novelette or "Novel Lite"
60,000 and up - Novel

I think the last thing in your mind should be what to call it (novel, novella, etc.) but to produce something you love.

The edges between short story, novella, and novel can get blurry. But generally, a short story runs up to 60 pages; a novella, between 60-120; and a novel, 120 or more. Those numbers are completely subjective, but they're good ballpark figures.

I got no idea why people are saying how many words. That doesn't help. If your going by pages, than most books have over 100. A good example for page range is the Harry potter series. The last one had over 600. So just go with the flow, add description, and don't make it all talking. Oh, and action works well!

This ? shows up on here as frequently as Twilight questions!  If you're going to be a "real" writer you need to go to a library & skim their section on writing.  Trust me, there won't be many.  While there look @ Writer's Market that lists all the current publishers.  Ignore those sections--you're not ready for them,  Do read their articles & learn about novellas,novels, etc.  Then go to a good bookstore & start buying for your personal library.  There will be books that have answers for the beginning writer & books by authors who give good advice & encouragement (Stephen King & Natalie Goldberg are 2 examples).



Get books on punctuation, spelling, grammar.  Don't forget a good thesarus & dictionary.  Sound expensive?  Ask yourself if writing is a hobby that you can post on here for anyone to claim, or is it a career?  I'm betting you want a career.Best of luck.

It really doesn’t matter how many pages. A 700 pages Harry Potter is as enjoyable as a 150 pages Marquez. The length of your novel depends on how you want to tell your story. True that some people don’t like novels that look underfed but there are others who avoid books that look obese. It doesn’t matter- don’t go by length. As long as you have a story that connects with your reader, as long as your narrative can enthrall him and keep him wanting to turn the pages, you know you have written a successful novel. All the best!

It's actually a good question. Especially if you aim to be published. There are rules, people. A select few get to break them, but not many. If your publisher states they want novels of 85-100K, then that's what they want. 5K one way or the other is no big deal. 20K? Big deal.

As lovely as it is to say, write until it's done, that only gets you to the rough draft. If you want to sell it, then you need to step up to the line and do the hard work, which means expanding or cutting.

I say this as someone who writes novellas. Believe me, word count is an issue.

Chapters should all be roughly the same length. In shorter works, 10-15 pages. In a novel, if you aim for around 20, you'll be fine. Again, a few pages here or there isn't going to make a huge difference, but balance is good. In other words, no 3 page chapters followed by 50 page chapters.

Typical, mainstream, genre fiction novels run between 80K-120K, depending on genre and publisher requirements.

We do count in words, rather than pages. That means that you have to have your work formatted so that we're all on the same page (Look! A pun!)

Well the worst case scenario would be the atrocious Troy starring Brad Pitt.  It ignored the major themes of the Iliad, excluded the importance of the religious beliefs of the warriors and how that influenced things, and omitted major characters such as Odysseus and Diomedes.



On a more positive note, I thought Fight Club and No Country For Old Men were excellent adaptations.

Dune - awarded best sci-fi movie award the year it came out.  But on film, a slow-moving thing; novel was fast and action-packed.  The mini-series did much better on this.

Many Steven King movies, too - The Shining is proclaimed as an excellent film, but doesn't compare to the book, which actually makes the events/characters believable.  Salem's Lot, the movie, lacks the vision and social commentary of the book.

"All the Pretty Horses" is a great book but they made a very weak movie from it. There are a lot of reasons, but here are some of the major ones. In the book, John Grady Cole is 16 and leaves home in with his 17 year old friend in 1949 on horseback headed into Mexico. There they get jobs on big ranch and John Grady falls in love with Alejandra (17) and they make love. John Grady is taken to prison where, in defending himself he kills a man. He then gets out of prison, is shot, but nonetheless rides back to Texas by himself. That's a heck of a lot and very heroic for a 16 year old. But in the movie, they made him 27 and the girl too and what's all that great about people that age having sex etc. Plus, in the book, the courtship between the guy and girl goes on for a lot of pages, so you can see their love and desire build until they are overcome by it, but in the movie they just jump in bed with little build up or explanation for what they see in each other.

If I really REALLY like the book, I try to avoid watching its adoption. However, I could not resist on watching the English Patient, and I regreted it. It just didn't have the spirit of the book at all.

However, I enjoyed two films that were made of good books: Ran [adoption of King Leare by Shakespeare] and Hakuchi [adoption of the Idiot by Dostoevsky], both directed by Kurosawa.

"The Bone Collector" by Jeffrey Deaver

Before I start, let me say that I like all of the actors involved, just not the casting of the roles!

Denzel Washington is not an older, white man (Lincoln Rhyme).  Queen Latifah is not a gay man (Lincoln's assistant).



Angelina Jolie is/was not a red head (Amelia Sachs).  They followed plot devices, but not the characters.  These characters are part of a series of books.  They aren't just throw-aways.  You read the books for the characters, not just the plot twists.

Eragon and the 5th Harry Potter book. The book gives you more detail while the movies felt like they were rushing you through everything. The movies skipped important events and changed things around. They didn't have the witch in Eragon. As for Harry Potter, the movie was just too short with too little details. If you read the books before or after the movies, then you could tell the movies were lacking and they would seem empty.

The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy. The T.V. series was bad enough but at least it was accurate up to a point.
The film just went off on its own, or as Douglas Adams (Author) put it "at right angles to reality". No wonder they had to wait until he died before making it, he would never have allowed such a pathetic travesty of his work to bear his name.

Need help with a title for my story



The legend of the Golden Light of LOTGA, many years ago in between the golden ages. There lived a huge city know as Braveture where people’s lives were in peace with the animals, nature and even their fellow people who live apart of the great city. Until the day of Summoning Lord- it’s a special time when all of the people, are thankful to their lord LOTGA in the sun-dawn temple. It was also known as a time of sharing, playing and even the joyfulness in life it’s self, but when there’s light, darkness will follow. 
A young man whom always hated the city and was set to destroy life, as we know today.

And then the day of Sorrow Cry was upon them; it was the huge down fall of the beautiful city and gaining unlimited power and life. The greed of ruling the whole world itself, then out of the blue a young child facing the deepest of fears, to come front him. Through out the horrible battle the child summoned LOTGA to seal the dark soul away forever, as faith would known it, the child give their life as a prise of sealing him forever and scattering five pieces of the Golden Light’s power around the lands called Cloridmay.

A Tale of their future from LOTGA say: “Darkness will rise from JTA seal and will try again to gain even more power, along with Thee marked child…”
“Thee who has the mark of LOTGA will rise to call, when time is needless and followers bond, Thee who will be our saver of Braveture…”

And so peace was back in place like it was before and the story of one’s true fate begins…

It sounds like an interesting story idea. If you haven't finished writing it, I suggest you finish the whole thing first before you name your story. However, here are some ideas:

- Legends of the Golden Light
- Savior
- Savior of the Light
- Marked Child
- Fate of Light
- Scattered Light
- Pieces of the Light
- Shattered Light
- LOTGA
- The Broken Shards of Light

etc.

You have to use your imagination. Don't just read it, you have to paint a picture in your head and imagine it just like you're watching a movie. (Except that you can picture your character or setting however you want). That's why I think books are more exciting that movies. There's no limits. As the person above me said, you have to find a book that's interesting too. Don't expect to find a boring old dictionary, start reading it, and actually enjoy it. :] Find something you're interested in.

I tend to read things that i'm passionate about. Vampires, witches, you know, fantasy stuff. But i also read 'realistic fiction', which s almost like real life, only not a real story. No magic involved, just telling about someone else's imaginary life. Find our passion. Maybe you like reading about rebellious students (if you do, try out Isamu Fukui's novel, "Truancy" about a bunch of kids who fight the school system). Maybe you're into fantasy (try Harry Potter, Twilight, The Host, etc.). Maybe you like Greek/Roman/Norse/Egyptian mythology (try Percy Jackson and the Olympians, anything about Thor or Odin, The Mummy, etc.). You may even like spin offs of things (Try 'the looking glass wars' by Frank Beddor [its and alice in wonderland spin-off], or 'Beastly' by Alex Flinn [ a spin off of Beauty and the Beast. Not as girly as it sounds, don't worry])

Just find your ideal fantasy and go with it.

It's just because you haven't found your type of books.



Just rent some books from your local library, at least 10. Start with the first one, and force yourself to read it up to page 36, if you are bored, grab another one, until you find an interesting one.

It's a bit like movies... you never know if you're going to like it... just give it a chance. :)

I hope it will work for you coz books rules!!!

Well, personally I enjoy books because they're a form of entertainment for me. I like to think of it as a TVshow and play it out in my mind. Books also provide new ideas and views. They cause enlightenment and new interests. 
Reading is something no one can ever take away from you. After you've read a book for the rest of your life you can always say "I've read the book ______!"



There are many, many places where you can go to enjoy a good book. Some of the places I go and recommend would be..

- Near a body of water such as an ocean, lake, river, pond, etc. The presense of water is calming and relaxing. Just make sure you protect the book your reading and don't drop it in or near the water! =)

- On the roof of your house/apartment. When I want to just be alone in a house of chaos I simply climb out my window with a good book and read. It is especially wonderful at night because you can stop inbetween chapters and take a look at the stars. But, you have to be careful not to fall because that could lead to possible injury/death or cause someone else injury/death. =)

- In a tree. Find a good (and stable) tree, climb up it, find a comfortable branch and read your book! I don't recommend it for long periods of time but it's quite peaceful if your looking to read a couple of chapters.

I hope I've helped you! =D

How can you write a love story without it being cheesy or cliche?



Whenever I write a book it always seems to turn into a bad romance. The only ones I have finished is ones where there is no proper romance. I did a good one about an affair, but now I just seem to be writing awkward filth. 
Can anyone give me some pointers?

What kind of books do you enjoy reading?  Erotica has a large following and the books do have some kind of romantic storyline, but it isn't the focus of the book.
Have you thought about putting real life issues in your stories, perhaps a love story between an aids patient and a soldier in Afghanistan.
or a story about an illegal alien who marries a guy for citizenship, but then falls in love with him, but he doesn't believe her, blah blah blah.
Take any situation from the paper and make it your plot and just use the romance part as a subplot.
Good luck and keep writing.

I think maybe the only way to do that is to have experienced love, and have gained enough perspective to address it honestly and objectively. I don't think anyone really knows what love is until they have lived through it. To say it's hard would be an understatement! Love can be beautiful and ugly, fulfilling and painful, all at the same time. It's never, EVER perfect. I think once you can tap into that kind of real experience and write about love with honesty rather  than idealism (and I mean all writers, not you personally), you'll wind up with a book that many people identify with. Good luck!

I worked in an international bookshop for over 6 years, and the steadiest bestsellers were Mills and Boon.  I daresay there is a 'formula' but it must be easy enough to learn.  Buy a couple and identify what the main themes are, and just write the same.  You will always sell.  The author's name is not important - the fact that it's Mills and Boon is the real selling point.

Any tips on creating a fictional world?



I'm trying to create a fictitious world for use in my art. It's going to have a lot of detail - histories, geographies, beliefs, governments etc. - but I'm not sure where to start. Are there any resources or tips on how to successfully create a complex, detailed imaginary world?

I look for books that have the detail data that matches my ideas best. I bought a home design book to get ideas for room decor, plant books to include plants, rock books for geology, books on sea life for ocean animals, fossils books for historical creatures, field guides for animals, etc.



A good way to use a history or geography book is to use the style of speech and replace it with your own details. I added history by finding news stories and then changing the details to match my own novel.

Since its always best to show instead of tell for religion, political and economic behavior, think of how you could show the behavior in a scene i.e. have people praying rather than saying people pray. Often movies can show areas that are hard to visit -- I like many of the BBC series.

I create a document that contains a list of all I've decided. See the references below for books with detail lists.

One pretty standard and often used way is to start with this world and start changing things. Some obvious kinds of things that can be changed would be to have people live a lot longer, or to be able to read minds. You could also make garbage valuable and gold trash. Just start with the real, change it, and see what you want to do next.

I ALWAYS start with characters. looks, personality, ect.

As far as political systems and philosophy go, come up with something that reflects YOUR idea of great, and also something that makes people think. Make people wonder and come up with ideas.  Seriously, I am sucker for these kinds of things.

Geography- be creative! But have it reflect your society.



History- Again, it should reflect your made-up society... Perhaps have something to do with our generation, if the story takes place in the future. This is the best way about making comments about our current society.



After this, go into details. Once you have come up with the whole, create the individual. 
good luck! :)

i loved it, dont really care if everyone else hated it (although i can see where they're coming from)
jake imprinting on nessie was an unexpected twist,
and i was soo happy for him, that he ended up with someone to love and that he can be a part of the cullens family  too.
and the thought of edward and bella being able to be together forever is exactly what i've been waiting for
it was a great ending, them all being able to be together forever and ever

the only part that bugged me was that the voluturis didnt fight.
they kind of did (mentally with their powers), but i expected like a physical attack and more fighting action
but it was great anyways, the positive thing about that was that none of the major characters died

i loved breaking dawn no doubt about it, but if other ppl hated it thats just they're opinion, which im not going to try to change

ok well i JUST finished this book and decided to ask this exact question lol so im glad i found you b4 i did :) so...hmmm where to begin..first of all I LOVED the begining with the wedding and honeymoon :) buuut I personally despise Jacob Black so he coulda died in the other books and i wouldnt have cared one little single bit. So as you could prolly tell i just skimmed over Jacobs book in the middle until it got right too the end wit bella and edward again. And yes my eyes got all watery when edward n bella were telling Nessie goodbye :( but besides Jacob, I thought the book was wonderful and it had a good ending :) for some reason tho it tore me apart everytime Jacob would come into the picture and Bella was all happy, I felt terrible for Edward, but its all good now and I cant wait until the movie 
oh and I love the part when their on the honeymoon and they say "Why Am I Covered In Feathers?!?!" "...I bit a pillow, or two" lol priceless!!

I absolutely loved the whole series including the last book. The writing style was different and as far as I'm concerned, improved. Jacob's not a pedo, he just wants what's best for Nessi, of course Bella wanted sex with her husband, it's called LOVE, and I'm glad no one died etc. She couldn't make everyone happy and I think that she did very well.
I hated the last HP book when I first read it but after rereading it, loved it. People just need to give it a chance. All the adults I know who have read it said they think it's the best so maybe it's the younger readers who dislike it, I don't know...
Personally, I loved it and I can't wait for the movie (12th December!!!) and I hope she publishes Midnight Sun soon too.

I know exactly what you mean!!!! I mean before Breaking Dawn came out, everyone was expecting something different, and obviously not everything that was imagined could happen. Stephenie Meyer did the best that she could do to satisfy her own craving to write for her vampires, as well as every other person out there who would read the book. I'm with you when you question why a lot of people who were extreme fans of hers before Breaking Dawn could totally trash her after the release of the book. Breaking Dawn actually was a really good book, but some people just got mad because Bella didn't go with Jacob, or something that they wanted to happen didn't. I'm surprised that some people hated the book so much. But I'm also Team Edward (not that it matters) and I found all the twists in the book exciting and unexpected. Breaking Dawn was a really good conclusion to the Twilight Series.

So you're saying they should love all her books unconditionally just because they liked the previous ones? I'm pretty sure most of the people who didn't like the latest book still like the other ones, they're just annoyed that they didn't feel the new one was up to standard. It's ridiculous to love a book simply for it's author.

I personally liked it too but I can see why some people wouldn't.
Twilight attracted so many people partly because it had an equal amount of fighting/enemies/death/tragedy and the lovey/dovey part. In the last book Meyer focussed a lot more on the lovey/dovey part to wrap the saga up on a good note.
But she ended up turning Bella Swan into some perfect mary-sue-type (Which put people off). Also, I was a bit disappointed with they way Alice was depicted she was different in BD, she just didn't quite seem like Alice.

But this sort of thing is to be expected with books - you can't please them all especially when so many people obsess over it and get a certain storyline set in their mind as they wait for it to be released.

She's an author.
She's going to be criticized sometimes. Of COURSE there will be "negative comments" and "slagging" sometimes. If you release a product to the public, you have opened the door to let yourself be criticized, judged, and critiqued. If she can't handle criticism (and she can't, judging by her silly interviews of late), she's in the wrong business. If you can't handle that she's sometimes going to be criticized, and you can't handle the "fans' outrage"-- welcome to America! Freedom of speech. People who disliked the book have just as much a right to their opinion as you do yours.

If half of her fans hated the book, it should tell you something about the book. If a good 90% of the *professional* reviews about the book are negative, it should tell you something about the book (personally, I put more stock into what a professional reviewer says than the typically 14 year old Twilight fans).

Who the hell cares if they "worshiped" her the day before but now don't like her? I'm loyal to BOOKS, not authors. I love JKR (one of my favorite authors), but if she ever releases a crappy book, I'll have no problem saying it's crappy. Sometimes even good authors can release something that is awful. I've never liked Smeyer, but even if she someday releases something that's just amazing, I'll still think Breaking Dawn is crappy. Like I said-- I'm loyal to books. Not authors.

For most anti-BDawners, the ending had nothing to do with our dislike. We didn't dislike it because it "didn't go how we wanted it to". We disliked it because it had no plot, there were dozens of plot holes, there was no point, there was no conflict, the end was anti-climatic, and the characters acted out of character.

Sorry, there are very few fans of it. At least, not that i've talked to. All of my friends that have read it (and so far, that's about...20 people) hated it. A few of them even returned their copies or donated them to our local library. Personally, i hated it.

I really dont think it's fair that i cant visit my usual friends list etc for fer of being spoiled. It's not me posting spoilers, and i'm not looking for them. I feel like i'm being punished by having to stay away from the net until the book is released (2 days later here) when i havent done anything wrong.

Nope. Luckily, not. I've been spoiled too and I feel extremely ungrateful to the dude who posted the first seven chapters of Breaking Dawn up. It's tempting me like what cake does to a fat guy. Just sitting there on my desktop. I really gotta delete it before I open it, heh. The only place where Breaking Dawn was "accidently" sold was a local store in TX. Lucky me... it HAD to be my state. Anyways, be a true Twilighter and keep away from anything else that might ruin the story. Only a few more days.. trust me, if I can do it, you can do it.

Breaking Dawn 08.02.08 - 1 more day from now *squee*

Just free write. Something will come to you eventually.
If it's someone else's idea, it will never work well for you - as a short story, /maybe/, but as a book, it's basically guaranteed not to. Beyond that, if someone had an idea for an entire book, why wouldn't they write it?

start with your own experiences.



if you are already thinking Harry Potter style then maybe you relate to that - explore that in your own life and elaborate and go from there.



think about your childhood stuff.

Well, you just said it yourself, you want a story on wizards. So why don't you start defining the settings? If it's going to be in Camelot, or the modern world (Do you want to be a wizard? is a great series on wizards in the present day who are intent on slowing the death of the universe) or a make believe world of sorcerors and witches (The Darkangel Trilogy by Meredith Ann Pierce) or even one of mages or chanters (Tamora Pierce's books, any one; the Chanters of Tremaris Trilogy).



Shape up the setting and the main character with a character sketch, and the plot will come out in no time.

If you are going to write about wizards I would first think about how you are going to make it completely different to Harry Potter. Maybe have a girl as the main character, of from the point of view of someone completely different to Harry - like Voldemort.
Why not think about the time it is set, it could be set in the medievil times or in the future.

Maybe something along the lines of

The year is 3945, the wizard count is low, single figures. Tomorrow is the execution of the last Witch, my wife. Only me and my best friend are left. We are the last wizards on Earth.

I know it sounds kinda cheesy and sci fi but I did my best

My favorite books by Piers Anthony would have to be Bio of a Space Tyrant (6 books) followed by the Apprentice Adept series (7 books).



I have read many of his books, but the above 13 books are by far my favorites - can't really single out a specific book, as these work more as a series than a single story.

Other books that I have enjoyed are the Geodyssey books (Isle of Woman, Shame of Man, Hope of Earth, Muse of Art), Shade of the Tree and Firefly, although he has written many wonderful books. I have read a few of the Xanth books and enjoyed those as well.

I don't know if you can find the UK versions, in the US, but US versions are definitely available. You can probably order the UK versions, but shipping would probably be pretty high.

If you check the link below and click through on the title of the book, you can see which versions have been published (near the bottom of the page) as well as their availablility. You can also try the second site listed below, but I don't know if shows if it is the UK or US version. Their prices on used books are quite reasonable and they offer free shipping in the US.

The sperm would have died because his body isn't fully working. So you do have a point there.

yet another reason why Breaking dawn doesn't make sense
I mean especially since SMeyer has previously said that all bodily fluid gets turned into venom when you turn into a vampire
sperm = bodily fluid the last time I checked

Yes, Edward is technically dead. All bodily fluids including sperm turn into venom. Apparently, in Stephenie's world, vampire and human can have babies but vampire and vampire can't. Which is weird, because, a weak human can carry some demon growth spawn that's crushing her pelvis and ribs but a strong vampire can't? But it IS Stephenie's rules, so let her live it.

I guess it happened somehow, even if he doesn't have any sperm. I know, that sounds so weird. Ask Stephenie Meyer, she probably has an answer.

I don't know these authors, but I'll tell you that if you look in their books at the dedication page, sometimes they'll mention who their agent is. Just another research tip.

Also, agents don't charge up front fees. If they try it, run away. They take their percentage off the top of the check you get from your publisher and you get the rest. Don't begrudge them their fee, though. They work really hard to get your work in front of the right people and help negotiate your contracts. A good agent is worth their weight in gold. A bad agent is worse than none at all.

Theres an obscure book called "Some Talk of Private Armies" which covers all the small Allied armed groups in WW2, from Pops Private Army (a Polish distillary worker in North Africa who formed a gueriila force with his Arab workers and caused mayhem to the Germans) through to the weird British fighter unit in the Far East that had Swastikas on their wings (seriously)

This book has to be pregnanat with novel ideas.

The other weird idea is that of the Melungeons, mentioned in Bill Brysons "The Lost Continenet" and in this link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melungeon

There is a theory that they are the descendants of the lost colony of Roanoke Island, who left their settlement with only the word "Croatoan" carved on a tree.

Look Im getting 2 points for writting this crap

I have novel which I am busy with rigth now, its quite strange and confusing, that was the whole idea anyway, a person needs to read 3 to 4 chapters in order to get close to the point but that doesnt mean he/she is gona undertand, infact u have to finish the book, think while you are reading, and try to locate some of the things you read in the previous chapters, kinda brain teaser but its nice and interesting though, when I read it I wander if those things are really coming from me, the name of the novel is "The Battle for the soul"... I have another one that says "Only if I knew", and other one is "Heaven has no mercy" so U probably get the idea

Look I dont know what kind of book u blv in, every fiction writer has his or her own style, I blv in romantic, chritian and eye opening novels, if U know what I mean

I could make any number of suggestions but ultimately they may not fit your idea of a good story. It's always suggested that you 'write what you know' or certainly about something for which you have a passion.

I know nothing of your age or your interests and that's why it is so tough.

It's not just the initial idea either, there have to be plots woven through the story as well to give it a credible length.

Who will you based your protagonist upon - you or someone you look up to? or your anti-hero? What other characters will you include. Will there be a love interest? family secret? national emergency? What twists will you introduce during the story to keep the reader interested. What will be revealed along the way and what will the final outcome reveal?

What genre will it reflect, sci-fi, action, sports, political thriller, murder, etc.?

I hope this has given you something to think about and then it can be a work of your own. If someone gave you an idea and you used it and your novel was successful, they might feel aggrieved and sue you for compensation for their original idea. This question would become paramount in any litigation.

Come up with your own ideas for a novel-I have to agree fishing on here for ideas is lazy. I'd be surprised if you got anywhere as a writer never coming up with your own ideas. Use your imagination for goodness sake-something I assume you have if you write. If you don't, you're never going to be a proper writer.

You shouldn't write other people's ideas, you should write your own. It is more important to write firstly for yourself.

As someone once said, it is better to write for yourself and have no public, than write for the public and have no self.

What interests you?  You could write a story about Special Forces rescuing a senior Government official who's been kidnapped.  Another idea is to work on developing a character.  It's amazing, actually, how this can work itself into a story.  It's difficult to advise you, not knowing your interests, but perhaps a lonely old man who's befriended by a much younger man/boy.  The old man's retired from, say, the C.I.A., and has kept his secrets all these years.  Gently, the boy pries these secrets from him, and you write your book as a conversation(s) between the two.  Could be quite exciting.  Hope this helps,
Good luck

Laurell did an interview with Writer's Digest back in March.  They asked her this same question and here was her response:

"YOU'RE ON ANITA BLAKE BOOK NUMBER 16 IN THE SERIES. IS THERE ANY END IN SIGHT FOR THIS SERIES OR DO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT GOING INDEFINITELY?

I have no plans to ever stop Anita. I think of the series as mystery; it's open ended. Unless I change my mind, I'll still be writing Anita when I'm 80. That's a while away. I may have other interests by then. But I'm still having a wonderful time with Anita. I'm still learning new things about Anita and her friends. I'm still learning new things about her world.

I've had other writers ask me how I keep an interest in it. All I can say is my characters are so real to me that they make choices that aren't mine. They surprise me and it helps me to never get bored. John D. MacDonald wrote more than 20 books for the Travis McGee mystery series. And Rex Stout had more than 70 books in the Nero Wolfe series. My goal used to be 20. But when I found out about Rex Stout, 70 became my new goal."

If you're looking for stories about an everyday person in a weird world, there are hundreds to choose from!

How's about trying for starters:

The Wizard of Oz - child called Dorothy ends up in Oz after being sucked up by a tornado.

The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe - 4 London children end up in Narnia after finding a tunnel there through an old wardrobe.

Stardust, by Neil Gaiman - A ordinary boy travels across the wall in his English village, thinking to find the fallen star he just witnessed, only to find himself in a magical world.

Bridge to Terabithia, by Katherine Paterson - two kids make-believe a kingdom that ends up becoming real.

Hope these titles help.

In order to be considered well-read, I would expect you to have read .........



My teenage children are at last developing a taste for literature and I have said that I would compose a list of books that I consider classics which they may like to have a go at reading.  What would be on your list? And if you had to add a 'heavy going factor' with 5* being heavy going and 1* being light, that would help too.



</question>



<additional details>



By heavy going I mean weighty, intellectual, tough vocabularly eg The Unbearable Likeness of Being, A Brief History of Time.  By easy going I easy to follow in terms of plot, vocabulary and general readabilty. It doesn't necessarily it is a better or worse piece of literature.

Gone With the Wind 4 (uses a handful of harder words but this has got to be one of the best vocab-improving books out there :D)
Animal Farm (politically based but great book!) 2
To Kill a Mockingbird 2
The Great Gatsby 3
Pride and Prejudice 3
Tom Saywer 2
1984 by George Orwell 2
Romeo and Juliet 3
The Pearl 1
Of Mice and Men 1
A Tale of Two Cities 4
Breakfast at Tiffanys (the novella) 2
The Lord of the Flies 2

I'd say my favorites are Gone With the Wind (I LOVED THAT BOOK AS A 7th GRADER!!!!), The Pearl, A Tale of Two Cities, and To Kill a Mockingbird. I'm 13 right now and have more of an adventurous but romantic taste in literature. :) The Lord of the Flies is a great adventure story for boys especially...But with all classics, the reader has to try and analyze it after reading - that way he/she can get the most out of the book and recognize the themes. I would recommend having your teens write a short response after each book they read, or at least going to Wikipedia and looking up the book and finding out more about the plot, themes, motifs, etc. :)

Other books my teachers assigned during middle school are:
The Outsiders 2
The Princess Bride 2
The Third Eye (this is not a classic though)
Night 4
Maus (this is a graphic novel) 1-2
All of these are very good selections; I would highly recommend reading Night and The Outsiders though. Princess Bride is a good, relaxing read and it might be considered a classic...

If I had to pick only one book to be on the list it would definitely be Gone With the Wind. It has so many good themes and life lessons and I think that even as a seventh grader reading it for a classic novel project, I was able to take a lot from that book. Now, whenever anyone asks me what the most life-changing thing I have done is, I tell them that it was reading Gone With the Wind! -laughs-  The themes of determination, never giving up, and not being able to get everything you want are all very important and I think it'll be useful for the next school year - I'm going into high school! Yikes, lol.

The higher the number on my list, the harder the language will be. If I were to relist these books in terms of how meaningful and deep they are (though this would depend on the individual's interpretation):

Gone With the Wind 5
Animal Farm 3
To Kill a Mockingbird 4
Pride and Prejudice 2
Tom Saywer 3
1984 by George Orwell 4
Romeo and Juliet 2
The Pearl 3
The Great Gatsby 4
Of Mice and Men 2
A Tale of Two Cities 5 - lots of symbols/themes in this one
Breakfast at Tiffanys (the novella) 3
The Lord of the Flies 4

If I were you, I'd go to a local high school that has Honors or A.P English courses. The teachers would be more than happy to give you the lists of books that their students read, and help you pick out which ones would be good for your children's level.

Many of the "classics" are not that hard to understand, and it's always good to use the internet and such to dig deeper into the book, about the parts they didn't understand and etc.

In any case, those lists are pretty extensive and contain most of the literature our culture considers to be classic.

I loved To Kill a Mocking Bird and that would be around a 2. Teenagers usually like things that they can relate to so i would say The Outsiders is a good pick. Then there is Flowers for Algernon. The first half of that book is a 1 but the rest is around a 3, maybe a 2 and a half. That might not make sense to you right now but if you were to find out what the book is about i'm sure it would make more sense. You know it really depends on whether or not your kids are boys or girls and the types of things they are interested in because that shows what kinds of books they might be enjoy. I think they might like the book called A Child Called It and that is around a 2. They can go on to read the other books in that series if they like it. The second one is called The Lost Boy and the third is called A Man Named Dave. They are all around the same level. It would really help me to create an accurate list if you could give a little bit more information but I hope I helped.

It doesn't really matter how long you read/write, as long as you make sure to do it for a little while every day, even if it's just 15 minutes. It's a good idea to keep a notebook where you can collect things that inspire you, and you can write down your favorite passages in there. If you read and write every day, you're sure to improve a lot. Ray Bradbury writes a short story every day when he wakes up. That's a lot, but it's something I like to keep in mind to inspire me.

You can read and write for however many hours you choose. 
I think it's best to set yourself a certain amount of time for each and stick by that daily. I currently read for around four hours and write for about an hour. 
I make a note of the page number and the name of the book. It helps me to decide on how to write a certain part of a story or bring across a certain aspect. 
I also would like to become an author and, from what I have learnt - by reading different peoples tips - is that any story ideas you get, jot them down. Maybe carry a notebook with you and if you find a good plot out of something you see or have any ideas during the day you can work on them during your specified time.
Hope this helps :)

Well, your probably not going to get an answer from anyone here who has written or published a book. However, I will try to give you some pointers because I am in college, and working towards a degree in English, with hopes of writing and publishing literature someday.

-You want reading and writing to be a thing of habit, it would be great if you could implement this hobby with the free time you have. Excessive television, video games, and texting have become a thing of habit for today's disenfranchised youth. I'm not saying that these things are inherently evil, but they're never going to help you with regards to writing or anything productive along those lines. 
-Learn how to write coherently, and use proper grammar. It's a thing of rarity on Yahoo Answers to find someone capable of posting a question or answer that follows these simple and basic guidelines. If you want to become an author, you have to write like one. Try to use capitalization and punctuation whenever you write. I'll give you some slack because you are only 13 years old, but you should learn to write as though it were going to be edited or graded, even if it isn't. Most people today don't take the time to do any of these things, but it should be a focal-point for anyone considering a career in writing.

Understand that writing is not an easy field, and very few ever make it big as a writer (same odds as professional athletics or acting). Writing careers are also dwindling, considering how reading is on a steady decline as other forms of media have taken heed in recent decades. But if you want to do it, go for it, and make it part of your daily routine like an athlete's training. As for typing down sentences you like while reading, I personally don't see any real purpose to that end. You should focus more on building a better understanding of the language overall, not looking for small phrases or sentences that seem appealing or cool.

Stephen King suggests 4 hours a day of each.  Which is ridiculous if you already have a job.  I'd say, and mind you I'm no great mind, if you read a book a week and write 500 words a day you'll be doing better than most.  When writing a novel, don't skip a day, or the story will grow dank in your mind and you'll spend most of your time trying to remember who that was or what just happened in the story rather than adding to it.

I wouldn't say there is a set number of hours that you should read for. Every one is different, so reads at different speeds etc. I would recommend reading lots of different genres and styles. 
As for writing, I would say an hour or two a night for now. 
If you are interested there are some really good websites that you can post things on.

http://www.fictionpress.com/
This website is really good as you can post your orignal fiction or poetry. Readers will review and tell you what you can do to improve

http://www.fanfiction.net/
Fanfiction are basically stories about tv shows, movies, books etc. Writing fan fiction is really good practice for a young writer, because it allows you to create your own plots, but you don't have to create a whole set of characters etc. Plus it's really good fun. I'm 15 and also want to be an author, my writings really improved since I began to write fan fiction, but it's not for everyone.

Hope this has helped, and good luck.

If you like reading, read.  If you like writing, write.  If you dislike doing either one, look for something else to do.  But obviously you want to write, or you wouldn't have asked the question.  Don't set time limits on yourself, either for reading or writing, whatever you do.  Writing is art, and you can't time it.  If you want to write down sentences from books, do it.  I do recommend you grab a notebook and write down ideas as they come to you.  Also characters.  If you see someone who seems a little off-beat, try weaving a story around him/her.  What do they do?  What secrets do they have?  Perhaps they tell you a secret.  What is it?

I read when I feel like it, I carry a notebook with me everywhere I go (for ideas etc) and I write when I am in the correct mental frame for it - but that is just me! I know others who write each day no matter what is going on or how they feel. I know people who read ALL the time and then dont write that much at all.... what works for you?

OK I know this isn't that funny of a book but a really good one that you will get hooked on is Kiss The Girls. It's a horror story about a killer. If you don't like horror storys then try Where the Red Fern Grows. Not too funny, but it has alot of mixed emotions. Have fun!

I may be a girl, but i think i can safely say you'll enjoy the Warriors series by Erin Hunter. It's about a forest full of cats from four different clans. ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan, and ShadowClan. The cats fight all the time, and there are battles, some romance but not too much, heart break, omens and prophecies, and the guidance of the clan of cats who have died, StarClan. The first book is called Into the Wild. There are about 22 books right now i think, with many more to come.

Try "Don't Tell Mom I Work on the Rigs: She Thinks I'm a Piano Player in a Whorehouse" By Paul Carter. It's Pauls bio here's a synopsis from amazon.com

Since age 18, Paul Carter has worked on oil rigs in locations as far flung as the Middle East, Columbia, the North Sea, Borneo, Tunisia, Sumatra, Vietnam, Nigeria, Russia, and many others — and he's survived (so far!) to tell stories from the edge of civilization (places, as it happens, upon which most of our lives rely). Carter has been shot at, hijacked and held hostage, almost died of dysentery in Asia and toothache in Russia, watched a Texan lose his mind in the jungles of Asia, lost a lot of money backing a scorpion against a mouse in a fight to the death, and served cocktails by an orangutan on an ocean freighter. Taking postings in some of the world's wildest and most remote regions — not to mention some of the roughest rigs on the planet — Carter has worked and gotten into trouble with some of the maddest, baddest and strangest people you could ever hope not to meet.

I use to work in a bookstore and the guys loved it and thought it was hilarious.

Hi JT.
My, you do seem to have been recommended some awful books! You give no clues as to your taste, but "funny" and "gripping" is a tricky one. I will suggest "Kim" by Rudyard Kipling, a cracking adventure yarn with a good dash of humour. Then I will suggest "The 39 Steps" by John Buchan, a ripping yarn if ever there was one. For modern books it is harder, humour being difficult to come by. Try the "Flashman" books by George MacDonald Fraser, starting with "Flashman" and "Flashman at the Charge". If you like the lying, womanising, cowardly chancer (like I do) there are plenty more!

As a wild card, try Jerome K Jerome's "Three Men in a Boat" and "Three Men on the Bummel". Not gripping in the accepted sense, but funny and quite riveting reads.

Enjoy, Steve.

I'm a girl, but am not afraid to read guy books and horror stories, and am not all interested in chick lit, so I think you can consider my suggestions with a peace of mind. I've also read all the ones I'm about to list, and I loved them!! They all have a good amount of adventure, action, and humor (especially the Alfred Kropp series) . . .



Here are a couple of books that are guy-certified (meaning I've seen them being read by guys):
the Pendragon series by D. J. MacHale 
the Everworld series by K. A. Applegate (I'm not so wild about this one as I am with the others)

Here are some more books that I haven't seen guys reading but are still awesome:
the Cirque du Freak series by Darren Shan
the Demonata series by Darren Shan
the Alfred Kropp series by Rick Yancy
the Alex Rider Adventures series by Anthony Horowitz

Note: I don't know if you would consider these books to be too juvenile (considering your age), but please don't be turned off but what I'm about to say: The first two I listed can usually be found in the Children's section of the bookstore, and the others in the Young Adult section. But they're all still REALLY good. Overall, on average, they are rated on Amazon a 4.5 - 5 out of 5 stars. I believe they can be read by anyone at any age . . . well, maybe excluding the Everworld series due to all the cussing.

Anyways, go check them out on Amazon to get a feel of their awesomeness!! :D

Also, if none of the books I listed suit you, try "American Shaolin: Flying Kicks, Buddhist Monks, and the Legend of Iron Crotch: an Odyssey in the New China" by Matthew Polly. I haven't read it yet but it looks interesting and it seems to have the stuff you want, as you can probably tell by the title.
---

Another note: I don't think the Warriors series will interest you; I don't think it's what you're looking for . . . Don't get me wrong, I really like the series, but I don't think it has the type of humor and grippingness (I know that's not a word) you want . . . Just warning you. ;)

Good luck!

You have to want to write above all else.  Having said that, read, read, read.  Learn from the masters.  (And I don't mean 'Breaking Dawn' type stuff, either.)  Dickens, Hemingway, Orwell, etc.  And write!  Buy a notebook and write out any ideas you may have.  Or pick a character, develop him/her and weave a story around them.
Good luck

If you don't have a creative side then there isn't much you can do which is the truth. If you do and you feel lost try to read some books which is the advice from most people! Read some good books though, some of the classics and not that Harry Potter rubbish. Dickens, Shakespeare, Orwell ( 1984-pretty depressing book though ) and the others. Try and look at some of the sentences in articles by Borris Johnston as well. There is some good writing there!

The one I have to recommend would be The Twilight Series by Stephenie Meyer.  The books are based on the pure fact that the main characters are having to fight for their love because it is very dangerous.

I was never really interested in Fairies and Demons, but this guy knows how to write.

He gives a description so that you feel that you are living it and describes characters as if they have been your friends all your life.  Believable, unputdownable and an amazing read.

I hate to sound like one of the grammar freaks, but what's with all the capitals, that must have been really annoying having to put in all those.
Anyway, enough of that.  Have you read Dune by Frank Herbert?  It's the most amazing sci-fi/fantasy adventure ever.  It's quite dark too, it's about a royal family that get moved to another planet where the natives are hostile and another family are looking to usurp them.  The planet is all sand dunes and these big worms live in them that eat people.  Really, if you haven't read it then you should, it's awesome.
You should also give Stephen King's The Dark Tower series a go too, that's pretty amazing, all 7 books of it.  It's got plenty of adventure and some horror too.
There's a book called Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by a woman called Susanne (or Susanna) Clarke and that's really nice and magical, it's a tiny bit slow but it is good.

Like Shebam, I'm also recommending A Great And Terrible Beauty Series. The books are amazing and worth reading. 
There's also City of Bones and City of Ashes, it has everything from Vampires to Warlocks. There's humour and romance there too, and a lot of twists and turns.

Anne Rice's vampire and witch books are excellent. 
Also Patricia Cornwell's books
You have some good recommendations.
If you like myth and humour, try Tom Holt, or Jasper FForde.
And if you want a good laugh, Hitch-hicker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold is good if you enjoyed We Need to TaaboutpKevinein. As is Special Topics in Calamity Physic by Marisha Pessl, and The Secret History by Donna Tartt

Anything by Meg Cabot is a good summer read. Try Avalon High by her, or the Mediator series by her will keep you busy, and she hates Stephenie Meyers Twilight series as well!

Han Nolan is a really good writer, try reading some of her books

It's better for girls than for boys, and it's not all about "I-love-him-but-he-doesn't-love-me" blahblahblah; they're more serious, more moving stories than that. Nolan doesn't consider the reader some pubescent little kid.



Also, Francesca Lia Block, she's really good too, a little like Han Nolan

Also, if you're into science fiction, try the Ender's Series (Ender's Game, etc.) by Orson Scott Card. It's a little like Harry Potter, only in space. It's about this really intelligent kid.

Good luck, happy reading!

I'd recommend the "Making Out" series, if you can get hold of them, by Katherine Applegate - http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zoey-Fools-Aroun... is the first one. More info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_Out_... - I devoured these one summer. Brilliant!

Also, The Book Thief by Markus Zusak - made me cry at the end.

Oh, and maybe try Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging by Louise Rennison, which is really good, and I'm just lookign forward to the film. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Angus-Thongs-Ful...

Hope that list wasn't too long!

I forget the title but a hen wanted to bake bread but none of the other animals in the barnyard wanted to help.  So eventually she gathered the ingredients and she and her chicks baked the bread.  Then all the animals wanted some of it but since they didn't help they got nothing.  Nice morality tale for a toddler.  :o)

I usually take my time with books; I don't like reading fast or making a competition out of how many books I can read a day.

Just a few days ago I read A Russian Beauty and Other Stories by Vladimir Nabokov and Animal Farm by George Orwell - not that reading both those books in a day was particularly difficult, since they're both fairly short and easy.

WOW!  Going for the classics.  Good for you.  A few years ago I went on this Kabbalah kick and read Gershom Sholem and Aryeh Kaplan.  On top of that I read the Wisdom of the Zohar by Issiah Tishby translated by David Goldstein.  That was a three volume set for over $100.  I was so absorbed with the knowledge I was getting I read while I was walking down the street and walked into a telephone pole.  It was equivalent to what you read.  I'll tell you what.  Your vocabulary increases as well as the way you comunicate.  It is awesome.  Try reading some philosophy and/or psycology in between your classics.

<question>



How can I find a (probably out of print) book that my mum remembers from her childhood, without title/author?



My mum was telling me about a book that she was given when she was a little girl (over 40 years ago), and she said the book looked old then! but she said she really loved it. However, she doesn't have it any more.



As a surprise for her birthday, I'd like to find it for her - but I don't know the title or author.

It's about a young girl from Liverpool who gets invited to stay with wealthy relatives in Cornwall. She has to go on the train alone, and before she goes, her mother takes her shopping for some nice dresses to wear.



That's all my mum can remember about the plot... She said it was a small green book and it was so old and non-famous then that it's probably out of print.

Would love it if someone could help out with a method to finding this book, as i doubt anyone will remember the book from the scant story details!

Thanks

This is a fantastic and very thoughtful idea but a tough one. Maybe try some Antique book dealers and describe as much as you can to them and they may be able to help you. Maybe your local library can advise where you could find some. See if anyone else in the family remembers the book (aunts, uncles, your grandparents if they are still with us) they may be able to remember the title.  Good luck with your mission, also id love it if you let us all know if you find it.

Wow thats a lovely idea, I think its great you put so much thought into your Mums gift. (Have a word with my daughter will you ha ha ).
I used to love reading when I was a kid but that doesn't ring a bell. All I can think of is that you visit your local library or even write to a few libraries in your area with as many details as you can about the book. You never know, even if you don't get the book you might get more details if anyone remembers it.
Also try writing to your nearest university as anyone who is doing an english or english literature degree may have read the book.
You could also traipse round as many charity shops as you can find, they always have old books. You might actually find a copy of it.
I hope this helps and I hope you find the book. Your Mum will be touched you went to so much trouble.

I'd love to answer your question but I don't recognise the story at all. Perhaps you could try asking on another forum that attracts mainly older people (maybe Saga?). I do hope you find it for your Mum as it's such a nice idea to get her the book. Good luck!

Not a lot of info.  For some reason this reminds me of a book I read as a child by Ruth Chew, I can't remember which one though.  But that's really just a shot in the dark.  Honestly, the only reason that probably popped into my head was it's the only British children's literature I can remember reading.

What a great idea! I wish you all the best.

Abebooks.com has a forum - you have to register, but I've seen books identified on less information than you have there.

There's also a site called whatsthatbook.com (or they both might be co.uk, sorry) which specialises in just this sort of question.

Good luck!

Anything you write is automatically your copyright. Keep all your back up work, research and early drafts of your writing. This should be enough to suffice if you come to a dispute about ownership.



You may be advised to post yourself a copy of the work and keep the envelope unopened - but this has no legal standing. I believe you can get a solicitor to verify that the work is your own creation, but this will cost you. Another way is to lodge a copy with your bank if they offer you this service. With Barclays it costs around £20 per year to do this and you have proof of the date when your material was put into storage.

This is not a joke: The Harry Potter series. They're really entertaining! :D
I don't read a lot of english books -it's not my mothertongue- but I really liked ''1984'' by George Orwell...

You should really read ''The Discovery of Heaven'' from Harry Mülisch (a Dutch writer) though. It's a great book.



And if you like French literature, try ''Un Mort Très Douce'' from Simone de Beauvoir, it's really good. You can get it in English, if you can't read French.

Stephanie Meyers books are incredible but I must say that no one should miss The Stand by Stephen King.  Although I am not a horror fan, I do find this to be the ultimate battle of good vs. evil God vs. Devil book!  I am an avid reader (3-4 books per week) and I still have to read this every other year.

The Stand by Stephen King. Though it was complete drivel and is about 1500 pages long so could not be bothered after about 100 pages.

Birdsong by Sebastian Faulks. One of the best books ever although a bit depressing.

It's funny, because the two that sprang to mind are from the same author, Coetzee.

The first one is Disgrace, I loved that book.  It made me angry and I wanted to throw it across the room at the end when the characters made tragic mistakes (according to me), but it was amazing and I couldn't put it down.



The other one is Youth, I have picked it up several times and have yet to get past the first 5 chapters.  One day I will finish it, maybe.

Twilight is a teen romance series about Bella Swan, who moves to a rainy town in Washington state and meets a handsome-beyond-all-belief vampire named Edward Cullen.  They fall in love, but of course nothing is simple (otherwise there wouldn't be one book, much less four).  You'll see Edward's rival for Bella's love starting more in the second book.  His name is Jacob Black, and he's by far my favorite. ^^

The books in order are:
Twilight
New Moon
Eclipse
Breaking Dawn

The books are poorly written, but they can still be interesting.  It really differs from person-to-person on whether or not they like it.

First, because there's no such thing. Anyone who called it a saga to you was lying THROUGH THEIR TEETH.
It is a series.
Calling a romance between a self-absorbed doormat and an emotionally abusive stalker a saga is a disgrace to all the real sagas out there.

There's no plot to it. Bella loves Edward. Edward loves Bella. Bella cooks dinner. Bella drown in depression. Bella hurts everyone around her. Everyone around her, regardless of that, worships the ground she walks on. New vampires come out of nowhere and want to kill her.
I've read better fan fictions.
You're so lucky to never have heard of them.
And no, you don't need to get out more if it's just to find out about this terrible series. Consider yourself lucky.

I agree with the first person, but here is a summary of the first book:
Okay, ready? So it's about this girl whose irresponsible and child-like mother abandons her for a minor-league baseball player who is ten years younger then her. Said girl then goes to live with her cop father in a town in the middle of nowhere in Washington. She basically takes care of him because apparently even though he was alone for sixteen years he is unable to take care of himself. Then, she goes to school, and even though she was considered ugly in her old school, she is apparently gorgeous in Washington. She continues to be mildly self-sufficient until she meets this boy who appears to hate her. Naturally, she falls deeply "in love" with him because (and only because) he is gorgeous (because who doesn't want a guy who hates you, right?). SURPRISE! The aforementioned boy just happens to be a vampire who wants to suck her blood! She becomes totally dependent on him and ceases to be able to think, act, or take care of herself, and she ceases to exist as an individual, rather she is "Edward's girlfriend" from that point on. He is very stalkerish and creepily controlling and overbearing, going as far as to slash her tires to make sure she doesn't go anywhere, but she doesn't seem to mind, because she still "loves" him. Somehow, he ends up "in love" with her too (presumably because she smells good), and they go all gushy love scene. Then some random other vampires decide they would like to kill her (because she smells good), so they try, and of course fail, because if they succeeded that would be several million dollars down the drain now wouldn't it- no opportunity for a sequel, which she decided to make three of. 
The author then makes statements about vampires and goes back on them later in the books, teaches girls that, while it is not okay to get married in high school, it is perfectly acceptable to get married the day after, get pregnant a few days later, have an overbearing and abusive boyfriend, be a nymphomaniac/satyrist or a pedophile, and that it is perfectly okay to attempt suicide should that abusive satyrist boyfriend ever attempt to leave you.
They're badly written, have plot holes as big as oceans, and are all about how "hot" the vampire is.  My advice?  Don't waste your time or money.

2.) there was a part of him, and i din't know how dominate that part might be, that thirsted for my blood.
3.) i was irrevocably in lvoe with him.

the Twilight saga is a 4-book series following the adventures of an ordinary 17-year-old girl named Bella Swan. It's largely a romance series, with exciting endings and lots of plot twists. Twilight starts out with Bella moving from Phoenix to Fork, WA and meeting the sexy vampire Edward, after which she learns that some myths are more than fantasy.

I read all 4 (Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, Breaking Dawn), and really enjoyed them. Stephenie Meyer (the author) does an exceptional job pulling you into the story. The target audience is teenage girls, but i know quite a few adults and some boys who enjoy the series.

Bella, a human, is in love with this guy named Edward. In the latter part of the first book she finds out that he is a vampire. And that she, his true love and vice versa, has the sweetest smelling blood any vampire would want to take a gulp of. It's like a siren singing directly to your heart. But their love for each other is so profound that not even the want for her blood is gonna keep them apart.



That's pretty much the main plot, but a lot of other things are happening around them. A love triangle is quickly formed.

I'll be honest, the series didn't suck. But the last book of the series did. It's one of the shittiest endings, in my opinion. You might feel like your anticipation to finish the series will be worth nothing, but you'll definitely be happy that you finished it anyway. I hope you enjoy the book, I know I wanted to. :]

Consider yourself lucky.

It is the story of a whiny girl who moves to a new town, and everyone at her new school worships her despite the fact that she despises them all in spite of their attempts to be hospitable, and every guy there falls all over her, but she chooses the most attractive guy who is also a vampire, but not really because he only eats animals, and he sparkles for some reason. They fall in love after one word together, and are devoid of any kind of chemistry or personality (although the personality thing kind of goes for all the other characters too). The plot sticks to the last 30 pages of the book, and the entire thing is written like a 12 year old girl fanfiction. This is made even more obvious by the fact that almost every character is a Mary Sue.

I only read the first book in the series, and I barely made it through that one because the writing was so awful and the story so cheesy. From what I have heard they only get worse. All of them really send bad messages as well, considering that the books are mainly read by 13 year old girls, but I can't tell you what that is because you said you didn't want spoilers.

About a month and a half ago I was in the same boat.  I kept seeing people on here posting stuff about Twilight, so I finally broke down and read the books.  And quickly became a Twilight addict.

The book Twilight is part of series, aptly named the Twilight Saga.  The books are Twilight, New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn.

Twilight is about a high school girl named Bella who moves to the small, rainy town of Forks, Washington to live with her dad after her mom gets remarried.  There, she meets a guy named Edward Cullen.  She finds herself drawn to him and soon discovers he is a vampire.  As she begins to fall in love with him she realizes the dangers of being so closely involved with the vampire world.

Forgive my conjecture, but I know it sounds a little corny and not thoroughly thought out, and in some ways it is.  But for some reason there is something about the books that draws people in and keeps them reading the books over and over again.  They're not great pieces of literature, but I like them.

Definition of saga:

1 : a prose narrative recorded in Iceland in the 12th and 13th centuries of historic or legendary figures and events of the heroic age of Norway and Iceland 
2 : a modern heroic narrative resembling the Icelandic saga 
3 : a long detailed account &lt;a saga of the Old South&gt;



Sounds like a saga to me..... Especially with the LONG account part.

Anyway, with that said, they aren't that great. They're good, but nothing special. While the first book is really good and the third is okay, the second and fourth aren't. They're not written very well, and the characters aren't great, and the story is very unbelievable. (Yes, I know it's about vampires and werewolves, but there still must be an element of believability and consistency to it).

So, basically, I wouldn't suggest them to you. Well, I might suggest TWILIGHT, but not the other three.

Well it's about these vampires and this girl called Bella and theres loads of things that happens. Don't want to give spoilers so it's not just about romance between a vampire and a human there are loads of different things going on it's just really good. Don't listen to those people who are saying it's bad because if they thought the first one was SO bad, why did they buy the other three and read them (which they have obviously done). And I'm 14 and I don't like it because Edward or Jacob are "hot" or whatever because I don't see how you can fall in love or something with a fictional character in a book and think they are "hot". It's one of my favourite books anyway I love the saga you should read it.

It's a love story between a human girl and a mysterious vampire. It is basically about the obstacles that stand in their way before they can truly be happy.
It is a very good series and I would definitely recommend it.

Being blind needn't stop you writing. You have two options:

1) You can buy a software package with voice recognition and screen reading;

2) You can dictate your thoughts to a dictaphone and have someone type it for you.

You may feel depressed because you're losing your sight and I do understand. My father was effectively blind for the last year or two of his life and he started going blind ten years earlier. While you still have your sight, try to learn Braille and techniques for coping with blindness.

And that your daughter is a lesbian is irrelevant. She may not have a husband or sex with men but she might still have children through a sperm donor. Be happy that she's OK with who she is. Embrace her. She's still your daughter and there for you!

Maine is a lovely state. I holidayed there in '77 and '81. I adore the seafood, especially the lobsters. However, maybe your wife just wants a change. If you've got lots of money, why not take her on a round the world cruise? It might give you ideas to write about.

Looking for something a little different =) Thanks all!



Ahh, Vampire the Masquerade.. wanted to read that after watching in on roleplay sessions. I'll have to check that out for sure.

Great suggestions everyone :)



Hmm, the 'vampire diaries' you suggested; is this the series/film about a more modern day vampire scene (Was an ok watch, but a bit iffy) or the book?

Also love to watch films..but the more recent ones i've seen, that are more modern don't seem to be as much about vampire history as battles between races, or weird takes on modern vampires ('My best friend is a vampire', 'Underworld', 'Kingdom of the vampire') 
Ack and did anyone see that film 'Jesus Christ :Vampire Hunter'?



And hmpf.. whose thumbing down answers, and why? They're all good suggestions. 
I'll eventually get round to reading most.

"The Historian" by Elizabeth Kostova = amazing!!! I really recommend this to EVERYONE! Probably my favourite at the moment, very... erm, historical :D

"I Am Legend" by Richard Mathieson = it's nothing like the film (everything is different - they just copied the title), I read it long before the film came out and it's one of my favourites :D Lots of scary vampire moments... (and they are vampires in the book).



"Dracula" by Brahm Stoker = just started reading this one and it's fabby. It was written long before all of the cheesy horror cliches which makes them all seem new and exciting when you come across them.



Also try the Anne Rice series. I love my vampire themed novels and these are some of the best I have ever read. What have you read so far? :D

Anne Rice: The Vampire Chronicals. Well written beyond compare to anything else. 
Stephen King: 'Salem's Lot. Not a series, but amazing all the same.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer: originally a television series but has also been translated into comics and novels. 
There's also the Anita Blake: Vampire Slayer series, but I was never all too fond of it due to the fact that sex is very heavily involved. The idea of vampires (reanimated corpses) having sex is irritating to me.

-The "House of Night" series by P.C and Kristen Cast is pretty good, and an interesting take on vampirism in general. The first book is called "Marked". 
-Someone else mentioned " 'Salem's Lot" by Stephen King. I love Stephen King, and this is one of his best (in my opinion).
-As far as movies go, "The Lost Boys" will always be a favorite (no, it has nothing to do with Peter Pan).
-I would only recommend "Twilight" if you're partial to romance novels.

I think that's it, sadly.
I can't think of anymore.

I Would Take It Because It's Entertaining And It's The Kind Of Book That You Can Read Over And Over Again Without Getting Bored. This Is Because It Has A Complicated Storyline And I Find More Clues To The Ending Every Time I Read It.

My favourite book is The Silver Sword by Ian Serriliar( or something similar), but honestly, I would take the Bible. I have tried on many occassions to read the whole thing but have never managed it yet. Being stranded on a desert island would be the ideal opportunity to do something that I have always wanted to..Just imagine, no interruptions and all the time in the world to try to understand such a groundbreaking publication....

A Thousand Splendid Suns By Khaled Housseini

It's a wonderful masterpiece about life in Afghanistan for a young lady during the taliban. it is garaunteed to bring tears to your eyes. i chose this book, because although i have read it, i wouldn't mind reading it again and again and again until i can quote word for word. this book teaches us something about injustice in this world that leaves the reader with the sense that if they were in charge of the world they would rule as this and this. if i was stuck on that island i would love to think about what i would change in the world and how i would do it and i would set targets and goals. it will keep me dreaming, planning for a better future, whilst also keeping me intouch with the world. its a heart-rending tale that offers boiling blood, tears and hope.

happy reading =]

The front cover is mostly black and white with a girls face on it with pink flowers surrounding her face.

Yes, the Neverending Story is based on a book by the same name by Michael Ende.  It was originally written in German.  It's a bit different from the movie, but it's really really good and the way it's written is interesting.  I don't think you can find it online for free, but try scribd.com or ebooks.com.  Or just go to your library and get the actual book.  i find that to be more rewarding anyway.

It was respectable science fiction, but not the great Clarke at his best.

It re-worked themes and idea he'd dealt with before, but to no telling  effect.  The 2001 and Rama books were fresher, but his earlier short stories were the freshest of  the lot.

When do you think the climax in Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde is?



I'm not sure if it's when we find out that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is the same person or at another point in the book.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It's definitely what you say: when we discover that they are the same character. There is no doubt in my mind that Robert Louis Stevenson intended it that way. When we read the story today, everyone knows that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are the same person, but the original readers would have had no idea, and had probably never come across anything similar before. If today's readers feel that the climax is at a different point in the book, it's because they already know the story's brilliant and world-famous climactic twist.

That is a really hard question. I personally LOVE the Harry Potters. A few other good books are The Inheritance Trilogy(oops I mean The Inheritance CYCLE), The Frog Princess series, the Lord of the Rings, Ella Enchanted, The Hobbit, Pride and Prejudice, and the Da Vinci Code (by the way to the person above....Angels and Demons came before The Da Vinci Code), and Sherlock Holmes.  There is a WHOLE bunch of books I love. I hate picking just one.

Best Classic(s):
-Pride and Prejudice
-Wuthering Heights

Best Young Adult:
-Harry Potter
-Twilight - you asked why its getting rated down.  I think its getting rated down because its not an intricately crafted novel that's at least 150 years old.  See, that doesn't matter to me.  I judge a book by the quality of the story, and it's an amazing story.  It's a romance story, but it also has a ton of adventure.  It's fantasy, but it's fantasy for those who don't like fantasy or even those who do.

Can you recommend a Literary Agent



Are there any Literary Agents who specialize in working with new, established and award-winning writers from the African Diaspora?

Looking for representation from a proactive agent who handles literary and commercial adult fiction and scripts as well as adult non-fiction (memoir, biography, essays, articles).

Any suggestions, please drop me a line.

Many thanks!

I suggest you research more effectively by studying Writers Market or Agent Query or any of half a dozen publications and guides designed to help you find an appropriate agent. Make sure you also check Absolute Write and Preditors & Editors for scam artists.

You know your work better than anybody. Use "Writer's Market.:" That is the list of the legitimate ones. Pick out a few and follow the instructions they give for query or proposal. Many of them ask for particular things... and some only accept email proposals.

So dig in and find the ones that look right for you and submit to them according to their instructions. Many of them allow multiple submissions... I would recommend that to save yourself some time, since these agent can be slow to respond... even up to months!!

Because of Lovecraft's work, Cthulhu is not only 'better' in this image  but better in the writing. Cthulhu helped Lovecraft's popularity among readers and writers of horror immensely.
ADD: I should say, the 'Cthulhu mythos' but I mean the whole world built around this idea, this anti-idea, this great piece of horror writing.

Writing several novels concurrently...writers: what are your thoughts? Am I being too fickle?



At present, I'm writing a novel for teenagers - I'm about halfway through, and it's humming along pretty well. I'm still "in love" with this book, and feel confident that I'll get to the end.

Thing is, I have ideas for many more novels pulling at me, books that I'm itching to write - both teenage and adult novels. I've even planned three of them to the point where I feel I could start writing them now.



While I'm madly in love with my current project, I can feel these other novels beckoning. I feel a bit like a kid in a candy shop!



Should I give in and work on several books at the same time? They're all vastly different ideas, so there would be no danger of confusing the stories...



Do you think that spreading my creative energy over a number of projects is a good idea? Am I being too fickle?



Put it this way, I always read a number of novels concurrently - always have done. I'm wondering what the merits are of approaching my writing in the same way...

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this...

The only way to resolve this issue, is to experiment, and see: "nothing ventured, nothing gained".



Many creative geniuses of the past have worked concurrently on more than one project.



Wagner had completed the first two of his Ring operas, and was working on the last,(the 3rd Act)of the third of the four, when he began "Tristan; completed it, then turned to "Die Meistersinger" and completed it, while continuing(in his spare time) to work on the Ring: fianlly finishing, after having worked on it for a period extending over 25 years.



So, I don't think you're necessarily being fickle; but I  would be prudent, and proceed with caution, monitoring your creative quality as you go along: if this suffers, then by all means stop, and resume work on only one novel; and at the most, to begin, wouldn't attempt working on more than three at the same time.



Interesting question; would like to be appraised as to how things turn out, sometime in the not too distant future.



Much good luck,



Alberich



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Well, Alberich, I had no idea that Wagner worked this way too...I'm tempted to say, "well, if a great composer can spread his creativity this way, then so can I..." but - well, I'm definitely not a towering genius like Wagner, and had better pace myself!

Given your history with concurrent reading and your ability to multi-task, I'd say go for it.  Give each story a priority - make your "in-love" project #1, and make an effort to still give it most of your time, but have a couple projects on the back-burner for those moments you just need a break from "in love." :)

I too get it that way. But I stick to my present work with all devotion. Two legs in two boats- and you go down! I dont want to do that. SO I just do what I am doing right now. You should write down all those thoughts and ideas so that you can use them later on - fill them with character and do the research they warrant. Here lies the problem, you cannot research all the different things at the same time. SO how can you write them? I, by now realise that writing should begin after a you have a good hang of all surrounding things. So working on projects which are much different is a very tough job, undoubtedly. You have 3 novels in your kitty, but were they all written simultaneously.



I guess, there are authors who work on several things at the same time. so you too can. But, personally I would prefer undivided attention to one main project. Just a personal thought.

Are you published, Hafwen x?

I would go for it, there is nothing to lose. If it doesn't work then you can stop. I am writing 2 novels and about 15 short stories. It seems to be working out fine. As long as i'm organized!

I joined a writing community called http://www.chapteread.com. I think you might find it useful. They have a private writing area where you can organize your writings and its really easy! They have some great writing tools and posting features for getting critiques and reviews. [you don't have to post if you don't want to] The other writers give helpful advice. Worth checking out!

I am working on lots of projects at the same time. I find that is the only way I can work. I tried fighting it, but that only made me block up ... argh!

So, this is what I do. I have read advice from other writers in lots of books and magazines and have found there are a lot of US out there!

I work extensively on one project to try and finish it. When another idea comes in I write it on a sticky note or in a notebook or something. Sometimes I go to that file and add the scene that has hit me. I can write for hours like that. When I wear myself out I take a break, then go back to The Main Project and progress on that.



Sometimes the main project is the only thing I work on - especially during the editing process. For some reason, it is difficult for me to be in editing mode and then switch to creative mode. Not sure why.



Just work with yourself. Work with your strengths. Lord knows those inspirational moments don't come oftern enough - work with it.



I have files and notebooks everywhere. The best thing I did for myself and my problem of being a Bear of Little Brain is to label EVERYTHING. That way I can have a hope of finding it ... I have three file cabinets ...

If you have three MS done I think that proves you have a little self-discipline! Yes. Keep it up! You are not alone



:o)

My Projects: two plays, three novels (four?), lots of short stories, lots of poems and the MS for my (hopefully) second published book Ghostly Galion and Beyond  ... My day job is writing for the Galion Inquirer Newspaper which has taught me to crank out stories much faster than I used to. But my dream is to get back to my creative writing full time. Some day. When some of the bills are paid!

Stay cool!
God Bless!

When I'm not working on my main opera, I write. (go figure)
I write emails, answer questions here, or work on other operas.
Even though technically, I'm still writing, I see it as taking a break.
There is nothing wrong with doing what you enjoy.
Besides, does your mind ever really off the other projects when your not working on it? Probably not. 
Writing is about inspiration and life experience, why not jot it down when it comes to you?
Best of luck.

That is the advantage of using excel.  You can cut and paste, paragraphs and chapters from one 'book' to another. Drop paragraphs into new files. and build characters in separate sheets, as the writing progresses.
I paint and read the same way, two three projects simultaneously.

Why do some authors write under their own name and also a pen name?



Just wondering..
A recent example i've come across was Anne Rice, who wrote under at least 3 names... I believe that was because of the books themes (s&m erotica)

Fanbase loyalty fears.

For some reason, a majority of general audience of readers prefer their authors to stay within one genre, one type of writing. They get "upset" when their favorite authors stray and do something different--even if it's children's books a couple times when they're mainly a horror author. This is particularly true of popular authors. So some have taken on other names so they might enjoy the thrill of the write and addition to the bank account without disgusting, demoralizing, annoying or otherwise losing some of the fickle fanbase they earned under the usual name.

It gives them a chance to write in a variety of genres, and fans usually expect the same sort of book written by one person.  It's not an unusual practice--Agatha Christie did it, as did Dean Koontz and Victoria Holt.

Well writing under a different pen name gives you a clean slate, you can be a new person again with a fresh audience. That can be rewarding in many ways, particularly if you want to see what sells, your novel or your name. A new name offers the old struggle of recognition.



Then again maybe it's for shame or embarrassment. I can imagine there are a lot of people who don't want to admit that this is the stuff they write.



And as always there's the idea that it can change your image. Female authors have been known to give themselves male pseudonyms in a bid to be treated equally by publishers. Maybe they don't like their name and want something that sounds appealing, something that matches their genre perhaps.



These are all bog standard though, I'm sure there are many more reasons for not wanting to give a real name.



I love that about Stephen King dodging the one book a year rule! That's great trivia :)

I must agree with Sarah Ray's answer--one can't go wrong with Juliet Binoche, but even that doesn't do the book justice. Also, if you really enjoy the novel, listen to a song version of it by Kate Bush. Pat Benatar also did one, but Bush brings out the emotion a bit more.

okay, well im sure you've read these, but if not, you should try the Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer. The fourth sequel recently came out, Breaking Dawn.
Also try books by Meg Cabot such as Teen Idol, All American Girl, and the Princess Diaries series and Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli (well this one may be too young for you, but idk)
also try the series of the sisterhood of the traveling pants, the clique book series, the gossip girl series, 
these ones aren't so girly, but if you like humor, try books by Jordan Sonnenblick such as "Drums, Girls, and Dangerous Pie" or "Notes of the Midnight Driver".
lastly, i haven't read this books, so im sorry if you try it and then don't like it, but I've heard that This Lullaby by Sarah Dessen was a very sweet one about love and I think most of Sarah dessen's books are like this if you'd like to try these...



hope this helps!! (and I'm sorry if some were too young for you!)

i liked jane eyr(?)  the  she just comes of age  so clearly. from the start you can see her strong will and as the book goes on you see her being pressed into a mold, to break her spirit. she comes through though. you see her  at the end of the book at the real start of her life , where she is aware of her worth, knowing herself  and willing to stand up for herslef with no apologies and go after what she wants. for me the story is motivating.

"Herzog" by Saul Bellow. It's impossible to describe the effect a book like that has on you. You just feel... more human, more complex than you thought you were. It's fantastic.

"The Virgin Suicides" by Jeffrey Eugenides is also very close to my heart, because it's the best example of how something tragic can also be deeply beautiful.

The Twilight series really made me think about life and the fact that we are all capable to being the best we can be. It also opened my imagination to a whole different world. It's hard to explain, but I think most the fans of Twilight saw things differently after reading the books.

I can't remember the exact title and I don't know the author but it is teenage novel about a woman released from prison having served time for a serious crime (killing someone?_). I think it's called something like Looking for Jay Jay or Hiding from J J!

Books by Karon Slaughter and  Patrica Cornwell are usually a safe bet.  Also by books by Ben Elton tend to be good reads.  A odd suggestion would actually be the Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell.  These are books usually for guys but they are nice and gripping for girls at the same time.  Im suggested them to 3 girls before and all of them liked them.

I thought The Great Gatsby was very boring. I loved some of the other books people have listed here though like Great Expectations and the Jane Austin books. Catcher in the Rye's hero just seemed like a whiney boring teenager to me though I'm sure it was a revolutionary book for it's time.
And I loved the first chapter of The Hobbit but then it got boring so I am sure I couldn't handle Lord of the Rings.

Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad.

Literary masterpiece, with lots of intelligent insights into the human psyche and countless incidents of symbolism, metaphors and literary devices. But good God, how boring!

I studied this text for three years in a row, from A-Level to undergraduate, but although I cam to appreciate it as a great work, I would go to great lengths to avoid ever having to read it again!

Moby Dick. there is a chapter on different species of whales, a large one. if you don't like the good old sea or sailing around you will find it as boring as i did.

To Kill A Mockingbird is boring, but people think it's great. Atticus coughs out a load of Chinese proverbs, Scout needs a good slap. The first half of the book is about Scout and Jem playing around in tyres. I'd skip that if I were you, if you actually read the book.

The Great Gatsby is brilliant. It's not very jolly but it's very evocative and poetic. Anyone who can't recognise that is ignorant.
The Metamorphosis is hardly boring. I imagine you didn't understand it.

It could be excellent, but it all depends on how you write it, sounds like it'd be a novel where you'd have to get deep into your own character's minds to display the emotions and feel of what's going on, and sometimes that's hard for people to do. 
But all in all, it sounds like it could be a good idea.

It's such a good story, Stephen King already did it as Richard Bachman.  The book is called Blaze.

I actually have several ideas for novels.

One is about a man who is a caretaker of a haunted hotel (I'll call it the Overlook) and gets snowed in with his family and goes crazy.

I even have a neat idea about a Pet Cemetary where the animals come to life, but I change the "C" in Cemetary to an "S."



I think those are pretty good ideas too!

i don't know why but everyone seems to be having similar problems with pre-orders. I pre-ordered mine from amazon and it hasn't been dispatched yet it is still showing as available to pre-order even though it should be showing as in stock...

...after all the spoilers and people who said they are going to cancel maybe they can't be bothered rushing the book to the rest of us?

I have just this second also realised this problem.
My mum ordered it for me off PLAY.com on Saturday night i think it was and it said it was due for release the 4th of August, and i have just checked and it now says the 11th of August .. Would it be best to cancel and just see if it is in the shops ?
Or does it matter that we pre-ordered it before the date was changed ?

Hmm, I've never read these books myself, but after having a look on Amazon, they sound pretty cool (have just ordered them for myself!).

The author, Anne Bishop, also does another series, called the Ephemara series, which might interest you.



You might also try: Dark Desire (Love Spell Paranormal Romance) by Christine Feehan 
Undead and Unwed (Berkley Sensation) by MaryJanice Davidson

You just send it. You have to type it up a certain way (google how to) and then just look up publishing house addresses, and send it.

Most books don't get published though, so if I were you I'd write the book first, before you start even thinking about publishers.

My father is a writer and I know from him that if you just send it in to the publishers they probably wont even read it. What you need to do is go to a good source, maybe try to 'bump into' a writer at a festival or something, and ask them to read your work, they might well reccommend it to a publisher. Thats what happened to my dad.

Hi there.  I'd recommend getting a copy of the Children Writers' and Artists' Yearbook, as this has loads of great advice in it, as well as the names and contact details for all the publishers and agents of children's books. 
Many publishers don't accept unsolicited manuscripts, so you may want to research which literary agents do, and send it there instead/as well as.



Also, it's a good idea, before you send it anywhere, to road test it on a few children first - if they don't like it, or get bored, etc, they will definitely let you know, and so you'll know whether you have a hit on your hands or not!
Best of luck!

Write the book first.  Forget all about publishing and other machinations.  You must really want to write for writing's sake, not just some idea to make money.  If you've had these ideas for a long time, for goodness sake get them down on paper.  It's a lot of hard work, a lot of re-writes, etc., but get to it.
Good luck

TWILIGHT FOR SURE!!!!!!!! It was the first one and it's the reasont that got me started reading the other ones.  It made able to connect with characters so much better, and I absolutely loved every minute of reading it! It is called the "twilight series" If there was only new moon, eclipse, breaking dawn then what is the point? Not that the other books weren't awsome either...cause they were.  Eclispe was my second favorite, then New Moon, then Breaking Dawn(it was good but I was just kindof disappointed) &lt;3

______________________________________...
The Story:
The speeding motorcycle took the sharp corner so fast in the darkness that both policemen in the pursuing car shouted,"Whoa!" Sergeant Fisher slammed his large foot on the brake, thinking that the boy who was riding pillion was sure to be flung under his wheels; however, the motorbike made the turn without unseating either of its riders, and with a wink of its red tail lights, vanished up the narrow side street.

"We've got 'em now!" cried PC Anderson excitedly. "That's a dead end!"

Leaning hard on the steering wheel and crashing his gears, Fisher scraped half the paint off the flank of the car as he forced it up the alleyway in pursuit.

There in the headlights sat their quarry, stationary at last after a quarter of an hour's chase. The two riders were trapped between a towering brickwall and the police car, which was now crawling towards them like some growling luminous-eyes predator.

There was so little space between the car doors and the walls of the alley that Fisher and Anderson had difficulty extricating themselves from the vehicle. It injured their dignity to have to inch, crab-like, towards the miscreants. Fisher dragged his generous belly along the wall, tearing buttons off his shirt as he went, and finally snapping off the wing mirror with his backside.

"Get off the bike!" he bellowed at the smirking youths, who sat basking in the flashing blue light as though enjoying it.

They did as they were told, finally pulling free from the broken wing mirror, Fisher glared at them. They seemed to be in their late teens. The one who had been driving had long black hair, his insolent good looks reminded Fisher unpleasantly of his daughter's guitar-playing, layabout boyfriend. The second boy also had black hair, though his was short and stuck up in all directions; he wore glasses and a broad grin. Both were dressed in t-shirts emblazoned with a large golden bird; the emblem, no doubt, of some deafening, timeless rock band.

"No helmet!" Fisher yelled, pointing from one uncovered head to the other. "Exceeding the speed limit by-by a considerable amount!" (In fact, the speed registered had been greater than Fisher was prepared to accept that any motorcycle could travel.) "Failure to stop for the police!"

"We'd have loved to stop for a chat," said the boy in glasses,"only we were trying--"

"Don't get smart-you two are in a heap of trouble!" snarled Anderson. "Names!"

"Names?" repeated the long-haired driver."Er-Well, let's see. There's Wilberforce...Bathsheba...Elvendork..."

"And what's nice about that one is, you can use it for a boy OR a girl," said the boy in glasses.

"Oh, our names, did you mean?" asked the first, as Anderson spluttered with rage."You should've said! This here is James Potter, and I'm Sirius Black!"

"Things'll be seriously black for you in a minute, you cheeky little-"

But neither James nor Sirius was paying attention. They were suddenly as alert as gundogs, staring past Fisher and Anderson, over the roof of the police car, at the dark mouth of the alley. Then, with identical, fluid movements, they reached into their back pockets.

For the space of a heartbeat both policemen imagined guns gleaming at them, but a second later they saw that the motorcyclists had drawn nothing more than-

"Drumsticks?" jeered Anderson. "Right pair of jokers, aren't you? Right, we're arresting you on a charge of--"

But Anderson never got to name the charge. James and Sirius had shouted something incomprehensible, and the beams from the headlights had moved.

The policemen wheeled around, then staggered backwards. Three men were flying-actually flying- up the alley on broomsticks-and at the same moment,the police car was rearing up on its back wheels.

Fisher's knee bucked; as he sat down hard; Anderson tripped over Fisher's legs and fell on top of him, as flump-bang-crunch- they heard the mean on brooms slam into the suspended car and fall, apparently insensible, to the ground, while broken bits of broomstick clattered down around them.

The motorbike had roared into life again. His mouth hanging open, Fisher mustered the strength to look back at the two teenagers.

"Thanks very much!" called Sirius over the throb of the engine."We owe you one!"

"Yeah, nice meeting you!" said James. "And don't forget: Elvendork! It's unisex!"

There was an earth-shaking crash, and Fisher and Anderson threw their arms around each other in fright; their car had just fallen back to the ground. Now it was the motorcycle's turn to rear. Before the policemen's disbelieving eyes, it took off into thin air: James and Sirius zoomed away into the night sky, their tail light twinkling behind them like a vanishing ruby.

Yes it is, since the novel is about the Darkness of Man's Heart, and Beezleebub (another name for the Devil) is literally translated to Lord of the Flies ... soooo ....

And of course, the pig's head which tried to lure Simon to the dark side, too. We can't forget that.

Oh the book made me cry. Simon's death. Horrible. Horrible.

I hated the Twilight series....

I would definitely vote Harry Potter because it is a link to my childhood. I remember waiting until midnight at Barnes and Nobel for the 5th book. And I waited until midnight for the 7th with the same people for pure nostalgia.  The books aren't very compelling, but I love them because they make me feel so worry free and young.

I'd say read one series, then the other, then move on to something else. There are loads of great books out there. 
Anne Fine, Philip Pullman, Eoin Colfer, Darran Shah, Michelle Magorian, Robert Westall, all great authors, to name a few, all have written more than one book. 
Also Ursula le Guin's Earthsea novels are fantastic. Give another author a try.

Cacth 22 by Joseph Heller. ?



The character Orr manages to escape by crash landing and setting himself adrift to Sweden. A recurring question throughout the book was, why was the whore hitting Orr on the head in Rome with her shoe? The answer was because it helped Orr get to Sweden. I don't understand how it helped Orr get to Sweden. If anyone can explain to me how the act of hitting Orr over the head with a shoe helped Orr get to Sweden i would be very grateful. Thank you.



Happy reading =)

There are, but the most recent and currently available Agatha Christie pastiches are more 'Ariadne Oliver' than 'Poirot' and are written by Gilbert Adair.

'The Act of Roger Murgatroyd'

'A Mysterious Affair of Style'

They are more pastiche than parody, but tread a delicate line: there are a lot of Christie in-jokes.

If those titles tickle your fancy, the third in the 'Evadne Mount' trilogy,

'And Then There Was No-one.'

is out early next year.

ignore walker what does he know!!! what you need to do is actually contact a publishers look on the internet or in a book for a name then either contact them by phone or e mail they will ask to see your draft do not be put off by getting a first refusal because it is common that you get first knock backs and you shouldnt just contact one publisher quite a few will c
give the chance of getting accepted and the right deal also i wish you every good luck and keep at it creative is good !!!!

The very first step, and really the only important step for you, is to land an agent. After you get an agent, it's the agent's job to sell you and your story to a publishing house. (And they indeed will work hard for you, because they'll be soaking up a very good portion of your profits.) Don't even think abut self-publishing. Look up an agent.

Does anyone know this book?



a few years ago i vaguely remember reading this book where all the adults in the world (it sounds crap but it was quite amazing) somehow had a switch flicked in their brains and they because zombies/monsters... this leads to groups of teenagers grouping together and creating their own 'tribes'. I can remember some pretty gritty details about kids being forced to run to the top of a tower with a bomb strapped to them; if they made it there on time and got back they got to survive...if not....well.

it was rife with religious symbolism and a theory about how God was indeed a part of the conscience until humans developed more complexed minds, hence the fact that God was something people still find so easy to believe.

It had one of those typical names (e.g. rivers of blood, etc)
any help would be appreciated but i know it's probably a long sot.

OH please, when are you going to STOP!
I am a 16 year old girl, I believe it is important for you to know my age and I don't like the Twilight series at all...

Stephanie Mayers just dreamed about Twilight and started writing, she didn't plan her plot, and mark my words this affected her plot severely. I took this from another user called Why So Serious ?... She\He said, there are no subplots, and I agree, there are no subplots to keep you interested, only one plot and that is BELLA LOVES EDWARD, EDWARD LOVES BELLA'S SMELL, JACOB LOVES BELLA, BELLA LOVES JACOB.. The END!
While J.K Rowling has an AMAZING plot, she created a new world, and do not forget her subplots, J.K's subplots are more complex than Stephanie's main plot for crying out loud!!!



Do not get me started on Stephanie's style of writing, although some may find it good, is very weak, she uses the words too often and she writes three chapters each time she wants to describe how good looking Edward is. She frequently adds a big word to simple sentences just to make it look more professional, and that's what middle schoolers do. Besides, I would like to know, what is so fascinating about her writing in first person, I've recently discovered that it only makes the book longer and more boring. I practically vomited at each and every sick, cheesy love scene, at each and every sickening love sentence from Edward to Bella "My life was moonless before you..... Or whatever" *VOMITS* CHEESY, SICK AND STUPID.. My LITTLE 5 year old sister could do better than that!.
Tell me now, can Stephanie's style of writing compare to J.K's captivating, amazing writing ? First of all, J.K started easy, so six year olds can read her books, then the books developed as each and every fan grew, the books grew with them NOT losing her amazing style, or the ability to suck the reader in. Second, J.K doesn't use words to often, she tends to vary her ways of describing something, and NONE of her dialog lines where THAT CHEESY. Third, did J.K ever write 3 long chapters on how Harry was the chosen one, that was mentioned in each book, right, but she NEVER SAID more than "The boy who lived", see, a simple sentence that takes only a tiny space in the book, not OH SO PERFECT incredibly long paragraphs on Edward's golden eyes, amazing beauty or any other sickening thing.

Stephanie's saga is basically for young 13 year olds who didn't read many books to be able to judge with a professional point of view, though I don't call myself a professional, nor am I belittling any reader. But seriously, she stole her plot basically, now if any of the Twilighters ever read a classic book, or at least any OTHER book they'd understand what I mean!. Stephanie's plot isn't new, well I don't call human\vampire affection new, that is used in many books. Since vampires are known to be very seductive and lustful. So this means her plot is COMMON, someone long ago had that idea, the idea was written in many other AMAZINGLY written books, so why waste the time and pathetically TRY to copy a plot in a very crappy way that makes the reader want to hurl ? Spare my please! Spare my precious time, and other people's time. Now, tell me have you EVER read any other plot that has, even the slightest similarity to Harry Potter? NO there are no plots like it, J.K worked 15 years on it!! 15!!. We have to appreciate her work, she not only made drafts, she made drafts for the drafts, now how can that NOT BE professional, how can we not take that for granted ? And look how her books turned out to be! Thank god her work payed off.

Stephanie's characters well not all of them, but most, are very annoying and rather dimwitted, I wish not to relate to them to tell you the truth. Starting with Bella, the sick dependent, whiny, pathetic, oh-I'm-going-to-die every three pages girl, and the oh-so-perfect-god, the amazingly handsome, brilliant, obsessive, ABUSIVE Edward.. The only good character she has is Jacob! And he is the one I was referring to when I said "Not all of them". Look at J.K's characters, NONE of them is useless, none of them was left behind, I could easily give up Ezmy from Stephanie's series, she was useless, Neville the one character we thought to be useless KILLED NAGINI, the Horcrux, that is DEVELOPMENT. Severus, look at Snape, he's a master piece no character was ever as complex as he is!! Dumbledore, we all thought we knew him so well, then she surprises us with that amazing past, and complexity! Voldemort, even Voldemort the villain, he too is a master piece, he is so complex, the way he became Voldemort is just enough to intrigue any reader!

What morals can you learn from Twilight, list ONE GOOD moral and I'll back out, let me tell you what I learned from it:

1- Females are stupid, whiny and they should have no dreams or ambitions, they should lust the perfect man and that's it. Look at Bella, she PROVES that.
2- You have two men fighting over you, then you have succeeded in becoming the perfect female, and may the dominant male win.. Like animals you see! Jacob and Edward fighting over precious Bella.
3- You should forget your friends, your loved ones for this so called perfect man. Look at how Bella treats her friends, how she sulks around the house because oh so poor Bella doesn't have a boyfriend.
4- Men should be abusive, controlling and obsessive to the point that they sabotage your car so you don't go out, to the point that they jump and look at you when you're sleeping.. To these creepy points, that scares me just by reading them. Thank you Edward!

Now let me tell you what I learned from Harry Potter, and you tell me which book has better morals:

1- Be trustful.
2- Care for your friends, family and loved ones.
3- Love is important, you should know that it's one of the important essentials of life, no one and I mean NO ONE can live, if they're not loved.
4- Be brave, you may be small, young, foolish and careless. BUT! You sure can do a change in life.
5- Do not let anyone or anything, drive you away from doing what is right, what you believe in.
6- Just look at the amazing, truly deep, meaningful things that Dumbledore says. Look at how many quotes you can take from his speech ?
7- Facing obstacles ?, do not let that get you down, no! Go and try again and again and again, until you do it right.
8- Study! It's important that you learn, not only learn how to 'fight evil' or 'magic unreal stuff' NO! Learn and be eager for learning, sure they teach magical subjects in Hogwarts, but please, have a brain.. That sends a message to all of us, saying learning is essential, important and most important you cannot live without it.
8- Sacrifice, you must favour others, over yourself.
So which one ?

That's my opinion! PLEASE RESPECT IT!!

Don't get me started on Breaking Dawn, yes I read it.. It doesn't deserve to be called a book!

Harry Potter cannot be compared to that, it's pathetic that Twilighters compare Twilight to Harry Potter, or even say that they are in the same league. It sickens me how some say that Stephanie can compare to J.K, I take that as wishful thinking...
I apologize if you find this rude, but it just irritates me so much, that people compare them. Again I apologize, I am sorry! :)

Even though I love Twilight and Harry Potter both to death, here's my views on the matter...

I don't think it fair to compare the two. Harry Potter is extremely creative and truely amazing, but Twilight is a great story that mirrors the fantasy of many teenage girls. Each is different in its own way, and I like them both.

Even though Twilight is taking us all by storm, Harry Potter is a series that is so special to those who grew up with them, that though different series will come and go, none can replace it.



As Stephen King said about Harry Potter, "This is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages."

Harry Potter is waaaay better and should stop being compared to Twilight. They have absolutely nothing in common except the passion of the fans. Harry Potter is epic, classic, and nothing can top that. Even though I love Twilight it will always place second in my own mind behind Harry Potter. But there's a big gap between 1st and 2nd. Also, I was pretty pleased with both Twilight and HP series finales. I thought Breaking Dawn was absolutely perfect. It could not have been better in my opinion. Well maybe if Renesmee had a different name=P

Twilight is poorly-written, is not suspenseful, and obvious.
Also, Harry Potter has such wonderful adventures, humor, the characters all seem very unique, and I love how Jo Rowling thinks of the plots and years. Honestly, once you read the 7th book, everything from Harry's first year and throughout the series is crucial, and it's just GENIUS. As childish as they may seem, I'm deeply in love with the series and the suspense KILLS me, especially in the 7th. You never know what will happen!

When I first read Twilight, I thought it was rather good. However, upon reading New Moon, all the book was, for most of the part, was whiny Bella because of missing Edward. They are very predictable, and a typical romance book. I loved vampire books, especially the ones by Anne Rice, and this mostly killed it. It's just, not that professionally written and obvious!

I cannot see why people would be comparing these two books to each other! Also, whatever Bella wants usually goes. If I saw such an attractive boy like Edward and had a crush, it's more realistic I wouldn't get him immediately like she did. I haven't read the past two books, but I bet you she will stay with him and be a vampiress and have a kid. In Harry Potter, everyone and their relationships have their ups and downs, and schoolwork, it's simply more realistic, despite the spells and such. No offense to you if you loved Twilight ^^;



AND I totally agree with Why So Serious?!

are u serious?
pshh harry potter of course. its way better written and its unique. JKR is  a great author who doesn't contradict herself like Meyer. Meyer is such a bad writer and her books are horrible. Twilight will be forgotten soon, but Potter will become a classic.

how many different books have you read, i'm guessing few..

Harry is better, he's up with the greats. JK created a book that made childern start to read. And it's not just a childerns book, it appeals to both genders and different age groups. Twilight's fan base is made up of teen girls. And both writing styles re not even comparable! Meyer just put some random sh*t together whereas JK actually thought about every aspect in the book and made everything connect. And i'm a teenage girl myself, i just see through Twilight for what it really is: pathetic.

Why so serious, you said everything that i ever wanted to say to those who were comparing harry to twilight. Perfect answer

God i have to edit again, but people who ask these questions make me beond mad! Meyer doesnt have any depth to her characters the only character in the who book that had personality is Jacob. Edward is an abusive, obessive maniac! In every sentence in the book he's all about protecting Bella. Bella Bella Bella! And the Bella is a stupid whiny girl who is always like "i'm going to die!" Meyer picked the stupidest character to narrarate the story, her downfall. Ugh, is this the incredible relationship you would want with a guy? No. And i know so many of these Twilighters hate Jacob. Jacob has all the personality in the world, he acts more human that any other character in the book. Jk, made the reader feel for every single character in the book--whether it was anger, sadness, laughter. She is the mastermind and it never will be Meyer. Never.

is this a joke?  Twilight will never be HP.  I'm sorry, but they just don't compare.  I wish this question would stop being asked. HP was more thought out, way more original, and didn't have endless plot holes and hastily added in subplots.



Twiligh had a promising story, I'm not denying that.  SM could tell a story, but she can't write one.  The characters are self-centered and completely dependent on one another. There's no actual story to  be told after the inital "falling in love" thing was over with.  It was like she added random stuff in hoping it would all just fall together in the end.



JK Rowling on the other hand, planed her book for more than a decade!  She has numerous subplots and  little extras that just amaze the readers.  Her choice of names alone in the entire series shine with brillance(Reneesme? please!), not to mention the complex story and how everything fits perfectly together. JK Rowling is a master, and HP is her masterpiece.  It will never be matched, nothing will ever come close.

i've only read 14 chapters though so i'm still holding out faith!

but harry potter has always pleased me. the main part of books i suppose is really the ending and the ending in harry potter was satisfactory whereas i'm slightly doubtful if i can say the same for twilight...

first and fastest would be to try to get some short stories or articles published.  There are online competitions and magazines as well - the pay's not large but its faster than book publication and if you do decide to move into book publication it looks good to mention previous paying work in the last paragraph of the query letter.  Also your local newspaper may pay by the article to free lance writers - do some research and give them a call.

In the book publishing world, the pay is better but it takes longer and the competition is harder.  Which is probably why the pay is better.  Short of postage, printing up a first chapter or two, and investing in some high quality professional letterhead - you shouldn't have to put out any money up front.  Self-publishing is when you pay someone to print your book.  Publishing professionally is when you find an agent to represent you and they don't get paid until they sell your book to a publisher and get a cut of your advance from the sale.  Real agents don't charge reading fees, real agents don't recommend book doctors, real agents don't ask for any money up front.  Real publishers pay YOU not the other way around.  You, as an author, should always be the one getting paid for your work, not the other way around.  Self-publishing is a horse of an entirely different color (paisley) for people that just want to see their book in print in small amounts to give to friends or for people with really amazing marketing skills - that's when you spend money.

Xenoplilius 'attempted' to turn Harry, Ron and Hermione in because he thought that if he captured the trio and handed them to the Death Eaters, he'd get Luna back who'd been kidnapped on the way home on the Hogwarts Express.

It's sort of sad... he was so dedicated to making out that Harry was innocent all along, but when his daughter was snatched, he cracked. 
If it wasn't for Hermione's quick thinking during the trio's escape at the Lovegood's, they'd have been goners.

Because he knew that the only chance he had of getting Luna back was handing in the only person that Voldemort and the Death Eaters wanted above all others - Harry Potter. He didn't care about what happened to Harry as long as he got Luna back, which is why when the Death Eaters turn up at his house they ask him if its another false call out as he has previously tried to bribe them with a home-made replica of the 'lost diadem of ravenclaw' which is a head dress that is extremely relevant to the Ravenclaw house. He sends for the Death Eaters via owl whilst Harry, Ron and Hermione think he is asking Luna if the Fresh-Water Plimpies have been caught. They cotton on and an the Erupment Horn (which Hermione points out but Xeno believes it to be a Crumple-Horned Snorsnack), is exploded when the Death Eaters turn up by Hermione. They work out that Luna is away because her bedroom is as if it hasn't beel lived in for ages. They allow the Death Eaters, when they arrive, to see Harry apparate, but keep Ron under the invisibilty cloak as he is supposed to be at home sick with dragon-pox I think? They do this so Xeno doesn't completely get into trouble because Luna is one of their best friends. I hope this helped! :)

Because Jake imprinted on Renesmee "Nessie", so basically they are brothers in the sense that they like, bond and stuff and he considers him as a brother, and son because Renesmee is Edward's daughter, and Renesmee was imprinted on by Jacob.

What's the deal with recommending classics?



Whenever anyone, teen or adult, here asks for book recommendations, there's always that someone who recommends Wuthering Heights or To Kill A Mockingbird  or other classics, and I don't understand why. They are not the best books, some of the language used is hard to comprehend. And yes I have read them, and hated them (except P & P).
Those books were groundbreaking at the time when they were written, but time has moved on. So why do you recommend them when there are better modern books , ones that actually deal with today's issues , not last centuries...?
Basically, why live in the past?

Well, obviously "time has NOT moved on" because they are still classics. And, just because the writing may be a little challenging doesn't mean that you should shy away from classics; most of them have the most original plots out there, compared to some of today's books that are just the same stupid story. 
I like to recommend them because some of the situations are the same, no matter what time period. To Kill A Mockingbird deals with racism: there is racism in today's world, is there not? 
The fact that you say you like Pride and Prejudice totally disproves your point, because you are saying that you enjoy the book, and possibly relate to the plot or to some of the characters. The way you feel about P&P is the same way other people feel about other classics.

An important part of the definition of a classic is that it survives the test of time. There are lots of good books that have been written more recently, but many (or even most) of them will be forgotten before too long.

Oh dear, you clearly have been reading the wrong classics.  It is so not about living in the past.  Yeah, there's some good modern books around but you can't beat books like Pride and Prejudice, A Tale of Two Cities and Jane Eyre.  I'm with you on Wuthering Heights though, I hated that one.
It's not that they were particularly ground breaking at the time, I mean, look at Dickens, he wasn't particularly original, he was just class.  Even Shakespeare used a lot of old stories, he just told them really well.  A classic is a classic because it's as good today as it was however many hundred years ago it was written.
You should watch yourself asking questions like that, it makes you sound a bit of a prat

True classics are not classics simply because they are enjoyable books. What makes a book a classic is dealing with timeless themes that are still applicable to modern times.  The word choice of those authors may seem dated and thereby sometimes difficult to read, but the value of the book is still there both in entertainment value and educational or historical importance. There are many, many wonderful modern books to read, but not at the expense of never reading the classics. There is time for both!

That is your opinion. Not everyone loves the classics. But most people recognize their worth in the literary world. I agree that Wuthering Heights is awful. But To Kill A Mockingbird is an amazing book. Just because you  think modern books are better, doesn't mean everyone else agrees.

But what books are suggested depends on the question. If you want only modern books, say that. If the question doesn't have specific parameters, then we can suggest whatever we feel the asker might enjoy.

Because as many have said, they are classics. They have stood th test of time. Around 5 years back Wuthering Heights came top in a romantic fiction poll.
The other thing is they are part of the English Cannon, and will still be around when most of the current best sellers have gone out of print.

1. If the question warrants a classic recommendation, why not recommend one if it matches what the asker is requiring.

2. One of the basic (and to me, most important) characteristics of a classic is its timelessness.  The fact that you, personally, may not like the narrative style or the subject matter of most classics that you have read, doesn't make those books irrelevant in present day.  A classic like Jane Eyre is a story of love and it sends a message of love and hope.  A classic like Frankestein delves deeply into complex filial relationships not to mention the issue of messing with the natural order of things and someone playing "God".  An adventure classic like The Three Musketters deals with notions such as friendship and loyalty.  Modern issues?  War and Peace deals with the issue of invasion and war.  Little Women deals with the issue of how war affects a normal family (it may be a family from a couple of centuries ago, but still, it doesn't make it less understandable).  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn deals with the matter of coming of age, all teenagers irrespective of when they were born, can relate to that.  On top of that poverty, an alcoholic parent, etc.  I could go on and on and on.



3. Not all modern literature is better than a classic.

If you don't like classics because you find them boring, fine.  If you don't like them because you can't fully relate due to the time in which the action of the story takes place, fine.  Reading is as much a matter of personal taste as anything else so reading preferences are highly subjective.  However, don't disregard classics just because you, personally, do not like them.

Reading a Classic is not "living in the past".



Books are called classics because they have stood the test of time, and still have something to say to us.  To Kill a Mockingbird was written in my lifetime. In the opinion of a lot of people who have read a lot of books, it remains one of the best books about racism in America ever written.  And if you find its language hard to comprehend, you need to improve your language skills.

erm, sor-RY but some classics are easy to read- to kill a mockingbird, as you mentioned, is one of them. the characters are wonderful, the plot is great. i think those things go beyond the time when it was written.



besides, they are beautifully written, some of them, and if you're a reader looking for a challenge and some depth, i think les miserables would be far more suited to you than twilight.



we're not 'living in the past', we're enjoying the fruits of what the past has given us in the form of great books.

I honesty don't think they're that difficult.  The language really isn't that difficult unless we're talking like, Shakespeare or something.  But once somebody is in high school they really shouldn't even have much of a problem with Shakespeare as long as they are good readers and read it slowly.  I read Shakespeare in 8th grade and it was no biggie.  If we are asked to recommend good books, we won't recommend something like The Clique or Twilight or Gossip Girl, because those aren't good books.  But there are plenty of good modern books that I have recommended.  They include Memoirs of a Geisha, Running With Scissors, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Secret Life of Bees and many more.  But some modern books that I like are very inappropriatefor someone in middle school or around that age.  I won't recommend a book like Running With Scissors to a 12 year old, even though they'd be able to read the words.  It's still a great book, though.  =]

That is a very uneducated way to look at it.  These classic books actually have depth and meaning.  They're books that deal with more than just the times, they deal with the human condition and deeper philosophical questions.  Books that are written lately are written to make money, not to explore, debate, imagine and wonder.  They're all about money, shallow relationship problems, sex and other things of the sort.  Basically, each book on the shelf lately is not so different from the one next to it, especially as it pertains to young adult sections.  That's why we read it, instead of things like "Twilight" and "The Clique" and "Gossip Girls".  You should try it too- just because you didn't like Wuthering Heights or To Kill a Mockingbird doesn't mean that you won't like other classics, like Jekyll and Hyde or Frankenstein.

You know the addage "True Classics Never Go Out of Style"? Well, it's true. People recommend them as good books because despite the passing of time, people still consider them GOOD BOOKS. And I'm NOT saying this personally about you, but I think a lot of people find these books "hard to comprehend" because they are lazier readers compared to that time. It's worth the read; sometimes it just takes more time.

I have to agree with EvilEDD on this one.  Classics have stood the test of time.  I enjoyed Jane Eyre as a 9 year old.  I still love it even now at nearly 40 years later.



Todays modern books will be mostly forgotten in years to come and can you seriously see the Twilight series being around in 200 years time?

To Kill A Mockingbird is dull.
Don't be so ignorant- clearly they are some of the best books, hence the popularity. You not understanding them does not make them bad books. It means you need to work on your vocabulary.
And you're naive to say that classics only deal with 'last century's issues' or 'uncool' things- Lolita, considered a classic, is about paedophilia and is certainly relevant today.
Pride and Prejudice is good but it was never groundbreaking :)

A lot of modern books are based on classics, except dumbed down. Which books do you like, may I ask?

Basically get your head out of the sand and invest in a dictionary. You not understanding them is due to your ignorance/lack of interest, not to them being bad books.

EDIT: You're wrong for saying people don't think the same as they did back then. It is society that thought differently, not people.
They are books, okay? Just as one cannot shun all modern books just because they didn't like/relate to one, you can't dismiss all the classics simply because you didn't relate to some. Why not try modern classics then- written in the 20th century? You might feel more of a rapport with them.

I agree. There are some really great books that are more modern. I can not relate to many classics at all. It's not the writing styles a much, but the way the characters are. I think that people have changed considerably since books like Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights were written.
There are books nowadays that deal with racism and social context, which are much easier to read and understand, and also enjoy. I will not fault people ever for reading classics. A book is, after all, a book, and as long as people are reading, what is there to complain about.
I'm glad you asked this question because it seems to me like people are always knocking others for reading things like Twilight or Harry Potter, saying we should read classics, not trashy novels but at the end of the day, a book is not just for educational purposes, but enjoyment.
I do like some historical novels, like the memoires of a geisha and others like that. I love the Twilight and Harry Potter series' and am very fond of Malorie Blackman. 
I think it just depends on how you see reading. Some see it soley for enjoyment, others do not.
People shouldn't knock stories that are written now because after another century or whatever, they may well become classics too.
I personally learn more from reading modern books that older books because I relate better to it. People don't think the same now as they did when many classics were written therefore some of the points they make are not strictly relevant any more.

Because a good book doesn't derive its value solely from being "groundbreaking" or popular at the time. The best books are considered classics because they still speak to fundamental human concerns, even though they were written long ago.

To be honest i think everybody starts reading the pulp novels for enjoyment and always will, I think the reading the "Classics" are something a lot of readers who have read for a long time feel they have too get round to doing, just like many cinema lovers will sit through Citizen Kane, maybe just too see what all the fuss was about.

I have tried myself to read some classics, with mixed results, I couldn't get through "To Kill a Mockingbird" as it kept reminding me of school. However "1984" and "Animal Farm" i really enjoyed, each too there own I say, You got to remember there classics for a reason, some books shouldn't be forgotten.

I can't stand most modern books. It takes some time for me to foment with an author I like. I'm no bestselling author myself, but some of the tripe they pump out today can't keep me for more than a few pages. I've tried, I've really tried.



I started reading the classics when I was a kid, I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. I got through a few things, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, The Secret Garden, The Arabian Nights. Maybe all that influenced me for later. I don't have a hard time reading through the language, and when I have had trouble I discovered it passes once you get into the story.



To me, there's more story there because it wan't just a story. I can't speak for all classics as I still have a long way to go, but what I can say is that they have something that's missing from most of today's novels: soul. They are more real to me than just about anything else that sells today. They don't just say what goes on they leave the reader to think. They capture humanity in its essence perfectly, and people recognise that and cling to it. Some people have the power to put into words what others may spend a lifetime trying to explain. The story may be good, but it's when it speaks to you that counts.



Don't get me wrong, some things that are made today are good, but they're not great.

This is Henry James doing Gothic rather than the real thing, but none the worse for that. There are various allusions to other works such as Ann Radcliffe's Mysteries of Udolpho. Does she see them - we have to believe she thinks she does for the story to work. I don't think we can ever be sure - but the sense of malevolence seems real enough.

I think that the lure of the story is finding out whether the Governess is delusional or the children really communicate with ghosts - but it is purposefully never resolved. Every event can be explained either way - the children are seeing things or the Governess is stark mad - and no authoritative explanation is ever given as to what REALLY happened.

It's a great text to look at "unreliable narrators" and "narrative framing". Throughout the whole text we are asking ourselves "Is the governess reliable or not? Can we believe what she is telling us?", and that's the whole point of reading on - to find out! Sometimes we think "ah ha - the children are definitely in touch with the supernatural", and then on the very next page we think "ah ha - the governess is definitely bonkers"! Yet we never find out, because no reliable voice says "this is what was happening all along".



This is where narrative framing comes in. If I remember rightly, it's narrated by a(n unknown) female, who is listening to a man, who in turn is reading a letter written by the Governess. Therefore the text has two frames. The story, in letter form, is being read by a man, so this is the first frame: the Governess's story is within the man's story. But it is someone else who tells us that the letter is being read by a man, and so this is the second frame: the man's story is within the narrator's story!  So we have to think to ourselves, "Who is actually speaking here? Is it the Governess through her letter? or is it the man, who might be saying something slightly different to what is written down? or is it the narrating woman, who has forgotten or has changed what the man has said?!" It all gets very complicated... which is why it's so damn good!

And here's an interesting little thought experiment: how would we interpret the story if, at the end, we returned to one of the frames? If we went back to the man after he'd read the letter and he said, "And since then the Governess has been locked up in a mental asylum", we would surely think, "ah yes, she must have been bonkers then". Or if we returned to the female narrator and she said, "after my friend had read the letter I went to visit the actual house, and I'm sure I saw one of the ghosts by the lake", we would surely think, "ah yes, I knew all along that the children were actually seeing ghosts!". This helps us see the importance of narrative framing and unreliable narrators. The text just ends at the end of the letter, and so we don't return to one of the frames. There is no authoritative voice to say "here's what's happening, you can believe me".

Phew... that was a bit of a spiel. Hope it was of some use to you!

The titles of four of James Herriot's books remind me of an old Anglican hymn.

The books remind me of beautiful, rolling hills, a skilled veterinarian who was both humble and humorous and often laughed at himself, all types of animals with varying degrees of ills healed by James Herriot and some of the specific stories in the books.

It reminds me of a bull with sunstroke, a horse that picked James Herriot up by the collar, a dog so badly injured that nobody but James Herriot could have saved his life - or even tried to, a woman who "made a difference" in the life of a sweet but badly abused dog and many other things.

All Things Dull and Ugly



All things dull and ugly,
All creatures short and squat,
All things rude and nasty,
The Lord God made the lot.

Each little snake that poisons,
Each little wasp that stings,
He made their brutish venom.
He made their horrid wings.

All things sick and cancerous,
All evil great and small,
All things foul and dangerous,
The Lord God made them all.

Each nasty little hornet,
Each beastly little squid--
Who made the spikey urchin?
Who made the sharks? He did!

All things scabbed and ulcerous,
All pox both great and small,
Putrid, foul and gangrenous,
The Lord God made them all.

Amen.

Nope, i have Facebook, My Space and a few other blocked on my pc as i do not want my nieces and nephews using social networking sites as they are rife with people grooming children. A lot of children ignore the instructions on how to say safe online as they think it will never happen to them. But truth be told an offender can find out where you live what age you are, if you have kids, the kids names/ages and your movements (where you are gonna be at a certain times) just from a simple profile on one of these sites.

Lol, I hated that book. It's a good friend's favorite; he bought me a copy and I felt awful because I just loathed every word on every page.

Personally? If the first chapter didn't grab you, the rest probably won't. So I'm going to say no. I think it's worth a read, because it is a somewhat famous book and it's always a good idea to read widely. I'm glad I read it, even though I hated it. You might feel differently, who knows?

Think others have corrected your spelling here, but the book is called "The Tales of Beedle The Bard" due for release early December 08 in 3 different editions. US, UK & Collectors edition which is supposed to replicate the handmade book that was sold last year for almost £2million!

It doesn't actually have Harry Potter in it, though one of the stories it contains was in the last book of the harry potter series. It's a collection of wizarding tales, with strong moral guides, rather like aesops fables.
From reading reviews some of the stories will be quite dark compared with HP, though in the standard editions each story is accompanied by an analysis from Albus Dumbledore!

What the serious Harry Potter Fan should be looking out for is a coppy of the Harry Potter prequel, a short story starring Harry's dad. Though as only 10,000 copies have been published it will be difficult to get hold of a copy.

The new book is the Beedles and the Bard which is a book of fairy tails mentioned in Harry Potter 7 so it's still Harry Potter.
I'll probably read it and anything else she comes out with.  I used to be more enthusiastic about her and then I read twilight, which isn't neccesarily better, the obsession is just more recent and it's got more romance.

I'm not being mean, but if you can't come up with a story on your own, then you really can't write fiction. Great fiction comes from authors who are passionate about telling THEIR story. Not somebody elses.

Yes, I have some ideas, but you can't have them. Sorry. If you are writing for your own entertainment, then you can try writing fanfiction or something. If you are actually trying to write a story, then you need to come up with your own story. There are 2 parts to being an author in my opinion: thinking of a plot and writing the plot. You can't steal someone else's idea and call it your own.

If you can't come up with an idea, you won't be able to come up with the story.  That, and why would you want to use someone else's idea?  Or why would you expect someone else to let you use their idea?

I've just spent the last 3 hours fleshing out an idea for my next novel.  I've actually been working on it for almost a week, and will probably spend another week on it before I'm ready to start writing chapter 1.  The idea is part of the work of writing a story.  Don't expect others to do it for you, to let you use THEIR hard work, and for that matter...don't sell yourself short!  Come up with your own idea, and write it!

Twilight is really getting old. Doesn't anyone read anything else? Then again, it was just like this with Harry Potter.



Anyways, Anne Rice is the Queen of vampires. Read her novels, and you'll never think the same about vampires. :) Try the "Hollow Kingdom". It's about goblins. Perhaps, try for the more adult "Lord of the Rings", because they are classics and amazing.



Even though it's not a supernatural book, I also suggest "13 Reasons Why". It's a new book that I'm just crazy about by Jay Asher, and it is predominantly about this girl who committed suicide. It's really good.

let's think about all the bad movie adaptations of books out there-

narnia (both of them sucked)
harry potter (got progressively worse as the books got longer and they had to keep on cutting things out)
eragon (haha major fail)
the golden compass (missing something...)
and more...

now let's think about all the really good adaptations of books out there...

the lord of the rings (amazing!)
pride and prejudice (bbc version, not keira knightley)
and that's all i can think of now...

so where do you think twilight is going to end up? my guess, the bad pile.



i hope they give bella a spine in the movie though...she's a disgrace to feminism as she is in the books.

but we'll see, we'll see...

I'm not worried, SM said that she was happy with the actors and actresses chosen to portray her beloved characters. She said she was especially ecstatic about Robert, as am I. The moment I saw a screen shot of him playing Edward, I knew that was exactly how I'd pictured Edward in my mind. I watched the trailer, and I think he makes a perfect Edward...he can definitely pull it off!

I think like all movies made from books, there will be good parts and bad parts. Remember, not everyone has read the book, so they need to make this appealing for them as well. As a fan, I really hope they do make it relatively true to the book. I think Robert Pattinson will do a good job as Edward. I think you have to make the decision. Are you going to enjoy the movie, as they made it, because you can't do anything about it. Or are you going to remark on every little stray from the book, criticizing the actors and the way they filmed it.



I really hope I didn't come across as ruse, because I did mean it in the best of ways. But really, you can't do much about the movie. Stephenie said she was extremely impressed with it, and in my opinion, she has pretty good taste when it comes to vampires. :D

I don't think a bad movie will necessarily ruin the books.  Everyone who already loves the books will simply condemn the movie and become sort of Twilight purists who only put any stock in the books.  But a bad movie won't pull in new fans, which is what a movie based off of a book should do.  The only problem is that Twilight is so popular.  I know a crappy movie came out pretty recently for The Dark is Rising, but the series isn't in any sort of spotlight right now, so it really didn't matter except that fans were disappointed.



I don't really expect much from the movie though.  I'm not terribly impressed with the trailers... I guess we'll just have to wait and see.  ^^

i think the movie is going to suck. Stephenie's books are pretty dramatic and I think a film version of that would not work well. I guess it depends on the actors and the director, but from what i've seen in the trailer and the film clips...the movie looks too melodramatic.

I have four copies of the 1957 printing of the book I bought years ago from Whitby.  They are all in very good condition (the paper sleeves are a little faded)  I think I only bought them because they were trying to get rid of them and I love the smell of old books.



If you message me your address I will send you a copy, I need to make more room on my bookshelf anyway lol.

I've used the book and set up a site for people to get a better idea of what's in it.  You can preview the book at http://www.tw-jackson.com

It's not going to work for everybody, and I don't think it claims to do so.  Some relationships are too far along to reconcile, others have problems that are too fundamental -- meaning you're just wrong for each other.



But a lot of people, over 6,000, have successfully used the book to get back together.  You won't know if it works for your particular situation unless you give it a try.

Best of luck to you.

Hey Derek,

I find myself pretty confident answering these questions now.. I used the Magic of Making up months ago as a last resort to save my marriage.

To my success it WORKED!  Boy was I excited, everything paid off.  I had to come to a decision, pay the $39 for a book that guaranteed to work, or waste hundreds on marriage counseling.

The choice is yours but I chose choice #1.

To get a full review of the book visit www.comegetanswers.com

Good luck Derek!

Thanks

Of Mice And Men essay for course work?



I Have To Write An English Essay On Of Mice And Me( the novel). I Have To Answer The Question: "The character lennie epitomises Steinbeck's message: no matter how hard we dream. reality always finds a way to shatter our fantasy" how far agree with this statement. What Am I supposed To write??

That´s a tricky one as I am not sure Lennie epitomizes Steinbecks message.If indeed there is a message at all.But then you won´t get points for arguing with the teacher.It´s a simple tale.And Lennie is a simple character.When he talks of living off the fat of the land.He believes it.No fantasy.He is a realist.He touches pretty girls hair because they are pretty.No dream.Now the problem is Man..If that is reality..so be it.It is people that destroy Lennie.Fair play he strangles a girl.And so  George shoots him
,Now the title comes from a line from a Jon Donne poem which goes something like:The best laid plans of mice and men go astray...So again it not a fantasy but a plan.If any one knows better it should be George.He is the dreamer.Getting a little stake together to buy land when it ends in disaster every time.But to keep Lennie happy he tells him of a glowing future with rabbits and puppies and of course..the fat of the land.So in short tell your teacher they have it wrong.

Well, you need a thesis statement that argues your point,  Are you going to agree with the question or not?  If you are, you could talk about George's realization that he cannot protect Lennie and his decision that he is better off dead.  In a way it's a shattering of his dream of them living on a homestead together, and is symbolic of all the characters' shattered dreams,

English essays = LOADS of writing! Plan the essay out; point example explain - make a point, use a quote from the story to back it up, and explain it :) You need one of these for each point the essay is worth. With these questions, they don't really want to know what you think straight away - you will need to argue both points, with a summary of what you think at the end. Don't forget an introduction consisting of your translation of the essay question. Have fun ;)

Of Mice and Men is a classic, and also one that I have never read, though it is on my list to read this winter.  However, there are numerous free on line resources that can help you with your study of this novel, most of which analyze the story, discuss themes and symbolism and other literary devices, and give character sketches.  If you do a search you will find many helpful resources.  Additionally hundreds of questions have been asked here on Y!A about Of Mice and Men so do a search for it in the Yahoo Answers search window and you will find lots of Q’s and A’s that should help you.

Have you read the book? You're writing an opinion based essay so you will need to have a good grasp of what happened in the novel.  You might skim through the book with the parts about Lennie in your mind and write down what happens to him throughout the novel.  You basically just need to decide if you agree or disagree with that statement and then pull examples from the book that prove your point.

I am an English teacher, and you should not have to post this kind of question.  What is your own English teacher up to?  You should know this book back to front.  I could write the essay for you, but I'm not going to.  When I teach any text, whether it's GCSE or A-level, I make absolutely sure that every single one of my students knows the book back to front, and they will not be fazed by any exam question.  They all pass with an A.  Speak to your teacher or your head or anyone who can find out why you have to post this kind of question here.

I know you can read a lot of Classic Literature on the Internet legally - there would also be modern book sites but often the books are not legal so I would suggest you to avoid these.

Among the classic literature part, you can try out the following resource which has a really good collection:
http://www.webliterature.net/literature

Among the classic books, girls tend to love works by Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters and Lucy Montgomery to name a few - so chances are that you might also love many of them.

My mom and I enjoyed the Dark Towers series.



"In the story, Roland is the last living member of a knightly order known as gunslingers. The world he lives in is quite different from our own, yet it bears striking similarities to it. Politically organized along the lines of a feudal society, it shares technological and social characteristics with the American Old West, as well as bearing magical powers and the relics of a highly advanced, but long vanished, society. Roland's quest is to find the Dark Tower, a fabled building said to be the nexus of all universes. Roland's world is said to have "moved on," and indeed it appears to be coming apart at the seams — mighty nations have been torn apart by war, entire cities and regions vanish from the face of the earth without a trace, time does not flow in an orderly fashion; even the sun sometimes rises in the north and sets in the east. As the series opens, Roland's motives, goals, and his age are unclear, though later installments shed light on these mysteries."

LISTEN.
It is a book. It is not a lifestyle, or something to be obsessed over, and definitely not something to actually die for. If you've made Twilight that big a part of your life, then maybe you should try to seek professional help.
I repeat: IT IS A BOOK.

Actually, Persi is kind of in a class all by herself, a kind of rolemodel for the antis. Molly and WSS? are more of our leaders. But I suppose that an in-depth analysis of the anti-Twilighter hierarchy wouldn't be the best thing for you right now.

No dear, I don't win. I read this book over two weeks ago and not once did I ever say a single word to any of you about what was in it. I read your theories and chuckled, but I never answered them. I could have, but when I finished writing my review, I tore my ARC (they are softcover) into pieces and shredded it. I shared with nobody.



Ed isn't what you thought he was. He wanted to abort his own child. Then he tried to pawn it off on Jake. What is truly sad is Jake was a decent guy and Stephanie chose to make him the second pedo in the wolf clan. That is disgraceful. The high school was filled with girls he could have imprinted on. Not a baby.



I did not want it to come to this. I even wrote and asked Yahoo personally to shut this forum down tonight. I have been trying to prepare you for this. How many times have I said paper and ink. That is all they are. And it's true. That is all they are. Stephanie Meyer is on drugs. She is the one who loses. I doubt her publisher will release Midnight Sun now. And how are you going to feel when the movie is bad too?



I drove to B and N tonight. I saw kids in limousines in full prom regalia. It cost some parents big money for this party tonight. And it hurts me that she let everyone down. How many times have you heard me say I treat being an author responsibly? I care about what people think and how they react to my work.



And you haven't heard me say a single word about the fact that I donated stories to an anthology raising money to rebuild libraries in New Orleans, have you? How do you think I feel knowing all this money was spent on this trash when it could have gone to help the libraries?



There are no winners here. There is only one loser -- Stephanie Meyer. Now take the book back and get your money back. Send a message to her that you aren't supporting her drug habit and that her book sucks. Pax-C

i hope she doesn't get really bad reveiws though becuase that will make her feel down.. and she did write three awesome books :)



BUT listen to me.. there was no fight i mean its not anti-twilighters vs twilighters. i hardly doubt they wanted to 'win' as you put it, they just were warning some of you guys, sorta



it's hard to explain... i just think, in my opinion, that nobody has won becuase there was no fight :)

Cinderella (One of the oldest fairy tales ever told)
Sleeping Beauty
Beauty and the Beast
Peter Pan
Hansel and Gretal
Aladdin  (Was included in 1001 Arabian Nights)
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
Little Red Riding Hood
The Three Little Pigs
Goldilocks and the Three Bears



Possible even Rapunzel
Rumpelstiltskin
Jack and the Bean Stock
The Princess and the Pea
The Emperors New Clothes

The Most Popular Fairy tales tend to have been changed and popularized by Disney. They generally don't resemble the original outside of basic story premise. It wasn't until The Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson cleaned them up that they lost their gruesomeness. They used to give Hostel and Saw a run for their money.

What tales are most popular to day is not necessarily what was popular 10 or 20 years ago.

Tell me what you think of my love story?



Story of...



The two spy's who fell in love...

I was 17 then and living in england. I was staying with my gradmother, While my mother was living peacefull in america. One morning I lift for school. And I remember coming home! My gradmother came near me crying and said... You'r mother is in trouble. Then I knew I had to fly to the united states to save my mom. So I grab all my stuff, got on my first 232 airlines and took off. As soon as I arive! I knew I had to keep a clear eye for any signs of danger. I could not trust anyone!  I grab all my stuff and I hop on to a cab. While I was in the cab. The driver who kept looking at me trew his review mirror. I had to keep my cool. He could be trouble. Soon he drop me off at near the stree not too far from where my mother would stay! I pay the guy and he drove off. I ran down the street to my mother house, hoping to fine a clue. As soon as I got there. I went inside! I look around, then soon I found a letter saying... 
"If you want your mother alive! Bring me the blue stone before 9pm TONIGHT!!!!!"  The blue stone I though!
The blue stone was the blue ball neckless that cost millilons that my mother sent to me as a birthday gift. They need it that stone to take over the world. 
Before I lift! I seen a wallet on the ground that they had drop after they kidnap my mother. Inside the wallet was a picture id. The Id almost look like the driver who I was with inside the cab. Soon I knew this was my guy to grab. 
I left the house and I went down to my own friend that I knew who can help me fine out where to fine this guy I must kill. I arive to my friends house, told her what happen. She grab out her labtop and track down who he is. She got everything on info. I knew he was mines now. So then I head downtown. I went inside into a bathroom and put on a fake wig and clothes ware so noone will know who i was. I sat down, was reading a babys book of todays world. Soon I seen him walking! Black suit, shades, and good looking hair. I could not let him think I was onto him. So I acted like I was just heading somewhere else. I chew a peace of gum, trew it on the ground, hoping he step on it. He step on it! And now I could track down his foot prints on my eye glood ware that can see footprints. I flow his foot prints, seeing where it lead. He got near a place where the foot prints end. I felt I was goin to lose him! So i started to rush, hoping to catch up with him.  But as soon as I got there! COUGHT!!! He got me!! I froze up! Knowing if I dont panic, he wont atatck. He look at me with a straght face! Shook his head, and grab a picture of him from my pocket, and he grab a picture of me from out of his pocket! And hold them together. He smiled a bit! As for me all I could do is just look at him, I did not take a punch or even say a word. He just grab my hand and said...go fine your mother!
Then I said... Don't you have her?
He laugh and said... "My dear, I'm a spy too! I was sent to fine her as well. But you are doin it the wrong way. 
And I stap and said... Oh yeah! Like how would you know how to fine her?? 
Then he said... "How about I take you out to dinner and will fine out.



(Sorry Im goin to skip a few parts. cut this short!)



Soon me and him started to date. Then he made the most dangerest thing of all...
We started to marry.



And yup thats the story....what you think?

you have MANY errors and its very hard to read. 
Your grammar needs improvement, you use many ! and . when they aren't necessary. 
You have a lot of misspelled words.
The story moves too fast and is flat.
You jump from past tense, to present, to past again, which makes reading it very confusing. 
Your characters are flat. You don't tell the reader much about them. We don't even know the main character's name. 
You have to do more showing. You tell to much. Also, explain a little more. Don't expect the reader to know everything. You can't make them guess as to why something happens.



Sorry if i sound a little harsh. I'm just trying to help out. By knowing and fixing your errors, you become a better author. You learn from your mistakes and therefore grow.

What's with all the bad reviews for Breaking Dawn?



!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...



Seriously, i thought it was a nice change for a puchy exciting plot line that never stopped. Some bits were a shock, especially the pregnacy, but with using the incubus and sucubus legends i thought she worked that in very well. 
And i was glad they finally got to writhe over each other in passionate sex, it's about time. Theyve waited how long and they're deffinately old enough. I think the book grew with them and it served well.

Because everyone loved the idea of forbidden love and the "i'll die for you if i have to be with you" idea. The forbidden love and sacrificial romance is the best in books. I HATE HAPPY ENDINGS, so I hated Breaking Dawn. Why did Bella get a freaking happy ending?! She wanted Edward but it was supposed to be with sacrifices. I loved New Moon a lot because Jacob was more humane and comforted a broken heart. It was more real- not so fantasy. I hated how Sci-Fi it was.

Stephanie tried to please everyone. But, she sure didn't. She may have pleased herself and maybe a few hundred but the people who fell in love with Twilight, New Moon, & Eclipse will probably be really upset. I know I am.

Everyone is entitled to their opinions.  On Amazon, the number of 1 and 2 star reviews is about the same as the number of 4 and 5 star reviews, so there are pretty mixed feelings about it.  I give it a one.  I am the opposite of you, I did not think the plot line was one bit exciting.  A lot of the book talks about Bella's pregnancy and builds up a werewolf fight that never happens, and then the ending confrontation with the Voluturi was pretty lame.  It was just so dull to me.  I thought she could have made it way more exciting.

Measure a book. Put the size into the custom paper size on microsoft word and it'll get formatted into that size.

But roughly speaking, say about 4-500 words a page.

But you don't really need to know that if you have a word count.

Know that roughly a novella is anything from about 12,000-40,000. A novel is about 40,000 + though that would be the absolute minimum. An average novel is around 75-85000 words.

If you do the layout in an A5 format, it will come to about 68 pages.  Remember, a printed book doesn't look good if you do the font in 12 so i will suggest you do the font in 10.5.

Font: Courier New 12
Double Space
1" (2.5cm) margins all around

A manuscript page equals roughly 250 words -- or that's what's assumed, no matter the actual number.



For now, you don't need to worry about headers and page numbers, etc. But this format will tell you roughly where you are. A novel of 100K words will equal 400 ms (manuscript) pages.

Most novels run between 80K-120K, depending on genre and publisher specifications. Knowing what you're aiming for -- doing some advance research -- will help keep your story arc in control and on track. There's no point trying to submit a 120K romance novel. No one will take it. On the other hand, most fantasy publishers want something longer than 80K.

<answer>



Here's the answer from the U.S. Copyright Office:

The way in which copyright protection is secured is frequently misunderstood. No publication or registration or other action in the Copyright Office is required to secure copyright. There are, however, certain definite advantages to registration.

Copyright is secured automatically when the work is created, and a work is "created" when it is fixed in a copy or phonorecord for the first time. "Copies" are material objects from which a work can be read or visually perceived either directly or with the aid of a machine or device, such as books, manuscripts, sheet music, film, videotape, or microfilm. "Phonorecords" are material objects embodying fixations of sounds (excluding, by statutory definition, motion picture soundtracks), such as cassette tapes, CDs, or LPs. Thus, for example, a song (the "work") can be fixed in sheet music ("copies") or in phonograph disks ("phonorecords"), or both.

If a work is prepared over a period of time, the part of the work that is fixed on a particular date constitutes the created work as of that date.

Here are more opinions and answers from other FAQ Farmers:



* To enforce a copyright in U.S. federal court, it must first be registered, as proof of ownership, and a copy deposited with the Library of Congress. Copyrights registered early do have the benefit of certain statutory fines, if an infringement is proven.



* It is sometimes asserted that: "To a large extent this depends on the laws of the country you live in. Copyrighting something is just a way of you asserting that you came up with an idea first. The simplest way to do this is to post a copy to yourself. The envelope will bear a postmark, which will bear up in court as the date you invented/wrote something, so long as the envelope is still sealed. However, it's better to try the Patent Office. There, for a small fee, you can patent inventions, and anyone coming up with a similar idea can then realize straight away that they are in breach of copyright."



However, this contains many common mis-perceptions and inaccuracies. For example, international copyright law is largely harmonious, under various conventions that are adopted in hundreds of countries.



* Under U.S. federal law: "In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work."



* Posting or mailing a copy of something to yourself is NOT an effective way to protect your IP (Intellectual Property). And only rarely would such a method ever hold up in court. File an application with the US Copyright Office, if you think you would benefit from having a registration. (See link to the right.) Find out what category your IP falls under - and not all things are eligible for copyright protection (ideas and titles of songs, stories or books, among other things), check the regs for this too - so you can figure out which application form you will need to fill out and send in, although it is not always simple. Applicants must follow the instructions precisely. Filing fees vary so check with the Copyright Office for current prices. Be prepared to wait for verification that your copyright has been approved and registered. ''Sometimes'' this can take months depending on how busy the office is at any given time, for your particular type of works.



A patent is not the same thing as a copyright as an earlier answer seems to imply. Patents and copyrights do not protect the same things. Nor do trademarks. And sometimes a combination of patent, copyright and trademark protection may be necessary to more fully protect your IP. If you are not familiar with the terms copyright, trademark, patent, service mark, visit the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the Copyright Office's websites and read up on the differences. Keep in mind that copyright protection isn't what it used to be thanks to the internet, file-sharing and widespread ignorance or disregard of the laws pertaining to ownership of IP. Patents are a little easier to enforce because patents apply to specific inventions which are more tangible than songs, poems, stories, logos, etc. And having a copyright on file does not mean you can't lose a court case over ownership of and right to use IP, but it certainly gives you an edge and added protection.



A lawsuit for patent infringement can cost millions of dollars and take years to complete.



* Copyright protection, if any, is automatic and immediate, and any unauthorized copies are infringements. Patent protection only exists after a patent application is reviewed and a patent is issued, and a patent cannot be infringed until then. It often takes years to have a patent issued (hence, "patent pending"). Trademark protection is also "automatic", from the time of "first use", but only for a limited scope, and a trademark registration provides valuable benefits.



* To prove copyright infringement you must have a registered copyright and prove the defendant had access to your work, copied it without authority, and that the copying was substantial.

In the UK copyright exists the moment the work is created.
The old days of posting a copy to yourself, or a bank manager (and leaving it unopened, to prove the date on which you created it) are long gone.
The moment you write something, or take a picture, copyright is automatically yours (unless you sign copyright over to someone else). It's even easier nowadays, since computers automatically save the date on which the file was created.
Copyright exists after death as well. Not sure if it's 50 or 75 years after death.
So, anyway, you don't have to copyright either pictures or stories - the copyright is automatically yours!

I just wrote this now, please judge it, thanks in advance.?



Be still child, do not cry
Do not let them find us, we come too far
Life will be better, that I promise
The fields will be greener, we will learn to smile

The men are coming child, please do not cry
They come with their dogs, as though to hunt 
They fear they have lost, those to earn their wealth
Shining their torches, nearer they’re getting

Don’t be scared child, please don’t be
I am but all you have now
Your mother you’ll meet up in the skies one day
She is up there guiding us through

Keep still child, for goodness sake keep still
The dogs might smell us, lord don’t let them find us
Master will but all forgive
To run from him, I have known some beat to death

Close your eyes child, the time had come
We have to move, slowly, deeper in the reeds
The men are near, they will find us
We shall move, more into the water

Close your eyes child, please close your eyes
We will move to the deeper water child
The men are yards away, their dogs at their heels
We have to move now, into the cold waters

Oh my child, say a prayer
It will soon be over, look above
Your mother’s guiding, she will keep us safe
Under the water child, we need to go

Take a deep breath child, we need to hide
The dogs will not smell us there
Under the water, we shall be safe
It will be cold, but be patient

Shh, do not shake child, don’t be scared
The dogs have retreated, the men have followed
Wait here for a while we shall child
When their lights fade, we will move

Oh my child, look at them go
I know it’s cold, but stay still for a while
They have gone, but they are still searching
In a bit child, we shall move

Look beyond child, over the bridge
Freedom is near, we shall go
We will be free child
Fear we shall know no more

Maybe before you start writing, you should try to learn proper grammar first - it should be "who just LOVES to write" instead of "who just love to write"

You have real talent!  People like you bring joy to people who love to read.  I love your poem and you are an upcoming writer.  Who inspired you?  I have some advice for you.  When you write stories and you have some original ideas, have an attorney have a patent number for your ideas.  Copy write laws can protect your original and hard work your wonderful imagination created.  I love sci-fi too.  Have you thought of being a screen writer?  There are many career possiblilities for you.

well, for a start your title is wrong 'just love to write' does not make sense, if you're a good writer at least use proper English! 'who just loveS to write' and you already have a '.' (full stop) so there is not need for the '?' well its a question so there was no need for the full stop!

and it's '15-year-old'

your title should read like this.

'Hi. I'm a 15-year-old boy who just loves to write?' and even that in itself is quite a strange question to be fair......?

I am a author of a published book. A lot of the answers here are right but so off-putting. Have fun and experiment. A great book to learn from is BBC Bitesize Revision KS3. It is a fantastic resource that will help you to bring even more life to your characters and plot and structure of your writing.

Try to edit your work a bit more. Think of it as a block of stone and like a sculpter you must carefully chip away or edit it to produce something creative and readable. Writing is not so difficult. What is difficult is editing, making certain it all makes sense in the right context. It takes a keen eye for detail. Read the words aloud if you can and re-read, re-read and re-read again until you cannot see or hear anymore mistakes and reading it flows and flows and you are gripped by it.

Good luck!

That's a great ambition.
Now, your poem... I'm not a poem expert, I'm a fiction writer, but I know how poems are supposed flow and I couldn't really... get the beat of yours. It was a great idea and I really loved the last stanza, but I felt like you were really trying to tell a story. Poems are generally a mixture between word play and a story with missing parts I think. Maybe you should try rewriting it as a short story - don't worry if it's only a page or half a page, because that really doesn't matter. And, if that doesn't work out, you can try messing around or rewriting the poem to see how that goes.
Now, I began to read your second piece of work - Cyborg Mania - but didn't finish it due to time. The first thing I noticed, however, was your change in tense in the first sentence. You go from past to present and the only way that would work would be if the line "he is neither man nor robot" was a thought or something like that. Otherwise, it should be "he was neither man nor robot". 
The second thing is that you do a lot of explaining. That's a no-no. What you want to do is tell the story, unravel it, allow the reader to be put inside the story and basically watch it unfold. Now, what you're explaining in the first paragraph is probably important for the reader to know. Try putting it in a prologue - ie, write out the event as it happens and, once it's finished, you can start on your first chapter. That's how I usually do it if I have info for the reader that happens prior to where I plan on starting the actual story. 
Skipping down a few paragraphs, you're recapping for some reason. You're also explaining, repeating and not showing the reader. It’s almost like you’re a writing textbook. IE - In one paragraph, you're talking about how Julie dies and Vaugn is incredibly sad. Instead of saying he's sad, he misses Julie, thus he tries to recreate Julie, etc, etc. you could say something like "Vaugn was at a loss of what to do with himself" (cheesy, no?), and it would show that without Julie, he'd be a bit lost in the world. Instead of telling the reader, you want to show them. Another example, instead of saying, “he was nervous” or something you could have him playing with a pen or nibbling his lip. Do get what I’m saying?
I'm gonna end here, because this is getting pretty lengthy. Haha. But, anyway, before you post, I hope you're editing, because it makes you look like an idiot if you don't and if you have any questions or want an opinion, whatever it is, feel free to email me. (;

In George Orwell's 1984 the party motto is:

War is Peace
Freedom Is Slavery
Ignorance is Strength

I'm just finding this hard to understand because the extract from "the book" was rather complicated when it explained these concepts. So i was wondering if anyone could attempt to explain them more simply? Thanks :) x

This motto is meant to brainwash people into compliance and keep them from questioning big brother. They are saying that WAR is the only way to maintain PEACE and homogeny. The part about FREEDOM being SLAVERY is  sort of circular logic meant to keep an oppressed people down by convincing them that freedom is too hard and make you work too hard and you are actually a slave because you constantly have to worry about survival so why not let us take care of everything for you? And finally, have you ever heard that old addage, Ignorance is bliss, its sort of the same concept, what you don't know won't hurt you so as a people we are better off with ignorant citizens. It makes things run smoother as a whole.

That's the point- it doesn't make sense.
It's called "double-speak", or "newspeak".
You control language because that's the way you control thought.
You aren't being controlled, therefore, it makes no sense.

They're examples of doublethink.  My understanding of doublethink is that it was used to justify what the government was doing.  In other words, by going to war they were actually achieving peace so it was a good thing.
Freedom is a bad thing because you're really becoming enslaved by those who give freedom.
Ignorance is good and gives you strength because you don't have to worry about the truth.

I could be off but the basic idea of doublethink is that what you believe to be true is false and vice versa.

the most important ideology from 1984 is "double think". That is extremely hard to explain, it basically meant that there can be two explanations from the same word or meaning. the motto is what the people are made to believe, not the proles (the poor under class people).



War is peace because there is no surplus of goods which lead to happier and advancement in people. the constant war kept people afraid and dependent (sounds like today almost). with constant war, there is no advance in culture or intelligence, which would lead to a revolution.

freedom is slavery because only the slaves are the ones who just "live". it might make one of the party members think, to be without big brother, to be without protection, without INGSOC, that meant to be free. then freedom is the worst. to be a slave of the party is to be free.

Ignorance is strength, because ignorance is bliss. what you dont know wont hurt you. if the Party and the proles knew that Oceania was put into fake wars as a tool of domination and mind control, if they knew that Big Brother didnt exist, if they knew that they were slaves, they might revolt. but its no use. the proles are kept dumb and the party kept undercontrol by fear.

Hope this helped. sorry for the grammer.  i just read 1984 again this summer. Great book.

disclaimer (as it were): none of these beliefs are mine, beacause i am not just a statistic. And we thankfully live in a world that allows us to have our wars, our share of slavery and our choice not be ignorant.

George Orwell's 1984, is a shock tactic at bringing to the fore, the futility of life that can be, if we do not use our collective intellegence as an evolved race. 
Governments will always use double think as a weapon to stay in power. 
Just how powerful do us, the poeple, need to be, to carry on the code of progress we have been educated to propagate?

All happennings in the book are essentially a mental state, expressed in terms of a satirical tangibility (and the other way round) that can be empathised with.

Here is an attempt at explaining these concepts in a simple way.

1. war is peace: 
when at war, impositions on life and living make choices narrow. you either expose yourself and  face the consequences, or you comply with authority, however absolute - and war time brings in absolute authority. precise, all-reaching and containing.
you have no choices. your life ceases to exist. you merely follow orders. 
life is simple. 
there are no personal conflicts to tarry with. no dreams to pursue. no ambition. no rights. no privileges. 
You are a robot that will do the bidding.
no conflict, is peace.
War is, therefore, peace.
1984 is such a scene. Existentialist. Robotic. Where everything is a duty to Big Brother. And every such duty is clearly chalked out and dispensed.



2. Freedom is slavery:
When you are free to be, to think, to act, and every one in your community shares this freewill, there are bound to be expectations, responsibilities, successes and failures. 
You are therefore also bound in that sense. Bound to those responsibilities that are due to those who depend on you. You are bound to expectations that these very people will impose on you. 
You are a slave to  desires of success and a slave to fear of failure. and the repercussions thereof. 
Life is a steady path of bondage and slavery.
Freedom is, therefore, slavery.
slavery to life and its many facets.
Hence Big brother solves your problem. He reduces you to a number. Where you simply exist, without thought.
In a brain-dead existence, you are free of the bindings of freedom. you are free of any personal responsibilities, emotions and desires.

3. Ignorance is strength:
problems arise when you know right from wrong, or believe one way or the other. Dealing with these problems are taxing. Ideals and ideology, knowlege and learning, progress and fulfilment, come with a whole lot of issues spoken of in motto 1 and 2. 
when you don't know, and simply follow directive, there is only one way to go. all your senses are channelised towards only one goal. and the goal is always the same- please Big Brother. there are no credits to be taken. No gratidute to be given. 
This makes you strong, as no energy is expended on any distractions.
Think about this: you are learning to drive in a foreign country. the rules are very clear and exacting. 
which will be easier? learning to drive from scratch, or first unlearning all your old driving habits and then learning the requirements as per your new track? And if you do manage to learn the new way of driving, how sure are you that your old habits will not visit every now and again?
ignorance is therefore strength.
when you have nothing to compare to, no two ways to chose from, just one track to follow - that is you are ignorant to any thing else- you are strong.

The idea of the book, as i see it, is to express the exasperation at what our lives have become. and a frantic atempt at putting the world right, before it is too late. 1984 was written when 1984 was in the future. the fear of what is to come can make the worst among us change our ways. and if you can actually see yourself in that horrid future, can you even imagine what the fear will be like?

Write a draft story, and send it to publishers. You'll need to have a good editor to carefully check your stories though. However, even if you like it, doesn't mean that you're good at it. Get some feedback.

It is a novel that makes us think about ourselves and makes us wonder how we would do if we were in similar circumstances.  It points out that civilized behavior may not be what we would do if the norms and mores of society were removed.

Lord of the Flies is a classic in that it is assigned reading in many schools, both high schools and colleges.



As a result there are numerous free on line resources that can help you with your study of this novel, most of which analyze the story, discuss themes and symbolism and other literary devices, and give character sketches.  If you do a search you will find many helpful resources.  Additionally hundreds of questions have been asked here on Y!A about LOTF so do a search for it in the Yahoo Answers search window and you will find lots of Q’s and A’s that should help you.

the hidden meaning of lord of the flies was to show the reader that when you take away all of the materialistic things in society and it's just a bunch of little boys on an island it shows how they formed their own structure of "government" in that some boys were in more power than others. they were stranded on an island and in the end it came out to be just like a real country that can give orders to the underclass workers. it also shows how people revolt against the leaders. the way the conch shell had so much power and whoever held it was idolized for that time.
the last time i read the book was two years ago so my memory is kind of faded, but i hope that this helps.

TITLE OF THE NOVEL



Lord of the Flies refers to Beelzebub, another name for the devil. He is also called the Lord of Filth and Dung. Throughout the novel, the children grow dirtier and dirtier, an outward reflection of their inner state. As their savagery and evil increases, they seek a symbol, a god to worship. When Jack and his hunters kill a boar, they have their opportunity; they leave the pig's head impaled on a stake as an offering to the beast. The head is soon rotting and covered with flies. The head, referred to as the "Lord of the Flies" then serves as a symbol of the evil and savagery of Jack's tribe of hunters. At the end of the novel, Ralph, with disgust, knocks the boar's skull to the ground and seizes the stick to use as a spear. He understands the evil that surrounds him in the person of Jack, and he seeks to destroy it.



ENDING OF THE NOVEL



The novel ends with naval officers arriving on the island. The one that spies Ralph and the savages who chase him, at first sees the boys as dirty children involved in fun and games. When he learns from Ralph what has happened on the island, he is amazed that civilized British children could sink to such a low level of humanity. Ralph and the boys listening to his scolding and break into tears that quickly become sobs. They are crying over the horror of their experience and relief over returning to civilization. As the boys weep, the naval officer simply looks out to sea to allow them to regain their composure. The ending is abrupt, appearing almost contrived.



The naval officer fails to see the significance of the boys' experience. His not realizing what has happened on the island mirrors his own inability to recognize evil within himself and all mankind. When he mentions fun and games, the reader is jerked back to reality. These are children who should be innocent and should be playing games. Instead, they have become the reality in all of us --- not that of innocence, but of evil.



It is ironic that the naval officer while appearing to represent civilization and rational society actually represents the evil present in civilization just like the boys themselves. He is a soldier who fights wars, which is certainly civilization at it's worst.

The story is an allegorical tale showing how thin is the veneer of civilisation when its normal constraints are removed.  There follows a power struggle between the forces of good and those of evil.

Golding leaves it to the imagination of the reader as to how this struggle plays out because the outcome is clouded by the arrival of the rescue party.

The hidden meaning has long been demonstrated by the gradual and ever increasing amount of juvenile violence in Western society.  YOu only have to think of the murder of the 7year old boy by two others under ten in the UK or the thousands of gang attacks and bashings,committed by what were at one time considered "harmless young people". Add to that the ever increasing number of  home invasions and the degeneration of many many juveniles into at the least mentally deficient Graffiti maniacs or at worst, mindless murderous thugs.
And Why? because forty years ago a group of ignorant adults decided that the time had come to pass laws empowering children to be exempt from corporal punishment and to go do exactly as they like without either parental or school control. 
Now just look at the price we are all paying for it!
Bring back public flogging as they have in Singapore and watch it transform juvenile deliquents into the mild little underlings  they once were(and their parents have forgotten how to create)...OVERNIGHT!

I started a new story on Fiction Press, but as it's mainly American users, I probably won't get any type of response until tomorrow morning. So please let me know what you think.
Note, it's probably not suitable for young kids as there are mentions of swear words, violence and adult situations.

There were several writers for the series, all of whom can be found at HBO.com. I'm reasonably sure there is not a book based on the series, or vice versa.



I wish they hadn't stopped too, although I understand. If they'd continued, there wouldn't have been a logical end. It would have tread in the same territory as I, Claudius for years!

What's the book that was ?



The book was by a woman and I believe was a bit autobiographical. Her doctor sent her away to get rest and she wrote instead. Her character thought she was sane, but would put on a dress and go wander in the woods, but really she was drawling around the perimeter in her room. it was a book and a movie.

Why is the twilight saga so famous for no apparent reason?



as a huge harry potter fan i don't see what the big deal is about these books. they have no plot, the titles don't make sense to the story, whatever the story is. also meyer cannot write to save her life. Jk Rowling is 10 times a better author than her. Bella and Edward have no personality, the only character that does is Jacob Black.



</question>



<additional details>



ps, i do have a personality and i have read them and found them really boring.



the plot aside it's the writing that gets me. the way its written is bad especially when compared to other books not necessarily HP. its like she's trying too hard with her similes and metaphors, the writing also feels forced. it doesn't flow.



here's a link which i think explains it well

Vampires. That's the real reason I suppose. Vampires. I found [and fell in love with] this book because it had vampires in it.
Vampires are ridiculously auwshum, and when you look for books with Vampires in 'em, Twilight ALWAYS comes up. 
Heh. I've now used the word 'Vampire' five times.
Ah. Vampire. ;D

I know what you mean. My guess/opinion is that because Harry Potter finished a lot of people wanted to read something else. It's not for 'no apparent reason', and a lot of people do love the book. Granted, it is no Harry Potter, but just because you don't like it, it doesn't mean other people can't. JK might be a better author, but there is always going to be better or worse books, not everyone can be perfect!

"when exploring how geniuses work, it's a good idea to start by defining precisely what a genius is. For the purpose of this article, a genius isn't simply someone with an exceptionally high IQ. Instead, a genius is an extraordinarily intelligent person who breaks new ground with discoveries, inventions or works of art."

it opened a new way of thinking, so it is Genius!

i have read both harry potter and twilight. harry potter is much better, but twilight is alright, too. if you notice, many of the 'obsessed' twilight fans were obsessed with harry potter a year ago until deathly hallows excitement died down. then they moved onto twilight because they had no fictional character to obsess over. once the twilight movie comes out, and sucks, everyone will move on to a new book. BUT NOTHING CAN REPLACE HARRY POTTER. :DD

Well I know that its about a girl who falls in love with a vampire and with the love part it more relates to girls, but also there is a mystical creature involved. But also all my friends talk about it and tell us to read it so also just spreading the word about the book.

Its a well picked genre.



Think of the success of Anne Rice...



I guess she put a lot of effort into creating this "perfect boyfriend" character most girls would love to have, added something that naturally draws attention like vampirism, and wrote it in the first person perspective of the girl so female teenage readers feel drawn into it.



Its a cute story buts all I can really say, Harry Potter are good in there own way to but that series is over now and its not really fare to compare them as Twilight focuses much more on the romance than anything else.

They appeal strongly to many teenage girls as they are very romantic.  And the hero, Edward Cullen, seems to go down very big with most of the girls who read the books.  Personally, I liked Jacob much better than Edward as he seemed more human, but I never really thought he had much chance with Bella, she was always too hung up on Edward.

I quite enjoyed them, especially the first one which I thought was quite good.  I liked Bella, I found her clumsiness and lack of interest in clothes endearing (I find clothes very boring myself, so I identified with that).  However, I found myself less charmed by the later books, she moped over Edward far too much and it began to get on my nerves.  and the last book I thought had a very tame ending, I was most disappointed.

I agree with you about the Harry Potter books being much better though, the characters are far more interesting, the plots much more intricate and exciting, and there is far more humour.

Have you read them?

Twilight makes ALOT of sense, Edward explains it.

New Moon is named so because the events in that book are the darkest time in Bella's Life (like the cycle of a New Moon)

Eclipse is named that because Bella experiences a life one.

Breaking Dawn is named because when dawn breaks, it's the beginning of a new day. I.E. Bella's life as a vampire



They do so have a plot, BTW!!

Stephenie Meyer is an AMAZING author. If she is so terrible than why do so many people like her books?!?!

Bella has a very good personality; Smart, clumsy, accident-prone, bad luck magnet, stubborn, loving and warm
Edward's: Thorough, intelligent, witty, protective, loving, caring.

JK Rowling is an amazing author, also. I love love love love LOVE the Harry Potter Books, but I also love the Twilight books. You should give 'em a chance, they are really good.

And the big deal is that so many people like them. The same 'big deal' there is about HP; the writing and plot is amazing, and it's just really popular!

Your right. Bella is like a leech and only lives for Edward. And she dumps Jacob, the only character i liked, for Edward when he comes back after leaving her. All four books are basically about Bella wanting to become a vampire and about her wanting to stay with edward forever which is really annoying. I hate the fact that so much people obsess over it...

I read the first few chapters of Twilight---wasn't anything special. The reason people like them is probably because 1. Vampires 2. Dumb Luck--once one person reads Twilight, his/her friends read it, and the more popularity it gains, the more people read it--sort of like positive feedback.

umm...excuse me! first of all they are famous FOR A REASON...cause people actually LIKE them and care about the book and characters. what's the big deal about Harry Pothead???? you don't have to like stephenie meyer or her books..but that doesn't mean you have to trash the books people (including me) really care about. she put her heart and soul into that story...thats like someone saying you have no purpose in YOUR life....how would you feel?? anyways...that's all i gotta say.

The Constant Gardener by John le Carre
Les Miserables by Victor Hugo
To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee

Two of them are old books, I know, but here it's completely new.  I've been wanting to read them all my life, but since I live in Indonesia, I have to wait.  I can't easily buy classics books here unlike in US or UK.  So two months ago, in my honeymoon trip, I saw those books on the "new books" shelf in a store and decided to buy it straight on.

To kill a mocking bird was first published in 1960's and I have to wait for about 40 years for the translated edition to be published in my country! (I'm still 23 anyways lol)

And Les Miserables?  I know since it's now in public domain, I can just download it.  But it was too heavy for me since my English is very poor.  It's relatively pricey because the book is huge and thick, but who cares? lol



As for the Constant Gardener? well..it's just because... I have no special reason on buying it.

Yes, I can think of a great one. Mildred in "Of Human Bondage." A doctor is fascinated by a waitress that will barely give him the time of day. All through the book he doesn't understand his affection for her but is hopelessly attracted to her. She treats him so unfairly and only comes running back when she needs help. He's a good man that can't recognize decent women when they come into his life.

A Walk in Wolf Wood by Mary Stewart (again, this is more a children's fantasy)

This is actually a rather tough question, since there is often a love interest or falling in love somewhere in the story.

***Edit: I did think of My Cousin Rachel by Daphne du Maurier in which the protagonist is a man, who does fall in love with Rachel. However, even at the end of the story, you are not sure about Rachel: is she good or bad, did she murder or not, did she love or not? Not precisely what you wanted, but...

In The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens, the female lead doesn't fall in love. If you consider Estella to be the lead female, Great Expectations doesn't have her fall in love. Pip does, she doesn't.

and I also thought about So Far From God by Ana Castillo because the main protagonist doesnt fall in love- Sofi- but her daughters find various forms of love and in different ways that brings them harm but thats not their main story.

How many people have written endings for The Salmon of Doubt?



Can you recommend any? It just about gets interesting when it stops. I think all the basic setup is there, all the major characters(clearly Dirk is working for a future/subconscious version of himself) and plot devices that are necessary though of course you'd add more. I'd give it a go myself, but I know I'm not a good enough author!



</question>



<additional details>



hello again, probablygraham. I know no-one could ever write a definitive ending, but I also know that there are some very talented, very Adams-inspired authors out there. There was an anthology fairly recently - the Fortean Times reviewed it - of stories written by a plethora of popular Scifi authors, based on notes and concepts left by Edgar Allan Poe. It would be nice to see a similar tome for Adams. Inspired by, not ripping off.

I think any ending would be wrong if you think about where most of his books ended up. What a terrible loss it was.

In case you don't know the author, if you like Douglas Adams, try to get a selection of Robert Sheckley - I'm sure he influenced him.

The mighty warrior Naaman, suffering from leprosy, was nevertheless greatly admired by the King of Aram. On the word of his wife's young slave girl, he is sent by the King of Aram to seek out a prophet of Samaria who can heal him. The King of Israel receives Naaman and the letter from the King of Aram and is offended that the King would send him such a person and expect him to help, thinking he was trying to pick a fight.

The prophet Elisha, hearing of this snub, summons Naaman and offers him a very simple cure for his leprosy. But because of Naaman's lack of faith and the offense he feels Elisha has given him by not meeting him face-to-face, he rejects this cure. His officers then remind Naaman that as a great warrior, if Elisha had set him some difficult task to accomplish to be cured, he would have followed Elisha's directions without question. Naaman comes to his senses, obeys Elisha and is cured.

"Page 2 of Babar" - anything in a book that shocked or saddened you in early childhood?



Early on 'The Story of Babar' the little elephant's mother is 'shot by a cruel hunter', with an accompanying picture.  Some parents think this is too much for little children to take.
At age three, I saw the picture of Henry the Green Engine, sobbing bricked up in a tunnel, and I disliked it so much I tore it out of the book!

This poem used to just break my heart, seriously. My first taste of empathy, I guess.

King John's Christmas, AA Milne

King John was not a good man --
He had his little ways.
And sometimes no one spoke to him
For days and days and days.
And men who came across him, 
When walking in the town,
Gave him a supercilious stare,
Or passed with noses in the air --
And bad King John stood dumbly there, 
Blushing beneath his crown.

King John was not a good man,
And no good friends had he.
He stayed in every afternoon...
But no one came to tea.
And, round about December, 
The cards upon his shelf
Which wished him lots of Christmas cheer,
And fortune in the coming year,
Were never from his near and dear,
But only from himself.

King John was not a good man,
Yet had his hopes and fears.
They'd given him no present now
For years and years and years.
But every year at Christmas,
While minstrels stood about,
Collecting tribute from the young
For all the songs they might have sung,
He stole away upstairs and hung
A hopeful stocking out.

King John was not a good man,
He lived his live aloof;
Alone he thought a message out
While climbing up the roof.
He wrote it down and propped it
Against the chimney stack:
"TO ALL AND SUNDRY - NEAR AND FAR -
F. Christmas in particular."
And signed it not "Johannes R."
But very humbly, "Jack."

"I want some crackers,
And I want some candy;
I think a box of chocolates
Would come in handy;
I don't mind oranges,
I do like nuts!
And I SHOULD like a pocket-knife
That really cuts.
And, oh! Father Christmas, if you love me at all,
Bring me a big, red, india-rubber ball!"

King John was not a good man --
He wrote this message out, 
And gat him to this room again,
Descending by the spout.
And all that night he lay there, 
A prey to hopes and fears.
"I think that's him a-coming now!"
(Anxiety bedewed his brow.)
"He'll bring one present, anyhow --
The first I had for years."

"Forget about the crackers,
And forget the candy;
I'm sure a box of chocolates
Would never come in handy;
I don't like oranges,
I don't want nuts,
And I HAVE got a pocket-knife
That almost cuts.
But, oh! Father christmas, if you love me at all,
Bring me a big, red, india-rubber ball!"

King John was not a good man,
Next morning when the sun
Rose up to tell a waiting world
That Christmas had begun,
And people seized their stockings,
And opened them with glee,
And crackers, toys and games appeared,
And lips with sticky sweets were smeared,
King John said grimly: "As I feared,
Nothing again for me!"

"I did want crackers,
And I did want candy;
I know a box of chocolates
Would come in handy;
I do love oranges,
I did want nuts!
And, oh! if Father Christmas, had loved me at all,
He would have brought a big, red, 
india-rubber ball!"

King John stood by the window,
And frowned to see below
The happy bands of boys and girls
All playing in the snow.
A while he stood there watching,
And envying them all ...
When through the window big and red
There hurtled by his royal head,
And bounced and fell upon the bed,
An india-rubber ball!

AND, OH, FATHER CHRISTMAS,
MY BLESSINGS ON YOU FALL
FOR BRINGING HIM
A BIG, RED,
INDIA-RUBBER
BALL!

And another by the same author:

http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels...

I was always so glad that he did get a little bit of butter for his bread!

I'm sure there are more, but those are what sprang to mind.
Nice question, thanks for asking.

eh, it is like the parents that won't let their child see Bambi.

You don't want your child to end up a hothouse flower. If they can't take reading Babar, what happens when someone they know and care about dies?  Do you run out and buy a "special" book to help them deal with the death?



..and because I can't resist referencing Herman Hesse in an answer on Babar.  It reminds me of in Siddhartha when the hero has never seen an old person in his life, do you really want your 21 year old to have a people-die epiphany in college?

Can anyone help me translate this Shakespeare monologue into modern english?



Helena's monolgue from a Midsummer Nights Dream.

HELENA: How happy some o'er other some can be! 
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she. 
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so; 
He will not know what all but he do know. 
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes, 
So I, admiring of his qualities. 
Things base and vile, holding no quantity, 
Love can transpose to form and dignity. 
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind, 
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. 
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgment taste; 
Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste. 
And therefore is Love said to be a child, 
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled. 
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, 
So the boy Love is perjured everywhere. 
For ere Demetrius looked on Hermia's eyne, 
He hailed down oaths that he was only mine; 
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, 
So he dissolved, and show'rs of oaths did melt. 
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight. 
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night 
Pursue her; and for this intelligence 
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense. 
But herein mean I to enrich my pain, 
To have his sight thither and back again.



Thanks so much!
Tora

P.S Is this the whole monologue?

Some people are so much luckier than others!
Everyone in Athens thinks I'm just as attractive as her,
But what good is that? Demetrius doesn't think so.
He refuses to see what everyone else can see.
And just like he makes a big mistake, going crazy about Hermia's eyes,
I'm exactly the same about him.
Love is able to transform things which are horrible, common and worthless
Into something beautiful and special.
People in love see with the mind, not the eyes,
And that's why in pictures Cupid (the god of love) is always shown as blind. 
And the mind of a person in love isn't able to think sensibly;
Someone with wings and no eyes is going to act too quickly and rashly.
That's why Love [i.e. Cupid] is often described as being a child,
Because he so often makes stupid choices.
Just like boys who are mucking around tell fibs 
So the boy Love contradicts himself all over the place.
e.g. before Demetrius saw Hermia's eyes,
He made a hailstorm of promises that he was my guy, and mine alone;
But when he started to find Hermia hot,
He and all his promises to me all melted away.
I will go and tell him that beautiful Hermia is planning to run off with Lysander.
Then he will go to the wood tomorrow night
To chase after her; even if he thanks me
For this information, it will still cost me dear [i.e. because he'll still end up with Hermia].
But I intend to make my suffering even greater by doing this, 
Just so that I can be with him on the journey there and back.

How happy some can get over over others.
Throughout Athens people consider me to be as beautiful as she, but who cares? Demetrius doesn't think so. And he will not change his mind. But he is wrong when he dots on Hermia's eyes. I am the one admiring him. Things that are ugly, love can make beautiful because love does not look with the eyes, but through the heart and that is why cupid is blind. And love has no judgement, it has wings and no eyes. So you make rash decisions without giving thought. And so love is said to be a child because it often makes the wrong decision. As boys in a game they lie, so a boy in love contradicts himself everywhere. For while Demetrius looked on Hermia's eye, he made oaths and swore that he was only mine.And when he received a little attention from Hermia, he forgot all his other oaths. I will tell him that Hermia left, and then to the woods he will go tomorrow night to pursue her. And for this information he will thank me. I don't want him to chase after her, it will only her me more, but I want him to be thankful to me. If only I were not blind with love, so that I could think again.

That's a rough translation, I think that is the entire monologue, but I am no where near my book so I cannot check. But I hope it helped.

If you were looking for a basic rundown of what is going on, it is that Helena is in love with Demitrius who is in love with Hermia, who does not love him. She has plans to runaway with someone else and she told Helena because they used to be friends. Helena plans to tell Demetrius that she is running away because she thinks the news will make him happy with her, but she knows she is being foolish, but she wants to tell him anyway. And the reason she is so obsessed with Demetrius is they had had a previous fling and he had swore that he loved her only, but then she found out he was trying to woo Hermia as well and he chose Hermia, but Helena was not ready to let him go.

Hi



Superman and Paula Brown's New Snowsuit is set during the winter of 1941  (on 7 December 1941 the Japanese attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbour). After this attack, the US felt forced to enter World War Two.

Very easy 10 points. What works better in a story?



What works better for main characters?

6 identical teenage girls as the main characters or
Sextuplets broken up into 3 girls and 3 boys?

What do you think would work best for variety, sibling rivalry etc?
Please say why you pick what you pick



</question>



<additional details>



They is identical because it is easier, and I thought it had more impact



Saying easy 10 points got a lot of answers in a short space of time and actually coming up with an answer to the question is very as it's just two choices and you need to do is pick 1



I've done creative stuff in other stories. They wouldn't be identical right down to personality because that would be laziness, I did plan to make them different and not completely the same.



I can see how that's misleading, I meant identical as in appearance wise.



To avoid further confusion, this is what I mean by 6 identical teenage girls: Identical in physical appearance. Personality-wise there will be differences

It just depends on the type of story.
I think that for some it would better with the 6 friends because they all have significantly different personal histories. But then again for the same reason the siblings have the same family/similar family life so any difference are interesting.

I prefer the siblings. For me, stories that have male and female points of view are more interesting and entertaining.

The second one. But it depends on your plot. In the first option are they friends or siblings? 6 identical siblings is too implausible and there is not much you could do with six identical people that you couldn't do with just two. The second option is much more varied and you could do more with boys and girls than with just girls.

The problem you would run into with 6 identical teenage girls is that you'd probably have to rely on cardboard characterizations in order for the reader to distinguish between them; i.e, The 'Smart' One, The 'Artsy' One, The 'Rebel', The 'Flirt', etc.

If pressed, I'd probably go with the 3 boy, 3 girl formula, although you're gonna run up against the 'Brady Bunch' syndrome--so avoid any Boys vs Girls scenarios. Instead, utilize the natural irony of the fact that they attract a lot of attention at school because of their sextuplet status, but at the same time find themselves individually feeling isolated in the family sphere because they are just one of six similar siblings.

Either way, you've got quite a challenge to write something compelling without coming across as just a wacky Disney Channel send up. Good Luck!

Seriously , 6 teenage identical girls as main characters would be so boring. 
On a first hear , it sounds  like they are identical twins or something.



I think it would be more interesting if you make them have different personalities from each other. If you make them all the same ,the story wouldn't be enjoyable and fun to read. Like this ,the characters won't have depth and the readers won't find them realistic. In my opinion, the whole point in writing  real characters in a book is for the reader to find them  believable and to feel like he/she can relate with the characters.
if you can't make them any different , I suggest you not to start writing a book. If you are lazy , to make various characters in a book , you aren't creative. By writing a book , the author shouldn't lack creativity.

On other hand, 3 girls and 3 boys. It sounds more interesting than the first option. After all , boys possess a different nature from girls.
With this , you can have male and female readers , something that you can't have with your first option.
the Male readers can relate to the 3 boys characters and the Female readers with the girls characters.

Either way , you can't have identical and same characters in a story.

EDIT: Then why did you say that you'd like to have 6 IDENTICAL girls in your book?
I suppose you meant their personality?

EDIT: Why all of them would have a same appearance?
I'm sorry , I don't know anything about what are you planning to write. But if they have different personality , it's normal for them  to have a different appearance , unless if they are sisters?

I've read the first three all the way through. With Breaking Dawn, I didn't make it past the second chapter. It was that hard to get through for me.



I'm not any team actually. Edward is a sicko and Jacob is just as sick. I used to be on Team Jacob, but after Breaking Dawn and the Renesmee fiasco, I quit on him. It's disgusting. Pedophilia is not my thing and that's what it was to me. Basically borderline pedophilia. That's why I gave up on him.



Gross. Just gross.

And now that I think about it, Renesmee seems to have taken after Bella on the whole borderline pedophilia thing. Edward may look seventeen, but he's more than a hundred years old.

I repeat: gross. Just gross.

I have read them all and of course love them.



I really haven't gotten into the "teams" so to say because there really isn't a reason to... anyone who read the books should understand the "power" of the love and bond Bella and Edward have.  Personally I never viewed Jacob as a threat to their relationship.

If you want love then read " a farewell to arms" it is about love and war. it is amazing. I read it when i was in freshman year of highschool. it is about a woman who falls in love with this guy, it takes place during ww1. He is a ambulance driver. He falls in love with this nurse. She likes him too, but she thinks she is to old for him. But they both love each other, they wind up getting together, then some other stuff happens, i dont want to give it away. This is a true love story. i love this book, one of my favorite. i read it lots of time. this book really is tryue love. And the book is based on the true story of the auther, Ernest Hammingway. this really did  happen to him. it is a lovely book.

I am 13 and here are some very good books Ive read recently:
Thanks for Nothing, Nick Maxwell (Best book I ever read!) 
Can You keep a Secret?
Glitz (from the top ten bestseller)
Second Time Lucky

I thought I would like these books: The Glamourous (double) life of Isabel Bookbinder



and the first of the Shopaholic  series, but  I didnt, both for the same reason, the main characters are so annoying!

I am currently reading The Desperate Diary Of A Country Housewife, so far good, and about to read Gods Behaving Badly .



My list wasnt in order by the way though the top one was definitely the best, so brill, could read it again and again and still laugh at the funny bits and cry at the touching bits (there is a lot of both).



Good luck!

Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is definitely a must read. The basic storyline of the story is that Jane falls in love and she has to choose between love or what she believes is right. It begins with her as a child and works up to when she's eighteen and wants a change of scene and to escape where she's stayed for most of her life. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Jane-Eyre-Pengui...

Pride and Prejudice was good as well. It definitely kept me reading. if you haven't seen the film, it's about Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, characters which begin with conflict. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pride-Prejudice-...

The Handmaid's Tale is a very deep story that is about a dystopia. It explores a world where very few women are able to have children and those that can are forced to have children for the rich. It's not really a romance, but it is a very good read. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Handmaids-Tale-C...

Tamar is also another favourite of mine. It is set in World War Two and is a story of love and betrayal. It jumps from future to past through two people. A wartime love story with twists and turns. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Tamar-Mal-Peet/d...

The Mediator series next because it sounds relaly good. It's about a girl who can talk to ghosts and falls in love with one. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mediator-Love-Yo...

Then there's also The Dark Night Series that I want to read, which is about a girl who gets marked to join the vampire world and falls in love. http://www.amazon.com/Marked-House-Night...

If you like Twilight, then you will probably like The Host, which is also written by Stephenie Meyer. It's about a love triangle within two bodies; that's next on my list to read. http://www.amazon.com/Host-Novel-Stephen...

You might also want to check out Blue Bloods- http://www.amazon.com/Blue-Bloods-Meliss... Another set of books I hope to read; they sound really good.

i suggest Stargirl by jerry spinelli.  i forget what its about, but i remember loving it.  i recommended it to my eighth grade teacher and last time i heard, she made it apart of the summer reading list.  oh, and the five ppl you meet in heaven, don't recommend it.  my teacher my senior yr of high school made us read it and it doesn't hold your interest very long... so i wouldn't recommend it for someone your age

Ha! You are keen...and i don't blame you!

I'm not particularly sure about Harry Potter itself but i've read previews of books on google books before now

But if all else fails perhaps surf the net for some harry potter fan sights they sometimes have extracts

and if the worst comes to the worst there are definetly harry potter movie trailers out there!

and by this time...your book will have arrived! hopefully :D

You could try downloading the torrent; that's the only thing I can think of. If you don't have a torrent downloader, get Azureus (http://www.toggle.com/lv/group/view/kl25... and then go to this page: http://www.mininova.org/tor/841798
Click download and then add the file to your Azureus downloads. It shouldn't take too long and you will have all seven books for free.
Of course I'd recommend reading the actual book if you can but for now, since you're eager (and you should be, HP is the best!) then you can try this.

You generally can't find more than a couple of pages or a chapter of a book like Potter on the internet, because the publisher and the author have a financial stake in people purchasing the work.  If you could read a big chunk of it online, then you might decide you don't want to buy it.  Copyright laws prevent people from electronically disseminating copyrighted materials.

Rich W has given you the correct answer.  You will NOT be able to download an e version of any of the Harry Potter series.  The reason is as Rich W states.

You can log on to the Harry Potter website and see extracts from the books.  This website also has links for J. K. Rowling's official site.

the harry potter wikkipedia

the leaky cauldren .org

1) Snape, definitely. He's the true hero of the book IMO; he's the only one who redeems himself. I really hated the way he died - he deserved better.

2) Luna Lovegood. She's just so delightfully dotty and insightful at the same time.

3) Sirius Black. I have a lot of issues with Sirius, he's immature and spiteful sometimes, but I can't help liking him anyway.

4) Remus Lupin. He's weak and a bit of a coward but he's also nice and loving.

5) Hermione. When she's not being a leaky faucet. She can be ruthless and manipulative, but her heart's in the right place.

1. Hermione Granger--I love strong, intelligent female characters and Hermione is the ultimate one. She never takes any crap from anyone and she always stands up for herself and her friends. And most importantly she's not afraid to voice her opinions whether people agree with her or not.



2. Harry Potter--I love Harry. Not only is he a courageous, caring, and self-sacrificing human being...he is HILARiOUs! I think most people think Ron is the funniest character, but I think the stuff Harry says and thinks is by far the funniest. I think JK Rowling uses her own sarcastic, dry humor for harry. He's such a great character.

3. Luna Lovegood---She's so quirky and weird. And I love how she says the most awkward things and she doesn't care how uncomfortable it makes the people around her. She's just living in her own little world.



4. Lily Potter---she was such a cool person who loved her child so much and it's a shame that she only lived 21 years. I would love for JK Rowling to write a book about Lily. I think it would be very interesting. I mean Lily was a muggle-born and Voldemort still wanted her on his side. That's how intelligent she was.



5. Weasley twins--They're so fun to read about. Whenever one of them appears on the page things just get so much more interesting and they always brighten the mood.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Voters</evaluation>



At first I was sure that Smeyer was doing the leaking. She just updated her page. My heart goes out to her and, being a fellow author, I understand what she means concerning writing any further.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...

As some of you may have heard, my partial draft of Midnight Sun was illegally posted on the Internet and has since been virally distributed without my knowledge or permission or the knowledge or permission of my publisher.

I have a good idea of how the leak happened as there were very few copies of Midnight Sun that left my possession and each was unique. Due to little changes I made to the manuscript at different times, I can tell when each left my possession and to whom it was given. The manuscript that was illegally distributed on the Internet was given to trusted individuals for a good purpose. I have no comment beyond that as I believe that there was no malicious intent with the initial distribution.

I did not want my readers to experience Midnight Sun before it was completed, edited and published. I think it is important for everybody to understand that what happened was a huge violation of my rights as an author, not to mention me as a human being. As the author of the Twilight Saga, I control the copyright and it is up to the owner of the copyright to decide when the books should be made public; this is the same for musicians and filmmakers. Just because someone buys a book or movie or song, or gets a download off the Internet, doesn't mean that they own the right to reproduce and distribute it. Unfortunately, with the Internet, it is easy for people to obtain and share items that do not legally belong to them. No matter how this is done, it is still dishonest. This has been a very upsetting experience for me, but I hope it will at least leave my fans with a better understanding of copyright and the importance of artistic control.

So where does this leave Midnight Sun? My first feeling was that there was no way to continue. Writing isn't like math; in math, two plus two always equals four no matter what your mood is like. With writing, the way you feel changes everything. If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely.

I'd rather my fans not read this version of Midnight Sun. It was only an incomplete draft; the writing is messy and flawed and full of mistakes. But how do I comment on this violation without driving more people to look for the illegal posting? It has taken me a while to decide how and if I could respond. But to end the confusion, I've decided to make the draft available here (at the end of this message on the Midnight Sun page). This way, my readers don't have to feel they have to make a sacrifice to stay honest. I hope this fragment gives you further insight into Edward's head and adds a new dimension to the Twilight story. That's what inspired me to write it in the first place.

I do want to take a moment and thank the wonderful fans who have been so supportive of me over the past three years. I cannot begin to tell you how much each of you means to me. I only hope this note will stop all the confusion and online speculation so that the Twilight universe can once again become the happy escape it used to be. After this incredibly busy year, I am now focusing on spending more time with my family and working on some other writing projects.

Lately, I have been to busy to read and have been listening to audio books instead, however the books I would like to listen to are not in that format. I like Terry Pratchett based things and have been sticking to him, Bill Bryson and Douglas Adams for audio books.

Any suggestions? ^^;

<question>



Will you read the beginning of my story? And criticise...?



So here I lie, as the dawn breaks for summer.  I should say one last goodbye before I leave.  She has made it clear that she did not want a best friend anymore, and only now have I come to accept it.  After fighting it for so long, now I do not know what to think about.



She gave me the chain around my neck as her promise.  And I really want to believe it again.  So I quoted it into my thigh and I watched the blood seeping out of the B then the E then the S then the T.  It surprised me that I am still alive, that I am bleeding and that my heart is still beating.



I remember how quickly we got close.  Lying there with her felt so comfortable.  I am not sure what we said to each other, all I remember is the subtle flow of thoughts and emotions.



I did not normally have people sleeping round at my house, I liked being alone, I was comfortable being alone.  I could do what ever I wanted, whether that is to cry or laugh or frown or any another doing, no one could judge me.  But now, I can’t stand being alone.



A thought began to creep into my head, I should tell her my secret, if you can’t tell her, then you wont be able to tell anyone.
“I want to tell you something, but I don’t know how.” 
“Go on then.” 
She shifted her position so that she was facing me.  I had obviously made my secret into somewhat of a tease.



“I don’t know how…”
“Just say!”
“I really don’t know how.” I pause. “Well…”



Grace watched me, smiling, that fact that she was interested made it a lot worse.  The light warmed her skin highlighting her constant blush.  She said with a certain softness that made me feel very safe,



“You can tell me anything you know.”



I have known Grace for years through high school.  And we didn’t really talk too much; honestly, I hadn’t really noticed her.  She is heavily interested in science related topics, so before this, our few, yet memorable conversations were mostly on articles in the New Scientist magazine, or what we were studying currently.



Thinking about it now, I don’t know how I found the courage to tell her, I hardly knew her.  This secret, was my only secret, the secret that I had been denying and hiding, but the secret that can be used to define me.



“Go on then!” 
I sunk my face into the pillow to hide my discomfort.  After a while of building myself to tell her, and then not being able to, she started to give up a little bit.  She saw that I was very uncomfortable.  To my relief we began talking off the topic for I while.



My palms were sweaty at the thought of telling someone.  But there was something about Grace, certain safeness, she does not seem to judge, or tell rumours.  It was the fact that she was so open about everything and how she treated you like her best friend even if you have just met her, or if you found her annoying.  I did not know how she would respond to this.  I did not think that I would tell her that it was a sexual obsession; the fact that I was a bisexual would be enough for her to handle.



Silence became fixed.
“Ok, I will tell you.” I gestured for her to come closer, “I am obsessed with my English teacher.”
“Oh my god! Guess who I like?”



“Who is a women” I forced out painfully. 
“Really?” 
She didn’t seem surprised at all.  Disappointment hung on my face; I planned to blurt out everything I had been keeping in for somebody to devour and reply, instead she asked.



“Guess who I like?”
“I don’t know.”
 “Dr. Reynolds”



She began a long rant, which I could listen to again. Dr. Reynolds was our Chemistry teacher, she had had him last year and going into GSCE science for the first time she thought, in these exact words, 
“Oh God, Blue lips, Yellow skin, who is this guy?” 
She began to like him when he began to say that she was smart.  Then it went downhill from there, or uphill, depends on how you want to look at it!  From then on she started to notice things, how well he teaches his lessons, his intelligence, his sullen stance are just a few examples.  She displayed a look on her face that I have grown so attached to.  The look read pure bliss with a hint of vulnerability.  She told me about her dream, where he was just kissing her, and that was it.  But I could understand how she felt because when she tried to explain it, the look moved to her eyes.



Seeing Grace’s face light up was confusing, not because it was weird that she liked a thirty-somewhat year old teacher, but because she was that attracted to a man. It is bizarre have girls, especially young pretty girls like Grace went for such plain men, it must be genetic, because I simply did not understand.  I wished I were normal so much; it would be so much easier.



Her pace slowed as she remembered what I had told her.



“You know, it does not surprise me.”
“Really? Am I that obvious?”
“No, I mean many girls are Bi-curious at this age.” 
“No, I am bisexual.”
It was uncomfortable listening to myself saying the word; I don’t think I had ever said it ou

<additional details>



There is always going to be something missing from now on.  Always.  Everything known to me is gone, what’s left is nothingness, only a journey ahead, for which I am not prepared.



So I retrace my past, to come to terms with the present, to find out if I will ever be able to find the right tools to carry on in my journey.  And if I close my eyes tight enough and wish hard enough, then maybe, just maybe I will be able to fall into the pages, and relive the words.

It is basically the path to enlightenment, and she is going to find out that she is a lebian shhh!

I think that you have an excellent writing style, and that you definitely have potential as an author.  For me, I thought that the topic was a heady one to tackle if its your first book, and if you really want to make the issue of her bisexuality a problem, she should probably be lesbian... In the school where i live, there are so many lesbians and gays that almost no one notices and its not a big deal.  But I guess it could be an issue in a less accepting environment.  I am curious, where are you planning to go with your story?

Umm well ... I'm going to give you some rules.. And they're not rules i found, i just made them up !! :P lollol



1) Always make sure you're comfy. (Sit in a big chair with a blanket and pillows, or sit outside in the sun on a comfy hair..)

2) Have a drink with you.. Not water, but lemonaide or your favorite drink.



3) Bring something to eat.. But something that you eat with your hands.. Like a chocolate bar, or even a popsicle !

4) Don't leave the blinds shut and don't turn the lights off.. Make it bright..If it's dim or dark you will get tired very fast and you won't feel like reading... (In less you like reading..)

5) If you wear glasses, make sure you wear them when you read. Without them, it might make you disey or give your eyes a really hard time..



6) Never read when the radio or TV is on, that will make it very very hard to read and understand the book..



7) Read a book you like.. (In less it's homework and you have no choice and you have to read a crappy book..)



8) Last but not least, tell your self you enjoy the book, even if you don't, just tell yourself you do.. And don't read to long, because next time you have to read, you won't want to because you'll remember how long it was last time........ Anyway, good luck and try to enjoy the book.. But just to tell you, if you don't like reading and you don't have to, than DON'T ! Never waste your time doing something that sucks, when you know you don't have to.. Life is to short to let that happen. But if you have no choice because it's homework, than make sure you read it... :P

Well, I agree and disagree with Hope Dream Wish. 
I agree with her sentiment, but I happen to do the opposite of everything she suggested except for the eating thing. I love eating while reading. I also am known to use the summary of the book on the back and choose an appropriate song on my ipod. Later, when you're done with the book and you hear the song again because of Shuffle or something, you will remember the fantastic book, and it's like reading it all over again. 
Where is Home?- Bloc Party - The Host - Stephenie Meyer. 
Philosiphia- The Guggenheim Grotto- Harry Potter (the series)- JK Rowling

The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?



help please!! im out of ideas!
"how does this book represent victorian England?"

i've put about how it shows people had to act a certain way, because when Hyde does things that are out of the norm, everybody is shocked at him

any more ideas???



</question>



<additional details>



it's for a-level, and thanks everyone for the help i really appreciate it!! getting more of those ideas flowing! i also thought about how Mr Utterson talks with Mr Enfield, even though they have nothing in common, just to be polite, representing England at the time to have been very much about keeping up appearences

Ok, that is a good start. Think a little more deeply into what you already have: Why would the doctor need an alter ego? Why would he keep his amazing discovery secret? 
Also: How does Stevenson describe the setting?
Hope this helps.

This is a GCSE text! Have you not taken any notice in class? Most copies have notes about the setting as well.  Go back and read the book again, highlight things that are out of sync with today's society, and you will have found your own answer.  After all the teacher wants your answer and arguement.

You could talk about how Dr. jekyll represents the middle class, respectable side of Victorian England with high morals and social values, whereas Hyde is more coarse and vulgar - he could represent the working class side of Victorian England.
It also highlights the Victorian preoccupation with medical science and the advances they believed they were making as well as the theory of degeneration, but that may be a little advanced if you are doing GCSE.

The way the description is always dark and gloomy... was Victorian England actually like this? Or is this relevant to the story only?

The relationship of the three men... How they take walks together... etc. What does this say about general relationships in those times.

Also go a bit deeper in the characterisation of both Jekyll and Hyde... he's exploring the idea of skitzophrenia... something that in the Victorian times wasn't fully understood. Explore the feelings and context that this has too.

I'd pick Ravenclaw. Those kids are freaking smart. I'm too much of a wimp to be in Gryffindor. Definitely not brave enough. I'm too nice to be in Slytherin, and I'm not THAT much of a wimp that I have to be in Hufflepuff. I think Ravenclaw fits best. Luna Lovegood was Ravenclaw and she's about as dorky as me. We could be bff.

Realistically, I'd probably be in Ravenclaw.  Outside of this online world, my job involves a certain amount of creativity, and I do like to think of myself an intelligent.  A bit bookish, certainly.

There's also a chance of Hufflepuff for me, too.  Hard work, loyalty, tolerance, and fair play are all things I value.  I happen to like Hufflepuff, too, so I don't see this as a bad thing.  =)

My one friend jokes I'm a Slytherin, because I can be a bit sly and overly ambitious, but I've toned that down since high school.

The second book in a trial of blood and steel is out and I would recommend the series for anyone into reading: Look for Sasha, the first in the series

If you think that you are a good reader and are up for a challenge then try the Siliarillin... I don't know how to spell it but it by Tolkien and is one of the most challenging books that I have read.



If you are looking for something a bit easier and more modern than those mentioned already then go for the Tomorrow series.

Any book be Fiona Mc Intosh is bound to be brilliant and I will say the same for author Terry Goodkind

One that you have probably heard  is the Harry Potter series but I'm not sure if you have read them.



Stephen King tends to right brilliant horror and I would recommend his Dark tower series as the best of his books ut of the ones I have read

Finally the book I just finished was Absolutely brilliant. Its the second in the Kingmaker-Kingbreaker series and is one of those must reads for all fantasy fans.



Hope you find at least one book here that you may like to read but if not just take a trip to your local library or bookshop. I especially recommend second hand bookshops because not only do you get a wider variety but you can get for anything up to a quarter of the price as it is new.

Edit: Just glancing at the bookshelf and remembered another great book, Black foxes... Set in the old english country side it is a brilliant work of fiction.

A legitimate literary agent will not charge to find you a publisher. They make money on a percentage of the sale of the book. They may charge a small amount for copy fees, but those are just small office expenses.

Those who charge to place your book are not legitimate. Never pay upfront for an agent.

There is a book called "Writer's Market" It lists a large number of Agents and says what kind of books the are looking for and how to approach each one.

I was looking for a great book list myself for the longest time. There's tons of great books out there and I wanted to choose the right one. Like you, I also don't jump on the bandwagon and read whatever the current reading fad is. The great thing is there is a reading journal that addresses the need for great book lists all in one place, and it helps you organize your reading for you.

I found this really great book lovers journal at http://www.bibliopages.com -- it's called Read, Remember and Recommend, a reading journal for book lovers. It's a spiral bound reading journal with Awards Book Lists including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, Los Angeles Times Award for Fiction and National Book Award for Fiction), Notable lists (BBC’S Top 100 is included) and Author Pages.

There's also a space for you to write down your personal favorites, list down the books you loaned, and write down insights you may have about books you've read. The best thing about is the book suggestions -- the book selections are awesome and will help any book lover read the right books.

It really helped organize my book reading because of the tons of lists that it has. You won't have to worry about the next book to read. :)

Find it at http://www.bibliopages.com. Happy reading!

writersmarket.com, you pay $3.00 a month for the service, but it gives you access to literary agents. Most of whom you can send your querys to via e-mail, so that's nice, and it saves bundles in postage. Good luck!

Writer's Market will give you some good info, but that won't ge you an agent; that will merely give you a directory of agents.

Agents are not interested in writers that have no proof of having sold work.



I published a novel over 2 years ago and thought that was my ticket when I had articles in New York newspapers about me finding missiles in Iraq as a Marine (google: Christopher Pascale). I was wrong.

My novel is in its 2nd printing and I'm working as a freelance writer with two articles on my resume along with about 500 copies sold of my novel.



As you build your resume and maybe get regular work on a paper or magazine you'll show that you already have a base that will bring in money. When you have that you could argue that you won't need an agent, but that's the nature of the beast.

My friend,



I have been teaching and writing books for many years. I have been teaching English Literature to university students for about 25 years.
 I was in a fix when I wanted to publish my first book. They are like hawks and they demand huge amount of money. Then I found a technique and started writing books.
Now I sell well and my books are liked.
If you visit my site you will get a link from there and send me a private message. I will instruct you without any charge. I like to help the students and upcoming writers because one day I was also like you.
God bless you

It is good that you want to get an agent for your book.

You must ask yourself these questions about your book first.

What genre is it in? Like is it fantasy, romance, horror, thriller, children? If the story is one of those genres, look for agents who are in that genre that your book is in, don't go for the first agent you see on a page without investigating the agent first.

How do they want to see your book? Do they want you to send a query first detailing within one page what your story is about, single space or do they want that and the first 3 chapters of the story?

Has the story been completely edited by a beta reader or an editor before I send it off to an agent? If not, get it done before you send it. Agents will reject any manuscript that has poor spelling, grammar and sentence structures and formated wrong. 12 font in Times New Roman, with an inch margin on every side of the page, double spaced.

Are you thick skinned for rejections? If you aren't, you better grow a thick skin as most of the time, you will be rejected. But do not let that chase you off from getting an agent, it just means that your story was not right for that agent, try another agent on your list. Try searching for an agent here: http://www.litmatch.net Go to the search for agents by using the Advanced Search and type what genre the book is in.

Are you able to wait for a response? Usually they take no more than four to five weeks but they could go up to six months before they read your query and get back to you.

Do you have the query written out already describing yourself as who you are as in I'm a teen or a young adult or a well traveled traveler who decided to put down my adventures or something like that and what your story is about, what genre it is and if it is ready to be sent to them?

If you can say yes, to all of them, you can do it just keep your head held high and start on the next novel while you are waiting for a response from the agents. But if you get an agent, if they ask for a certain amount of money up front to put you on their list of authors - RUN, DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THAT AGENT. Most agents will not ask for money as they will get paid when you get paid. But there are legit agents who will charge a reading fee which they will state on their website, be sure the agent is associated with the AAR which is the group that all agents are a member of.

I hope that I didn't chase you off from becoming an author or searching for an agent. It will take effort and time to find an agent that is good for your story, so don't give up on the first rejection, keep going.

Good luck.

That was a book I read soon after leaving a violent relationship.
Reading it gave me some strength; not as much as the support from family and friends though.
I realised from reading it that I was not alone; there is so much more out there to be afraid of and conquer!

I love to read, I am going to see if I can find this book. You didn't say what it was about but that is OK. Pagan Queen had a book she liked and now i can't remember the name of it. My horse broke my leg this Monday was a week ago, am still suffering from the break and my mind is not clear from meds. I have to take. The pain pills make me sleepy.

It may well be worthy but I'd always avoid choosing anything with this kind of title as I have a morbid fear of supposedly motivational books which only contain the sort of clichéd psychobabble you find in women's magazines or on daytime TV talk shows.

You might enjoy 'Daddy Long Legs' by Jean Webster, which is about an orphan girl who is sent to college by a mysterious benefactor.  It is set in a later period than 'Little Women', it was published in 1912, but it is a delightful book, and gives a wonderfully vivid impression of what life was like in a girls college at the turn of the last century.  The book is told in the form of the letters that Judy writes to her anonymous benefactor, and it really is a lovely book.

'Anne of Green Gables' by L.M. Montgomery is another book you might like.  Again the heroine is an orphan, and she is adopted by an elderly brother and sister who actually wanted a boy to help on their farm, and at first are dismayed to get a girl.  However, they get to like her and decide to keep her.

Also of course you might enjoy the other books that Louisa M Alcott wrote.

The speaker poses a rhetorical question to the now-dead subject of the poem: in the past when something 'moved' you, did you ask yourself "what profit" do I gain from such emotions?  The implication is that when humans experience strong emotions, we value those emotions for what they are.  Therefore, when the speaker calls the subject "past love, praise, indifference, blame", he is saying that those memories are valuable unto themselves.  Yes, the ghost will never know the speaker thinks of this yet the speaker is glad he will have those thoughts.

Darkly Dreaming Dexter
Dearly Devoted Dexter
Dexter in the Dark

All the books are good, but they differ pretty significantly from the show. Some major plot points were changed from the novels. As to which is better... that's a toss up. There are things I like about both, but I'm really inclined to like the show more. That's very unusual for me, but there you have it.

This being said, one thing I really like about the book is that it more effectively communicates how... cold Dexter is. On the show, his fake warmth almost seems so genuine, you come to believe it. In the book, there is no mistaking Dexter for the monster he is.

I highly recommend you read the books AND watch the show (season three starts next month, so you've got some catching up to do!)

He became quite rich - certainly better off than most playwrights of his day and bought a share in the theatre his company used and a country house back in his home town.

Some of his plays were more successful than others but he was certainly famous as a playwright in his own lifetime.

You can clearly see that this was the case because of the Folio edition of his plays published soon after his death.  Had the plays not already been successful this would not have been brought out because it would never have sold.

His plays remained popular up to the Civil War, then became less so after the Restoration and were revived once again in the late eighteenth century and have remained on stage ever since

A lot of info. about Shakespeare during his playwright years is unknown - they are called "The Lost Years" by Shakespearean scholars. We DO know that his plays were very popular in his time - and he did make a decent living. But specifics on just how rich he was are unknown. It is likely that he spent as much as he made, as soon as he made it, based on what we know of his lifestyle.



I would suggest checking out this website:

http://www.shakespeare-online.com/biogra...

There is a great biography - with detailed info. There is even a copy of his will ;) That might help you - it would at least tell you much money he had left when he died.

Ruby, it's "Break, break, break".



See the difference is '... a voice that is still' and not '... a voice that is free'

Break, break, break,



On thy cold gray stones, O sea!
And I would that my tongue could utter



The thoughts that arise in me.

O, well for the fisherman's boy,



That he shouts with his sister at play!
O, well for the sailor lad,



That he sings in his boat on the bay!

And the stately ships go on



To their haven under the hill;
But O for the touch of a vanished hand,



And the sound of a voice that is still!

Break, break, break,



At the foot of thy crags, O sea!
But the tender grace of a day that is dead



Will never come back to me.

Here is a list of all of his books and short stories. 
I don't think there is any order, or if there is it will be in the order they were written, so go by the year it was published.
As to whether or not they are "any good", that is a matter of opinion and taste, you'll just have to read them and decide for yourself.

Best Arthurian book told from Guinevere's point of view?



I'm into Guinevere from the Arthurian Legend and want to read all the trilogies told from her point of view that are out there. First one I started with was The Dragon Queen by Alice Borchardt but I didn't like it that much because the characters didn't come alive to me and I couldn't relate to them emotionally.



So which trilogy do you think is the best? And why?



I want to read:
Queen of Camelot by Nancy McKenzie
The Guinevere Trilogy by Persia Woolley
The Guinevere Trilogy by Rosalind Miles
The Guinevere Trilogy by Sarah Newman
Young Guinevere by Robert D. San Souci

If I'm missing anything out then let me know or recommend me more! Thanks.

Guinevere's autobiography says this:

"I don't know why I bothered following Arthur, he was a drunk, and the quest for the Grail consumed him! After nearly six years of touring with the Round Table, I decided to quit and take up my own solo career!"

'The Mists of Avalon' by Marion Bradley is a great read, it is actually told from the point of view of Morgaine who was the half-sister of King Arthur.  However it also looks at Guinevere's point of view as well.  It is basically the Arthurian legend from the point of view of the women in Arthur's life, and is a really good book.

Just to add to Jude's answer the Marion Bradley books are also part of a trilogy.

The Mists of Avalon
The Lady of Avalon
(Priestess of Avon) bit unsure about the title of that one, it was a while ago!

I would definitely re-read them again though as they are very good and really delve deep into the Arthur myth.

Happy reading!

I really enjoyed the Persia Woolley series when I was younger, although Rosalind Miles is an excellent writer. I also can't recommend enough The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley. It's a take on Guinivere that is utterly unique. While it is part of a trilogy, I think only that specific book deals with her?

Do you find it hard writing a story?



Do any of you always find it difficult thinking about what description you want to write on each scene, and think about what the plot should be? Do you even find it hard to think of a good ending? And do you sometimes have an idea on your head but just find it hard to put into words? I'm just curious, know I do!

I consider myself to be really good at the beginnings, but I have a hard time with the ending if I don't have it when I start writing. I don't really have trouble with writing the scenes unless I'm writing something I know nothing about, or I am lacking inspiration. When that happens I take a break, clear my head, and then come back and read what I already wrote, editing. Most of the time my pen just flows and I don't even think about all the details, my brain adds them as I edit. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night with an excellent idea, but I forget it when I get up in the morning. I hate when that happens, so I learned to put a notebook by my bedside.

Sometimes, I myself am writing a story and have been for quite a while. Every once in a while I will have times when I cant write to save my life and end up deleting everything that I had just wrote. I find that if you decide to create something in your story that will change the outcome or plot that you should sit down and prepare yourself for everything that you will need to explain, write, and extrapolate on. If you suddenly decide to add some random character "cause he's cool." Make sure that you have a reason behind the sudden change. I tend to add things that dont have a true meaning and are pointless to the plot and overall scheme of things. Make sure that you try to keep everything close to the plot to avoid the reader losing interest and getting confused. AND about endings . . . I DO find that difficult because I just want to keep going on and on . . . and on . . . kinda like this answer.

lol, I love to write and it kinda is apparent . . . would you like to read my story.

Yeah I do find it hard to write stories.



I have no problem with having ideas for them but I can never ever finish writing one. If I have the beginning I don't have the middle or the end, or i might just get an idea for one scene and not be able to move much further from there.

I am also dyslexic, I don't have many problems with spellings but grammar and punctuation can be quite a problem for me.

After saying all that I probably think i'd find it much harder NOT writing stories because then they would just stay in my head and clutter up against each other until they drive me crazy. So I guess its good to look at it all in perspective

yes for sure! ESPECIALLY putting my thoughts into words, that is so hard for me, and sometimes when people read it they are like huh??  If i am very inspired its never hard for me to come up with ideas, but to actually write them on paper is definitely hard, it just takes lots of practice.  I think the more you read other peoples work the better you become at writing.

I'm 122000 words into my new novel, and I think my head is about to explode. There are so many things I'm worried about- it's too long, the plot doesn't make sense, some of the characters are paper-thin . . . the only thing that's keeping me going is the knowledge that some of the book is really good, and that if I work hard and focus, I WILL be able to finish it. I need to keep reminding myself that it's a LONG HAUL- I wrote three novels in a year and none of them were good enough to publish, and then I wrote a novel in 14 months and it WAS good enough, so the longer I take the better the follow-up will be.

I'm a terribly disorganised writer, so I don't 'plan' the days work like most authors. Instead, I just let the scenes flow. I always try and end a scene with a killer sentence that is so good that the reader has to keep going, and on the rare day that nothing comes to me, I get antsy and nervous. I aim to write two thousand words a day, and it's quite depressing to know that of those 2000 words, 1500 will end up being 'cut'.

The other thing that keeps me going is the fact that I love writing- the worst days writing I ever did was still better than my best day of 'real' work.

I love writing.  Usually I'm inspired to write by a scene in a movie or something particularly good or bad I've read in a book, other times it may be a dream I've had that I think has some really good solid elements and plot points.  In all the cases I have a very vivid picture of who and what I want.  Occasionally my characters get off center because I'm having a bad day or a particularly good day and my characters don't seem true to the scene or themselves.  It's then that I may work the re-writes to get them back on track, really look at the scene.  Most of the time when I have one idea I find it breaks off and blossoms into several ideas and the words always seem to flow.  Lately I've felt like I've used all the words in the English language to describe my loves scenes and romantic moments (I'm a romance writer) then I realized how many abandoned notes I had scribbled around and tore into them.  Many times I'll skip those scenes until I feel amorous.  Similarly if I want a particularly authentic fight scene I'll study an action adventure movie or wait until someone ticks me off driving and pour those emotions into the writing.  And I've learned not to give the emotion away, I can stew for a minute or two but mostly I can analyze in a way that I can then project into the story whether it be by setting or tone or plot or character.



And somewhere along the lines the story speeds up and in order to keep up and stay true to the story I do handwrites then type that way I can have a type of outline to follow and re-work.  I may have the scenes out of order in the book but at least they're all there and then the typewritten copy is linnear so I don't lose any plot points, build up, character development etc...



I make sure I do a page a day or sometimes a chapter even when I don't want to and when it's so bad I put it somewhere else because later I need a fight and that scene I wrote before is close to perfect with a few edits.  Either way I don't 'delete' per se I just put to one side that way the ideas are always available to step up when I think I'm fresh out of ideas.  Even if they don't work sometimes they can be an inspiration and sometimes that's all a writer needs.

I don't want a really boring and complicated one, but rather a book that one would enjoy and also one that would make a good essay.



I have some ideas for books:

-The five people you meet in heaven(Mitch Albom)
-A fine Balance(Rohinton Misty)
-Great Expectations(Charles Dickens)
-The english patient(Michalel Ondaatje)

So which one do you guys recommend and why.

Well, this is only my opinion but I was very moved by "The Five People you Meet in Heaven."



I'm not that great at sticking with a book. If it bores me, it bores me, and I tend to abandon it a couple of chapters in; but this one I read right through. I couldn't put it down.

It's very nicely written with a simple narrative style, so no need for a dictionary in one hand as you read. And I think it would make great subject material for an essay. There's a lot to explore there in terms of human relationships and how they interweave both in this life and possibly the one beyond.



But everyone is different, and you must go by what you like yourself.

I agree with Reena on this. I think you should read them all and then decide which on would be best for the essay.  I too read up to fine books a week and last night on my shift I finished one and all but a few pages finished another in 9 hours!  So they wouldn't take long to read.

I recently read The five people you meet in heaven in one night shift.

"Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night. Very dark, but there were stars - points of light and reason....And then you shot across my sky like a meteor. Suddenly everything was on fire; there was brilliancy, there was beauty. When you were gone, when the meteor had fallen over the horizon, everything went black. Nothing had changed, but my eyes were blinded by light. I couldn't see the stars anymore, and there was no more reason for anything."

I know it's a long one...but I love it! I cried the first time I read it. I know, I'm such a sap.

About 60. This isn't including books I've I've studied, just books for my own enjoyment.

I've done well this year, I was really struggling to get into any books last year and only read 10 the whole years. For me that's unheard of!



But I've been reading an eclectic bunch of stuff this year. And I've discovered that I really like historical fiction and I'm currently reading Philippa Gregory.

I keep a list and it says about 38.  I have a tendency to read books at work and separate titles at home and then I compile them on the list at least once every three months so my count isn't accurate.  I started out with The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom, then read Cross and Double Cross by James Patterson also with his books The 5th Horsemen and Quickie.  I read books that my teen reads so we can discuss it and I can assist with her homework, like Lily B. on the Brink of Cool Elizabeth Cody Kimmel, Secret Society Girls: An Ivy League Novel by Diana Peterfruend, I got very into Dean Koontz's new series Odd Thomas and devoured the four books someone gave me.

Not counting books relating to my profession, probably 20, but then I tend to pick books with small print and a lot of pages.
I've read 2 Jack Whyte books - about the Crusades, 4 Maureen McCullough books about ancient Rome, Edward Rutherfurd's Rebels of Ireland, Sarum and London, Ken Follett's The Pillars of Earth and for light relief a couple of Ben Elton's books and I'm in the middle of my second Jeremy Clarkson book. I've also re-read Catcher in the Rye by Salinger and William Golding's Lord of the Flies.
Just about to start on The Bastard of Istanbul  by Elif Shafak.

Wow! Do I feel inadequate?

I thought I was a prolific book reader, but I'm nowhere near some of these people.  100 books - I take my hat off to you, that is brilliant.

I'm currently reading Genome by Matt Ridley ( it's excellent, and makes me feel really clever) and have probably read about 12 or so since January.

Is being an author that great?



i'm 16 years old,love writing ,i almost do it instinctively.The words flow down and they're just there.But i'm afraid that's the wrong thing for me,i'm afraid that even if i got published and became a well known author would that realy be great...what do u think?..should i die and be sure that there's one soul out there that felt happy or hopeful for reading my books.I know it sounds stupid,but i can't just be average in the one arena i believe i belong in...so what is greatness really?

Canadian book Publisher POD?



Many places for Canadians to self-publish at an affordable price with small minimums are usually in the USA, where postage costs are often more than the printing cost. Using Create-a-space.com service (https://www.createspace.com/) a soft cover book cost an amazing $4.10 (US) to print but $24.00 and up to mail it. With current currency exchange- there is not way to sell the book in Canada. Similar problems occur with Lulu.com (http://lulu.com), the printing cost  is affordable, but shipping at 2-3 times that cost for delivery from South Carolina. A Small Mystery Novel that the author has added $1.00 to his printing cost, sold for $6.95 (US$) but shipping and packaging was $21.30 more.



Readers BookCase Publishing is offering both conventional and self-publish services, as made in Canada, geared to Canadian marketing and affordable. Picking economical book sizing, will give you  books printed and delivered at price you will be able to sell. Authors are able to avoid shipping costs, by selling it on line through their eStore. https://wingrove-press.com/books/

I think of Bach and Beethoven... Classical works.  Edward and Bella  story, although modern and fantasical by every stretch of the imagination, is a very old and ancient love story filled with complications and undeniable love.  Classic pieces definitely express and heighten that feeling.

Well...this song is actually more of a Midnight Sun song...cause it's kind of how Edward was feeling...what he was going through (it's crazy cause if you've read the first chapter of MS, there's even the same metaphor)



The song is Twisted, by Carrie Underwood.

This is really funny but I find that the song that always pops into my head is Mariah Carey's "Always be my baby". It somewhat makes sense if you just read the lyrics.



That's the style of music I listen to (90's R&B) and so it's somewhat difficult to imagine the appropriate songs to go along with the story for me because I realize that they like to listen to opera and old school type stuff but that's not for me.



And the lyrics to "Blue moon" by Ella Fitzgerald, as well.

Try reading Misery, by Stephen King as well. As for movies, I don't know why, but Silence of the lambs is the scariest for me. I still shiver when I hear Goodbye Horses by Q lazarus!

I have never read a scary book. They just can't be scary. Although, pictures come intoo mind i just don't find them flowing to scare me. Movies however are different. Scary movie? Saw? Saw II? Saw III? Nah they are not scary; more disgusting. I think the exorcist is quite scary; although there were disgusting bits, there was a good storyline.

So I decided to participate in NaNoWriMo....?



Okay, since I am not working right now, it's the perfect time for me to try to do this.  I have come up with an idea that I think I could easily write about.  However, even though I think I can really get the idea down I'm not sure it's the type of book I would like to read. Does that make any sense???



Do writers normally write a genre different than they read?  I usually like to read very dramatic books but my idea is a kind of mystery/romance.

Apparently if you stand in front of a mirror at midnight on Halloween, light a candle and say the "Hail Mary" backwards, the devil will come and claim your soul. (i.e. you won't die that night, but when your life ends, he will be the one who gets your soul.)



If you stand in front of a mirror at midnight, light a candle and comb your hair while eating an apple, you will see the image of the person you are going to marry standing behind you.

Perks of being a Wallflower songs?



If you were making a movie about this book, what songs would you use and why. Here's a breif summary of the book:



"As "Charlie" enters high school he must deal with the suicide of his single close friend in his class and an ever continuing feeling of guilt over the death of his Aunt. As an entering freshman, Charlie finds friendship in two seniors Sam (who he falls in love with) and Patrick. Sam and Patrick introduce Charlie to their friends, who immediatly accept Charlie into the group. As Charlie begins to get into school his English teacher, Bill, recognizes his genius and begins to give him work beyond the class room to stimulate and interest him. The relationship between Bill and Charlie progresses from teacher and student to a true friendship.



As the book countinues Charlie matures and begins to become intergrated into highschool. He deals with his first girlfriend and his first breakup, Sex, drugs and rock and roll all are introduced to him. As he begins to become more confortable with his life, he uncovers an ugly supressed memory that changes his life."

I don't mean to be obvious, but you'd have to use the Smiths' track "Asleep" in a very understated kind of way (given its importance in the book.  You're talking about that MTV/Chbosky book, right?).



I would probably also use some new Iron and Wine, and likely some Grizzly Bear.

Two good books that feature some form of time travel are Green Darkness, by Anya Seton, and The House on the Strand, by Daphne DuMaurier.



DuMaurier also wrote a book called Mary Anne, which begins with a flashback (NOT time travel, which is quite different), and that may be what you are referring to.

You can maybe put some romantic quotes on there that Edward has said to Bella, like about how she was a meteor that shot across his sky (I believe that was in New Moon, though I don't know which page number). Maybe you could put the quote from Shakespeare in New Moon on the back of the shirt?



Or, you can put snarky Team Vampire sayings on it, like:



Only vampires can love you forever.
Edward Cullen: Because I'd rather have winter than summer.
I like my men cold, dead, and sparkly.



Or, you could put the original movie tagline: The Forbidden Fruit tastes the sweetest.

Authors of romance style fiction.... please give me some feed back?



I have an idea for a over all story idea which would translate into a set of about 20+ books or romances concerning a group of women.  When approaching a publishing house to see if they are interested in my book... Should I make them aware that I could possible be looking at producing that many books?  Are publishers interested in publishing books that could possible have an AUDIENCE that would be loyal through that many books?  Well I know they probably would.. it would make sense financially but what I need to know is whether to push that goal when dealing with them.  Just how many books should I already have written in the series before I submit the first one?  Should I have a couple of the next ones ready to go too?

I think that's a very good idea. As such you will know which books precisely you want and not choose any nonsense. The problem with me is that I always lose my lists and as such spend, or rather waste, a lot of time trying to remember what books I want to look for and read. I does not matter however long you take to read all the books on your list, the essential is that you have taken the pains to write it down and go by it, which, believe me, is very essential.



Hope this helps and good reading!

Counterpoint here--lists make me feel guilty. (Looking at all those titles that I have yet to cross off...) And having a list tends to take away, for me, the joy of discovery when I walk the shelves at the public library or the aisles at the local bookstore. I don't want to pick up a book and say, "Okay, here's one for the list." I want to pick up a book and be so excited by the premise or the writing that I MUST read this book right now. Lists end up feeling too much like "should reads" to me.



But whatever keeps ANY of us reading, I'm all in favor of it.

Yep! I did this on monday. I've got 46 books on my list so far and i'm half way through the first one already.
I wrote it out in different coloured pens so it's more readable and stuck it on the wall. Every time i finish a book i'm going to cross it off and date it and replace with another book.
Good luck!

It's good, keeps you from walking back and forth for hours at barnes and noble trying to pick out your next book.
I've done that for a while. One thing I had to do was limit my list to ten books. It grew to the size that I was looking over it just as long as I was spending at the book store with the old method.

Of course! That way you won't forget all the books you want to read and when you come across another good title, you can just add it to the list. I do this too, by the way.

lol i know what you mean everybody around me was practically hypnoticed by that book i was like 'vampires? hell no i am not reading them' guess what? i became addicted



twilight is pretty much about a girl who falls in love with a vampire. She moves to a small town named Forks (in Washington) in order to live with her father. She's intrigued by this gorgeous boy named Edward Cullen and his family because no one in the school really knows anythign about them, and they seem to be perfect. She's also awfully curious as to why Edward seems to hate her from the very first second. A lot of stuff happens, she finds out Edward's a vampire and lucky for her, he likes her enough to resist her blood. The rest of the book is about their struggles because obviously it can't be easy for a vampire and human to be in love. wiki has a great summary but it tells most major plot elements so if u want to know all of the story, look at it. I loved this book, and if you haven't read it yet, read it! hope this helps =]

You gotta read it girl before the movie comes out November 21!!! Seriously, I can't put it down, its amazing!!! Simple but beautiful girl Bella moved to sleepy town Forks to live with her father after her mum decides to remarry... She goes into this high school and was intrigued by a group of students who were too good looking and sophisticated yet strange in a way cos during lunch hour when everybody else are eating, the group just sits there everyday NOT eating at all (LOL)..Then to make it short, she fell in love with one of the guys named Edward Cullen & found out he was a Vampire....Simple plot but the way it was being written, awesome!! My fave line would be, 'I MAY NOT BE HUMAN, BUT I AM STILL A MAN..." cos he was so in love with her and fighting so hard not to suck her blood and kill her.... Later on in the story, it becomes a love triangle of some sort between him, a Vampire, Bella, a human, and Jacob Black, who happens to be a werewolf.... :)

Any info on Andrew Jacksons books of all his presidential letters he wrote while in office?



I have a volume set of very old books that contain all his letters that he wrote while he was in office. I am trying to find out if they contain any value. They are in good condition. They were printed in the 1800's. Any info on this would be appreciated.

I've completed a children's book including artwork. What next?



I wrote a children's book for some students at my school. It's completely finished including the art work. Everything is put together and completed. Where do I go from here in order to publish is, distribute it, get it in the hands of parents and children everywhere and make a little money doing it?

Maybe lil Petey could go out and pick red, red apples, green grapes from a vine, orange pumpkins from the patch and the most purple blue blue berries from a bush when it rains and it seems the rain is washing away all the colors.  It is as if the world is a steel gray.  Pete complains how he hates the rain for stealing his 'happiness and joy' but his parents explain why we need the rain and just when Petey accepts rain as a good thing and dressing in his duck suit (rain suit) it stops.  Next comes fog making it spooky and scary and then the rain bow which fill the sky with all the colors around his little yellow cottage.

<answer>



Because the "Lord" is not his name, it's his title.



So his name was Alfred Tennyson.  Once he became a Lord, one way to write his name is Alfred, Lord Tennyson.



The same applies to Byron.



His full name, reflecting his title,  was George Gordon, Lord Byron.
Queen Elizabeth can be referred to, among other things, as Queen Elizabeth II, Lord of Mann.



ETA:  To answer your further question, people refer to both men in various ways.  Tennyson is often called "Tennyson".  Byron is often called "Lord Byron".

He was a 1st Baron, a descendant of King Edward II of England, and appropriately one would write his name as such.



His full name and title is Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson.



When you are a descendant of a King your title is a show of familial tie, regency and honor.

How do you find your next book to read?



I love to read but i find myself reading alot of random books, which is ok. We goto the local thrift store every once in awhile, there books are .10 cents so i go through and get any that look the least bit interesting, i figure if i spend $3-4 on a bunch of random books and end up with just one or two good ones then its worth it, but i usually end up reading them all because well they're there.  :) how do you pick books?

Read the monthly reviews in papers. You will be able to gauge whether you like the story line or not from the review. That's pretty effective.
Get a library membership. You can check out books and authors to see if you like them. Borrow books from friends and get recommendations from friends as well. Happy Reading!

One book usually leads to another. If I like an author, I will read more of his or her books. I read about the author (who inspired him or her, what time period they are from) and get ideas from that.



Also, I hang out in book stores a lot.



I read book reviews in magazines and in the newspaper. This leads me to books I might not have heard of otherwise.



My friends are readers, and I am interested in what they like to read.



Mostly, I just read what I never had time to read in school.

Well...my favorite detectives have a gift for seeing things others don't...and they're able to put these little things together and make big things out of them which lead to the case being solved...these are TV detectives though...not sure if there's a dramatic difference...



So your detective could maybe as a child (unless it's supposed to be a child detective, either way) Could just realize they have a knack for seeing the unseen...they're able to think logically...they have a want to help others...there could be a certain case that hit close to home with them and they felt compelled to help solve it because of something that happened in their life...



That's my input...if I knew more about the character I might be able to help more...maybe...hope I have helped though!

Depends on where you are.  In the United States, there are different types of detective.  There are police detectives, private detectives, and so on.  You cannot become either of those things until you are an adult, and for a police detective you need a lot of training and experience, and you have to pass a difficult test.



Private detectives have to be licensed.  As for "motivation", I assume you mean what makes a person WANT to be a detective?



You can surely make that part up for the purposes of your novel.

Considering the emphasis put on reading to your children and the research behind it that proves how it helps children I would think this would be true through out your life.  If someone can't think logically then it is not due to reading but to an underlying cause.

No, I think fiction readers -- seeing how a plausible world can be constructed within a work of non-fact -- tend to gain perspective on the world around them, discerning what works and what doesn't.  Whether the setting is another planet or one familiar to them from our world already, the fact that every reality has certain rules the author(s) are willing to follow (see a story lately without cause preceding effect or the "pull" of gravity?) indicates rules that readers can and must follow.



Whether they choose to write their own fiction (I've written two novels, one novella, and I'm working now on one more of each) or whatever direction they take in life, they discern a specific framework to work in inspired by a fictional example.



Often, that's the only way to communicate a truth to a reader or hearer -- consider epics like the Iliad or the Odyssey, the Star Wars saga, or the parables of Jesus for they communicate some specific truth about human beings because they're all written by and for ... human beings.



Far from losing their capacity to think logically, fiction and material presented as fiction (Christians, I am NOT saying Jesus' parables are fiction, please reread this section and substitute "story" for "fiction" if it pleases you), from "The Cat In The Hat" to "Watchmen" enables its reader to draw conclusions from it about life they never would have from mere fact.

Anyone know a good site for publishing a book?



i'm looking for a site where i can publish a story i'm writing right now. this is my first book, so i am not sure how to publish! i dubbed it for the time being 'Shinobi no mono' (the historical name for ninja) as it is a ninja novel. i am trying to put together all my ninja and ninjutsu (the art of the ninja) knowledge into one novel. but it is already VERY long, so thinking about making a sequel! lo! i think it is a fairly good storyline, and am making it up as i go along. LOTS of fights, assassinations, sex, and other exciting material! so can anyone tell me where and how to publish a book?!!!



</question>



<additional details>



i meant the kind of publishing where ur book is SOLD, like at bookstores and such, and u get PAID for it! lo! although i might try posting my story there just for the heck of it!!!



thanks, but i meant the kind of publishing where ur book gets SOLD, like at bookstores and such, and i get PAID!!! lo!!! but i might just post my story there just for the heck of it!!! haha!!!!!



sorry about the same additional details twice! lo! i thought it had failed the first time when i wrote it, so i came back and wrote it again!



Spywriter, thanks for the tips!!! don't worry though! i'm not planning on trying to publish it until i've gone over my story a few times (AFTER i've completed it!), and make any changes i see fit! actually i'm in the process of reading it through what i've written so far, right now, although i'm not finished yet (because my story is so long even now that i have a hard time remembering what i wrote!), and ALREADY i've made several changes! so u don't worry about that!



oh...one thing...about the name!!! sorry, i wrote 'Shinobi no mono' in my original question instead of 'The Shinobi no mono' which is what i actually dubbed my story as!!! lo! forgot to write 'the'!!!

www.quizilla.com is a good place to post up your stories. they publish it for you, so your ideas cant be stolen. u can post about one a day to keep your readers coming back for more. (although u can post as many as u want. i usually like posting one a day)



its great! but make sure to save all ur stuff on your computer because sometimes the site crashes and you have to rewrite it if you were writing it on the web. a lot of ppl who use quizilla post very long stories, so your book should be fine. also, readers rate your stuff, so you can have a good idea of what people think of your stories before getting them officially published on paper.



good luck to you! :)



btw, my URL on quizilla is gummybare76



although it doesnt really work anymore cuz i think someone hacked into it, you can read my stuff if you like.

Ok, I'm trying to remember the title of this book. I read it in grade school, so it's probably a young adult book.



Synopsis: A young girl is ignored by her family. She eventually is forgotten about and lives within the walls of her house.



Does anyone know what this is? I need to find it! Thank you so much!

Thinly veiled stories of people from your past.



Items in the newspaper or on the news that make you think "what if".



Writer's Digest books. They have more than a few on creating writing ideas.



Personal fantasy involving thinly veiled people from your present. But you could get sued.



Take an old OLD idea and modernize it (like centuries old. ie Homer's Odyssey became Oh Brother Where Art Thou)



Read John Campbell's and Carl Jung and Caroline Myss' books about archetypes. Place archetypes in modern setting.

Do something like, cause and effect, and tie stuff together. Like: this bad event happened, so this guy did something to stop that, but in stopping that, the guy used something that would make another bad thing happen.



Then, try to add some personal stuff if you like: The guy did not know who was his father, and the bad thing is a bad guy which is his father. Probably the father tells his side of the story and the main character has an inner conflict.



Cause and effect, relationships, past events, keep those in mind ;D.

me an my group of friends are all writing and have written two books. the way that we come up with plot ideas is to sometimes think oh something that you like our hate about your life. then you would come up with a main character. he/she would be like you. you would be able to make up a life wheter its in the gladiator days, caveman days, or 7003. my group all has their own character in my story. that makes it easier on cominng up with the characters personalities. also for the plot, there may be a tv show or movie that you like, you could base your story of of that.

Not your favorite book, or the best-written ones. Not the most exciting or most popular. Just a book that you have a deeper connection with, maybe because of one sentence in it or because of who read it with you or because you grew up with the main character.

The House on Mango Street because something about the way Sandra Cisneros narrates the entire book through the mind of a child really brings the whole book to life. It's definitely not a book to just skim over the pages just because of it's size. It's context disguises a vast majority of well rooted meanings when thoroughly read and it's really quite enjoyable.

1 - I thought it was just so full of cliche. Meyer writes like an 11 year old. Also her characters are flat. bella just seemed like way to much of a wimp for me to relate to her. What kind of example is that for young teens!

1,000,000,000,000,000, I liked New Moon the best, And Jacob. Jacob is why I like New Moon. He seems so friendly and loyal! (I don't care that I just described a dog. He is half one anyways!!!) I loved all of the characters, but Jacob is definitely #1.

Title for this story?



I got the idea for this while passing by an old animal hospital, the place looks abandoned. Anyway got this idea for a story how it starts of like this.



Info: Birch-wood animal hospital was once a busy vet's office, patients varied from common pets to exotics. The office remained open until it folded on July 12th 1985. The building had been closed due to financial and health reasons. Now taking up residence are former patients  that were left behind. The main character is Walker, an albino Belgian shepherd. Other residents include Mozart the cat,  Mullet the english mastiff, Dayton the ferret and other characters, including Portia, another shepherd. One day, Walker hears howling and other noises from a locked room.  After week of hearing the noise, Walker decides to investigate and discovers one of the main causes of why the office was closed.



I had originally titled the story 'Condemned' since the vet's office is no longer used but thought it was little dark. The animals do talk in the story. It's not a horror story since I don't write in that catagory.



Anyway, could use some title suggestions, any takers?

Are there any other women in their thirties in love with Edward Cullen?



I'm a happily married, 33-year-old woman, but I just can't get him off my mind. Now, I know he looks 17, but he's so much more mature, wise, and romantic because of his years in existence. He's a dream come true. Am I the only woman in this age group to have feelings for this fictional character?



</question>



<additional details>



It's funny ... some people think older women liking Edward is comparable to a pedophile. Yet, it's okay for him to love someone who is so young and impressionable. To me, that seems more wrong. He's got the mind of a man and the body of a boy...

love your question - I'm in my fifties and love Edward - when someone in my writers group recommended twilight I said no way i hate stories with vampires and werewolves - was I wrong! love the whole series and although I write romance novels I just couldn't get enough of this story



</answer>



<asker's comment>



I love this answer. I have trouble thinking of Edward as a physical being, so to me he is ageless. It's the idea of him that I love--his compassion, devotion, wisdom, and inner being. On the surface he seems overbearing and harsh, but if you look deeper, you will see the beauty in his intensity.

I would like to clarify based on an answer that was posted earlier. Age does matter. Lusting after a boy is disgusting and totally inappropriate for an adult woman. There is no condoning such behavior, ever, and I would certainly never intend otherwise. Edward is a representation, not a person.

hes abusive, hes controlling, he likes stalking Bella, he likes sniffing his girlfriend, he steals personal property (when he left Bella in New Moon, he got rid of her gifts), he forces Bella to do stuff, he doesn't listen to Bella when she tries to say something, hes over protective, he is a lying, cheating, stalking pedophile and a thief. Its kind of sad that your in love with a fictional character especially with these traits. good luck.

That's quite creepy, m'am. Although he is a 107-year-old man, Meyer intended him to be 17 forever, and I consider that pedophiliac-ish.



EDIT: Man there's a lot of pedophiles on this forum!



EDIT: Age shouldn't matter, but try telling that to a judge who deems you as a pedophile in court for having sex with a boy who is very mature for his age. Basically you're saying that as long as a boy is mature, you can lust after him all you want.

Book recommendation! Easy ten points?



Well, it is my birthday fast approaching and I need to tell my Mum a book that I would like. So I thought I would ask what book you would recommend, considering the following:
*I do not enjoy Sci-Fi
*I have already read Twilight!!!
*My favourite books are: The Book Thief, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, The Bronze Horseman, Night, Pride and Prejudice, anything my Jane Austen, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Tess of the D'Ubervilles, A Thousand Splendid Suns, The adventures of Huckleberry Finn.



*So I guess the only trend I can see in those books is that I generally like books which were not published about this generation best.



*I enjoy reading boos around WW2, that have historical information about the war but also some kind of fictional story (as is seen in The Book Thief, The Guernsey Literary..., Suite Francaise and The Bronze Horseman)
*Also, I am sixteen, but I don't like teenage fiction books, generally, unless they are very very good and not revolving around the same old Girl at school meets boy at school and so on.



So any suggestions?
Thankkks

1984 is sci-fi, you silly girl :P



If you really did like 1984, I would recommend either The Handmaiden's Tale (An excellent feminist novel set in the future, I highly recommend), or Brave New World.
Both of those books are great reads, quick, and will definitely serve you later in life.

Granny nightgown needed?



Where can I find a granny nightgown with cap for a reasonable price. I can only find expensive authentic prairie ones and others have wolfe parts attached to it. Help, I need it for Halloween!

<answer>



You could probably buy a long flannel nightgown at any major department store.  You might have to make your own hat.  You could buy some flannel at a fabric store.  I think that the kind of hat you are describing would probably just be a circle gathered with ribbon.  Someone at the fabric store might be able to help you with how to make one.

Not much to the central premise, but Christian institutions do have a rather dark past, and an even darker origin.



This is a free read and is a lot more specific than the Da Vinci Code. Called "Gospel Enigma," it is the 10th free e-book on this long page of free in copyright e-books: http://newfreebooks.com



Have fun. It is a great read.

What is the narrative voice in Frankenstein? ?



I cant seem to figure it out. I know the narrative voice of the monster/creature is surprisingly  is gentle and guileless . But what about victor? or the other characters? how does shelley make the voice distinct from other characters?



Also, what are the ethical issues in this book.
the only think i came up with is aborting and human cloning. what else.
thanks for your input and ten pts for best answers.

Sounds interesting. Why does it need to be descriptive? I think as long as it gives the reader some idea of what it is about or stands out then it's good. Without reading the story or having more to go on its not easy to come up with a title.



Also if you haven't actually written it yet then I suggest writing it (or at least a large part of it). Title isn't that important and if you have the story it will be easier to get a title.



Worlds combined?
Brothers together: A new world?
A past forgotten?
A past revealed?



If I were you I'd write down key words that are to do with the story and see what you come up with

um. you're the writer. writes write their OWN titles.



But I can help you, try choosing a name or phrase out of your book thats interesting, and at least has something to do with your book.



Try writing the title AFTER you write the book, I can promise you that that helps alot when searching for a title.

Chapter VIII
http://www.mollands.net/etexts/northange...
"Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen, that she would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney with seats, as they had agreed to join their party. This was accordingly done, Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them; and after a few minutes' consideration, he asked Catherine to dance with him. This compliment, delightful as it was, produced severe mortification to the lady; and in giving her denial, she expressed her sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she really felt it that had Thorpe, who joined her just afterwards, been half a minute earlier, he might have thought her sufferings rather too acute. The very easy manner in which he then told her that he had kept her waiting did not by any means reconcile her more to her lot; nor did the particulars which he entered into while they were standing up, of the horses and dogs of the friend whom he had just left, and of a proposed exchange of terriers between them, interest her so much as to prevent her looking very often towards that part of the room where she had left Mr. Tilney. Of her dear Isabella, to whom she particularly longed to point out that gentleman, she could see nothing. They were in different sets. She was separated from all her party, and away from all her acquaintance; -- one mortification succeeded another, and from the whole she deduced this useful lesson, that to go previously engaged to a ball does not necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady. From such a moralizing strain as this, she was suddenly roused by a touch on the shoulder, and turning round, perceived Mrs. Hughes directly behind her, attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman. "I beg your pardon, Miss Morland," said she, "for this liberty, -- but I cannot anyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you." Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine. The young ladies were introduced to each other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness, Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of the obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with having so respectably settled her young charge, returned to her party."

Book suggestion like Jason Steed or Alex Rider?



I have been spoilt. I have read:
1) Twilight series. Liked it
2) Fledgling Jason Steed. Really Loved it read it twice.
3) Alex Rider. Loved it.
4) Ravens Gate. Liked it
5)Young James Bond. Liked it
6) Jimmy Coates. Liked it



So what next. I enjoy the YA fiction teen hero's they are great I wish Anthony Horowitz would write more Alex Rider and cant wait for the next Jason Steed. A new Jimmy Coates is out next month but what do I read now? I need something to read (Its better than homework lol)
Can you suggest anything for a 14 yr old boy. (No sex, drugs or horror, I dont like them scary)

Yes, but the books have to be old enough not to be protected by copyright law any longer (usually at least 75 years old.)



That site is www.gutenberg.org.



There are thousands of books available there, but if you're looking for something recent, it won't be available to read for free on line.  Authors and publishers are entitled to be paid for their work, you know.

Wrote a opening to a story ( gory )?



I’m going to tell you about the day that I lost my childhood, the day that started the rest of my life, that changed my ambitions, my goals, and ultimately my life.



It was three years ago in the small city of Charlottetown Prince Edward Island.  I was attending my regular schedule going to classes at Colonel  Gray High School but we just called it the gray back then.



I remember my first hint that something wasn’t quite right when my teacher..or substitute as she was for the past few days walked in and started speaking to the class.



Her voice was rough and low as a males and she had appeared to have started to sprout a bit of a beard.  I didn’t think much of it at the time, it was just one of those things that me and the other students in my class would make fun of her for later but, as the class progressed I could have sworn her face was starting to protrude around her mouth and her fingernails were getting longer.



Around the middle of class she started speaking very spaced she sort of sounded like that space captain on that “Star Trek” show.  I knew then and there something wasn’t right she didn’t even seem worried, like she didn’t know what was happening to her.



I got the gut feeling that I should leave the room, I felt in danger, so I raised my hand and asked if I could go to the bathroom and she said sure but, she looked like she was going to kill me.



I came back to the class after an extra long trip to the bathroom to find that the small plexiglass window on the door was covered in a red piece of paper, or so I thought it was.
I knocked on the door impatiently, I wanted to get back in because I didn’t need the teacher any angrier with me then she already was.



After about five minutes of knocking I got frustrated and walked outside to go to the window,  something didn’t feel right, my class was full of the “druggies” so it was usually very loud but I heard nothing.



I approached the window with caution and flipped off some kids who were making fun of me for stalking along the wall and when I got there and peered into the window. What I saw made me vomit there right against the chalkboard a kid I knew his name was Richard I think but he went by “big D” was through the board, his blood splattered across the board like some gruesome abstract portrait.



That’s not all I saw, the majority of the kids were hunched over their desks still as boards blood pooling beneath their skulls and I soon found out what really was covering the door, a thick trail of blood that lead down to the body of an old enemy of mine Percy Stone.



I slumped down to the grass horrified, that was the first lucky thing that saved my life that day for just as my head moved from where it was this beast jumped though the window maw clamping down with a thud where my head hd been moments before.
“****!” I exasperated, “what the hell was that thing!”



Before I could get a good look, it was off, into another classroom.



Stupidly I followed it to try to stop it, ha that’s a laugh if only I had known what the effects of this action would have been maybe I would have stopped but probably not I enjoy this life to much.



I saw it go into my morning math room and I swung my myself through the broken window.  What I saw startled me even more, the students were half massacred bodies littered the ground. and what was left of the living students were to scared to move the were all looking towards the same scene.



I followed their gaze and saw it, my teacher, or what as humanly left of her at least feeding on my math teacher.  I flinched as a heard the bone crunch and near vomited again at the gruesome sight and this saved my life for the second time that day, for as I keeled over in near vomiting state it jumped at me again and missed only to hit one of the few living students in the chest.



I  heard a horrible cracking sound which could only be the breaking of everyone of the girls ribs as the giant beast struck.



what do you honestly think :P

Since most short stories can be of length anywhere from a few hundred words to about 17,500 words, and novellas 'start' at 17,500 and can be up to 40,000 words in length, with novels starting at 40,000 words on up to the stratosphere, the length of epic poems takes them right out of any possibility of being a novel since none I know of are at least 40,000 words long, though of course I don't know all epic poems.



Add to that the fact epic poems have at least a recognized meter if not a recognized rhyme and you see that epic poems and novels are most certainly not the same type of writing at all.

That's the point of books. If you have an active imagination, good for you. I know that I usually put myself in the character's shoes, and it makes me like the book a bit more. Like when I read suspense books i get panic attacks because i had been reading as if I were the character. i know it's silly to some, but I enjoy books better that way. ^_^

In The Wasp Factory (Iain Banks), did Angus dress Eric up as a girl when he was younger?



The book says 'my father dressing Eric up as a girl was just, as it turned out. a rehearsal for me'. I took this to mean that from the outset, Angus was curious about gender identity and toyed with Eric also. But I've found an article on the Internet that says that Frank's memories of Eric being dressed as a girl were actually just suppressed memories of himself when he was still being raised as female. Does anyone know which it is?

Have you tried Lord Loss by Darren Shan?



It's about a boy who has led a normal life until his parents and sister were brutally murdered by demons. He then found out that their parents had made a bargain with a demon to cure his sister who was starting to change into a werewolf. But something went wrong, so they were murdered instead. Later, the boy lived with his uncle and tried to uncover the secrets about his family and the werewolf disease in his family history. I can't explain much, I don't even remember the name of the boy himself as I've read the book years ago. But I found the novel quite interesting to read. In fact, I think it's good, in my opinion at least. It's a young adult genre though, so I don't know if that's your taste.

Authors - does one need to complete all research for a novel before beginning to write?



My mother along with a couple distant relatives of mine are working on a historical fiction novel based on real geneological events in our anscestor's lives.



My mother is working in the research end of things at the moment but will also be involved in the writing.



She recently wrote to the woman (some distant cousin or other) who is doing the main writing asking if next time they meet up they could discuss how the story is going to be written - what person it will be written in, whether or not there will be a narrator, whether or not they will flip between present and past etc. She also wanted to discuss a timeline for the writing of the book so they can have general deadlines to aim for.



She got a rather snippy response which basically said that such a thing is impossible without first gathering ALL their research about the setting, time-period, people, etc. That writing a novel can take up to 20 years and there is no way they can even begin to discuss writing chapters of the book beyond the first (which she already wrote).
Here's a quote "Before plotting, we need to determine the
theme, characters, events, descriptions, relationships, etc., etc.,etc. and so much more. Once we know those, we can go on to determine the structure and form of the book as well as how we will deal with issues like continuous or contiguous time, linear vs. non-linear construction , voice, point of
view, genre, and so on."



My question is - which of them is being unreasonable?
Is it unreasonable of my mom to expect to be able to flesh out the book's POV and general construction without having all the research done first? Or is the other lady unreasonable not to have a general idea of these things by this time?
(they've been working on this for about 5-6 months.)

I think both are being slightly unreasonable. Authors generally finish most of the research before they begin, but this definitely does not mean you cant discuss plots and characters or chapters before the research is complete. Both need to be done simultaneously. For eg, to get an outline of the characters, it is necessary to know which character is placed where, who is narrating, who is being villified,etc.Genre also needs to be kept in mind when conducting research. I think both should be involved in both parts of the novel's making.

Both are unreasonable.  The distant cousin is unreasonable for stating a novel like this could take upwards of twenty years.  That's complete nonsense.



I'll give her three at the most, but not twenty.



She is right however when she says SOME of the other things have to be understood better before a plot can be developed.  Characters, events, descriptions, and relationships are important.  Theme however, is something the writer develops AFTER the first draft.  Otherwise, if a writer begins with a theme, he's only going to end up with a preachy book that goes nowhere.



On the other hand, your mother is being unreasonable by saying she can develop the POV and time period construction without knowing these characters and their times better.  This isn't the case with complete fiction. Fiction writers make it up as they go along.  In her case however, she's dealing with real people who lived real lives.  How does your mother know she's not going to run into an engaging great-grandfather later on after she begins to write?  Someone who captivates her imagination, and shows her that he is what the whole family is about?  And therefore, should be who the book is about?  In that case, she'd have to scrap the whole book and start over again.



Both are being unreasonable.

Your mother probably just wanted to discuss the concept of the book, because she's excited about starting it.  In that case, why not advise her to write a few short stories about the characters she does know.  Later, when she and her cousin get together, perhaps she can pull some of these SS's out and see if any of them will fit into the novel.  If not, she can start submitting them to some reputable journals so that she'll be able to find an agent once she does finish her book.

Read my short story? Thoughts? Advice?



I don't know how I got here; all I know is, I've never been here before. A strange world between worlds. A world of nothingness. A space that is all mine. I see black, a deep black surrounding me, echoing through my mind. Everything's simple, slow, and clam; yet my mind has never been so busy. My mind is a waterfall, a constant rush of all lost thoughts and memories.



I remember my grandmother, and how her hands used to look like crinkled sandpaper; but were like velvet to touch. I remember letting the waves wash sticky watermelon from my skin at the beach. I remember how naked and smooth my legs felt, the fist time I shaved them. I remember stripping sheets of ugly wallpaper. I remember feeling weightless as my father pushes me on our old tire swing. What ever happened to our tire swing? I am an empty shell, occupied by nothing but a string of consciousness. My mind is on random.



I have flashes of unexplained images. Scrunched up paper, shriveling as it is slowly consumed by fire. A pink, toothless baby, taking his first breath. A flower opening itself. My dog. A tree crashing to the ground. Orange cordial spilling on a clean counter. Rubble clicking over one another. Ripples on an otherwise still lake. The wind turning the pages of a magazine, like an unobserved force.



Frustration melts through my body, taking away my warmth. I want to be able to smell, to open my eyes, to be in control of my body. I take a deep breath and tense up all over, an attempt to free myself from this calm that has become my prison. I focus. I hoping to hear, to twitch, to point, anything. Out of the blue, I cam smell my Grandma's house, the smell of old ladies. Then:



"Uh! Did you see that?! Roy? She moved her finger! Look! Look! She's doing it again!" A familiar voice fills the air.



Where have I heard her voice before? I can't remember.



I feel a clammy hand at my cheek, "Julia? Can you hear me, sweetheart?"



I focus on my finger, I move it.



The woman sobs, "Oh thank god" she whispers, "It's your mother darling. We're both here, your brother and I."



I feel a small hand on my leg; then a soft face, wet from tears. The vibrations from his sobs run up my body. I can't believe I forgot her voice, my adoring mother.



"Can you hear me sweetness? Are you there?"



I try to speak, my energy is gone. I want nothing more than to hold her hand, to show her that I hear her; but I'm cemented to the bed, a prisoner in my own body. I feel tired.



Mum starts to weep.



"It's okay, I'm fine. Just help me wake up." I try to tell her, nothing comes out.



"I'm so sorry Julia. I'm so, so sorry. Please wake up. Please."



Her tears send tingles down my spine as they land on my neck.



"I've called Auntie Jill, she's going to bring the re..." Her voice fades until it's gone completely. Then silence.



I remember my mother cradling me as I cried for one reason or another; she moped my runny nose with her sleeve and hummed. As my head pressed against her breast, I could hear her heart and her breathing. I felt as though I was back in the womb. Completely safe and warm. I try to imagine such a place, the womb, being a baby. It seems a world away.



I remember taking Roy to the park when he was a baby, he was so new and perfectly unspoiled. Everything we saw was like a new discovery through his eyes, he was fascinated. He'd stare at each blade of grass like it were a piece of art; and dig his tiny finger nails into the dirt, trying to stay as attached to this new world as he could. At that age, everything was so precious, so raw and untouched. It's a wonder how similar we all used to be, once upon a time.



I can hear a slow, steady beeping now. Then, a smoker's cough. I fall back asleep.



My chest hurts, like nothing I've ever felt before. My face is burning up. I can't breath, I can't think, there's nothing but pain. I feel hands all over me, they turn me onto my side. There's a sudden, sharp stab in my back, my chest hurts less now. I fall asleep.



I feel sunlight on my legs, and hear my mother in the background. She's crying. Please don't cry, Mum. I hear a man's voice, then heavy footsteps leaving the room; Mum's wailing grows louder. I put all my energy into trying to speak to her; instead, I get a headache. I drift off.



I remember being nine and climbing a tree, as high as I could. Not once did I look down. I just kept climbing and climbing, up and up. I stood on the highest branch. As I looked out, I could see the red roofs of houses, and aeroplanes, and clouds, and the horizon. It made me feel so small. Then I looked directly below, and felt even smaller. If ever I knew how to get down, it had escaped me now. I sat in that tree for a whole afternoon, with my Aunt underneath, yelling. I sat in the sun, my skin burned. When I finally decided to come down, I slipped and landed on my arm. I had to get a cast. The hospital room smelled o

Would any good writers / editors care to critique three paragraphs?



I'm currently writing the first draft of my first novel, and I want everything to be prefect. If you have any input, be honest and please don't sugar coat anything. If it's terrible, feel free to say so, but at the same time please offer any advice.



One more note: These are the first paragraphs of the book. Do they make you want to continue reading?

Imagine this:
You are growing up with many close friends who invite you to the movie theatre every time a good flick comes to the big screen. You are blessed with a father to admire, a mother to take care of you, and a younger sister to protect. You are getting good grades in school, and have recently begun to explore your future – Colleges, careers, the whole package. Albeit, life is far from perfect, you are still able to wake up each morning with a smile on your face and momentum in your heart – Momentum to live every day to the fullest.



Now imagine this:
Instead of visiting the movie theatre with your friends, you are sitting on a bed, vomiting into a basin because your stomach cannot handle the high doses of chemotherapy.



Your father worries about you all day and all night, your mother cries quietly as she drifts off into a troubled slumber, and your sister watches you from across the room, wondering if you will be with her as she grows up. You wake up each morning feeling as tired as you felt the night before, and every day you fight against a vicious disease that has claimed many, many lives, and now threatens your own.



The disease is childhood cancer.
Every school day, forty-six children are diagnosed with cancer. One in three hundred children will be diagnosed before their twentieth birthday. Cancer is the number one killer of children in the United States and is more deadly than Cystic Fibrosis, Muscular Dystrophy, Asthma, and AIDS combined.



Every child diagnosed with cancer comes from a different background; they all have unique personalities with distinct goals and aspirations for their lives. Moreover, each child has a different story. This is the story of one of those children.

I think this is good.
I would only change one thing, which I'll mention since you ask.
Try "Although life is far from perfect, you are still able..."
Suggesting that because in an otherwise smooth read, the use of 'Albeit' slows the reader as the only word there that just doesn't fit with the rest.



I would be happy to read the story of this child.
I think cancer is a subject that many people have dealt with (or may in the future) even 'simply watching' family/friends battle this disease in its many forms, as I have.



Good going.
One word of caution: As you wrote in your prologue here, 'life is far from perfect,' and so is most writing, even good writing.



Very little of anything I know about is 'perfect,' so suggest you try not to set that high a goal for yourself per: your lead-in asking for critiques.



Oops. Another word of caution: if you plan to try for publication (not vanity press but real publication) suggest you post no more online.



It is not unheard of for scouts, agents, publishers to take a look at what is online, and if they see a piece cross their desk they recall seeing online, free, for millions to read already... there will be no sale.



ADD: The terminology around oncology is rather mysterious to most of us, but the chemo I saw being given was by I.V.



It looked like a 'dose' to me; but I have no idea what it's name is. Chemo is usually given during a set time, though for some a return for more occurs. Ah, you prob'ly know what you need to know on that. If not, you know how to do research.



No caps after a dash is correct and a good call.



Disease names in caps, I'd say, depends on why/when/who and et cetera. Like I said, very little is perfect and one of the beauties of writing is that, barring grammar error, a writer (even with grammar error in some cases) does as thought best and as long as the story supports 'different' usage, differences can work.



Thinking now of Vonnegut's reporting on the bombing of Dresden, which he was indeed witness to and gives himself one line about in Slaughterhouse-Five ("Oz") which is not only factual but a sci-fi time-travel story as well.



2nd ADD: Your use of 'momentum' in the heart is fine as it is explained immediately. It's a word you're using to describe a 'feeling,' which is a sensation many people allocate to the heart.



And I think every child DOES come from a different background, as even those in the same family see the dynamics around them differently. If you want to clarify that, it's done easily enough by using a substitute for 'background,' but not really so necessary here.
This IS your first draft, after all.

Wow, thank you so much for the very well written advice. :)



Yes, the correct term is, "dose" because it sums up how much they give you.



And the reason I'm striving for a perfect book is because I know it won't be. Reach for the moon so that when you miss you'll still land on a star. :)

I like the contrasting lives and then the description.  It's an interesting introduction to a story.



There is some clunky sentence construction, grammar and word usage.  Some things that stood out for me:



A heart cannot have "momentum."  "Albeit" is a very formal word to use for a casual narrative (and doesn't need a comma).  Don't capitalize a word after a dash.



You don't get a "dose" of chemotherapy; it's either a dose of medicine or a round of chemotherapy.  Instead of "many, many" lives, give a number--hundreds, thousands.



Don't capitalize the names of diseases (except AIDS, but that's because it's an acronym).



It's a very broad brush to say that "every" child comes from a different background; I'm sure there are many with the same types of backgrounds.



As you can tell, I'm kind of a nitpicker.

Set in South Carolina in 1964, The Secret Life of Bees tells the story of Lily Owens, whose life has been shaped around the blurred memory of the afternoon her mother was killed. When Lily's fierce-hearted "stand-in mother," Rosaleen, insults three of the town's fiercest racists, Lily decides they should both escape to Tiburon, South Carolina - a town that holds the secret to her mother's past. There they are taken in by an eccentric trio of black beekeeping sisters who introduce Lily to a mesmerizing world of bees, honey, and the Black Madonna who presides over their household. This is a remarkable story about divine female power and the transforming power of love - a story that women will share and pass on to their daughters for years to come.

Mr Darcy's original proposal is the climax because it comes at the moment when Elizabeth's anger towards Mr.Darcy is at its fullest, highest emotion. The letter, I think goes towards Elizabeth's realization of her own feelings, her own pride, and how she feels about Darcy starts to come to light as her feelings start to change.

Hills Like White Elephants?



I have to come up with a thesis for "Hills Like White Elephants" by Ernest Hemingway. Does anyone have ideas? I can not come up with one.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I don't normally give out homework help, but  I am assuming that you read this, as it isn't very long, and not much happens in the story.



I read this story in college It was a long time ago, but I HATED this story, so I remember some of it.
Then I had to write the same essay.



All I remember is that Hemmingway and his girlfriend are standing around in a Spanish Train station waiting to get on a train somewhere so the girlfriend can go have an abortion, and it is hot, and nothing much happens.



The story was against everything I believed...and to be honest I don't remember anything happening in the story. All I remember was miserable people  just sitting in the miserable hot train station and everyone was miserable. They had spiritually dead lives, and they were selfish, atheist, spiritually dead and morally dead people, and I just really disliked them. I disliked the story, the setting, everything.



So that is what I wrote. I wrote that I hated it. My exact words were "What this story really needs is for an F-105 to pop up from behind those hills and drop a load of napalm on the train station, incinerating the carachters, the setting and everything, and perhaps then Mr. Hemmingway can write something that is worthy of his tallents and worth the readers time."



You don't normally take on Hemmingway, regarded by most teachers as the greatest American Author ever, but my teacher was open minded and honest and let me get away with it. Your teacher may or may not be as open minded.



(Personally I think Margaret Mitchell wrote "the great american novel", judged by it's sales figures and enduring popularity Gone with the Wind beats out the more "literary" books.)



So if you hated it, like I did,  just say you hated it. Make sure you can give good reasons for why you hated it though.



And be aware you are taking a bit of risk when you do that

Ok, so I'm writing a scene in which a innocent teenaged girl is wrongfully accused of murdering a child. Her village goes on a witch hunt for her and the main accuser tries to torture her into a confession. We don't get a graphic description of the torture, except when the girl tells us, that she pissed herself from the pain (is that really possible?)



We do get to see the accuser shave her head (her does so to humuliate her) and are told that he checks to be sure blood is the only thing left on her scalp.



Anyhow, just as they are about to hang her, she is rescued last minute by her childhood, friend who is on horseback.



The two escape the village and are riding across the desert.



While they are riding, she discovers that her childhood friend is a werewolf and starting to change.



</question>



<additional details>



EDIT: right now i have the protagonist riding in front of her friend on the horse and they're making very small talk with no mention of what happened in the village. Then, when they stop riding, the friend is telling the protagonist that he's going to have to leave her somewhere else because he is a werewolf and if they are still together at sunrise he'll hunt her

When writing one should write about what one knows.  Urinating from pain or laughter is not uncommon-check a medical book.



Gee????  hummm I don't know -  Small talk after just escaping from people who were torturing me and being covered in blood from that ?????NA...I wouldn't be making small talk, I would be barely breathing.



WEREWOLF at SUNRISE??? Never saw any of the Lon Cheney Movies did you...Werewolf's are suppose to transition at the rise of the full moon and by sunrise are again human.



Head shaving usually doesn't leave residuals of blood unless more than hair is being removed..It was use usually used to show that someone was a betrayer of the group and not just as a general method of humiliation.  Besides you have them in a DESERT..the village would have stoned her.



What time period is this you didn't indicate so I had to guess.

Emotional? I get nearly hysterical sometimes!



I lost it while reading "The Life Of Pi." I cried all the way through "The Art of Racing in the Rain" and STILL can't even talk about that book without tearing up. "Bel Canto" nearly put me off the edge.



I've read "The Weekend" by Peter Cameron a dozen times and cry everytime.



LOL



I too have thrown a book across the room. I'll get so worn out emotionally, I have to put it aside for a couple of days!

One time I was reading Noughts and Crosses (by Malorie Blackman) at the bus stop. At the end its really, really sad. I burst into tears. A lovely old lady came over and said, "are you alright, dear?" I replied, weeping, "no! Callum's dead!" And the old lady tried to comfort me, thinking I'd lost someone who wasn't fictional. Oh, the shame! lol.

Tell Me Books I Should Read?



Don't Like - Harry Potter,Lord of the Rings,Romance,Fantasy or Sci Fi



I Like - Black Comedy, Fiction, basically books someone with a sense of humor/personality similar to a male Daria or Jane (from daria) or Janeane Garofalo would like



I am a 23 year old Male so please something close to age appropriate and gender appropriate.



I have a dry and sarcastic sense of humor.I also want books on the more unconventional side, because I get bored with the same old thing all the time.I also want something that is a bit of an easy read because I have a short attention span but not too easy or I'd get bored with it.However I also want something that isn't too predictable because I don't like things I can see the ending a mile away.

You will totally love Christopher Moore. His twisted sense of humor is one of a kind. Start with Lamb: the Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal.



Also Carl Hiaasen. My favorite is Nature Girl.

Wild Fire by Nelson Demille



He's written quite a few books that use the same character. They are smart and quirky, entertaining, very laugh out loud. Spy type stuff but all have gripping storylines. Look up Wild Fire on amazon. His books are bestsellers. I've read all of them. I actually think they are mostly written for the male reader.

I loved "Ella Minnow Pea." Clever.



It's not fiction, but I'm wondering if you would like "Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer." It's about an Alabama football fan who followed the team around for a year in an old RV. It's hysterical. I'm not a huge football fan and not a fan of Alabama in particular, but this book is too much. I laughed til I was nearly sick. I'd recommend it for just about anyone. It's by Warren St. John, who writes for the NYT.



You might enjoy any of the mysteries by Tim Dorsey. He's a bit like Elmore Leonard, twisted, dark, hysterically funny. Great stories, all set in Florida, eccentric characters. Wonderful. Some of the titles are Triggerfish Twist, Orange Crush, Torpedo Juice. Check him out at http://www.timdorsey.com/home.html



If you haven't read Elmore Leonard, you might enjoy him. "Get Shorty" was one of his books made into a movie. Great characters, crazy story lines, fun to read.



Hope this helps!

It really depends on what you would consider grammar words. Age, grade and reading level would change which would be considered vocabulary words.



From chapter 2:
hypocritical
discretion
emphatic
acquaintance
nonsense
astonishment
tumult



Some other words you may consider:
imprudent
exigence
unintelligible
compassionate
consolatory
obstinacy
comparative
acquiescence
importune
impertinence
abominably
palliation
actuated
laudable
vindication
assiduously
condescension
obsequious
sufficiently



These are just some which may qualify. You can search through the story for others here: http://www.online-literature.com/austen/...



I hope this helps.



Note: These are merely from Pride and Prejudice. The site I gave you has all six of her major novels, and you can search for words and phrases in each.

<question>



Is writing a blog about a book a bad idea?



Is it true that a publisher will not work with a book that has been seen on the internet?



The reason I ask is because I am writing my first novel, and I had an idea that if people saw very (and I mean very) short sneak peeks of the book that got them interested, then they would be more likely to buy it and refer it to friends a relatives once it is on the shelf. But tonight I read something from a fellow Yahoo! Answers user that made me think otherwise.



I was planning on starting a blog, just a general blog to write in about my life and strange events of random days like plenty of teenagers do. But in the midst of that blog, I was planning on throwing in some entries about the novel I am writing, entries to introduce the two main characters and how I relate to their personalities and such, and giving my friends / blog readers updates on how the writing process is going. Maybe even throwing in a sentence or two to get people interested. If I did this, would my chances of being published in the future be altered at all?



Like I said before, I would think that a publisher would be happier to see that people are already interested in the book.

I wouldn't post anything online purely due to plagiarism concerns. Some of the people who like your idea, won't hesitate in stealing it. That being said I do like the idea of getting hype for the book through a blog.
One thing you could do would be to write it first, posting things like 'I worked on the novel today, will post some soon' to gain hype for the people who read your blog, but don't put any on until it's finished and you've shown it to a publisher or had it copyrighted. That way people know you're writing a novel and want to read it, but can't actually steal it. The other thing you could do would be to post small bits of it online like the title, character bios, or small one liners that show off your writing without giving anything away.
Good luck, I'd love to read the blog!

That's exactly what I had in mind! :) Just character biographies, and maybe just a single sentence, one that no one could really do anything with even if they stole it. Thanks!

I'm pretty sure people like Steinbeck and Hemingway were never taught anything but they took things from places they'd been and people they'd met, experiences they'd had to build their stories, some of them were half non-fiction. There are some things that just can't be taught, some people just have a talent and know how to use it.

Stephen King comes to mind.  Most writers do a lot of writing before stepping into a writing class.  From my experience, writing classes give a person the opportunity to write, and some exercises to facilitate those opportunities.



Terry Goodkind, also, is a product just sitting down and writing until something good came out.

Yes, but you have to have a sense of what's good and why. The way to get that is from reading both good and bad writing.



However, even if you don't take classes, it can really help to read some books and articles on the craft of writing. The ones put out by Writer's Digest are very good. Several authors have also written books with their insights into the writing process - it can be quite helpful to read different views on it.

Ah, I used to be in a Vampire-obsessed phase, it's more of a spy-obsessed phase for me now. When I was into vampires I read the Darren Shan series. It's a series about a boy (called Darren Shan) who is turned into a half-vampire. The first book is Cirque Du Freak. It's a really good series and I've really enjoyed them. Give them a try if your still stuck.

The Night Before Christmas?



I'm trying to find a version of The Night Before Christmas that my father used to read to me when I was little. I'm only twenty now so I don't think the book is too old. I would know it if I saw it but I can't find it anywhere. It had amazing illustrations, better than any Night Before Christmas book I've ever seen! I believe the cover was dark blue with an oval opening and a picture of Santa in his sleigh driving over a town. I know there was a little mouse on every page. If you know anything about the book I'm looking for or know how I could find it please let me know!

If you're mature enough to handle a book that deals with relationships and sex, check out "Tomcat in Love" by Tim O'Brien.



If you want a challenge, try reading "The Gulf War Did Not Take Place" by Jean Baudrillard. Its about how most of the war was done through radar and stuff, so it wasn't a real war. Its kind of like how a map is supposed to be the land, but the land always changes so the map isn't real. It tries to explain what is real and what is not.

I swear i reviewed the first one for you? I think i said ur ending style was brilliant. Well once again u proved me right. In part II i liked ur ending. But, in part III i thought u should've stopped with A time paradox and forgotten about the last paragraph. It would've been a very good ending.



The story was brilliant, i thought it was a good style u worked on. Good on you. Have a star.



Like you said the last two of the trilogy was a better piece of work to the first one (however i am not hating on your first part; it was actually very good) but I really liked the ending. I would rate this trilogy as an 8 or 9 out of ten. Actually a definite 9 because it was very well tied in. I really liked the storyline by the way and i liked the fact that Omina was rather ominous (the names was a play on words i expect).



It was very different. U didnt keep the writing extremely detailed nor did you write heaps of description and many would have to hate it for other people to love it but, like many others, u had the ability to keep the reader "reading" without effort. Does that make sense or am i confusing?

The premise and much of the wording is good. A 7.5 out of 10



I would suggest that the start is too abrupt as the character development is too slow, to foster reader interest and familiarity with the main character. It takes all of part one for this to develop. Having the story in 3 parts, waiting for a dial up download, doesn't serve to sustain interest. I found part 2 riveting as it involved me with the character. I became disinterested and lost, with the added characters in part 3 and likely missed the intended climax.



For a short story it is imperative to limit characters, so that you can adequately develop those that you have and those that are important to the plot development, while maintaining an interest in the flow of the story.

SARAH PALIN AND THE POLAR BEARS?



If you research Palin and the Polar Bears, you will find that she is opposed to them being added to the Endangered Species List due to ice melting because of Global Warming. She doesn't want them added because it will inhibit drilling.  SO - why is she constantly seen on the campaign trail wearing a Polar Bear pin on her jackets? What is she trying to say? I don't want them protected but I like them?

I'm thinking it's because the polar bears aren't endangered and to stop hunting them would allow their population to grow out of control causing even more man & polar bear clashes. They are coming into towns and villages and destroying property as it is, this is with their populations in check.

The person who focused on hunting has missed the point: the bears aren't clashing with humans because they aren't hunted enough; they are clashing with humans because they are spending time along shorelines, hunting for scarce food (and therefore attracted to garbage dumps and food stores) instead of out on the ice hunting seals.



I think the polar bear will continue be used as a symbol of Alaskans' northern attachments even if the bears are extinct, and I think Sarah Palin wears the pin because it's an Alaskan symbol.

I'm probably gonna tick off a lot of religious people, but in my novel...?



Lucifer is one of my main characters. I did research and I found out that Lucifer was just something the church made up (in fact, they even based him on the lost king of babylon) In that respect, I think he would be a cool character to use in my story. I feel like he would be REALLY crabby and fun to...well, make fun of.

Definitely one I would read.  The church made up lots of things so people would convert.  They hated women and classed them as witches when they used to help the sick with tried and tested remedies yet worship the 'Holy Mother'! Hypocrites or what!

yeah, cool.
not the worst thing someone's ever done in a novel.
Lucifer is an age old character.
everyone knows who lucifer is, it's better than creating a random demonic figure. i suppose.
anyway, have you seen the movie "little Nicky"? that has Lucifer in it, and, many other demonic characters.

I would say re-read the harry potter books there is probably a lot of detail that you have missed in them. They are fantastic books.
However i do have to say do not read Phillip Pullman he is not a good author.

I would definitely recommend Jonathan Stroud's Bartimeaus triology. The first book is the Amulet of Samarkand. It's all about a young boy who is apprenticed to a magician and decides that he hates his master and wants to prove he is really good so summons a djinn to steal a powerful artefact from a very powerful magician. As one might expect things don't seem to go his way and there are various plots to overthrow the magicians of a world not dissimilar to Victorian London by non-magicians etc etc. Its a little darker than Harry Potter but I couldn't put them down.

Irish writer Eoin Colfer books are just too good for kids. (His first name is pronounced "Owen").  His books are BETTER than Harry Potter.



If you love Harry Potter (and I do), then you'll love the Artemis Fowl series.  The audio book version is read by the same actor, Nathaniel Parker, who plays Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley on PBS.  Here they are in published order:



Artemis Fowl (2001)



Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident (2002)



Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code (2003)



Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception (2005)



Artemis Fowl: The Lost Colony (2006)



Artemis Fowl: The Time Paradox (2008)



Artemis Fowl is a billionaire teenage criminal mastermind who discovers the hidden fairy world.  I love the kid and his body guard, Butler.  I also read Colfer's Half Moon Investigations and loved it too.



You might also like the classic series by C.S. Lewis called the Chronicles of Narnia.  I don't recommend that you read them in published order but in order of action:



The Magician's Nephew



The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe



The Horse and His Boy



Prince Caspian



The Voyage of the Dawn Treader

John Irving (..according to garp, son of the circus, hotel new hampshire)



Tom Robbins (even cowgirls get the blues, another roadside attraction)



Kurt Vonnegut (cats cradle, timequake, ....)



Considering your stated tastes, You will like Charlene Harris (HBO series Trueblood is based on her books)



You should really check out Vonnegut too.



Real people story worth reading "angelas ashes" and "tis" by Frank McCourt



James Clavelles "shogun" series is awesome historical fiction and its long enough to read for a month or two!

Like what? Please list these striking similarities of yours, as I fail to see that they exist.



As for the answer above - Animal farm? That was about Communism - from what I can see Communism has completely failed, and even Chinas regime only maintains a very thin attachment to proper Communist ideals, and is moving more and more towards capitalism.

Size 12 is not Fat - MEG CABOT [no, it's not about Anorexia. It's actually a detective story, it's pretty good, one of her best, I'd say]



Hope I helped.

In  chapter 14, Alan Campbell gets rid of the body for Dorian and this is part of what is said: "a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps." You could have a steel coil and/or a piece of wire and/or a picture of a mahogany chest and/or a clamp to represent this deed.



You could have an easel or at least a paint brush to represent the portrait, itself.



You could have a picture of opium or an opium den to represent what happened to Dorian, a cigarette to represent the rather indolent Henry (or a cane), a picture of the statue of Adonis to represent Dorian and his beauty. You could also have a French novel to represent the book which influences Dorian in such a bad way (Wikipedia suggests it might have been something like Joris-Karl Huysmans's À rebours).



I'm sure there is much more, but I hope this helps a bit.

If you want a good "modern" classic, try "All the King's Men" by Robert Penn Warren. It won the Pulitzer prize. It's about a politician (Willie Stark) and his right hand man (Jack Burden) and how they run his campaign to run for Governor. It's full of lies, corruption and deceit.



The characters are fatally flawed, but still possess redeeming qualities.



I read it for the first time as a senior in high school and I have read it every year since then.



::EDIT:: I'd highly recommend "Crime and Punishment" by Dovstyesky. (sp) That's a good read as well. It is about a man who commits a crime and how he deals with his conscience afterward. Of course it has layers of symbolism, so that's fun to look out for too.

Les Miserable by Victor Hugo-
It's basically 3 stories that are connected. It's pretty much about love and redemption. It's a really good story, but rather long.
A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith
It's a coming of age story about a poor girl in Brooklyn.  Easy to read but still one of my favorites.
Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan
It's about 4 women and their lives and the lessons they learned.



Oh, and I really enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, both by Jane Austen and both good old fashioned love stories.

I read a book for my english class during the spring semester of '08 called "On Writing Well" by William Zinsser.  I had purchased the 30th Anniversary edition, and while the book is on writing non-fiction, there are many excellent rules of thumb to use for fiction as well.  You might also want to check out his other books over at Amazon.com...

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



If you're not being too picky about where the stories could be posted, there's always places like fictionpress.net, elfwood.com or deviantart. Since anything that is made publicly available (say, posted on a net-site that anyone can view) is counted as publishing (not professionally speaking, but from a legal standpoint), using a like that could work for this purpose.



All three are free, you just create an account and post your story according to their guidelines.



If however, you are looking for more professional sort of publishing, the only route I can think of would be to submit the stories webzines. This process however can take months and chances of being accepted are quite small.



Hope that helps

Voldemort is the heir of Slytherin. Everyone THOUGHT it was Harry, and Voldemort was just using Ginny through the diary to reopen the chamber. The heir had to speak Parseltongue to open the chamber.

It was neither. Voldemort was the Heir of Slytherin all along. That's who Tom Riddle was. His mother was a Gaunt who were descendants of Salazar Slytherin. Ginny was possessed by Riddle when he is still in the diary, and so through her he opens the chamber. However Ginny is never the actual Heir of Slytherin. Harry can open the chamber because he is a parselmouth, meaning he can speak the language of snakes, like Voldemort and Salazar Slytherin, but he is not the heir. The line of Slytherin ended with Voldemort.

The heir of slytherin was voldemort because although Harry could open the chamber as well, he would not "purge the school of those unworthy to study magic" as would Voldemort so he doesn't qualify.

What is the theme of "the black cat" by edgar allan poe?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Horror, I guess. What happens is he murders his wife because she tried to stop him from administering his idea of justice to his black cat. He builds a wall and hides her body behind it. The police come by to investigate, but find nothing. And the end of the visit, they declare him innocent. He agrees, saying nothing is hidden. To emphasize his point, he taps the wall behind which his wife's body is hidden. It collapses and his wife's grossly disfigured body rises up with the black cat on her head.

How can i start my story? ?



Ok, I have come up with the first half of my plot and I have all the characters. However, I don't know how to start my story. So here's the plot. The main character breaks up with her boyfriends which is very simple. However, about a week later she gets a call from a hospital - her ex boyfriend was in a motorcycle accident. Later, when he wakes up he does not remember the break up (he had amnesia) and they start to fall in love again, making the same mistakes as they did the first time as well as different ones. I can't find a way to start my story, or to finish it! Can you help? How should I start - and what would you find an effective finish?

Just start writing.  Start anywhere, just get the story down on paper.  Lots of times you don't know where the story should start until you get to the end.  By the end, you will have an idea of theme and by having the end down, you can now plan for it at the beginning.  You can work for months on that first chapter, only to find the story should start at chapter 3.

Maybe start with how bad their relationship was.  This way it's not only the break-up he forgets, but also that they were not very happy/fought a lot.



For the end: what about a twist! (the plot needs one)  Maybe she finds out he didn't have amnesia all along!  He just pretended because he didn't want to lose her.  That would cause for some good conflict and make for a good climax.  And then, of course, the inevitable and-they-lived-happily-ever-after kiss...

Help i need a title for my book.?



here is the story so far.



Chapter 1



Normal, what is normal. Living happy ever after. Yeah right there is no such thing as happy ever after only the real world. And the real world sucks. In the real world there is no where you can hide. You have to stick it out , no matter how bad it is. But to tell you to tell you the truth there is people who have it worse then us. But when your going through something extremely bad , you think that there is no one in the world who understands your pain. But there is always someone who will understand you ,to tell you the truth they are probably going through the same thing as you. When your going trough a bad patch there is always someone to talk to, don’t think of the worse way out. And don’t be afraid that you think you are being a snitch , because you are only doing what is  best for you.



I have tried everything , but nothing works , I just want o get away from this torture. But there is no way out I have tried everything, tried telling , tried taking my life did any of those things work? NO! It just made it worse ….there is nobody in the world that can feel what I am going through. First I though home was the answer , but home was just as worse. There is no point in living ..what is the point of living if your unhappy and your life is in shambles. Why does everything happen to me ….well I know the answer ..because I am bad luck …I am the reason that my parent fight. I am the reason for everything. Why did god even make me … I am just  bad luck to everyone. I have no money. .no friends …no where to turn…no one there to catch me if I fall. People always tell me that life is full of choices… Life is always hard. Well you got that right. Life is always hard, miserable, gloomy and dark.  Life is full of horrible surprises for me. Never nice surprises. My mum says its because I am  an EVIL GIRL. And bad things happen to evil girls. But what I don’t understand  is that she does evil things , but I get punished for it. But why wont mum understand that life is full of consequences and that if she makes a mistake she should not punish me. Its not fair.

Thanks to the popularity of the HP books, a lot aspiring authors are writing fantasy books (including me). Getting a debut novel published can be very hard especially when the already established fantasy authors (ie. David Clement-Davies, Cornelia Funke, Christopher Paolini, JK Rowling etc...) already appeal to so many people.



Firstly,  you have to know WHAT kind of fantasy book you are writing. The fantasy genre has been divided into a number of categories such as:



Urban Fantasy - which are stories taking place on THIS world, rather than an imaginary land. Examples include The Phoenix and the Carpet by E Nesbit



Epic fantasy - envolves a completely new fantasy setting with different "races" and a completely different culture. Epic fantasies also involve a battle between good and evil or a heroic quest. Examples include The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien, Harry Potter by JK Rowling and Eragon by Christopher Paolini.



Historical fantasy - stories that are set in the past with some elements of fantasy such as Chronicles of Ancient Darkness by Michelle Paver.



Mythological fantasy - Stories directly inspired by myth, folklore, and fairy tales such The Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis.



Humorous or "children's" fantasy - light hearted fantasy stories mainly for young children such as The Magic Faraway Tree and The Wishing Chair both by Enid Blyton.



Science fiction - when elements of science extend to fantasy such as The Host by Stephenie Meyer and books by Ray Bradbury.



Horror fantasy - when fantasy books have themes of horror and are mainly written for adults such as Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles



Romance fantasy - when fantasy books have a romance theme in them such as the Twiligth series by Stephenie Meyer and Elizabeth Kerner's Song in the Silence.



Out of all these, I guess epic fantasy is really tough to write. You have to invent your own imaginary land and your own mythology. I salute the authors JRR Tolkien and JK Rowling for coming up with books of such details.



When you have finished your novel, get a copy of Writers Market or How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy by Orson Scott Card. And then get yourself an agent first.



Beleive in yourself and you will be successful.



Best of luck.

Hi!! I see that you like Twilight - so it's best not to write about vampires or werewolves, as it may be hard to not think of Stephenie Meyer's ideas, and the use them (not on purpose). How about... dragons? I know its kind of babyish, however you could make it better and aimed at teens, like Eragon. Or, something involving magic.



Here are 3 ideas of my own!



1) A girl/boy moves into a new house, and there are thousands of paintings on the wall, every time the character seems not to be looking they change. This is because the paintings aren't simply paintings, they are the story of someones life. The main character get sucked into these paintings... and in this alternative world, there are dragons, fairies, vampire and more. Maybe, she is the only human left in existence there?



2) A girl/boy have a mirror, which pulls them into a paralell world. Like the above idea, but a mirror instead.



3) Last but not least... your main character works at a company that is very well known and powerful. One day he/she is working late, and hears a heated conversation in another room. She hears the (wo)man angrily shout "fine! I'll do this myself! It'll be at the printer!" The character, curious, goes to the printers, and finds a sheet of paper with a black hole on. She can put her hand in it, and it gets through stuff. Maybe, she puts her hands in and something comes out... something mystical.



These are more a mix of sci-fi and fantasy, i guess. But, i hope i could help. enjoy your writing and good luck!!

<question>



Are there any specific characteristics that are necessary in literature/plays for it to be considered tragedy?



For example, if a family member of the protagonist dies near the beginning of the play/narrative due to natural causes and the plot mostly focuses on the protagonist and the supporting characters reactions, suffering and grief in reaction to the death - and the narrative ends at an indecisive point with no direct resolution (but does have a climax/catharsis) - could it still be considered tragedy? Or modernist/post-modernist tragedy?



Or would it be a completely different genre altogether?

Well, it sure doesn't sound like farce.  If there is a catharsis, and the catharsis isn't comedic, then it most likely is tragic (how many categories are there?  It's not an action/ adventure story, not a horror story, not a children's story, not a love story...  Are you sure it's actually a story??  Because if you aren't sure it's a tragedy, then it is entirely possible that all you have is a "stream of events"-- which would be very post modern, but not tragic...  And it would not have a catharsis).  Check out Wikipedia on this matter.

For something to be a tragedy, a protagonist has to have been of a high status, and they fall....fall...fall...Beowulf was a tragedy/catharsis because he was of a high status but was killed. Romeo and Juliet was a tragedy because both characters were of a high status but died. I would say that Doomed Queen Anne was a tragedy because she was a queen but beheaded.

Brooke Village would sound ironic if it was the name of a school in an industrial zone.



Ellington sounds like it was named after an inbred blue blood who gave money to found a private school because of his pedaphillic tendencies.



Rock Harbor sounds like a good name for a porn star, so if it is a boys school the name could be part of a sexual fantasy of a sexually frustrated boy.



Riverside is an utterly crap name.



Kent's sounds like it was sponsored by a tobaco company

Riverside is nice, I like it because it sounds like a boarding school people would want to go to, and I like Brooke Village - it sounds posh. Do you live in Kent? Because I noticed you have Riverside (a place in kent), and Kent's. I used to live in kent!

Enigmatic (Flight 45 or passenger 12) or even gate 16 (gate 16 is the only gate in the airport that passengers still use to board the plane through the old security system, so the terrorists can only board the plane if they board through gate 16).



Melodramatic...flight of the damn, flight of fools, Terror at 10,000 feet. Flight into terror, Destination....terror.



hmmm....I like that one....Destination...Terror!



Simple...the last flight, danger flight, terror aboard etc.



Make it positive and heroic. Last chance for heroes, a heroes calling, the night we stood tall etc



How about make it more personal. Ted's terror

<question>



Is this a good idea for a story? (for NaNoWriMo)?



One day a boy named Thomas obtains a magical watch that takes him back in time. Awesome.  But then, uh oh, he accidently breaks it, which causes the watch to malfunction. Time starts repeating itself every twenty-four hours. And now, he has to go through the same day doing the same things forevah. Worser yet, it's on a school day. Crap. Because the day will be forgotten anyway, Thomas starts doing different things to test peoples' reactions and stuff. He learns a lot about his friends, enemies and people in general from doing this.



After doing so many things day after day, Thomas becomes bored and, therefore, more risky in his feats, and he loses his mind a bit. He starts doing incredibly crazy things, and gets very carried away with it. Ever wondered what would happen if, say, you pulled down a teacher's trousers? Or even did it to yourself? What if you murdered someone in front of everyone? What would the reaction be?



Unfortunately for Thomas, the watch somehow fixes itself... at the completely wrong time... Thomas must now face the consequences of his horrific actions, which have caused a massive uproar of disgust.

With this premise, you might consider keeping it light so Thomas can be likable.  Meaning, he could pull pranks but he shouldn't murder anyone or do any intentional harm.  But hey, anything goes for NaNoWriMo, right?

Sounds interesting. Why does it need to be descriptive? I think as long as it gives the reader some idea of what it is about or stands out then it's good.



Worlds combined?



If I were you I'd write down key words that are to do with the story and see what you come up with
