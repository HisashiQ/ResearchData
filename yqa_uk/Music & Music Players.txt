IPod classic movies?



Why when I add a standard 2.35:1 movie to my iPod, It crops it cutting off the ends so I only see the middle and miss a lot of the picture. Is there any way that I could put the movies on uncropped, unzoomed so I can see the full picure, even if that means there will be black bars at the top and bottom?

Ipod touch clicking sound question



I recently bought an Ipod Touch. When playing certain tracks I hear a clicking sound through the right earplug. It seems however that this sound is only on songs that I have downloaded through Limewire. Is this some sort security measure to deter file sharing??

No it is not. It is a feature on your ipod. To disable this feature go to Settings, , General, Sound Effects, and then touch Off and you should not be able to hear the clicking noises again :)

this is NOT a feature of the ipod this is due to errors in the MP3 file causing clicks. I never have a issue like this with purchased songs  but sometimes with ones I import from CD.

Downloading via Limewire in addition to being illegal can also have those MP3 files with hidden viruses and trojans.

NEVER ever use anything form a file sharing site without checking for viruses and trojans.  MP3 files and images CAN and DO contain Trojans and viruses.

If you bought itunes plus songs , you could use them with other programs to upload on her mp3 player. They aren't protected. Or you could use Amazon for your mp3's they play on any player including ipods.

No, iTunes is designed specifically for iPods. But, if she gets a different mp3 player, you can take the music from iTunes and put it on there. Just not as easily as an iPod.

music files from itunes are drm-laden. in order to play them on mp3 players other than ipod and iphone, you need a special program to help strip off the protection and convert the itunes m4p, m4b, m4a music to mp3. i always use tuneclone. my friend introduced it to me. it automatically generates a virtual cd burner, with which the music files can be converted at very high speed.



you can learn more about it from:

If it's a new Starcaster, you will be paying twice what's it worth. They are going for $199 in the States.  If it's an older or vintage Starcaster, you are getting a heck of a deal.  The older Starcasters are hollow-bodied electrics and don't look anything like a Stratocaster.  The new one's look exactly like a Strat and are pretty good guitars for the money.  Just don't overpay.

Don't worry about it, the program has changed itself slightly and so has to be re accepted by your firewall.
As for Bonjour, its software made by Apple to be a part of iTunes to keep it running smoothly.

If you need replacement earbuds look into skull candy. 
These seem to be pretty good based on the opinions of those that I know that purchased them. I bought some for my daughter and she really likes them. When my zune earbuds stop working - I am going to replace them with the skull candy ones.

# 3 Open the folder.
# 4 Go to Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View (the tab) &gt; scroll to Show Hidden Files and Folders and click it.
# 5 Click OK
# 6 Go back to your iPod folder/drive, there you will find a new folder called iPod_Control

# 8 The Music folder in it will have a bunch of folders named F00, F01 and so on. THEY HAVE YOUR MP3s. Look through the folders to find your stuff.
#9 drag back into itunes or left click,open with itunes.whichever.dragging it may not always work so copy the file and paste it.or import it.

itune blocks this function since itune is the tool with one way to transfer files from itune to ipod. you must utilize other tools to achieve that. There're couple of tools for transferring the files between ipod and computer (for backup)depends on your demands, e.g transfer only songs/videos, transfer photos etc. You can have a look of below review site, hope it useful.

Help installing 3rd gen iPod Nano?



Ive been trying for a couple of days to install my dads new iPod. I've installed 2 iPods previously and have had no trouble. Whenever I plug this one in it comes up with a Windows Wizard. That didnt come up before when I installed the other two ones. Ive been looking on other websites including Apple and none of other peoples suggestions have worked. Has anyone else had this problem? How did you overcome it?

you might have clicked sync with this computer only, on your itunes on your old one, you will have to reset and restore your ipod, unless you can get your old computer back and untick the box, if you want to reset and restore it, click and hold the lock and home button at the same time untill your ipod turns off, then hold the home button while you plug your ipod into your computer and then you will b able to restore it on itunes, hope this helps

Your question is as clear as Mud.
I am confused are you talking about the iPod touch or the Ninendo Itouch software and another MP4 or DS unit.

this case  is designed for the ipod Touch and so should fit it!

the ipod Touch is:-
Height: 110 mm (4.3 inches)
Width: 61.8 mm (2.4 inches)
Depth: 8 mm (0.31 inch)
Weight: 120 grams (4.2 ounces)

also all ipod touch are MP4 if you are NOT talking about the ipod Touch then this Case will NOT fit it!

as the sizes do NOT match up it seems that you do NOT have an iPhone Touch but a different player so I suggest you look for the case designed for the player you do have!

Free music:

First, go to http://zamzar.com/tools . Right click on the “convert” button and save it to your favorites. Now, find a music video of the song you want on Youtube, or almost any video site. Click on the Zamzar link in your favorites. Choose “mp3” and enter your email. In about one hour the song will arrive in your email. Good luck!

You might try doing a site search at http://www.tucows.com or http://www.download.com. Both have free and shareware programs which might help you. I seem to remember seeing a free converter at one or the other, but I do not have an ipod, so I had no need

don't buy an iPod... I'd rather you buy an mp3, most have more features than an iPod..
I'd recommend taking a look at these:
http://pages.samsung.com/us/mp3/?vid=tru...

and learn a lot more here:
http://anythingbutipod.com/

they all have different prices, but most are around the iPod price or lower, and are better than iPods

How does Ipod touch internet work?



Okay, so I just bought an Ipod touch 16 gb, it will be here in a day or two. Now I might sound kind of stupid, but I'm not very technilogically inclined so please forgive me. How does the whole internet thing work? Do you have to buy a membership or something? What if you don't have wireless internet? I have a macbook with DSL, but it's hooked up to a router. Or can you just use anyone's internet. I will be leaving for college in a month where you can use their wireless internet for free just by typing in the password but I am very clueless about wireless internet so any light anyone could shed on this issue would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!

The iPod Touch uses WiFi to connect to the internet.  You have to be within range of a wireless connection to be able to access the internet.

I'm still not 100% sure what wifi is....say I'm in a city or a starbucks or something, will I need some sort of password to use the internet?

When you get the iPod, on the home screen, there will be a "Settings" button.  Hit that and the first line will say "Wi-Fi."  Choose that category, it will open to another screen.  The iPod will then automatically search for a network.



B-razzle



If there is a connection in range, it will show up on the list.  If the connection requires a password (such as at a hotel or a private network), there will be a little lock symbol.  This connection will require a password.



B-razzle



However, if it is a public network, it will show up, along with the signal strength.  Just choose the one with the best connection. A college will probably have free public WiFi. Hope this helps...

IPod Touch - Very large "other" capacity!!! HEEEELP!



I just purchused an iPod touch just recently ... and already I have come across a very annoying problem. The other day when I synced my iPod, i noticed that the "other" category on the category bar was VERY large ... like 2.68GB! It's taking up a lot of the memory and I cant put any music on.



I would like to know how to fix this without having to update the iPod software (cos my internet is too slow). I am currently on 2.0

Any help would be greatly appreciated ;)

What is wrong with my iPod Battery?



I have a 6GB iPod (classic?), it's probably 4 or 5 years old. The battery will say it is charged after 10 or 15 minutes of charging. Then when I use it, it'll last for an hour or two, then "die." But, if I turn it back on after a moment, it'll work again for a while longer. What do you think is wrong with it? Is it worth spending $60 or $70 to fix it? Or should I get a new one?

What's wrong with it is that it's old. IPod batteries lose their ability to hold a charge two to four years after you get them (it differs by how you use and charge the iPod). If you think it's worth spending the money to get it replaced, then go for it. If your iPod still works (other than the battery) and you don't need more space than you've got, you might just want to get it fixed. But if you like the new iPods, then get one of those. It's really what you think is worth it.

Yes you can. First, go to http://zamzar.com/tools . Right click on the “convert” button and save it to your favorites. Now, find a music video of the song you want on Youtube, or almost any video site. Click on the Zamzar link in your favorites. Choose “mp3” and enter your email. In about one hour the song will arrive in your email. Good luck!

I've got a first gen Ipod touch and am loving it.  I had originally thought about buying one and talked myself into getting a nano.  Subsequently, I won my current ipod touch in a contest.

You should ask yourself a lot of questions when deciding:

1. What is my access to wi-fi?
If you've got a wi-fi router at home or an account with a major wi-fi hotpoint provider, then I highly, highly recommend getting a touch.  It depends on what city you live in, too, as some cities have a lot of free access points.
It's worth noting that the browser is a full fledged one, so it's very similar to browsing at home.  There are currently no plug-ins, though, so aside from youtube, you can't watch any online videos or visit flash websites.
And the mail application for accessing yahoo mail is great.

If your wi-fi is restricted, then the touch essentially becomes a nano with a bigger screen and better games. I had very limited wi-fi access when I first got my touch, though, and still loved it.



2. Do I watch lots of videos? Show off lots of photos?
The nano is a great device but if you plan on watching videos/photos regularly, the touch is a significant improvement.  Keep in mind that the touch does have limited space, so its ability to hold a lot of full length movies is limited, when compared to something like the ipod classic.

3. Do I like playing games?
Again, the touch is a clear winner in this respect. Some amazing graphics and the number of titles is growing at a tremendous rate.

4. Do I mind carrying a larger device around?
For some, smaller is a must.  As a reference, though, I carry mine around in my pants pocket and often forget that it's there. Depends on the size of your pants, I guess.

5. Am I planning on getting a phone in the near future? 
It might be worth getting the ipohne instead, as then you don't need to carry an mp3 and a phone around.

6. Can I learn a new input method?
There have been complaints about the lack of a tactile keyboard.  Personally, the ipod touch screen keyboard works really well.



As for official reviews, I like cnet and they give it a great rating.



All in all, if you can afford it, I highly recommend it.

Most other phones use a cheap Qualcomm chip set.

Bad part -
You have to deal with iTunes.
No bluetooth or a crippled bluetooth on the iphone.
The headphones that come with Ipod SUCK SUCK SUCK.
I have a separate top of the line Sony headphones.
Playing games on the Ipod sucks.

(Yes it is doable)
One warning though;
It takes forever, the setup for songs vs album sides is less than optimum, and the final results..let's just say iTunes still gets business from me.
Your connectivity will depend on your amp.
I use a powerwave unit, iMic is another option.

well if you really want the artwork you can search the album online and paste it into the slot where it says no album artwork, but that rlly stinks if your not gonna have artwork you might as well use limewire, but good luck if nothing else just paste the artwork in

That happens to me too. I believe that sometimes the album does not exist on iTunes' database or it's because your album name or details (genre, etc) does not match the one on the database. I tried changing the name of SOME albums to the exact way it's written on iTunes and found it to be successful. Example: Cafe Del Mar Volume 5 might be written Café del Mar, Vol.5 etc.

You can do it manually if the auto thing doesn't work.

Highlight an album on iTunes, and Google the image cover on Google Images. Right click on the highlighted songs on itunes and select 'get info'. Drag the picture from Google onto the 'Album Artwork' frame on the 'Get info' window.

Hope this helps.

i-pod touch. you don't need the classic unless you have LOADS and LOADS of videos and music. the touch is modern, probably not the cheapest and has all the features of the iphone except the mobile stuff. and great screen for viewing videos.

If you go to Target they have a whole bunch of keyboards that you can try out.  I would suggest trying them out and seeing what features they have because you can hold out notes and they have funky sound effects.  I'm not sure if you can find one exactly like the one used in that song but they definitely do have ones that sound similar.

ITunes gift card stopped working?



I downloaded two songs from my gift card on iTunes, so I had $13.02 left on it. I tried downloading "MakeDamnSure" by Taking Back Sunday, and it went through the usual motions of making sure I really wanted to buy the song. I clicked "buy," and it started connecting to the iTunes store, but all of a sudden, a little pop-up box came up saying that my payment method was invalid, and I would need to find another way. So I tried starting over by hitting "redeem" on the home screen and re-typing my redemption code, but it says "The code you entered is not recognized as a valid code."

Does anyone know how I can fix this?

iPod accepts only MP4 videos, you need a third party software to convert your videos to MP4 videos.
you can try iSkysoft iPod Movie Converter,it's easy to operate and support free upgrade.
here is a step by step guide for you:
http://www.iskysoft.com/user-guide/ipod-...



then,put the vides on your ipod thru iTunes.
ps:i don't suggest you to synchronize ur new videos as all of your preexist iPod videos will be covered. just drag and drop the videos you want to add from ur iTunes to ur iPod video menu.
good luck!

the black thing in the back is carbon fiber which hides the wifi
in other words a receiver tht will look up for internet connection from routers or anything tht give off signal for example if you go to a starbuck you could go on youtube.com myspace.com on your itouch
because its receiving the internet signal from ur black thingy lol kk

It really depends what you want in your iPod, and how much you want to spend.



The iPod shuffle is good for people who don't have that much music and just need one for occasional use. It comes in 1GB and 2GB. On the downside, it doesn't have a screen and you can't use playlists.



The iPod nano is one of the coolest iPods in the current lineup. Aside from the fantastic colours, it comes in 8GB and 16GB, plays video, has a 2" screen (which is pretty good), and has an accelerometer which means you can turn it on its side and it will show Cover Flow, or shake it and it will shuffle your music.
It might sound like I'm being a bit biast, but this is a great little player.



Next is the largest capacity iPod, the classic. It comes in one spec, but it's a big one at 120GB. It also has a 2.5" screen (which looks great), really long battery life, plays video, and comes in sliver or black.



Finally, there's the iPod touch. It has a massive 3.5" screen (which looks fantastic) which is also your interface with the iPod. It can connect to the Net, download songs straight from iTunes, play 3D games, and plays video. It comes in 8GB, 16GB, or 323GB.



I would choose the iPod Touch, mainly because of its wireless Net capabilities and its massive screen. But really the reason there are so many iPods is that people have different needs, and so yours won't be the same as mine.
To sum it all up, the shuffle's for people with not much music, the nano's an all-rounder, the classic's for someone with lots of music, and the touch is for people that want a smartphone, but no phone.



Hope that helps!

When you "erase ALL content" you really do erase ALL content. Games aren't downloadable off of Zune Marketplace just yet.



You should delete the latest update, and update to the latest version again. It might bring back all the new stuff, including the games.



Call Microsoft at 1-800-GET-ZUNE

Can I move MP3 files from my iPod Nano to my Rhapsody library?



I have a first-gen iPod Nano that has un-died. I went out and bought a Sony Walkman MP3 when I thought that the iPod was done, but the iPod suddenly started working again a little while ago. The iPod has a bunch of MP3 files I'd like to put on the Walkman (I never did like the iPod very much, and I've already promised it to someone else if I could get it to work again).  The only other place I have those songs is on my dead laptop.



Rhapsody recognizes both players and lets me see what songs are on each of them. But when I try to drag a file from the iPod's library to the Walkman's, Rhapsody gives me a big fat "no" circle and slash. When I drag a file from the iPod's library to Rhapsody's, it acts like it's transferring the file but doesn't add it to the library.



Is there a different way I should be trying to do this, or does it just not work that way?

Unless you have purchased your old ipod from an apple store within 30 days than no you can not return it, nor can you trade it for a new one.



Your best choices are to just upgrade the software on your old one (for 9.95) and stick with your old, or try to sell your old one on ebay or craigslist and then buy the new version if you really want it.

if you want the newer version, you can probably trade it in, but then you'll have to pay the price difference if there is one.

Does vinyl still sound better than CD do you reckon?



Playing some old records earlier, most of which I now have on CD... there's nothing better than that crackling sound coming from an old record and that much richer sound! That you don't seem to get on CDs....



I played a song on my (iron maiden) CD, a remastered one I bought recently... and then played it back to back with the same track on vinyl, and the vinyl sounded much better and clearer. This 27 or so year old vinyl!



What do others think?? Surely I can't be the only one who thinks this?



I'm 17 by the way... i didn't grow up with records, but have actually switched TO them!
Not only that, but it's cheaper too :P heh.

see if you can get your hands on a 12' record which is usually an extended mix of a single....it truly is as good as it gets, the bass end is fantabulous.  you're are right about the comparison to CD's and i am old enough to compare....the art work involved with albums is another story as it's from another world, truly superb.

As a 55 y o crusty, I did grow up with vinyl and have to agree that nothing sounds better than an LP, I think that CDs are wonderful just too clinically good. Also it is so much better to have hold of an LP cover and read the sleeve notes, you really had something substantial in your hands. The crackling brings out a certain warmth on LPs that a CD will never have.

i so agree with you on this......the sound is much richer almost like you could hold it in the palm of your hand and definitely feel it in your insides.....i remember when cds first came out and everyone was like "these are indestructible" yeah, right....i cant tell you how many cds i have gone through that i have bought duplications of because of minor scratches.....i say yay bring back the old 45s and 33s....i still have a few classic vinyls and my dad has scads of them.....i love listening to them on his old pioneer speakers (talk about your dinosaurs!)

vinyl has a richness all of it's own. cd's cannot convey the feeling of the music it is too sterile and clean. i love the crackles and the jumping when a bit of fluff gets on the needle.
