NEVER pick wild mushrooms!  It takes an expert to tell if they are toxic and you can die if you eat the wrong ones.

Search google for mushroom growing kits.  The spores are legal to possess and sell but the actual mushrooms are illegal so be careful.  I've never done shrooms myself, but I would recommend trying weed first (if you haven't) because event that can be strong and I have a friend who once did shrooms and said it was so powerful he'd never try it again so be careful.

If you have a crawl space and don't mind the odor of cow dung sifting through the floor boards.... Go to Hawaii, find a cow field anywhere after a good rain  early in the morning, there is only one kind and use the spores to seed a  fresh layer of store bought manure once you get them home. Keep it moist and warm with a plastic sheet until they germinate. Then pop a Sam Kinison DVD in your TV. Wear a hernia belt whenever possible.

Genetic modification, as far as we know, does not reduce the vitamin/mineral content. Some GM crops, like golden rice, are even engineered to produce more of certain vitamins (in golden rice it's vitamin A).

However, because most GM crops currently are manufactured to withstand pesticide usage, they are often sprayed with more chemicals and this has been shown to reduce vitamin/mineral content. For example, crops grown without pesticides can contain up to 60% more antioxidants. The reason for this is that when a plant has to defend itself agains predation and competition, it makes more antioxidants.

Yes, the North Yorkshire Moors were covered in trees, This is supported by lots of evidence from pollen samples recovered from ancient core samples.

The trees were cut down during the Neolithic, and onwards both to provide fuel and to produce open grazing for neolithic herdmen's sheep. The sheep grazing prevented regeneration of the forest, and this couples with slight cooling over the last 10,000 years has left us with the bracken covered moors we how see.

The flat valley (Vale of Pickering) between Staxton Wold and the Moors was a huge lake in early postglacial times and this was occupied in mesolithic times http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Carr by a culture that used the site for fishing and hunting in the summer months

I doubt that it happens very often, as the caterpillar crawls around the tree looking for leaves to eat, it is unlikely to find the ones that have fallen off.
They would probably eat it if they found it, though.

However, if you're going to put it in a textbook, I hope you have some better source of information than some random guy on YA.

There aren't possibly enough sponges on the bottom of the sea to suck up all the water. Yes, they do suck up some, but in comparison to the amount of water in the sea its hardy anything.

Sponges don't suck up water. Water just passes through their body. Water enters the sponge body through pores, then they are directed in the cavity. Then, water is filtered by the collar cells of the sponge to pick up bits of food, then with the help of these cells, water is pushed out if the sponge body.

It's just a matter of flowing through, not really absorbing in, so there wouldn't be any possibility that they would suck up all the water.

It is unlucky to kill spiders because a spider spun a web over baby Jesus to hide him from Herod.

If you are referring to growth hormones used  when taking cuttings these are the natural plant hormones that stimulate root growth (auxins).



Plant hormones affect a plant's ability to respond to it's environment. they work in pairs at very low concentrations. There are 5 different types of plant hormones:-



auxins -  cell elongation, apical growth stimulation, rooting
 gibberelins - elongation, plants growth



ethylene - fruit ripening & leaf drop in the autumn



cytokinins - cell division.



abscissic acid - inhibits other hormones



See the website I've mentioned for more details.

Plant hormone dynamics: When growth is promoted in plants, endogenous hormones may move into or out of the growing tissue, change in concentration through synthesis or degradation, or be chemically converted between active and inactive forms. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the growing tissue itself may change, producing an effective change in hormone level.

Strange are the ways of Nature. The night-blooming Orchid Cactus (Epiphylum Oxypetallum) is one such wonderful creation in the plant world. This plant itself looks as though it forgot to grow, well… like a plant. It has just long leaves sticking out of the ground. There is no stem or trunk as such. Other leaves go out of the sides of the leaf. Wait. The best is yet to come. The flower, like a second leaf, grows out of the leaf directly.The flower, in brilliant white, starts to bloom very late in the evening, lasts all of two hours!! If you don’t watch for it, the flower closes up and droops its head as though ashamed of its short life. The full bloom is usually the size of a large palm, with very prominent yellow-headed stamen. A very faint pleasant smell wafts through to and the petals look so delicate that one is afraid to touch it.

It is very easy to propagate this plant. Just break a leaf and stick it into the ground. Voila! Another plant springs up in no time. It requires full sun and well drained soil. No known pests attack this hardy plant. Truly a magnificent specimen of the botanical world.There is some confusion about its Indian name. It is often called Bramha Kamalam but I think it could be a mistake because the real Bramha Kamalam (Saussurea Obvallatta) is an exotic Himalayan flower belonging to the Sun Flower family, found in higher altitudes (between 3000m and 5000m) It is one of the star attractions of the Valley of Flowers, while the Orchid cactus actually belongs to the cactus family and cannot tolerate frost.
My search in the web too did not lend clarity conclusively. However, the Indian Government has released a postage stamp depicting the flower bramha kamalam, which is also the State flower of Uttaranchal.

This question has different answers from different experts over various times. Physically, the colour of water is affected by factors like the light source, absorption and scattering of light, as well as suspended materials in the water. The major light source in the Earth is the Sun. Sunlight comprises different colours of light, from red light with the longest wavelength to violet light with the shortest. The colour of an object mainly depends on the colour of light emitted from it.



Absorption by water is stronger for red light, but weaker for blue light. But this effect is only apparent when the water is reasonably thick (exceeding 1 metre). This is why, in daily life, a cup of pure water appears colourless under white light whereas a big aquarium looks bluish through the thickness of water.

Its clear, the reason it appears blue is because of the reflection of the blue sky. Thats why when the sky is black and cloudy the sea is that colour.

Water is clear. It is the minerals in it that give it a hue of a color.  Like in lakes it looks green but that is all the algae that is growing in it, oceans look blue that is the reflection of the sky and the sand and salt all combined.

Water colour is caused by the presence of dissolved organic compounds – predominantly humic and fulvic acids, which are the products of decomposition from organic soils.

The sea is blue because it reflects the sky. You have probably noticed that the sea is not very blue-looking when the sky is overcast. Water reflects and scatters the light that strikes it; this is shown by the fact that you can see your reflection in puddles. When the sky is brilliant blue, the sea is also, because it reflects the blue of the sky.

Pure water is clear.

Depends if there are any other substances in it.

Swimming pool water appears blue because of the chlorine and sometimes if there are blue tiles in the pool they can make the water appear blue. The sea sometimes appears blue if the sky is reflecting off it. Sea water can also look green because of seaweed and other underwater plants.

Cupping of leaves is not a good sign on geraniums.  It is the prime sign of a rare disease, caused by the beet curly top virus, which is probably the most destructive and distinctive virus disease of geraniums. The normaly flat leaves become curved, and the lower and older leaves may become yellowish between the veins. Later, the entire plant becomes yellowish.  Symptoms of leaf cupping appear in autumn and again in spring. Beet curly top virus is transmitted by grafting and by the feeding of insects.  I guess you can just wait and see what happens, but in all likelyhood the health of these plants will go downhill.

Below is a great website on geraniums diseases.

Since you don't mention your geographic location, it's hard to say.  My grandmother had one in her backyard in Mississippi, and I agree that they are delicious.



I will say that planned suburban neighborhoods often choose trees for landscaping that do not bear fruit, because they can be a bit messy in terms of yard work.  However, there's no reason a homeowner can't plant one of his own.

Mulberries grow mostly in warmer countries. Anyway, people in the UK don't plant trees for their frut, it seems. As someone coming from Eastern Europe, I do notice that the concept of picking berries or anything else edible from trees or bushes is a strange concept for the Brits. Apparently, everything comes from shops and supermarkets, so if you see a tree or a bush with juicy sweet berries, it's there just to look pretty. And birds get it all :(

Picking berries is very common in Russia and Eastern European countires (mostly because there are still some forests and unspoilt land). In the UK, where almost every bit of land is private property, you really have to watch out.

"Salsola (also known as Tumbleweed, Saltwort or Russian thistle) is a genus of herbs, subshrubs, shrubs and small trees in the family Chenopodiaceae, native to Africa, Asia, and Europe; they typically grow on flat, often dry and/or somewhat saline soils, with some species in saltmarshes.[1] Recent genetic studies[2] have however shown that the genus as traditionally circumscribed is paraphyletic, and many species are likely to be transferred to other genera in the future."

Can I smoke ground sage and get psychoactive effects?



I know that dried salvia leaves are smokable and posses psychoactive drugs. But I was wondering if ground sage (the spice they sell in cooking supplies) is smokable or contains the drugs. I've looked online everywhere and can't find anything except for nutmeg another spice but totally different.



</question>



<additional details>



I've seen people trip on salvia divinorum there's even proof that there are phycoactive compounds in the leaves such as salvia divinorum a and b. And I have also seen people trip on the nutmeg spice. But I have never seen someone or heard about someone getting high from the SPICE.

The cells in a seed have a nucleus and its DNA will split and copy its self then the cells split to make two cells, this continues until you have a bannana. Basicaly its dna acts as a checklist to tell its cells what to do, so in a way a bannana does have a brain, but it cant think really

A meristem is a tissue in all plants consisting of undifferentiated cells (meristematic cells) and found in zones of the plant where growth can take place.

(((Importance of Meristems - In plants , growth is impossibe with out meristem)))

The term “meristem” was first used by Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli (1817-1891) from his book “Beiträge zur Wissenschaftlichen Botanik” in 1858. It is derived from the Greek word “merizein”, meaning to divide in recognition of its inherent function.

The meristem,are a group of multipotent cells that can generate organs, has regenerative properties, and is self-organizing.There are two types of meristem in plants, the above ground portion in the shoot and the below ground portion of the root .The shoot apical meristem produces leaves, buds, and stem. The root apical meristem produces the root and responds to gravitational cues. The shoot apical meristem is organized into zones and layersThere are two zones, a central zone located in the center of the meristem, surrounded by a peripheral zone.The meristem continually produces new leaves, which are visible as they initiate as slight bumps, or primordia, at the periphery of the meristem.
 Not only are leaves initiated from meristems during plant development, but also new branches are initiated from axillary meristems located at leaf axil junctions along the main stem. The growth of axillary meristems is normally suppressed by the shoot apical meristem. However, if the shoot apical meristem is removed, by pruning for example, then the axillary meristems will grow into new flowering shoots and branches . This phenomenon by which the growth of apical meristems is suppressed by the shoot apical meristem is called apical dominance. Apical dominance also suppresses the growth of adventitious meristems, which form along the surface of stems and leaves. Hormonal signals are important for the mechanism of apical dominance and affect the growth of both axial and adventitious meristems.
Another important meristem is the root apical meristem ,which is organized into four zones at the tip of the root: a root cap, a zone of cell division, a zone of elongation, and a zone of differentiation.

A meristem is a tissue in all plants consisting of undifferentiated cells (meristematic cells) and found in zones of the plant where growth can take place.

The term “meristem” was first used by Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli (1817-1891) from his book “Beiträge zur Wissenschaftlichen Botanik” in 1858. It is derived from the Greek word “merizein”, meaning to divide in recognition of its inherent function.

Differentiated plant cells generally cannot divide or produce cells of a different type. Therefore, cell division in the meristem is required to provide new cells for expansion and differentiation of tissues and initiation of new organs, providing the basic structure of the plant body.

Meristematic cells are analogous in function to stem cells in animals, are incompletely or not at all differentiated, and are capable of continued cellular division (youthful). Furthermore, the cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely. The vacuoles are extremely small. The cytoplasm does not contain differentiated plastids (chloroplasts or chromoplasts), although they are present in rudimentary form (proplastids). Meristematic cells are packed closely together without intercellular cavities. The cell wall is a very thin primary cell wall.

Their are 4 different types of RNA

1. mRNA (messenger RNA)
2.heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA), 
3. transfer RNA (tRNA)
4.ribosomal RNA (rRNA),



Functions:
One of the primary functions of RNA is to facilitate the translation of DNA into protein. This process begins in the nucleus of the cell with a series of enzymatic reactions that transcribe DNA into heterogeneous nuclear RNA by complementary base pairing. Since hnRNA is a direct copy of DNA, it contains exons and introns which are coding and noncoding regions of nucleotides, respectively. hnRNA undergoes post–transcriptional processing that involves removal of the introns and the addition of adenines to the end of single stranded RNA molecules (a process called capping), which are now referred to as mRNA. mRNA is transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm of the cell. In this way, it functions as a carrier for information from the cells DNA to the protein synthesizing organelle, called the ribosome.

The mRNA attaches to the ribosome to allow for the initiation of protein synthesis. Part of this process involves another type of RNA that is located in the ribosome called tRNA. tRNA is an adapter molecule, which functions as a bridge between a specific three-base sequence or codon in the mRNA strand and the amino acids that are used to construct the protein. The tRNA carries an amino acid that matches the specific codon and this process begins and stops based on specific sequences in the mRNA. Each amino acid is transferred to the growing polypeptide by chemical interactions to produce a full-length protein. Another type of RNA that is part of the ribosome and is involved in protein synthesis is rRNA. rRNA has two primary functions. First, it provides the structure and shape producing the catalytic regions of the ribosome. Second, it helps speed up, or catalyze, protein synthesis by interactions between the tRNA and the protein synthesis machinery.

use in industry:
they are using rna to unlock the human genome.
