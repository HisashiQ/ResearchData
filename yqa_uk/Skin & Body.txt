Take zinc daily to fight infections, this will also help healing. These days tattoo studios are mostly very clean and sterile. Go somewhere with a good reputation and you'll be fine.

Any diseases you get while getting a tattoo you will get no matter what you do. By getting a tattoo you are putting yourself at risk for HIV, Hep. B & C, and if you don't put lots of sun block on it (after it's healed) you are at a higher risk for skin cancer, and alot more.



Besides sun block (AFTER it's healed) there isn't alot you can do besides NOT get it.

Don't worry though, licensed places should be fine. I'm NOT trying to talk you out of it, I'm getting one Thursday! :P

Be careful of who you allow to tattoo you. Make sure that the artist uses clean tools ( No, I don't mean that they wash them, I mean that they get them out of unopened packages). Make sure everything is completely sterile.



If you aren't careful, you can get :



Hepatitus, tentanus, HIV, AIDS, the list goes on. Numerous blood infections.



Trust your instincts, on this one!

(By the way, just because a studio has licensed artists doesn't mean that they are always clean!)_

there's a slight possibility of contracting hepatitis from getting a tattoo, but if you go somewhere clean where they use a new needle every time the risk is pretty much nothing.

you also have to keep it clean and moisturized the first few weeks, because it's an open wound and scabs over, you don't want to get an infection.

make sure your tattoo artist and parlor are reputable, and ask about aftercare, they should have detailed instructions on how to prevent anything from going wrong

Tattoos are done using needles and do have a potential for mixing body fluids.  Therefore you could get any disease from tattoos that you can from, say, drug use.  This includes Hepititus, HIV, Blood Poisoning etc.  You can also get infections in the tattoo itself.

Make sure you go to a sterile tattoo studio who are a member of the recognised tattoo artist association/register or whatever the governing body is in your area.  Make sure the artist uses clean, new needles etc and wears gloves.  Ensure everything is sterilised and wiped.

To reduce risk of infection take Zinc tablets.  This will increase your body's recover time reducing infection risk.  Make sure you follow the after care recommendations to the letter.

You can only get diseases from dirty, unsterilised needles at unclean, badly run tattoo studios. Things like Hep C, HIV and other blood-bourne infections can be picked up from these unlicensed scratchers. To avoid disease is simple - go to a licenced, regulated tattooist and check their health certificates.

Everything should be new and sterile, to prevent bloodborne pathogens from being able to get anywhere near you. The tubes and tips should be fresh out of the autoclave, the needles, as well, should be both new and sterile, either pre-packaged with an expiration date or made at the shop and sterelized, and everything should be covered with barrier film. Ask to see their cleaning room, they should be happy to show it to you. They will wear gloves that they will replace if you leave their line of vision. Armrests and chairs will be covered with barrier film as well as the machines will have clear plastic bags over them. When they use vaseline, it will be applied with a wooden toungue depressor. Ask to see inspection papers. They'll have no problem if they're up to snuff. Enjoy your ink!

Whatever you do I highly recommend Braun epilators.I  have one and so does my mother and my mothers has been lasting for years. You can get one of those new ones with a cooling glove, it is always much better and less painful to epilate when your skin is cooled.

You should definitely buy the epilady - the new one, though. It has like a strip to soothe the skin as it pulls the hair our, so it doesn't feel too bad.
I use it all the time, even after shaving an area for a while, and I find it much easier and more convenient than waxing - not to mention much less painful!
And the hair grows back a long time after you use it!
It's the pink Braun "Silk-Epil" one... I swear by it :):)
Good luck!

veet is good! or razors if you're in a rush, but i wouldn't advise them because the hair grows back fast, and the stubble hurts whilst its growing back in the process. Creams like veet and nair are good because they make the hair grow back less fast, and the hair is thinner as well, whereas shaving with a razor makes the hairs grow back faster.

if you dont want to wax, then shave and use a hair minimising cream(bit like moisturiser) afterwards, which dissolves the hairs over a period of time, making them thinner when they grow back so they dont look as dark

Is my cartilage piercing infected?



About two months ago I got my industrial pierced. Since then I haven't had any problems and I have been really good about cleaning it. But I do have a bad habit of playing with it. Recently, I noticed that on the inside of my ear where the hole is on both piercings it has formed a swollen bubble around the hole. It isn't red, or hot. But occasionally I will have some fluids come out of it.  Is this swollen bubble bad or is this normal? I have another cartilage piercing on my other ear that I got done years ago and I dont remember ever having this problem.. help!?

no its not an infection, this is called scar tissue. The easiest way to get rid of it is to buy Tea Tree Oil (which can be found at a drug store usually near the vitamins) and use a q tip to apply it to the bubble. In a matter of days you will see significant improvement. I have 16 piercings and this has always worked for me.

i had the exaaaact same problem with mine. the inside of the top had this weird scab/bubble/weird thing that made my ear sort of look like it was swollen.
anyway, it's like a keloid but if you treat it properly it will go away. 
the worst thing you could do in this situation is to try and pick it off, touch it, play with it etc etc etc. don't worry though, it's not infected.
if you are still cleaning it everyday, then start using tea tree oil diluted in warm water. just a few drops in about a cup of water is enough. but make sure it's 100% oil first. tea tree oil can help prevent you getting keloids and hypertrophic scarring and all that stuff so it's really good. 
after a while it will go down, don't expect it to go away overnight cos mine took a few weeks. but if you leave it alone, and let the scab fall off by itself and use the tea tree oil solution then it should go away with no problems. just make sure you don't pick it!!

mine has gone away now and the top hole doesn't hurt anymore, but i think i'm getting the same thing on the bottom hole..

good luck

You can buy Clearasil pore scrub stuff but a classic thing to do is use toothpaste. If you put some toothpaste where the spots are and leave it for about 10 Min's (this will sting like crazy) then wash your face thoroughly it should absorb all the grease out of the pores. Check on a small bit of skin to see if you get a reaction first tho. Hope this helps.

Saunas, facial steamers, hot showers, all will help open up your pores. Keeping your skin clean. Stridex pads have salicyclic acid in them and really clean your skin. St. Ives has a clay mask that is good. You could try the biore strips, I've known them to work well for some people.

I would suggest you to exfoliate to get rid of blackheads. Exfoliating would help to open the clogged pores as well as erase the skin along with the blackheads and give new and fresh skin. It has worked for me and would definitely work for you as well.

I would recommend what I use, Zenmed's AHA/BHA complex. The primary ingredients are glycolic acid, purified water which help to cleanse dead skin cells while promoting smaller pores and increasing the production of collagen for healthy skin. All you get in return is new, fresh and smooth skin without any scarring. The product is completely natural and hence there are no side effects when used and suit any type of skin.

So, try this and I can assure you of relief from blackheads in a weeks time. You can use my Zenmed's discount coupon "zen4less" to avail a price off, just in case if you decide to buy it.

The best way to remove them is by a professional with a needle type removal.. exfoliators and all the crap they say on tv doesnt work lol.. goto a beauty salon and they will get rid of them for you.. its quite painful as i had it done years ago.. then they returned... i think no matter what people with oily skin will get them no matter what.. dont squeeze them as you will release bacteria into the dermis and cause more problems!!! plus it may scar..

Should I Still Get My SEPTUM Pierced If I Have A Virus?



I've decided to get my septum pierced and planned to get it done later on this week, but i went to the doctors today and he told me that I may be coming down with a virus.

Should I still get my septum pierced?
If I did, would the virus affect the ability to pierce, healing? etc.

You should wait until you are 100% healthy again.  Not only will your immune system be taxed anyway, resulting in prolonged healing, but going to the studio while you are possibly ill will expose every person who walks through the studio doors.  It really wouldn't be fair for a person to catch your illness just because they decided to get a tattoo that day.  Also while you are ill, your pain tolerance will be lower, and you will be at a much higher risk of shock.  The septum tends to be a very painful area on the best of days, and I have seen quite a few clients get dizzy and nauseous after the procedure is done.  Better safe than sorry IMO.

How can I get rid of this scar?



I thought that after a scab formed, it wouldn't create a scar. 
but it did. and a weird shaped, weird coloured, horribly big and ugly looking scar.



I was riding my bike.. well doubling. I was standing on the back,
my friend took a sharp turn when it wasn't supposed to be and my leg slipped and went into the wheel while it was moving. If this has happened to you, you know how much it hurts and how bad it looks. :(
Its about a foot above my ankle so I can't hide it in the summer because i love shorts and i've tried coverup and foundation but it doesnt hide it. so i have a bandaid covering it up and it looks ridiculous.
I'm so self-concious about it and i want it gone.! Here is a picture because its so odd and i've never seen one like this before. :(

Don't know that there is much to do. That scar really shows what a nasty accident you had. Wow. If the accident was recent and the scar is new, then give it time. It actually may fade a lot more. If it's old, then go to a dermatologist to see if there's anything to do. He may have more suggestions.
Sorry I didn't have anything more useful.

It really really does not look as bad as you think. I know it is not a nice to have scars in visible places, but often you will notice it more yourself than others will because you're very conscious about it. It still looks dark and new. With time it will fade and start blending with your skin. One thing that does fade scars is cocoa butter creams. You will have to cream your legs with this over some time and you should see an improvement. One of the best is Palmers, and it leaves your skin real soft and smooth too.

I think Nivea has the best product out there for hydrating the skin, I use their lotion during the summer and their body out for the winter when my skin used to be dry, now it's always soft and never dry.  I've used other lotions by other companies but I always had to re-apply during the day, not with Nivea.  I apply once and don't think about it for the rest of the day they are great.

I don't ever intend to find out that it does hurt.  What do you expect when a hole is pierced through flesh?

No way a nose pierce doesn't hurt one bit. Well i got it done by a gun and not by the needle,so?
It's like getting your ear pierced but just on your nose.

I have had a nose piercing and I nearly fainted when I got it done and it hurts like hell when someone hits you in the nose (my baby niece knocked mine out and I never put it back in). Belly button piercing  doesn't hurt as much. I still have a small scar on my nose.

You're having a sharp object pushed through your nose :p

Yeah it hurts a bit, kind of similar to having your ear pierced. However, it's not that painful. Maybe a 5 on the scale? I found it hurt more when i caught it on stuff, rather than when it was pierced.



Although i've had snakes bites, my tragus, belly button done...and they all seemed to hurt less than my nose did.

Looks good, so is worth it.

It depends on your pain tolerance. I pierced my nose myself when i was 17. It didn't hurt at all, but my eyes did water. I also found that I sneezed a lot more after. It will hurt more in the few weeks after the piercing. Don't bump it too much and make sure to clean it well. Nothing hurts more than crusties ripping through your nose.

Not even a 1, it really depends on how your pain tolerance but honestly all these people who havent had it done throwing in wild guesses of 8 WTH is the point.
It really doesnt hurt during, it tingles a bit after but it does sting like hell if you catch it (like i did straight after XD)

I'd give it about a 4. I got mine pierced when I was 15 and it didn't hurt as such, my nose just felt like it was quite hot.
There were a lot of tears, but not because of pain, just because that's the automatic reaction of the body.

Keep in mind, I was pierced with a hollow needle, not a piercing gun. When I got my ears pierced with a gun, THAT was painful. The needle is the safer and less painful option.

if you get it done with a gun you only feel a sharp prick however if you get it done with a gun it is more likely to get infected then it will def hurt and it looks horrible
if you get it done with a needle they first make the hole then they insert the stud so instead of one bit of pain u get two but it is much easier to keep clean and less likely to get infected
also if you get it done with a gun u have to get a big stud which doesnt look very good so id advice to get it done with a needle its not that painful anyway 
hope it works out!

* Wash your face twice a day (thrice at most) with gentle and unperfumed cleanser.  Avoid using soaps as they contain harsh chemicals and ingredients that can damage your skin.



* Avoid touching your face.



Stop putting your hands by your face! I am often guilty of this resting my hand on the side of my head while reading. Also rubbing or bracing your chin is another common problem when thinking.  Avoid rubbing, touching, or itching your skin with your hands. Your hands contain a lot of bacteria that can cause acne flare-ups.  It is probably one of the most difficult things to avoid since much of the hand to face contact throughout the day we are unconscious of.  Make it a habit to avoid hand contact and be conscious of it during the day to avoid bacteria.



* Avoid the temptation to pick, prick and squeeze your acne.  This will send the infection deeper into the skin and can cause severe scarring.



* For mild to moderate acne, you can use over- the- counter topical ointments, solutions, lotions or gels that contain  salicylic acid or azelaic acid as an alternative to benzoyl peroxide.  Resorcinol, salicylic acid, and sulfur help break down blackheads and whiteheads. Salicylic acid also helps cut down the shedding of cells lining the follicles of the oil glands.



* Topical antibiotic solutions and lotions can also be applied.



* Tea tree oil is a natural antibiotic and antibacterial agent and has a drying effect on the skin.



It keeps the P. Acnes bacteria at bay along with decreasing facial oiliness, which makes this oil a worthwhile investment.



* Sulfur helps to heal existing blemishes by unblocking pores.



* Alpha or Beta Hydroxy Acids (AHA or BHA) works by keeping the skin exfoliated.  Glycolic acid, the most well-known of the bunch is a useful adjuvant therapy for mild acne. Mandelic acid, a lesser known one, but one that combines the keratolytic properties of glycolic acid with natural antibacterial properties that help reduce the presence of P. acnes, may be considered a more effective alpha hydroxy acid in treating acne lesions.  It is also much less irritating than glycolic acid, a factor that may be very important to those with sensitive skin who are unable to use other agents such as Retin-A, benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, or salicylic acid. It is effective in treating mild cases of acne on its own, and can be used successfully with other therapies on moderate acne.

These treatments are usually effective for mild to moderate acne problems only.

I use Zenmed's Derma Cleanse Acne Gel for getting rid of my pimples. I have started to take a liking to the product because it helps to get rid of even stubborn and big red pimples in a days time without leaving any scars. This gel is completely herbal and is made from the finest botanical extracts and helps to clear pimples quickly and at the same time opens clogged pores and reduces the redness and swelling thats often some pimples appear with.

Also something good about this product is that it doesn't dry up the skin while it is being used. This is something good as your face won't look dry but would look lightly moisturized.

Try it, its a very good product for clearing pimples and opening clogged pores of dirt  and bacteria.

I like rose tattoos. I know people say they're overdone or outdated, but I think they can be really beautiful. And I certainly prefer them to stars and butterflies. I like roses best when they're the classic red, but that's just me. As long as you like it and think you won't regret it when you're 90, go ahead.

meh, tell those people to get their own damn tattoos, and leave what your gonna put on your body to you! I think those types of roses look really good black. My fiancee has one very similar to that, and it's black with yellow highlights and looks fantastic. I say go for it! There's nothing wrong with black roses. (especially if your a fan of Tiger Army) as long as you have a good artist that can make it flow right. :) I say go for it!

Tragus piercing....questions!



I'm desperate to get my tragus pierced, but am a little concerned about the pain.

On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the worst pain imaginable) how would you rate the pain of a tragus piercing?

Also, how long does it take? What's the average cost? What's aftercare and healing time like? Would you recommend it? Etc etc.

(I have my helix and auricle pierced, would it be comparable to them?)

Many thanks! xx

I'd say about a 5. If you go to a good piercer who works fast, it'll be over in a blink. Mine was £25 with a 1.2mm barbell, which is about average cost (don't get it done with a ring, they turn a lot when healing, causing irritation to the piercing).

Aftercare - sea salt soaks morning, evening and after you shower or swim. More info here - http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Salt_S... Don't turn the jewellery, it will just push crusties into the fresh wound and irritate it. When not cleaning, try not to touch it at all, and if you have to, make sure you have clean hands.

I'd recommend it, it was my first cartilage piercing, it's cute and healed the best of all the piercings I've had since.

for me, it hurt about a 4
and when it comes to pain, im the biggest wimp

its really fast.. and the cost just depends where you go

it takes a while to heal and it hurts more during healing time then the acting piercing process



its really nothing, 
youd think it hurts like hell

Zero. I felt nothing when I had my tragus done not even a pinch but I found the top of my ear to be really painful. Infact, that was the most painful of all my 13 piercings. It varies for different people though.

I would say a five. It was painful for me, but I have a very low pain tolerance and sensitive ears. I took it out only a couple days later because it didn't look right on me and it wasn't all that I thought it would be. It was free for me, because I had it done at a Tattoo parlor that has "T Tuesday's" and every Tuesday, they have "T" things for free. Like nipple piercings are free because it's "Titty Tuesday" and so on. Anyway, I think the price was around $30-40 if I remember correctly.

I have a low pain tolerance, so I'd say it was about a six. Much more painful than when I had my lip done. It only took about 5 minutes to get it done; most of that actually him setting it up to pierce me. It's just a quick prick. Mine cost $60 at the place I went too, and it would have been $80 to get both done for me; but it varies where you go. I don't remember the healing time, but the aftercare's pretty easy. I have had a little bit of problem with earwax getting stuck on the barbell though.

Pain About 3 the jewellery going in is the most painful part and that doesn't really hurt
Its over within seconds and cost me £25
Just make sure you bathe it twice a day with warm salty water and i got told leave it atleast 4 months before trying to change the jewellery but leave it as long as possible.
It only hurts slightly more than a helix piercing

Why on earth would you want to cover something as innocent as stretch marks, which are so easy to get rid of by the way, with something as foul and regrettable as a tattoo??!!? you are wrecking your young body with something you will undoubtedly regret as some stage of your life, when you could use something like bio-oil for 2 weeks and have your own perfect skin back. not to mention the fact that you are not supposed to tattoo over stretch marks in the first place.

Well if your stretch marks are deep then the tattoo will not look right. Also if you decide to have more kids getting a tattoo in that area will probably get stretched, causing bigger deeper stretch marks and possibly not look the way it is supposed to after have another baby. Not to mention any weight gain or lose you have can do the same thing.

I think its because more people find tanned skin more attractive than they do pale skin. Tanned skin somehow seems to give people more confidence. But it also hides more imperfections in the skin, ie: marks, blemishes etc.

However, i find pale skin much much sexier than tanned skin. I have long black hair, big brown eyes and white as white skin. I think the contrast is stunning and far more attractive.



When i go out with my friends that are tanned and really bronzed, i get alot less attention from blokes as i am so white. But it doesn't bother me as i adore being pale and interesting!

There's nothing wrong with tanned skin, whatever makes you happy and whatever turns you on! Its down to personal preference. But personally i don't like it. Infact it puts me off people, i much prefer pale skin.

well if you think pale skin is pretty, then there u have it...in your eyes pale skin is pretty.

I don't know about preference, but I have learned that people in asian countries used to consider tanned people poor, because they worked out in the rice fields all day or something like that.....whatever it doesn't matter, I think the skin type that a person was born with makes them beautiful.

it's pathetic when some people try to make themselves into something they're not, instead of accentuating what they already have that makes them unique.



I think all skin types and colors are beautiful, as long as you didn't pay for it or raise your risk of skin cancer ( excessive sun bathing) to get it.

I think attitudes are changing. I used to love to get a tan, now I'm in my early 40s and try to keep out of the sun - I prefer to look pale and smooth rather than brown and wrinkly!

it depends on the person really. some people look nicer with tanned skin. others look much more beautful with pale skin. before all this fake tan and that came in years ago people used to see pale skin as a sign of a woman who could look after herself and didnt need a job out in the sun all day. well that was about a hundred years but you get my point. pale skin isnt a sign of weakness or illness. thats like pure white which makes you seem ill. i think your natural skin colour is better than fake tan. if you want the tanned look then get a tan gradually in your garden while sunbathing or go to the beach. alot more natural and more attractive than orange. trust me many lads have told some of my tanaholic friends this. i just tend to go natural and tan in the garden.

No it doesn't hurt, just a little sore afterwards.

When I got mine done, I had a blue sapphire-ey type one.

It doesn't look tacky to be honest.



Claires is expensive tacky sh!t to be honest.

I know, your better off getting some from like H&M, or actual, stainless steel and stuff.

Stainless steel are OK to put in, but when you get them peirced with an earring you have to keep those earrings in for 6 weeks,



then after 6 weeks take the earrings you got them peirced with and then you take them out and use stainless steel

All piercings are gonna hurt at least a little because it's not normal to have holes made through the flesh.

Some people can tolerate it more, some people can't. I reckon if you can't tolerate pain very well then you're gonna make a big deal out of it.

It hurts about the same as the first one. Because its still the same  soft fleshy area. I personaly think its nice but some might disagree. I would go for plain metal (gold or silver) in both pairs or complimenting colours like red and white or blue and green.

No it doesnt look tacky, if you have enough room for even 3 sets it looks good. It cost me £5 on a market stall that had its own piercing studio behind a curtain and they used surgical steel gold plated earrings with a turquoise stone. It hurts exactly the same as your first set. And well it only stings for a few seconds, the swelling and throbbing soon goes down and in 6 weeks you can put in what you like. I wouldnt want to get mine done in the middle of a busy jewellery shop window.

How would - hypothetically speaking - one set up a massage parlour in England?



Hello,

If one was to start a massage parlour in England, how would it be done? What factors would have to be taken into consideration, what type of premises and lettings would be used and how could one avoid trouble from the authorities (naturally enough, there would be no trouble because all acts in the buildings would be perfectly legal).

Naturally enough, you might like to take out some fire insurance in case the place went up in smoke, especially if the other massage parlour owners told you there was a lot of sparks about.



Also, you might find it handy to have a few friends who work in the police force, because they have a stressful job and sometimes make use of alternative therapies.  You might also like to choose the city or town you set up in carefully, because these premises seem to flourish in one or two cities much better than in others.

I have used sunbeds before and I am sorry but I do have to play good samaritan and warn you that a lot of people develop malignant skin cancers after using these. They are dangerous and I will never be using one again!

But... to answer your question, if you want a decent tan for a months time, you will need to go about 3 times a week until then. It takes a while to build up. Also, another hint if you are looking to tan faster, don't use the fans in there as they cool you down too much.. the more you sweat, the more you tan. I did the same thing 6 months ago for my own wedding, so I understand why you want to go.

Hope this helps, but sorry, I still had to do the warning.

I used to go 2-3 times a week. But then I started drinking coffee atleast twice a day.. and I have no job, so I couldnt afford to pay $9.25 2-3 times a week for tanning plus another $8-9 a day for coffee. So I just stopped tanning. Its summer, go lay outside. Its cheaper.

As a fellow tan aholic I recommend going everyday because you can only go once every 24 hours. Then once you get the color you want just stop for like 2 weeks because the tan will last you a while. To keep up with your tan you can apply bronze lotion to your body which will give your new tan a sun kissed glow. And one tip: Buy your tanning lotion and bronze lotion at walmart or target, you get the same effect but are only paying 10.00 instead of 50.00! Good Luck!

going on a sunbed isnt to bad as long as u dont abuse it , i think u should go on every other day 4 the 1st wk just for 3 mins then every 3rd day 4 the 2nd wk for 3 mins then the last 2 wks go twice a wk for 6 mins and you will have a nice tan ready for being a bridesmaid . but dont make it a regular thing make sure u use the creams they sell in the shop b4 u go on as this will protect ur skin as well as help u stay a nice colour. if u are only looking for a tan 2 be a bridesmaid st tropez is good it costs about £30 pound if u have it done 2 days b4 u will have a lovely tan 4 the day and it will last a bout a week after . the only problem with it is u have 2 keepit on 4 24hrs b4 u wash it off good luck and hope the weather holds out 4 u on the day x

Leave it as it is – what’s the point of adding chemicals to it? It’s a greater turn off (for me anyway) when it’s not natural. Ignore the celebrity culture, save some pennies by not buying these useless products and be proud of your own unique shape/colour!

I like Clarins but it's about £15 a tube.  My sister likes likes L'oreal's self tan range plus with L'oreal self tans they not as dear as the Clarins.  If I was you I go into your local Boots or Super Drug here in the UK & ask @ the sales counter what sells the best.  Look luck & take care.

Gradual tanners like the one from Jergens is good. Results appear in about 3-5 days with once-a-day use. It smells alright from the bottle but I dont like the smell when you actually put it on. The smell transfers to clothes and bedsheets.

I've also tried Airbrush Legs. Itts a leg makeup spray. It does rub off though, so dont do it on your ankles if you're going to wear dressy shoes with a strap on the back

I read on msn somewhere that if u get streaky legs you should exfoliate afterwards using a loofah and baking soda. I've never tried it though.

Here's also a link to popular tanning products (and some sunblock products as well) rated on MSN

Nose piercing caught, help!?



Got my nose pierced just over 2 weeks ago, was healing well and didn't feel sore or anything. Then about 6 hours ago i went to rub my eye and got my thumb nail caught on the piercing and pulled it half way out of my face! I pushed it back in and cleaned it straight after. It feels slightly sore when my nose flares but other than that it's okay. I just wanted to know how much this has set me back healing wise?? How long will it take for it to not feel sore again?? Basically, has this slowed down the healing process and if so how much??



</question>



<additional details>



I sort of rubbed my eye, put my hand down and the piercing was halfway out and it felt quiet sore. I put it back in so i don't really know whether or not it scraped the inside, i think it might have but im not sure.

The healing process will barely be affected by this at all, when piercers give you an approximate healing time they take this sort of thing into consideration because of course your piercing is going to get knocked at some point. It'll stop being sore very soon, don't worry :) It's normal to hurt a bit if you catch it on something when it's a relatively fresh piercing.

Apply lemon juice to your knees, leave it on for 5-10 minutes, then get a towel and dip it in warm water and use the towel to get the lemon juice off. You can also try rubbing Aloe Vera on it, it works for the face, but I'm not sure if it works for the knees, you should try it anyways.

Or you can buy Lancôme Flash Bronzer Self-Tanning Body Spray. It gives you a tan that looks natural.

I certainly wouldn't recommend having it done at Claires. They only use a gun to pierce and you should NEVER use a gun to pierce cartilage. It can shatter the cartilage, cause massive trauma to the ear and cause keloids, they're also pretty unhygenic.

If i were you i'd pick a proper piercing parlour that specializes in ONLY piercings. A reputable place will be much more hygenic, give you proper aftercare and do it all properly. A reputable piercer will charge anywhere between £15 and £25 for cartilage piercings with a needle.

And no, for a helix (top or ear) or auricle (middle of outter shell of ear) piercing you need either a labret, BCR or a barbell as these are more comfortable and allow for swelling of the ear. A stud won't allow the ear to swell and will cause you so much pain. (Trust me i know from when i had my auricle pierced with a gun.....very nasty and extremely painful afterwards.)

The first few years I had it done that would happen from time to time.  Usually it because I did something to irritate it, such as sitting in an awkward position and my belt would rub against it.  I found that wearing loose clothes usually helped the pain to go away.  Keep an eye on it and make sure you don't develop any kind of infection.  If it looks like you're starting to then make sure to wash it well with antibacterial soap (Dial) and then do a salt water soak.  That should help head it off.

well let me start off by saying dont EVER shave in between waxing sessions!

basically, wax if you have the money
shave if you dont have the patience.

waxing is really painful at first but you get less and less hair each time plus you build up a tolerance.

i personally wax because its a little cleaner and im a forgetful person

go to your local beautican and ask for a bikini wax---it will be painfull at first but lasts longer then shaving and its more hiygenic then using a razor and shaving gel---the area thats a bikini line is the outer part of your 'private' area its the part you can still see when you wear bikini bottoms----personaly i think its best to have all of the 'private' area waxed and personaly i feel like its more hiygenic

Waxing is better because a professional can do it in the best way, don't be embrassed, you won't be the first girls she work on! :) I wouldn't do it because of the pain (skin is really sensitive in that area), i can't stand it....but if you can, you should do it! Shaving is fast, but if you're not used to, you can get a inflammation!

You can't really stop the peeling. That's your body's natural way of shedding the skin that died off while you were in the sun.



If you want to prolong the length of your tan, while getting rid of some of your peeling skin...exfoliate!

Use a strong lufa sponge or an exfoliating scrub in the shower. The rough  texture will help to get rid of your peeling skin...after your shower rub on a tan prolonging lotion with LOTS of moisturizer. I recommend Cocoa Butter....

Hope that helps!!!

For folks with lighter skin, a tan is only temporary. The reason you tan is because you literally burn your skin in the sun.

Don't purposely sit out and sunbathe. Peeling is a pain now, but you may think it's worthwhile with the tan. Wait until you get older, and that tan won't be so pretty when you have skin cancer.

start using exfoliant. you can either buy one. or you can just scrub your face with sugar.

it will help scrub away dead skin cells so new healthy cells grow back.

You can try taking vitamin e, or even applying it directly to your skin.

You may as well ask "what is your favourite music,colour, or food?" If you want a tattoo it should be personal, not a consensus or an opinion poll!
Wake up!
BTW, the word is "scapula". Scapular is a verb, meaning "to, or of relating to, the scapula"

Something that means something to you. Think about images, ideas, words, and values that are important to you. Or come up with an idea like "rebirth" or "hope" and find a symbol that represents it to you. You can look through images from different cultures and classic tattoo designs to find an image you like. But don't just find a design on a website and copy it. Come up with your own image and idea for it so that it really represents you and so that it's not something kitschy that you'll regret.

As this is obviously going to be a perm tattoo, I suggest a visit to the shop to look at some designs, before you have the tattoo done.

Personally I love dragons, and the mystic designs, but as an individual you have to consider what design is on your arm, not just for now but in future years when you reach your elderly years.

I doubt that there's any facial cream that removes moles out there, but I know that getting one removed is seriously completely painless. They take a needle that is so thin its hard to see, and inject the mole. It goes completely numb, and then they take a very small surgical knife and, boop! It comes right off. Depending on how big the mole is, they may need to sew it up with a couple of stitches. Hope this helped!

If you have not had lip enhancement before then I would suggest that you first try temporarily fillers (restylane) to see if you like the look.

the active ingredient to look for in any treatment is Benzoyl Peroxide.
That's found in Clearasil as previously suggested but also others (Freederm, Biactol, etc).

Try not spray aftershave anywhere near your face for a little while, use a really mild soap for washing (e.g Simple soap), something unfragranced anyhow, and see what happens.

go to the doctors and they can give you tablets and cream so you wont get them no more :D

the tablets take 3 months till they work (but its worth it) and the cream is instant but it does dry up your skin but it gets rid of the redness pretty quick and is supposed to keep your skin clear.

I would recommend for you to use 'Derma Cleanse Acne Gel' from Zenmed. Why I recommend this stuff is that it clears spots in no time without causing much scarring and doesn't dry out the skin unlike other products.

It's a complete herbal product made from pure botanical extracts that I have experienced works over night to get rid of even stubborn spots. It would also help you to unclog pores and reduce the redness and swelling of spots.

It costs $25 and can be bought online from zenmed or at stores or even at amazon.

Hi I got some stuff from, avon I got correct fade and peel pads which help with spots and acne scarring, the only thing you have to do is be careful with them if you have senstivie skin, If these dont do you any good, I use avons immediate response blemish cleansers you was your face and leave it on for 30 seconds and then rinse, and it makes the spots go down in seconds, I would only recommend using it when you have spots thought and not all the time as it can burn the skin or it does mine anyways. But its brilliant and does the job better than clearasil and anyother ones you can get in the shop.

Septum Piercing Hole?



I'm planning on getting my septum pierced in the near future.

I know that after a few years I may decide that I no longer want it, so I was wondering if I would be left with a hole in my nose if I did decide to take it out? And if so, if there's any chance that it would heal?

I'm not going to just throw out a number because it's hard to say. It all depends on where you go to get it done. Usually good artists charge about $100-$200 an hour. Color generally costs more as well and takes more time to complete. I would shop around your local tattoo places and ask. Don't get ripped off. A tattoo that size and detail shouldn't cost more than $100.

where do ya want to put in??if i estimate it will goes 95 bucks, well actually When it comes to tattoos, you get what you'll pay for. Yes, there are plenty of people tattooing out there that will ink you cheap, and you will be crying to a real artist to have it covered up. Look for quality, and be willing to pay for it. NEVER haggle over the price of a tattoo. It's disrespectful to the artist. If you can't pay for quality, don't bother. This is not a bargain bin. It's a piece of art you will wear for life.

I need lip piercing help!?



I'm getting my lip pierced very very soon, and there are a few things i need to know. I've tried doing research, but it has come up unfruitful. Here's the deal:

I'm getting it done at a local tattoo shop. Is this an okay idea?

I do a lot of sports, and i may have to take it out for a few hours at a time. But this would be weeks after i got it done. Would this heed any complications?

If i decided to stop wearing it, how noticeable would the hole be?

If i made sure to take good care of it and cleanse it often, what are the chances of a bad infection?

What are the types of lip piercings, like what styles, (ring, stud...) and what can i get other than snake bites, spider bites, or singles?

Is there anything important i should know before i mutilate my face?

It's a bad idea to get a body piercing if your going to do sports.
but if you DO decide to get it. you really have to clean it.
and if you decide not to wear it anymore, theres gonna be a small hole.
but i think its a bad idea if you get a lip piercing and decide to leave it out a couple hours. cause new piercings close really fast.

A local tattooist should be fine, just check who'll be doing your piercing, how long they've been piercing etc. You won't be able to keep the piercing out for more than an hour before it closes up, so I'd advise you wear a retainer instead:

http://www.bodyjewelleryshop.com/online_...

They are clear and can't be seen and because it has a flat top (without a ball like a titanium labret stud) it shouldn't catch on anything or cause too much trouble during exercise.

If you do decide to take it out, the hole isn't very noticeable at all:

http://www.igophoto.net/y0urelectrikk/im...

But they will be smaller as the hole heals in time.

Just as long as you take care of it, and do what the piercer tells you (i.e. no fiddling with the jewellery, rinsing out with diluted mouthwash after everything you eat/drink/smoke etc.) you should be fine. Oral piercings are some of the piercings that are hardest to get an infection with because of the mouth's natural chemicals.

There are loads of different types:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lip_piercin...

Google their names to see what some on them look like.

Just be sure that you think it will look good and that you want the piercing!

Hope this helps, and enjoy your new piercing :)

Ear stretching: How long should you wait before jumping to 0g from 2g?



Seeing as this is a full 2mm jump, should you wait longer? If so, how long? Months?
Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



P.S. I did rip my ear slightly going from 8g to 6g. Nothing too bad, healed in a couple of days, but because of this i know i now need to leave a longer healing period between 2g to 0g.



I am a 2g now, i had previously confused gauge sizes before. I guess i should have downsized when my ear ripped (or i presume it ripped as it bled, although not a lot), but i didn't and it's healed fine now. I was planning to wait around two months before the next stretch, but maybe i should wait longer...

if ur ears are healed and u didnt rip them on the last jump id say do it right now. my friend went from not having his ears pierced to and inch double flair in like 2 months and some change. it didnt rip 1ce. i thought tht was amazing. but 2 to a 0 is prolly one of the larger sized jumps. but 0 to 00 is like nothing at all. id say if ur eventually goin to 00 skip 0 and go to 00. i went slow and did almost every size bcz i was the 1st of my friends to start gauging their ears but wen my friends started it i knew wat i was doin so i coached them through it. one of my friends went from a 4 to a 00 no problem.

You need to go from 6 to 4 first.
Then 2 to 1.  You can find 1g jewelry on http://www.bodyartforms.com/plugs.asp?je...
And then 1 to 0.
2mm jumps (like 2g to 0g) are not recommended, and are almost a guaranteed blowout/tear.

You should be waiting at least 3-4 months between stretches now.
And if you experience a tear (like you said you did), you should have downsized immediately, started doing oil massages (vitamin e, jojoba, emu),  and not even think about stretching for at least 6 months.

http://forums.bodyartforms.com/forums/t/...

EDIT:
You should wait a lot longer if you're already at 2g.  Any bleeding is never okay, and means you did tear your lobe and should be downsized.  You are creating scar tissue that, usually, doesn't seem to have any adverse effects until you begin to stretch larger.  Then you're stuck with very nasty looking lobes.

You shouldn't be stretching at all if you can't be responsible enough to follow the guidelines and take proper care of your stretches.

Little red bumps, ingrown hairs on stomach.?



I had hair on my stomach and I thought it was gross so I shaved it off. Now the hair is really thick and coarse. When I get my stomach waxed it leaves in grown hairs and there are red bumps. It also leaves like little dark marks around my belly button like there is still hair there. How do I get rid of it all?

..while showering everyday rub them well with the sponge ..then after a week u will notice them gone because the dead skin will get peeled and the hairs will be free..then wax them again and always when u shower use a sponge...
and never shave them..or u can do laser ...u will lose them forever

Yep and yep 
Exfoliating it's like a body scrub you can get it ANYWERE 
just place some on your hand and rub your legs and wipe it of after wards
If you live in Britain then you can get some good stuff from tesco (I know sound cheep and nasty) but i only got it becuase there was nothing else but it the best one i've used

I know you say 'without shaving', but you could try a shaver with an aloe vera strip and apply aloe vera gel after shaving - might bring down the redness, works for me anyway... xx

I strongly recommend the Nair Pretty hair removal cream. Ive never had good luck with Razors, OR hair removers, but this stuff was amazing. I left it on for 10 minutes and I didnt have to worry about my legs for the rest of the week.



But It really does help to exfoliate your legs before doing any of this to help remove the dead skin. And that prevents irritation! =)

Try shaving with a different razor and shave gel (one that moisturizes and is for sensitive skin). Apply lotion right after you get out of the shower while your skin is still damp.

Have them waxed,it lasts a few weeks & if you rub a pumice stone over your legs as the growth starts to show it will last even longer.Either have them done professionally or you can buy different products to do it your self.Recommend professionally tho' for best results & longest lasting.

you can also buy a light scrub (exfoliating scrub its a body wash with beads in it)  and what that dose is removes  all the 1st layer of dead skin. there are some that are soft enough to use daily  so give it about 2weeks and ur tan will be close to gone.

You can just stay indoors everyday so it'll fade eventually.  Also toothpaste might help a little.  I don't know for sure but put it on at night and then wash it off in the morning,  eventually it MIGHT work.

My arms are relatively skinny, so must i put on weight or will it be ok. i stress "relatively" not that skinny. I have had stretch marks before on my thighs when i was younger and lost a huge amount of weight at once.. I don't want it happening again.

Mederma is a pharmaceutical (aka: dangerous) product that uses onion as its base.



I recommend adding fresh, organic, raw onion intake into your daily diet so that your body is being fed a constant nourishment of live enzymes and living cells needed to minimize your stretch marks while your body is growing. The same with garlic, because they contain essential oils used by scientists to create skin-restoring medicine to assist in the skin's healing process. I don't know how they use onions to make Mederma, but my fiance used Mederma on her mastectomy area after her breast cancer surgery and created a very painful, sub-dermal infection. Garlic and olive oil healed her in days, though; its regular application actually minimizes scarring during healing. I don't know what would happen if you added onion to the recipe, but I'll get to that in a second...

For skin infections, crush garlic teeth and marinate them with a fair amount of olive oil. Let the garlic oils release into the olive oil for a little while (15-30 minutes is okay, but longer is probably better) then apply directly over the skin. You may try sleeping with it, but you may make a mess of the bedsheets.

I like it. Beautiful font and it's unique. It's not the tattoo I would get, but I don't think that's a bad thing - it is supposed to be personal and meaningful to you, not anyone else. I also wouldn't be comfortable with getting something so visible, but that is just me. I think it's a nice design and well executed, and you being happy with it is obviously the only thing that matters.

I have tried 3 times to 'summit' and answer to you, and Yahoo!7Answers keeps 'taking a break' and I keep loosing my answers!... sigh,
I like it a lot, there is nothing not to like. Good idea, fine job of tattooing, great placement...
I am not sure why you want to know what I think though???
If you are unsure because of airheads like 'friend' above me who thinks that if they say something that it is true.... than don't be. Brush them off, their comments are made from ignorance and a feeling of insecurity.
If you are asking, because you feel that your tattoo doesn't translate like you thought it would, then you may need to think about an addition (I did this - as in something similar - and it worked out) 
You could put something to symbolize life (like a flower) or :http://images.google.com/images?gbv=2&nd...
http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...
or put something that means 'life' or 'living' to you (it does not matter if anyone else gets it)
But if you just felt like asking, 'cause you got a new tat, well,,
like I said, .. well done!

Do you speak Latin?  I hate foreign writing tattoos, how do you even know what it says?  The size is cool though and I like script tattoos.

I also hate people saying what are you going to do when you're bored of it?  What are you going to do in 20 years time?  These tw*ts obviously don't have tattoos, nor do they like tattoos.  So your opinion is not f*cking wanted.  Why bother answering a tattoo question when you don't like them at all?

Every night before you go to bed apply a pretty heavy amount of vasaline to your cracked lips, do the same in the morning or when ever they feel dry, if you are going our or something and don't want to take the whole container with you take a pocket size one or cary an organic chapstick. (try burts bee's) Apply frequently or when ever they are sore or cracked.

Go to bath and body...they have this lip exfoliator stuff...it is like chapstick/libbalm with exfoliating micro beads...you rub it on your lips to help remove the flaky skin, then wash it off then apply something soothing...they have a great selection and it is totally worth the money!  I bought some like a year and a half ago and I still have it...it was less than $20 for the exfoliator and the lipbalm (I think they were 7.50 each plus tax)

Blackhead Trouble... HELP!!



This is kinda embarrassing but... I have a blackhead that i've had for a while and it just wont go! I also have some around my nose.
I've tried blackhead strips, blackhead remover cream and yes, i've tried the horrible job of squeezing them and that still didn't work.
Nothing will work and get rid of them! :(
Does anyone have any really good advice or anything that they could recommend to me to get rid of them?
Thanks to all who help.

there not just gonna disappear one day. Even if you do get rid of them there still gonna grow back. Try to steam your face by filling up the sink with really hot water. and then put a towel over your head and keep your face a few inches away from the water. The towel keeps the air out therefore the steam makes the blackheads softer. And then you can try any of the methods you mentioned and it ll be easier. 
Good luck ( :

I use St . Ives Apricot Scrub ( its like $ 5



, more or less depends on the store ) and I also use the Neutrogena Wave ... after using those 2 probducts i had no problem with blackheads anymore !



- Wet your face with hot water ( or as warm as you feel comfortable with ) 
-  Scrub your face with a small amount of Apricot scrub 
- Rinse it off with warm water 
- Use the Neutrogena Wave ( it'll tell you how on the package )  all around your face , especially where the blackheads are . 
- Rinse your face with freezing cold water , or if your not comfortable with freezing water then rinse with warmish water and then rub a cold ice cube over your face to close the pores and prevent them from building up with dirt and bacteria . 
- Apply a light moisturizer . 
And then your done !!



p.s. you can wear makeup after this , just not alot so that it clogs your pores again .

If the blackhead strips didn't get anything out.. maybe you weren't using a good kind, or the glue didn't dry right.

Use biore.  Use them right after you get out of a hot shower - do not dry your face, just put them right on.  If they're a little dry, add a little warm water, but do not soak them.  They should be moist, but not "wet".  Lightly blot them and press them firmly on your skin, and especially in the creases of your nose.  Don't make any facial expressions until they're completely dry. 20min to be sure.

There is also some metal thing that someone I know has.  it evenly presses around the area, and forces the blackhead out.

If it's really big and bad, maybe in a soft spot, like your cheek, a friend can dig it out with a pin - sorry!

ok well i think you sld maybe look at skin products that maybe your usuing and they are blocking your pores and creating the spots.

u need a gud exfoliator and (i use sea salt from the lush shop its fantastic) its natural not dead expensive and feels really nice on the skin.

i wld get a gud toner aswel



there is also a face mask in the avon that help you have to peel the mask off so removes dirt. the body shop has something similar but will be more expensive.

i wld also get a moisturiser that is not greasy on your skin. the lush shop has a few nice ones that dont clog ur skin.

clearisil has a pen you can use on ur spots and it fits in ur bag u can take it everywhere.  i know the £1 shop has had it in a few times.  its just silver (unless they have changed the packaging)

maybe after squeezing them u cld use you dads nice aftershave to close the porse (it hurts but it works)

maybe look at ur diet to u might be eating sumthing ur alergic to that can cause spots. thats my boyfriend problem he eats loads of crap lol.

i hope that helped

Wow, your ears must seriously hate you...

Firstly, SLOW THE **** DOWN

If you've been finding stretching painful in the slightest/needing to force the tapers at all/bleeding then you're doing something very very wrong. Downsize, give your ears 2 months minimum to heal then start stretching sensibly

The charming people over at Kaos Softwear have kindly explained in detail exactly why stretching with silicone is shitty: http://www.kaossoftwear.com/index.php?ma...

And the charning people over at LJ have taken the time to compile a number of reasons as to why you shouldn't be stretching as fast as you are: http://s260.photobucket.com/albums/ii9/b...

And finally, just because I'm such a loving person and you seem to know as much about stretching as a picture of yourself (or maybe learn it all from hot topic employees and you omgsohxc friends, there's very little difference) Here's some nice shiny links:

it would be absolutely impossible to say what will hurt more for you, if you didn't find it painful having your tragus you probably have a high pain threshold so maybe it won't hurt?

but, you could try expecting to feel the worst pain ever - then that way you can only be pleasantly surprised?



it doesn't take that long to heal, and you will get used to dealing with sneezing and stuff.

it depends on how sensitive your skin is, i mean my friend had her nose done and she said it didn't hurt at all, but yet one the most painful piercing is your tongue and my belly button hurt more than my tongue.

No one can tell you how bad it hurts - we all have different tolerance levels to pain. It didn't hurt me but it might hurt you.

And no, the needle isn't thick at all. They are usually done with a 14g or 16g needle.



You can see how big each gauge (size for jewelry/needles) is here: http://tonguestud.com/gauge.html

Of all the piercings I've gotten, the only one that really smarted the the nostril and that was just for a second. I've never had a lip piercing, but have had a monroe, and it really wasn't that bad. And with the lip being and oral piercing, there is a lot of blood flow to the area making is vascular. This means that if cared for properly it should heal within about 3 to 4 months.

I think it REALLY depends on you PERSONALLY, because I heard that nose piercings were so bad that years later they still hurt..

Mine stopped hurting a few hours later..

An Ex BF got his lip pierced and said he hadnt realised it was done, because it was so Painless...

So I really do just think it depends on pain tolerance.

But the nose is the cutest...If I do say so myself.....=)

Getting your lip pierce will hurt the most, keeping in mind that the most you feel is a slight pinch, nothing more.  The nose is probably the least painful.  The monroe is somewhere in between.

Well Personally, I don't think piercings hurt at all because it is only a needle going through a part of your body, and it is fast and precise, not slow and enduring like tattoos.

If you have your ears pierced, I think if you get a monroe or snake bites or anywhere near the mouth area, it will probably feel the same. The only places that will probably hurt more are tendons and thats pretty much it.

I got my nape pierced when I was 15 and it was a cinch. I also really don't think it depends on age, it varies upon pain tolerance. To me getting my ears pierced felt the same as getting a surface piercing. So, just find out how much you can handle.

Plus, the thing is, that getting the area pierced isn't most painful, it only becomes painful when it gets infected or when you have high migrating/rejection issues (but rejection/migration won't happen to your face piercings).

One with an O-Ring:

not as much as you think
the piercing doesn't last long and they do it when you lay down so the position is very comfortable, don't be afraid and stressed before, just go for it.

yes, not gonna lie, YES. it hurt for a second but if you touch it, its stings really bad and it could hurt for days. It's a comfy position and they do it when you don't realize it. It's the anxiety when you're jumping off a zipline--thinking you're gonna fall, waiting patiently...but then if someone pushes you off and catches you off guard then it's surprising but it doesn't hurt nearly as bad if you don't realize it. Sorta like shots, too...tell you to look away....DONE.

not at all! im pretty good with the pain of piercings though, but the only thing i felt was a little pinch. the only problem i had with it healing was, since i wore a uniform for highschool, my skirt rubbed up against my piercing quite a bit but it was just irratated and red. i soaked it twice a day with sea salt dissolved in boiling water (wait until its warm, not too hot that it will singe your skin) when i ran out of H2Ocean that i got from the piercer.



but go for it! ive had it for 4 years and i still LOVE it.

all piercings are going to hurt no matter what you get pierced.
depends on your pain tolerance is a big part of it as well. if you have high pain tolerance honestly i wouldn't get it done.... some it hurts a lot, some it hurts a little and some it don't hurt at all, some get red, sore, after pain like period cramps, and some do bleed and then again some don't just depends....

How painful is it to get a tattoo?



im 18 on friday, and ive been wanting to get a tattoo for quite a while now. i just want something on the top of my arm, nothing big. but does it really hurt. like what does it feel like. my brother has 3.



</question>



<additional details>



i think i might get one done, just not on friday. may get a tattoo of my 2 rats at the top of my arm. if i take a good photo of them, and give it to the tattoo artist, do they draw the image then print it out. say the tat was 5cm by 7cm how much would that roughly cost, in pounds please, plus it would be in colour



http://z.hubpages.com/u/261363_f496.jpg
i want something like that, but instead of it being a rose, it would be my 2 rats, with their names underneath them



i dont want it on the back of my shoulder because it will hurt alot there, and i wouldnt get it on my stomach as im not thin.

When I got mine, everyone told me it would be really painful, so I used something called Emla Cream. You put it on an hour before you have your tattoo done, and it numbs the area completely. I hardly felt any pain at all, just a buzzing sensation on my skin. The only pain I felt was when the tattooist went over the edge of where the cream went. Also, yes if you get a design, take it in a couple of days before you want it done, so they can draw it for you.



If you get your rats on yourself, you will probably regret it. Yes, I'm sure you love them but don't forget that a tattoo will last forever. When you get married, if you wear a traditional gown, your tattoo will be able to be seen. When you want to look elegant and beautiful, it won't happen with a tattoo on your arm.
And when you are an old lady, you really won't want that on yourself.
Mine is a symbol from the film Alien V Predator. I really like it, but I knew that I wouldn't want it on show, so I got it at the very base of my stomach, where only my partner would see it. Think about it really carefully first.

Every person has a different pain threshold, some people it hurts, some people barely feel it. The best way to reduce the pain if you are gettgin a tattoo is to just think about other things, try to act like its not happening,

Dont all needles hurt when they pierce your skin? Well imagine that times 5 million! Ok not really. It is pretty painful, but depends where you get it. More fatty places I hear aren't as bad. I got mine on my upper back in the middle. It hurts pretty bad there. My first tattoo. About the size of a medium handprint. It is a butterfly. There was so much outlining! That is painful, but wait until the coloring comes in. That does actually hurt worse than the outline. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but its not fun! Good Luck!

How to wash your FACE?



I never really know how to wash my face.

I am pretty sure I am not supposed to use the same soap I use on my body, as the skin of the face is more sensitive.

I scrape my face with a wash cloth in the shower, but that's it.

I don't have the money for any expensive soaps or cleansing products.

i have the same problem with blackheads. they are gross. i used proactive for about 2 years and now i stopped. all it was doing was maintaining my acne and not clearing it. i don't recomend it. what i found worked ok on blackheads was the clean and clear blackhead scrub (or something like that) and then i always use the st. ives hydroxy masque and it works amazing. it leaves my skin really soft so that when i use products that dry out my skin i don't have dry skin.

It depends on your skin type. But based on facts, it should because it has salicylic acid which specifically targets blackheads.

Retinoic acid likewise works on bleackheads.

Have you tried chemical peeling before? Before using proactive, you can try glycolic peeling or any chemical peeling available on your area to strip off your blackheads and uneven skin tone.

I've known a few people who have and they were fine. Some of them did look pretty bad though. You can't tell when you stop growing at that age since you can start and stop but it doesn't really matter anyway, if needed you can take it out, let it heal then get it done again when older.

Wow, 13? Thats kind of early. I'd wait until 15 or 16 to get something like that done. Belly peircings on girls that young may look kind of skanky. If you do decide to go for it, be ready to take some harsh criticsm from your friends parents, and some kids at your school.

I had my belly button pierced when i had just turned 12. My dad would never have let me have it done but i told my mum that everyone was getting it done and i would be like a freak if i didn't! This of course was a lie, but a lot of the popular girls in school were having it done and i thought it looked really pretty. One of my friends, the same ago as me had had hers done a few months before and had recommended a good piercing shop to go to, where her mum had had a number of piercings done before. My mum wasn't willing to let me have it done at first. No one else in my family has ever had anything except their ears pierced so it was quite outrageous! In the end my mum gave in as she said that i had the figure to show it off which i might not always have. She suggested we go to the piercing shop recommended by my friend but a friend of my mum's said that she knew a better place, so we went there. The place we went to was a tattoo shop so in hindsight they were not specialists in piercings. The women that did the piercing put numbing spray on my belly button which had no affect. She then tried to pierce the belly button far too high up. She then realised it was too high up and so pierced it again, this also was too high up. The women then tried a further 5 times, all in a too high place before admitting she could not pierce it. She refunded our money and we went straight to the first recommended piercing shop to seek advise on how to stop an infection developing from the 7 holes in my stomach! The shop owner cleaned up the 'wounds' and gave me instructions on how to help it heal. He told me if i wanted to have my belly button re-pierced properly he would do it for me after the holes had healed.
We hadn't told my dad that i was getting my belly button pierced so you can image how much we weren't looking forward to telling him i'd had it done and it had gone wrong!!
At christmas that year both my parents came with me to the first recommended piercing shop where they put tons on numbing spray on my belly button then pierced it. It healed quickly and well.
Now 4 years on i still have the scars from the first place but i don't regret getting my belly button pierced. I just regret not trusting my friend! Since then i have had a couple of other piercings done and have gone to the shop that did my proper piercing. Though a year or so after my experience with the tattoo/piercing shop, two friends of mine went to that same place (even though i recommended that they didn't) and got their belly buttons pierced and both became infected. One had to take hers out after two years of infections and the other is still getting infections in hers now.
I don't want to discourage people to get their belly buttons pierced, i just think that you should check that it is a decent piercing shop you are going to before you let them at your skin with a needle! Because i now have a very irrational fear of needles and blood because of this experience!

i was nervous getting it done then once i got there and got it over and done with i was fine....and now 6 yrs on i love it....i love changing the belly button bar to all the new colourful ones and cool things....
a bit of advice dont wear big kinda like diamond ones with things hanging out of them it gets caught in your shirt :)
so plain ones and then when your wearing something that it wont get caught in than you can wear the fab ones ;) 
theres so many belly button bars to choose from :)
good luck and dont be worried about what your friends and family think if your mum lets you get it done that's great than.....x one or two of your family members might not approve but sure your mum let you get it done....

Wheat germ oil did it for me when I had a dog bite on my face, I got a small bottle of it from boots and massaged it in every night for about 2/3 months did the job a treat. I was very surprised to not have any permanent scarring. I think the oil was helpful but most important was the daily massaging because it keeps the scar from developing or something along that lines. 
The only thing is that it is VERY thick & oily so try not to let it settle round the outside of the bottom of your nose because it will probably cause blackheads. Always use it at night and thoroughly clean your face with oily skin facial cleaner in the morning.
Hope this helps.

There's no way to get rid of scars 100% but putting sun-screen on them will make sure they don't get darker. Some creams and especially scar sheets will get rid of them, but it takes like 8-weeks.
I have no patients for something like that :P. I just use a little bit of make-up and try not to be self conscious about it.



I used this website awhile ago to try to get rid of my surgery scars

I wouldn't use it on your face because it is in fact mainly oil. Using this is going to clog up your pores there for give you spot or even make you brake out. It's great for your body as it smooths out rough edges (like elbows, knees ect) and as I'm sure you've read that it can minimize the appearance of scars and stretch marks. For your face go back to using your usual moisturizer but not too much at first to try and get rid of the excess oil. Also for your spots dab some tee-tree oil or toothpaste before you go to sleep to try and cool them down and try not to rub them too much either.

Hope this helped!

People told me a few things about that bio oil and i tried it but i found it to be very oily, it sits on your skin and doesn't absorbe even if you use very little and i found that it gives me spots, i think it clogs up your pours. Try Vitiman E cream, i find it excellent for spots and you can use it as a moisturiser and put it on before you put on your make up.

It can be used on the face, but if its causing spots then i'd stop using it because you might be doing more damage. Maybe just use it on you problem areas and see if that helps.

I've never used Bio-Oil myself but i've heard it is for stretch marks and scarring, so i'm not sure if you should be using it on your face but more areas like thighs etc.  Try using something lighter on your face, i've used simple light moisturiser and also Nivea light, both are good especially as a base for make-up.  If your getting spots you definitely should stop using it.

There are 3 types of oil.

Petroleum 
Plant based oil
Animal based oil

ALL oil boils down to these THREE types of oil.

And yes, that does include Bio-Oil.

Bio-Oil is oil...



It doesn't matter if you smear your face with duck fat or if you smear your face with vitamin e oil... The ONLY difference is the impurities in the oil base. THAT is what determines if it will cause spots or not.

Baby oil is nothing but Mineral Oil... the same stuff you use on furniture and on your cutting boards...



NORMAL moisturizers are EXACTLY THE SAME as your "Bio-Oil" the only difference is the origin of the oil, how it is processed, and what is added to it to help prevent spots.

I have had the same problem as you. It's great for stretch marks and softening you skin but it is much too oily for your face - I have switched to a lightweight moisturiser and my face is much better now. But my breakout is still clearing up - slowly but surely.
So no - you shouldn't use bio-oil instead of a moisturiser.

You can use bio-oil on your face.

Spots are fairly normal when you use a new product on your face.  Whenever you use a new product your skin needs time to get used to it and adapt to it.  Unless you have a severe reaction you should use a product for at least two weeks before deciding if it's for you as your skin will have got over it initial "shock" at the product by that time and got rid of most of the effects of previous products.

Chances are you have never used an oil based product on your face so your skin won't be used to it.

If you have oily skin adding oil will actually reduce the amount of oil your skin produces so you end up with a less oily skin!  In you have dry skin it will obviously reduce the dryness.

Use a tiny, tiny amount in the morning only. You don't need to moisturise at night.  Night time is when the skin repairs itself and the last thing it needs is more gunk.  If you need moisturisors at night your cleanser is too harsh.

Try applying it to slightly damp skin.

Your skin will settle down and then you can make a decision to carry on using it or not.

apply proactive or benzoyl peroxide2.5 its very effective for acne and pimples…
drink 8-10 glasses of water
Crush mint leaves to extract the juices. Apply the juice to your face every night. This acne home remedy also the tooth paste works too. To remove the redness apply the eye drops which reduces the redness I think its called Visine it instantly removes the redness.
apply ice to your face regularly it closes the pores so that would definitely reduce the acne breakout

The cause for pimples are many and not only adolescence as
popularly believed. Chronic constipation is one major cause,
the food we eat plays a very important role. You will have
to cut down the fried food, chocolates, cheese and aerated
drinks. Eat a lot of fresh fruits and green vegetables with
a lot of water. Instead of washing the face with soap, use
orange peel powder. Dry Orange peels in the shade for 4-5
days. Powder finely and store. Wash your face with this 2-3
times a day. It clears the face and feels very refreshing.

Can't decide on the best location for my tattoo



Ok, let me start by saying i'm 30 years old, i've put lots and lots of thought into it, i gave myself a cooling off period to see if i still wanted it and there is meaning behind the tattoo, so i don't need your answer if its going to be "don't have it" or anything along those lines!!
Right, now onto my question. The design i've chosen or designed i should say, is of a heart made out of a rose and its stem with wings. Its meant to represent my mum who passed away. Because of the details it will have to be around 15-20 cm wide. i just cant think of where to put it, i though the base of my back as i cant think of anywhere else it would look nice. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
P.S It is my first tattoo, but i'm not bothered about the most of least painful place to have it, as i'm still going to have it done regardless.

Hey

I quite like tattoos on the base of the back, but they are known as tramp stamps, so maybe not good to have it there, considering the nature of your tattoo!

Definitely not the arm - to be honest, when people have hearts done on their arms they look like pirates, because that's what they stereotypically have!

I would say the back of your neck. Subtle, but means something to you.

Lets just start by saying in 41 and I have 21 tattoos..I think the base of the back is not right for a memorial tattoo..most people call those tattoos tramp stamps or butt hats and mostly they are larger with some triangular pattern..In my opinion the best place for a memorial tat is on the back side of the shoulder and most of the time thats where i see them on women

i love tattoos and all body art... but i think some places are oober tacky and trashy.

although the lower back tattoo has a rep for being a 'tramp stamp' i think they look really good. anything in the middle of  your back looks good. to the side of your back looks tacky, [shoulder blades] the back of neck tattoos are also another favorite of mine, or the inside of rists, or the top of your foot.

no arm, leg, stomach, or big tacky ankle tattoos.

body art used to be my job, so i've seen a LOAD of bad tattoos, and bad tattoo spots.

Very nice.
I would consider putting it right over your heart. 
The other place that I think would be beautiful and where you can see it when you want to is on the inside forearm of the hand that you use the most (left handed, right handed)
If you chose the later, I would try it kind of wrapping around at an angle, rather than just straight up and down with the arm.
I think that you need it to be personal and where you can see it easily.
Don't make your decisions based on what you think anyone else will think. When people ask, tell them it is so you can always have your mother with you. (that also stops any objections or criticisms.)

Also, pick an experienced (at least 10 yrs.) artist - well established. Make sure that you like his/her portfolio (not the subjects as much as shadings, and line, and delicacies) Know that a tattoo is different from a drawing on white paper. When you approve the artists translation of your drawing, you need to trust and open yourself to a change in the piece. It becomes different with your skin color, and your muscles, and flesh moving around. By the time it heals you will be completely fascinated and in love with it! It will come from your drawing but will almost have a life of it's own and then merge with yours!



Good luck!

Either the shoulder or the lower centre of back as both of them are not completely obvious places but can be showed of a little depending on what type of top you're wearing.
Personally, i would go for the it being in the centre of lower back, as (because 15-20cm is not too large) its a delicate place to have it and can be discretely shown or hidden.

Good Luck! :P

I was going to get them and ended up going with venombites instead because I was afraid snakebites would make me look like a man xP

Tongue paralysis has never been reported as a complication of oral body art, but there are other documented side effects to consider. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), tongue piercing typically causes:



* pain



* inflammation



* infection



* greater saliva production



Less common side effects include:



* injury or shrinkage of gums



* damage to teeth, fillings, and other dental work



* difficulty chewing or swallowing



* prolonged blood loss immediately after procedure



* possibility of disease transmission, such as hepatitis



No systematic research has been done on the after effects of tongue art, so it's impossible to say how likely it is that any one person will experience any of these problems. However, the ADA officially does not support piercing in or around the mouth because of the potential for serious side effects.

If you do decide to get your tongue adorned, considering that body art studios are unregulated by most states, check them out carefully, paying particular attention to the following safer piercing guidelines:



* the business is licensed and established, with separate clean, tidy, and well lit rooms for procedures



* trained and experienced piercers use new gloves and a fresh disposable needle for each procedure (never go to a place that uses piercing guns — they are more difficult to clean and inflict greater tissue damage)



* an autoclave and ultrasonic cleanser for sterilizing instruments are on the premises



* all of your questions and concerns are answered openly and directly. If you're unsatisfied or uncomfortable with the answers, or can't get them at all, go somewhere else.



Tongues are typically pierced by running a needle through the front third of the tongue, from top to bottom (taking care to avoid the blood vessels on the underside of the tongue), usually without an anesthetic. A barbell shaped piece of jewelry is then inserted through the hole created by the needle. The jewelry, which is longer than usual to accommodate swelling, must be made of one of the following materials:



* surgical stainless steel



* titanium



* 14- or 18-karat solid gold



* niobium



Aftercare for the 4 - 6 weeks it usually takes tongue piercings to heal is complicated. Key aspects include:



* cleansing the mouth at least a dozen times a day with a diluted mouthwash for one minute, including always rinsing after eating, smoking, and drinking. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide and mouthwashes that are high in alcohol.



* washing hands before touching the piercing (contacting it as little as possible, too)



* sticking to a soft foods diet for the first week after the procedure



* not having any kind of oral sex activity and open mouth kissing for 4 - 6 weeks



* not applying any antibiotics to the site because the ointments, creams, or gels are hard to remove from piercings, which could cause microorganisms to become trapped within them. Instead, a liquid antiseptic oral cleanser used twice a day, on both sides of the piercing, for about a couple of weeks is often recommended.



* sucking on some ice or drinking ice water, which can help with the swelling



* using a warm, low sea salt concentration solution to soak piercings



* going to a health care provider immediately if there's:



o abnormal or unusual appearance features, such as redness or inflammation that go beyond a quarter-of-an-inch circumference from the piercing



o thick fluid oozing from the site that's yellow-green in color



o extensive bleeding



o a feeling of heat or red streaks radiating from the site



o persistent or increased tenderness, discomfort, or pain



If you remove jewelry from a piercing before it is completely healed, or when it is infected, it will close up rapidly, and more often than not result in negligible scarring. In cases of infection, it's better not to remove the barbell in order to encourage proper healing and minimize potential for problems. Piercings that are older or larger in size will get smaller, but probably will not close completely even when jewelry is left out. In these instances, scar tissue inside piercings may develop, which may look like a small indentation and feel like a bump in the skin. With time, these scars often become more supple and decrease in size.

Has anyone used a fast and effective remedy for removing moles and warts?  I've seen a promising report from a herbal remedy but it's SO expensive! If any of you have had success with a herbal or over-the-counter preparation, I'd love to hear about it.  Many thanks

Skin tags drop off by themselves after a couple of days if you tie some thread tightly around them and leave them for a few days.

herbal sucks i hada skin tag on my thigh an i pulled it off myself you dont have any nerves in the skin tag so it actually dosent hurt an it wont grow back. if its quiet large tie a string around it it will cut off the circulation to the little bugger and it will fall off. if it s a mole id suggest going to a doctor

either with your GP for he/she to laser them off if you have not got time you can either buy treatment in a chemist or jst buy sum clear nail varnish that works supprisingly.

basically warts live on air so the coating of the nail varnish bloks the air seriously it works my mam used to use it on me when i was a child.

and skin tags all the doctors do is take a long hair wrap it round the tag and it falls off.

You can go to the doctor to see what's available. Skin tags can just be removed by tying some thread tightly around the hangy-on bit, it'll drop off in a couple of days (I was going to do that to one on my neck but chickened out, I'm such a wuss!) I think mole-removal requires seeing the doctor and warts can apparently be frozen off with something like Wartner (saw it on tv, advert is weird).

It doesn't have to be all or nothing.  You can still have a tummy but be predominantly a pear.  Are your legs thinner or thicker?  If they are thicker you are a pear, thinner, apple.  Or there are body types that I think of as "barrel body", just kind of solid from shoulders down, like an athletic build even if you have a little extra padding.  Don't go by the magazines 3 categories of shapes, find what works.  If nothing is vastly out of proportionate to the rest than you don't need to dress to camouflage or blend.  Take tips from whatever issue you have.  Like if you are short waisted, wear a longer top to elongate.  If you have a pouch belly, try a babydoll or a rouched top.  Big hips/butt, A line skirts are best.

Good place in Buckinghamshire/Oxfordshire (maybe Warwickshire) to get a vertical lip piercing done?



Hi,

I’m getting a vertical lip piercing (central) within the next few weeks – I haven’t had a piercing for a while though (three standard lip/labrets previously) and this particular piercing seems to be one that not many places near me have had experience of and I’m not overly keen to be a guinea pig.

I live in Chipping Norton (West Oxon) and I don’t want to go too far a field, for obvious reasons (jewellery change visits and aftercare)… but I’m willing to travel within Oxfordshire/Buckinghamshire (maybe Warwickshire) for the right place. I don't want to go to any old place, as I’ve been butchered by a shoddy body piercer in the past and it wasn’t an enjoyable experience.

If anyone has had a good experience of a vertical labret, can you please let me know details of where you got it done & piercer name, especially if it’s remotely near to where I live?

Thanks!!!

Nope. NOthing. Apart from laser surgery to have it removed. Beats me why you would have tatts in the first place. The wee angel on your ankle may look nice now, but will look pretty ratty when it is hanging over the sides of your shoes when you are 80 ...

don't wear sunscreen on it and lay out in the sun also use an exfoliant when you bathe, all this will help to lighten it more quickly.  But it will lighten on its own over time as well.

If you are stupid enough to have a tattoo, you will have to either live with it, or get the tattoo parlour to try and lighten it up or get it removed (OUCH) Just think before you mutilate your body in future!

You may be able to have part laser removal and them maybe have the parts of the tattoo redone again to tidy it up. You can get white put in to the tattoo also but it depends what effect you want. Tattoos fade naturally in time so many people get them filled back in but this may be what youre after if you want it to appear a bit lighter.

You could also try a little light shading around the outside of the tattoo but you should take it a bit at a time and be careful with this. It would disguise the outline so it will appear less bold.



Its hard for me to say because I dont have a photo of how it looks.

Beauty Question!!! Please Help Me!!!!?



Lol sry for the title, needed to get your attention. I'm a 21 yr old guy and i'm looking to take better care of my skin. I recently got some products (exfoliation body wash, body lotion, hand exfoliator, hand cream, facial cleanser and facial lotion) to take better care of my skin. My question is, is it advisable for me to use a mask (i.e. hydroxy mask, though i hear those are really harsh on the skin)? I would say i have normal skin, not too dry or oily and not really any breaking out. If i should use one, what should I use? Which brand and type etc. I dont care if its "girly" i just want great skin. Also, how do I use it? The only thing is that i dont want to be smelling really girly after all is said and done lol. (if it has a girly smell would i be washing my face afterwards or going to sleep so it doesnt matter anyways?)  Please be specific.  also where can i find the product(s) you suggest?
thanks!

Masks can be useful. But you should only use them once a month otherwise it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun, which wouldn't be good.



The best masks are ones that come in the little packages at your local drugstore ($1- $2 or less).  St. Ives has an amazing product 2-in-1 shower mask/cleanser. very cheap and you can use the mask anytime you go in the shower because it is very gentle. And St. Ives is great on sensitive skin too.

Before you get a mask, you should find out for sure what skin type you have (in source). Some masks are specially made for different types of skin (oily, combo, dry etc.)



DO NOT exfoliate more than twice a week. Its not good for the skin. But you should do it at least once to get rid of dead skin cells that may cause breakouts.



You shouldn't smell girly afterwards =P And the directions are on the back of everything :)

Hope I helped =D

Leave intense moisturizing cream in your shower, and right when you finish showering and dry off, moisturize your knees and the rest of your body. This will make your skin very soft as your skins pores are still freshly open from the shower.

Also, I've heard that for soft feet people put moisturizing lotion on their feet before going to bed and sleep with a sock on. You could try that if you find a long enough sock? Or maybe just a soft cloth to wrap around your knees?

Hope this helped =)

I'm not sure about any long term affects, but I break ALL the "rules" though (popping). I use bar soap on my hands in the morning in the shower and just rub my face for about 15 seconds. And about twice a day - noon, evening - I rinse my face with warm water and dry my face somewhat roughly with a towel. Works for me.

why snakebites are wrong placed? isn't that simple lip piercing?

i find some piercings disturbing, i.e. the ones on a neck or hip, but if someone feels good about having piercings in those places then it's a good thing. i think it all depends on personality and no one should judge others just because he/she wouldn't like to have some piercings.

Actually, scar tissue won't pigment.  If these acne scars you are talking about are actually scar tissue, then they will stand-out worse.  I have a large scar under my right cheek which has almost entirely faded, but when I spend time in the sun and tan my face, it becomes very visible since it won't tan.

I even tried one of  those EURO spray-tan machines before going on a cruise and had the same results.

NO NO NO!



You've gotta wait till they're healed a bit more. I'd say a minimum of 4 weeks.

The metal used to make the earrings from Topman is likely to be something like tin or a poor alloy mixture, this will almost certainly react with your new piercing and most likely cause an infection or a nasty reaction.

It's just not worth it my friend, leave well enough alone.

Wait until it is fully healed. If you take it out now, and try to place a new earring in, it might be hard to make it go all the way through and that will hurt/be uncomfortable. Best to wait a couple more weeks, or at least a few more days.

I wouldn't.  I got my ears pierced years ago and couldn't wait to have different ones put in.  I took them out and a few minutes later tried other ones.  It was like i had to re pierce them. Ugghh, definately not recommended!  My sister had to do it for me and it wasn't very fun for either of us to say the least.

I wouldn't, I changed mine to early and it got infected and my whole face swelled up lol! It's best just to wait for the 6 weeks and look after it properly, otherwise you're probably gonna end up getting it pierced again!

Got my nose pierced yesterday, and i woke up the smorning and the first thing i did was wipe my nose lol. Not good right. Keep accidently touching it and therefore am probably gonna need to clean it three times, when my piercer said to clean it twice. Is it alright to clean it three times a day?

Yeah, 2-3 times a day is what's recommended.  Anything over that amount is probably too much and will impede the healing process.

actually it can..it may seem ok to be cleaning it more than three times a day and while it may not harm all there is a possibility of doing harm, because you can irritate a fresh piercing..that is to say your piercing is fresh..3 times should suffice. also you should really try not to touch the piercing period until they are healed unless you are cleaning them and if you do touch them do so with CLEAN hands. touching a piercing in the process of healing could cause it to become infected from bacteria off of your hands. also playing with it before it is done healing can make the area more painful, prolong the healing time, and ultimately adversely affect the piercing.



i have 14 piercings including: nose, tongue, both nipples[which out of fascination i won't leave alone i.e. touching them] navel, an industrial[which is two piercings, a helix, and 3 lobes on each ear.



people may disagree but hey go ask your piercer they recommend 3 times a day for a reason..also look into some h2ocean..it is great..by the way what are the piercings and how long have you had them that info may better assist others in helpin you

Well, if they are fresh scratches or cuts that are recent, use something like Zinc, Mederma or Neosporin.  They will the reduce the inflammation and possible scar tissue.

If these are scars you have had for a while, you really can't do much except go get laser treatments if you want them removed.

Oxy has alcohol in it and can cause drying and discomfort for most people.

When i used Oxy (Briefly), I had problems with extra dry skin where I used the pads. In a couple of places (mostly my nose) I had some problems with skin peeling.



Try something that is less harsh. Personally, I prefer Witch Hazel, which is natural, and cheap. Neutrogena also has some great products to look into.

Next time you go shopping for acne products, look at the ingredients. Not everything uses alcohol.

yep using over the counter products such as oxy are too harsh on our delicate skin. ive been there with clearasil, clean and clear you name it.. and my skin was dry and flaking :(.



please, buy a mild soap and use it twice a day and you will see that your skin will be glowing, spots will dry up naturally and if you eat right (NO JUNK FOOD) less will come, only a few approaching and on the monthly cycle - we cant stop that, if only :).

:) good luck, i did this a month or so ago and its so much better.

Why does my belly button keep rejecting? Please help.!?



I'm 15 years old and I've had my belly button pierced twice already. The first time I had it done it rejected after about a year, and just recently it just rejected after 4 months. I haven't really done anything wrong, well besides I sometimes cleaned it only once a day instead of twice(which only happened maybe 3 times). Then when I was swimming at my friends pool it, it got hit and kinda started bleeding so i got out, which leads to my next question- Does chlorine in pools(public or not) and hottubs affect wether it will reject or not? I soak it with water and salt 2 times a day. Then after a while the skin bewteen the hole gets really thin and the ring looks like it's just about to fall out so I had to take it out. I want to get it done a third time but people have told me maybe my body just won't accept the piercing. I've had my ears done and no problems but I was just hoping maybe someone can tell me where I went wrong and if I can ever have a successful and healthy belly button piercing. Thanks so much if you answer.

bellybutton piercings are technically a surface piercing, but some people's body's don't reject them. but, a lot of people's body's do reject and the chances are that if it rejects it once, it's going to reject it again and again.

you can keep trying, by piercing underneath the scar tissue to make it harder to grow out but that probably wouldn't be a great idea. i'd say if you've tried then the likelihood of it happening again is very high.



it's not always how you treat or care for the piercing that makes it reject, sometimes your body just can't handle it. that's the thing with surface piercings, you can take care of it the best you can but it will ultimately reject because it's not meant to be there lol

try another piercing maybe?

maybe you should wait a year or two and try it again.
but since you've had it done twice already your body might just be rejecting it.
and donttt use neosporin on it.

Your bellybutton just doesn't want a piece of metal there, so it keeps forcing it out.  It could have a lot to do with your age too.  Wait until you're a couple years older and you're closer to being finished growing so it won't migrate as much.

I've been in pool and hot tubs and never had a problem, but I waited until my piercing was healed until I went in either.

she says that you should clean it 3 times a day dont take it out dont swim in pools unless they are salt water if you do all of this for 6 months it should work if it dosent it could just mean you are allergic!
it sounds like a lot of work but if you really want your belly button pierced it is worth it

Bio Oil is expensive and small. Um, you can't make them permanently go away, but you can reduce and make them fade away to a not-so-noticeable state by shedding pounds. Also, use cocoa butter everyday and don't scratch them if they itch!

Scrubbing with seasalt or coffee is really good. what is also known as a natural stretchmark-lotion is this: take a cheap carrier oil (almond oil, olive oil etc) and add it a pan of boiled coffee, stir, put in a bottle and use twice a day! i also liked Lierac's products for stretchmarks but they were expensive too

Try 'Body Focus' Stretch Mark Improver from the Body Shop.

I've been using it for around 6 weeks now and i've noticed a massive improvement in my skin tone and also in the appearance of the stretch marks. It hasn't made them go completely (nothing can do that sadly) but it has really made them less noticeable and made me feel loads better about them.

It's £16.00 and seems pretty expensive, but it lasts for ages and you don't need lots of it. Here's a link to more info....

Give it a try, and good luck to you xx

I have strech marks on the backs of my thighs,i have been using. Palmers cocoa butter formula. it ranges from £3-5 depending on which product you buy, ive applied it twice a day generally after a bath or shower. And the marks have appeared reduced and faded alot, although they are not yet fully gone.
You can get it form most shops like boots, superdrug etc

It also smells delicious

hope this helps

How do I get rid of dark circles?



I don't smoke, I don't drink coffee or tea. Just water. I've had these dark circles under my eyes all my life (24yrs now), but it seems as I get older people start to comment how tired I look or if I am ok and point out I have dark circles. They are very dark purple in colour and its so upsetting, I have tried all sorts of creams to make them disappear even the cucumber. When I use concealer or a foundation to hide them I look weird (it looks like I've tried too hard to hide them), but also the concealer cracks throughout the day and starts to look awful.
Its knocking my confidence as people keep pointing it out.

Can anyone offer any advice as to what I can do? Or if anyone has used anything which really does work. All the ones I have used have done nothing, and I feel like I am wasting so much money on cosmetics that don't work at all.

Thanks to any advice.

Common Causes of Dark Circles :



* A family history of dark circles, increases the chances to get affected by dark circles.



* The deficiency of vitamin K in the diet, is the main factor of causing dark circles.



* Allergies are often the blame for dark circles.



* Smoking, increases the chances of dark circles.



* Fatigue and lack of sleep, are the main causes of the dark circles.



* Insufficient iron, which causes the anaemia, is also responsible for dark circles.



Home Remedies:



* The dark circles can be treated by some nourishing ingredients such as elastin, collagen and Vitamin E.



* The dark circles can be eradicate by rest and relaxation.



* Dip cotton balls in freeze chilled ice-cube and massage the 15-20 minutes on the eyes.



* Apply a paste of fenugreek mixed in milk on dark circles in the night. Wash off in the morning and watch dark circles vanish for good.



* Eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Iron deficiency can be a cause for dark circles around the eyes.



or try dermatologist recommended Dermalex.

I had the same problem! So i was searching about to try and find something that would help. I tried a few thing from here http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Black-...
Nothing worked miracles straight away but i could start to notice a difference. I also read that puting teabags under your eyes could help so I tried it. About a week later from trying different methods there was a big differnce but I could still notice them but I carried on what I was doing for a few more days until I was completly happy with them. Now I just make sure i just have a good night sleep ;) xx

Dark circles can treated with regular and gentle care.Cover your eyes with cotton soaked in warm milk for 15 minutes everyday to remove the dark circles around your eyes or dip cotton pads into freshly extracted mint juice, flatten them and place them on closed eyelids for 10 to 15 minutes.

This is a bit painful but it works well. Use spot cream (the clear gel stuff from Boots is ok). It will sting a bit but only for about twenty seconds or so, so be ready with a damp cloth if it gets too much and remember to do one eye at a time and keep your eye shut!

3. Smoke and take drugs, you might as well as you have the after effects
4.wear a balaclava
5.Become a Batman Villain

6. Most importantly, dont worry so much about it, thats probably half the reason they are still there

maybe its sleep?
sometimes when i get up i have dark rings too,
and mine don't go away...
in the morning try and waken your eyes up by splashing them with cold water? and don't use cosmetics to cover them up that will/does look awful maybe you should buy a special roll on cream that you use in the morning to remove dark rings from under your eyes, if that dosen't work or you can't find anything go to your doctor? ask your pharmistist and possibly go into a drugstore that sells cosemetics and stuff i'm sure they'll have something.
if not its probably just your genes ):

What I would do is try a light blush to put under your eyes. Put ob your foundation and then VERY lightly put some blush under your eye. If that doesnt work I would try some really light skin color eyeshadow. But, make sure the eye shadow isnt glittery and not easy to point out. You might also want to try ( I am not sure if this will work) Rub some tanning lotion around your face but make sure its light so that you wont look like youve been stuck in a tanning booth for hours and that should cover it up =] I am also pretty sure you could go to a cosmetics store and ask what to put on to cover it up. But, if it costs too much dont buy it. Usually pretty cheap things work well.

I had the same problem. BUT all you need is about two weeks of getting PLENTY of sleep. After that to maintain the look, keep getting at least 8 hours of sleep a night. Trust me that it will work.



If you have trouble sleeping try a new mattress don't drink a lot just before you go to bed (you might wake up to go toilet), also if it's hot sleep in undies or shorts and a t-shirt.

I can't sleep if i wear sock. lol.
everyone is differemt.
Good luck and sweet dreams :)

Well Bella, I think your absolutely beautiful! (no homo) From one female to another I had the same problem like you did. I thought I was ugly because I didn't look like any of my family members either. I'm the shortest out of all of them(no matter what there ages are and I'm the 5th oldest out of 14 cousins and my 2 Lil sis & I'm the oldest) My body shape is different from them, My feet are smaller, I am more curves when their more up and down. But I noticed that because I stand out more people tend to remember me more and look for me or ask about me that have only meet me once. As you grow up you will see changes in your features that you family wish they had. Trust me I know. They tell me all the time. So you have nothing to worry about. In this cause different is always better.

If I were you I'd take those studs out and let them close up. I know that's not what you want to hear, but piercing studs are not good for piercings and neither is being pierced by a gun.  A piercing stud and gun force the skin to move out of the way, jamming the piercing stud into your lobe. Guns are also known not be very sterile. A piercing needle removes a small hole so the jewelery has somewhere to go. Also if you go to a professional piercer to piercer your ears you can ask for hoops which are easier to heal because the infectious puss and whatnot coming from the piercing are transferred down the ring and a lot easier to clean away. 
People that have their ears pierced with a gun are more apt to get infections later down the piercings life, because it is hard for your skin to heal properly back into place.

That ear care solution doesn't really do much. Try cleaning it with 8 ounces of warm distilled or bottled water mixed with 1/4 tsp of sea salt. It's probably an abscess, which is what happened with my cartilage piercing. It's basically just a pus bubble. (Gross, I know). But just try cleaning it with that. And make sure your pearl earrings are either nickel free or 14K gold, or something that isn't supposed to cause reactions. You could be allergic to the type of metal that those earrings are made of.  You'll be okay sweetie.

The lump is probably hard swelling. I suggest washing off the earring you got it pierced with and leaving that in for another 2 weeks. Stop cleaning it with the Claire's after solution, all that is is watered down hydrogen peroxide which causes more damage to open wounds. Try soaking it in a sea salt solution 2-3 times a day for 5-15 minutes (1/8-1/4 tsp non iodized sea salt dissolved in 8 oz distilled or bottled water)

How can i get rid of ingrowing hairs ??



I seem to have them on only one spot (left side of my face, near chin), and always there, nowhere else...it's awful when i shave, and even worse when the beard starts growing... any ideas ?  :(

actually i'm sorry to say but i don;t think there is an easy way to get rid of them---i think the only REAL way to really get rid of them is to have lasic treatment...which isn;t that painful...but it is very effective!.....
although you can buy some cream which can help slow down the growth or appearnace!.....

1] exfoliate every other day with an apricot scrub
2] shave AFTER shower or bath - pores open, hair [ whiskers ] is/are softer
3] use a good extra protection shave gel
4] change razor or blades at least once a week [ guys only - leg hair etc is different ]
5] shave as usual, but finish shaving each area on face, in direction the hairs grow - this really works! [ mustache area - down; etc.]

Any area of your body that you shave can produce in-growing hairs. The best way to stop this is to exfoliate, so the skin doesn't close over the newly cropped hair.



You can use soap and water with an exfoliating sponge, or even purchase some specialised exfoliating facial washes which should help with this problem.

Try some hair removal cream. If that doesn't work, just keep waxing or shaving or whatever you do. I don't think there's an easy way to get rid of them permanently. Just need to have extra pampering time :)

Arbonne has great exfoliators that you should use daily to help prevent ingrown hairs...they also have a men's line that features shave gel, wash, etc. You can check them out and read ingredients, etc on-line at www.arbonne.com. They also offer a 45 day money back guarantee if you aren't happy with the results.
You can place your order securely on-line if you decide to purchase anything, you'll need a consultant ID though. Mine is 17578482 and any questions, just email me at ikea82@aol.com

I'm not sure what size I was but when I was 12/13 I was like a AA or an A cup lol. But when I was 14 I waslike a C and a half lol. So trust me it's completely normal because we all go through a growth spurt. And if worse comes to worst - stuff a few socks in there lol

Oh and I was actually a 6-8 dress size

You can eat anything! I wouldn't drink alcohol for a day or too in case i prevents it from healing but anything else should be fine!



I found when i had mine done i found it quite hard to eat for the first day as  my lip felt all swollen even though it wasn't!



Keep it clean too!!!!

Use green Listerine mouthwash to clean the inside and spray savlon to clean the out side (you can use normal savlon but i found the coldness of the spray was really nice!)

Initially, I was told to eat soft foods for the first couple of days, like soup and pasta which really helps. I was told to avoid spicy foods for a little while, and also dairy for the first week (milk, cheese etc.)

If you don't already know, you should boil 500ml of water and mix in one lid of Original Listerine and leave to cool. Then when you have anything to eat, drink or smoke etc, rinse out with it afterwards. And you should do this for the first 2-3 weeks.

Alcohol is okay, but as long as you regularly rinse out your mouth with the watered down Listerine. Beer shouldn't be drunk in the first week also due to the yeast in it that may give you and infection.

Hope this helps :)

Help..my skin is getting dark..home-remedies for dry-sensitive skin pls..!!?



Hi..

Since a month or so..i had a lot of field work that i have  to stay outdoors(i stay in india,u can imagine how hot it could be..!) and no time to apply sun screen at all..and its like i have to stay there in the sun from 10AM to 4PM though a little break now-n-then..

and now im back to home..but i found that im very much tanned...really very much that i could clearly see the difference between the color of the skin over the head(sections inbetween the hair,when u make the partition) and that of the facial one...

i know that i could go for bleaching..but no..cos mine is dry-sensitive and the pores might clog as well..and most of the time i prefer the homemade products..

please suggest me any homemade remedies to remove tan as far as possible..cos i need to attend the party this weekend..il never forget ur help..
thanq..!! :)

Does getting your belly button pierced really hurt? Please be honest!?



I really want to get it done, but am a bit scared of the pain, how much does it hurt out of a scale of 1-10? And is it best to go to somewhere where they numb it or not? With the after care when cleaning it, do you have to touch it ect cause im more scared of this bit hurting!!?

1 I'm being totally honest I didn't feel a thing. 
When I got it done they used something that freezes your belly and then a clamp. At first it was a bit tender and felt funny when walking but about a month later I could twist mine, people always ask if it hurts when I do it, it doesn't. But you have to clean it or you could get and infection, it just gets puffy sometimes.

I didn't think it hurt at all. It would score about a one maybe two but that is pushing it lol. I would definately suggest getting it numbed and anywhere respectable would numb it. After is probably when it will hurt. Try not to wear clothes that will catch it as it really hurts. Cleaning it isn't so bad. I can't remeber it ever hurting me to be honest except from catching it on clothes.

Noo you don't need to numb it! If you get it pro. done they do it quick and simple.
They put this clamp? on it, and it pinches your skin a little, but it's how they get the needle in to pierce it.
And honestly, I didn't even feel the needle go through when I got mine done.
It felt like something pinched me a very tiny bit. And I didn't think she already did it but she told me it was done.
Then she took it out and put the belly button ring in and it was amazzzzing.
Don't be afraid! It's quick and doesn't hurt.
So on a scale of 1-10 I'd have to say it's a 1.

I'd say about 2-3.  Piercing really isn't as bad as people make out and a belly piercing is the same.  You'll feel a pinch which will only last a few seconds then it's all done!  I've had mine done twice once it was numbed the second time it wasn't and they both felt fine.  Wherever you get it done will give you after care advice which is generally to clean it twice a day using warm salted water,you shouldn't touch it with your hands (to avoid spreading germs) just use cotton wool.

If you're scared get it numbed.  If you're really scared then don't do it at all because you're not ready.  To be honest with you, its not terrible at all to have it pierced.  Just a quick pinch.  The discomfort however is the healing process because the swelling makes the area sore and you're going to have to be careful getting dressed and taking a shower so that you don't bump it.  Yes you do have to touch it when you clean it.  You have to soak it in warm saline solution (the piercer will give you sea salt) and remove any crust carefully with a q-tip and move the barbell up and down a little so that it doesn't get stuck.  If you really want it, the discomfort is negligible.  It sounds to me that you might not be ready for this however.  Not a big deal, just give yourself some time until you are less freaked out.

To be honest, it doesn't really hurt. Maybe a four or five. But it is just uncomfortable more than anything else. Numbing it isnt really necessary. And when cleaning it you can use a q-tip so you dont have to touch it. It will be a little sore after wards for a while, but will ware off soon enough. And they're so cute!! :]]

Good luck! :]

Hello 
I had my belly button pierced last november and I am terrified of needles. It hurts for about a second! They put the clamp on your belly and put a sharp small tube through, and then they put the bar in. 
When they pierce it with the tube, all you feel is the first bit when it goes in, you barley feel in come out the other side. It happens so fast you dont have time to feel pain.
Then they put the bar through the tube (its best not to look because it bleeds a bit) and pull the tube out. This bit just feels a bit strange but not painfull atall. 
On a scale of 1 to 10 the pain is about a 3

All piercings hurt no matter what you get done but some hurt a little more then others like nose, tongue and ect.it just depends on your pain tolerance as well if you have a high pain tolerance honestly i wouldn't get it done! when i went to get ny navel pierced the lady told me to lift up my shirt so she can feel my navel to see if i had it done before she was feeling for a scar tissue and i didn't have one and then she cleaned it and then she put clamps on it and she put a rubber band on the clamps so it wouldn't move and then she told me its going to feel like a little pinch well it did but honestly i didn't feel her putting a needle through my navel and plus i never felt her putting a curved bar bell through my skin! so honestly mine didn't hurt at all and i didn't have no redness, no after pain and no soreness! it felt like i never got it done and i had to check to make sure it was there! as far as i know no body piercers numb i don't think they are aloud to but im not sure and if you do its the worst cause when it wears off i heard it hurts more then if you didn't have it numbed! my body piercer told me when i get a shower to clean it with soap and then push it up and down that way no skin will grow around the ring so i did and its fine i had mine for 2 yrs now! and it takes 6 months to a yr to fully heal and you can change it in 6 months but your body piercer has to change it though!

I got mine done, and the pain is nowhere near what you are expecting. Be warned, the needle is big, but it is over before you know it. In my opinion it hurts less than ear peircing! If there is a pain it lasts for less than a second! And there is no stinging pain after!  It is just shock really, no pain. on a scale, 10 being the highest, pain is about 2!



And for the after care just wash it with soapy water and the less you touch it the quicker it will heal. just clean twice a day, and try not to fiddle or touch it other than then. You could get some anticepting cream aswell if you want. When you clean it just push it up , clean then push it down and clean. And don't worry when it starts pussing, it will do that, it happend to everyone, it is just part of the healing process! it will probable puss for about 6 months! ( it isnt as bad as you think, just when u push it up there will be a little bit of puss Lol)  it takes about a year to heal.



Don't worry they will explain it all to you at the place where you get it done!

Good luck.

It was a 2.
I didn't feel anything until he shoved the jewelry through. This was s ting pain but lasted only a few seconds then went away.

Do not go to a place to numb it isn't worth it as well as can cause complications to the healing.

When cleaning it u will want to wet a q-tip and clean the crusties off so you have to move it some then and then sea salt soak it. No it doesn't hurt when you move it to clean, remember though when touching the piercing to do with with CLEAN hands.

well first of all you should be avoiding things like stress, lack of sleep, sugars, caffeine and alcohol and I think things high in iodine like seafood and dairy. Also greasy things make my face oily and more prone to clogging pores.



In terms of if you already have a zip, I would recommend using aloe vera gel, every night before you go to bed. Rub a small or medium amount on your face (gently massage it in) and this will reduce inflammation and size of the pores - it gives a tightening sensation and clean feeling too. This has worked great for me, and although benzoyl peroxide does work, aloe vera is much less cumbersome and probably less hazardous.



If you have real nasty zip, putting ice on it does work. This kind of varies as I only really tried it once, but one time I had this huge honker that was TERRIBLE and I put some ice (in a plastic bag cover in a clean napkin or paper towel) and rested it on my zip (don't be too aggressive, but still press it against your zit). I had to do this for a while and rotate between ice cubes, but it went down significantly. There was however a small scar leftover, so I would be somewhat careful of that (although there would probably be a scar anyway if it is a large zit).



I also take taurine pills (2 500mg pills per day (on an empty stomach, giving some time before and after eating) and this seems to help some, supposedly helps regulate blood sugar and be good for overall health - although that doesn't mean you can just take the pills and still eat badly.

Sadly even when you have a really regular skincare regimen you will get spots - especially if you have eaten some of the foods that tend to cause them!  (chocolate, fatty food - anything really enjoyable).
Only thing to do is have your emergency kit ready - a good spot stick or gel like clearasil is good although I have found tea tree oil to be just as good and easier to carry around!
When I do get spots I give my face a steam clean - really hot water in the sink then stand with your head in the steam to open the pores, then use your normal face wash and use cold water to close the pores afterwards.
This helps get your skin really clean and stops it making more spots by leaving the pores open.

do not take out your earrings to clean them.

you're not supposed to take out jewelry while the piercing is still healing. taking it out will stress out your piercing and slow down healing.



if you have a bad smell this soon, it could be that the jewelry is low grade, or you could have an infection.



dabbing some antibacterial or antimicrobial soap around the piercing site will help with the smell if its just from the earring. personally, I use provon, which is an antimicrobial soap that can be found at most medical supply stores.

go to a piercer and have them check out your ears. (I mean a real piercer, not a store clerk at some place at the mall)

Nope, it's best just leave them in and swab them with antiseptic, especially if it's a cartilage piercing. You'd be surprised how quick they can close up. You can wash them when you're in the shower with soap if they really are bothering you, it shouldn't sting if you've had them in a couple of weeks.

Take them off,and clean your earrings and your ears with warm water.Put polysporin on your ears,just a little.Put your earrings back on gently turning them a bit every day.This should help.if You can also put a little rubbing alcohol afterwards,in case you still have a little blood or discharge.

Does your mother know you are asking this?  It makes no difference in the end, you have to be loved and love in return via the packaging your given.
I personally think chickens should be loved for their inner beauty not just the breast and legs!!!

It doesnt matter what your Bra size is.
I mean for one thing,
Breasts which are too big can look tacky.
And Breasts which are small can look quite classy.
So dont worry,
And if me like you cause of your Bra size then ditch them.
They seem to care more about your body then your own self!

Try this solution: Dermaline skin whitening cream for dark skin spots.

But remember, birthmarks are beyond skin deep and cannot be totally removed with any skin lightening cream, but can only fade them. How much it could fade the pigmentation will still depend on the nature of your birthmark and type of skin.

There are tattoo places all over Thailand, I couldn't really recommend 1 as I don't have one, but the guys I traveled with all had them done.  I really like Thai writing, but I guess you have to trust that the guy is writing what you want.

But good luck, you'll have a great time in Thailand

Some products do actually work. Some body wraps don't, some do. But that also depends on your body. Sometimes, the body doesn't react to some products. The Sauna Belt for example, i have a friend who uses it and my! She has lost weight and looks great. But still, nothing compares to proper exercise! So get working!

If it's done well - then okay, but I personally would find one "down there" a little distracting if you catch my drift! I like back-pieces on men, especially across the shoulders. Something to emphasise a man's masculinity, the way his body is shaped. Same with women. Work with what you have but be prepared for a few gasps from future partners if you choose to have something done to your intimate areas!!

Depends on the tat and guy who has it. Simple and understated all the way for me. A small tat that draws attention to a nice part of the body such as the shoulder blade or arm can be a real turn on, something that you maybe don't know is there till the clothes come off, like a kinder surprise! A big monster of a thing on a skinny chicken arm is a no no.

As far as your nether regions, are we talking nearby on right on the relevant equipment? I'd like something low on the hip or stomach. But nothing that could be affected by the hydrolics as it were.

A tatoo on your 'down-stairs region' would be HOT...but only if you got the faces of all the members of 90's pop sensation 'Blazin Squad' on it.  Failing that I'd setlle for McFly.



Otherwise, no. Not hot at all.

Not to me or my friends. I'm an Italian aristocrat, and tattoos are so lower class. I thought mainly Hells Angels and such motorcycle gangs wore them in America. My Japanese friend says yakuza wear them in Japan. If one of my lovers had tattoos on his "pene", I'd scream and tell him, "Stronzo, ficcatelo tra i denti." I think tattoos are for gangsters, and I don't date criminals.

Fonts for inner wrist tattoo?



I'm going to be turning 18 soon and I've always wanted my name tattooed on my inner wrist, so I'm going to have it done for my birthday. I was thinking about getting an italic font, but I was wondering if anyone knows any websites that allow you to preview different fonts? Also, I'm unsure about whether to get it facing inward or outward, what do you think?

No sure where you are or what computer programmes  you use, but word in Microsoft office has a drop down list that shows the different fonts. It may be hard to get a sample for them to copy though. It might be worth asking the artist if they have any samples of fonts that they can use, and getting them to sketch it out for you.

Most decent tattoo artists will draw up some sketches of fonts for you and ask for your input. I'm sure you have some idea of what you want - work with the artist and find something you like!

I agree with the DaFont.com suggestion - I am planning a text tattoo and that is the site I am cruising to find the font I want.  I also use 1001 Fonts, which has a pretty decent selection.



I am always confused about people getting their own names tattooed on themselves, though.  I am not trying to poop in your Cheerios or anything but it seems a bit odd.  Why your own name? That is like walking around with a name tag every day, or embroidering every shirt you own with your name.



I try not to judge what other people get, this is just a trend that has always confused me.

I agree with julieisbest - I too fail to see why people tattoo their own name (or worse still; someone elses) on themselves BUT everyone is individual and so don't think I'm having a dig.

Best thing is to go into your chosen tattoo studio - they will have a list of fonts that they can/will tattoo. I have Latin font on my foot and it's a font from the studio because the font I took in wouldn't have looked great in ink. 
Research your studio, there are some dodgy people out there! Look for one that has been established a long time, make sure it's licenced and ask to speak to some of their clients - a good studio won't mind you popping in a few times when they have a regular coming in. Where abouts do you live? If you're in my area I can recommend a great place.

As for where it faces, the only way to decide is to see it. When you've settled on your studio, ask them to put the transfer on one way, then wash it off and put it on the other way so that you can decide. Don't be afraid to speak out - it'll be there for life so if you'd like it a bit further to the left than where the transfer is; tell them!
(The transfer is the outline they use, it's just like pen ink and its so you can decide for definate where your tattoo will go, for example I had made my mind up where my foot tattoo was going until he put the transfer on and I was like "actually....move it down 1cm" - you don'ty know what it will look like so its best to remember that you can wash off and reapply the tranfer, but not the tattoo!

I really rate Clarins products, and they have ranges specifically designed for different age ranges, so you can pick one targetted for your mom's skin.  They can be fairly expensive though.



Do you know what products she normally uses? You could get other products from her favourite range that she wouldn't normally buy for herself - that would be a nice treat.

I live in Canada, so I will name the products I use, and hopefully you can get them in England.

I use St. Ive's Apricot Scrub in the shower in the morning, followed by the Proactiv toner. After that I moisturize with Aveeno Positively Radiant lotion or Aveeno Ultra Calming lotion.



At night I use the Proactiv 3-step program, followed by one of the above Aveeno lotions.



***Basically for healthy skin, you will need any cleanser, toner, exfoliater, and moisturizer/lotion. Following a routine will keep your skin looking great. If you wear makeup, make sure it is labeled non-comedogenic, so it will not clog pores. If you have blakheads, Biore strips work great.

Good luck!

Sudocrem (usually for nappy rash or sumthing)
Its really helpful for reducing the redness of spots...
okay so i dont have perfect skin but sudocrem does help in those 'omg I have a huge spot on the end of my nose and its the school dance tomorrow' kinda moments.
super cheap and lasts for YEARS too! :) xx

1) Wash your face first with warm water, then with soap, wash the soap off with fairly cold water. That opens your pores, cleans them and then closes them. (That was a tip given to me by a Lacoste model) Repeat twice a day, every day.

2) Clean and Clear's gel. Reduces spots in 4 hours and it will make your spots disappear if you use it every 4 hours back to back. This can be found at Tesco's for 3.90 I think. Definitely worth a buy!

It's about your inner-self and outer.

Refer http://epictureperfect.net/clear_skin.ph... here and try the clear skin remedy and also drink fresh juice every morning (2 apples, 2 carrots and 1 orange) Watch you will definately see a difference. Skin will be clear.

Showers, more hygienic because you don't constantly bath in water thats cleaned away your sweat, skin oil etc.

There more relaxing for me and you can adjust the temperature of water to your liking whenever you want.

A bit of information on both:

Shower: Daily use (faster). Easier to wash hair. Easier to rinse off. You waste water. Choose temperature (accurately/at any time).

Bath: More relaxing. Dirt stays. Easier to shave legs. Better for sensitive skin. Occasional use (slower). Temperature adjustment is tough. Save water.

Ok probably a stupid question but here goes!Im getting my nose pierced at the weekend but my skin is really bad, like the skin on my nose is so dry its flaky.Eww i know!But anyway im tring to take better care of it to help this problem but when your nose is pierced does it not be really awkward to clean your face?Like how do you exfoliate your nose without irritating the new piercing?Or put make up on even, it must be hard trying to make it look even without getting it near the piercing?

maybe just try moisturiser at night (only a little, because i used to cake it on, and it made my skin drier!!) to help the skin before you get it pierced

Oddly enough I have this same problem!
I have my nose pierced too. The best thing to do leading upto the weekend is to moisturise as much as possible. When you have the pearcing, use vaseline on your nose to keep it moisturised. When the pearcing heals make sure you continue to moisturise regularly.

you don't even have to lose weight, you're not fat! It annoys me that in this day & age if you don't have a washboard stomach etc you're considered fat. Celebs have a lot to answer for grrrrr. As for the clothes, just wear what you feel comfortable in, have your own style :)

yes it can grow out and not necessarily just because you havent stopped growing, sometimes your body can reject the peircing causing it to 'grow out' , you may be able to have it re pierced but it would depend on if it left any scarring and if so how bad it was

Yes it will, my sister had hers done at 15 (shes 23 now) and she has 2 holes on her navel the holes only close up but never go away completely it doesn't look too pretty. You can get them re-done though the piercer will advise you on how long to leave before getting it redone due to the risks of piercing scar tissue.

I had my belly button pierced when I was 24.  When I was 29 I got pregnant so I took it out about half way through.  My son is 18 months old now and I have never put it back in and the hole is still open.  I'm not sure how much someone's tummy grows though.  I don't think your actual bellybutton grows a lot

i had mine done when i was 13 and its still here now 4 years later, it can grow out though and will leave a scar, you can take it out and get it repierced 
some people are more prone to growing out though, just depends on if your body rejects it

I got my bellybutton pierced when i was 13. Im almost 18 now and mine has grown out a little bit. It moves forward slowly. It probably will leave a little scar. Yes you can just take it out, im not sure about re peircing it, but id say you would have to wait awhile becuase otherwise it will be in the same place as before and will grown out anyway.

Its just off the high street
to get there you have to go in ( i think its above a beauty salon) and walk up quite a few flights of stairs first.

Not sure how much it would cost as i dont have that piercing, maybe around £20-25??

if you have a naturally round face you can't really 'slim it down'. blush on your cheekbones can make your face appear more defined, but you shouldn't change yourself to shut up the bullies. they're obviously idiots.

Well, I don't know what kind of a hair style you have, but as a cosmetologist I would suggest you try parting your hair on the side. It is very flattering for thicker faces & looks great on pretty much anyone! Also try doing your make up differently and playing with new styles!

How old are you?

9-11 : Chill, you will lose face fat eventually

11-15 : You will find face fat reduces gradually so don't worry yet

15-20 : Face fat should have reduced. If it hasn't simple jaw exercises should reduce or try eating healthier

20-30 : Try the above and try losing weight

Over 30 : You gotta live with it, sorry!

The above is assuming you maintain your weight and it is healthy i.e. you aren't overweight.

However,

1) Try jaw exercises
2) Eat healthy
3) Reduce weight / keep fit

haha, i have a really chubby face too! i have since i was.... born, i'm 14 now though (i'm not a chunkster either). but yeah, and my friends at school just started like being all "goochie goochie goo" and grabbing my cheeks. 
it's actually kind of annoying

ANYWAYS! why do you need it to look thinner anyways? can't you just like wait for the chubbiness to wear off, that's what i plan on doing, if it ever does go away, what's wrong with chubby faces?
and tell the people to just bugger off... or you know, just make fun of something about them, haha. that's always fun

To gain a size just by using a cream..mission impossible?



Hi guys!
I don't deny the fact that being skinny I'm pretty much ****-less :-)
What I was wondering tho', was if there are some creams that can help you gain a size or at least to have more tonic breasts!
I usually shop at 'Boots' or 'Super drug' for beauty stuff...do you think I could find anything right there?
Thank you soo much in advance

<answer>



i have the same sorta problem, only im not as skinny ): lol.



when i did some research it turns out that, scientifically, no creams or medicines can make them grow much faster. your breast are made up from fatty pads which can be enhanced by eating lots of high-protein foods like cheese, nuts, white meat and cream.



a friend also told me that if you lose weight, some of the excess weight goes to the fatty pads, making them grow. but you dont wana lose weight if your already skinny *ahem* LUCKY! :)



hope i could help x

DONT take it out, if it's infected it'll close the infection in and it might leave a permanent scar. Clean it very well with a sea salt water solution at least twice a day. Then before you go to bed put a dab of antibiotic ointment on it like polysporin, or any off brand will work too. Just DONT take it out! If it does happen to get worse then you need to go back to where you got it pierced and the piercer will help you.

You need to make sure that you clean your peircing really really well everyday. When i first got  my nose pierced i started getting a small bump by the stud and i just washed it really really well and it went away on its own, but thats not always the case. I would suggest going to the peircing shop and talking to someone there just to be safe.

Take it out for that time. It won't close. That's what I did in school. . Or you can put a see through bristle from a brush in the hole. . A lot of the girls did that when i was in school. . Don't use a black one though. . It makes it look like you have a huge blackhead. . Euw lol

Don't they make studs that are clear? You could get one of those and put it in just for her class...or maybe you could just put some liquid foundation over it right before you walk in.



Also, maybe there are some tiny little bandaids that you could put over it for the two hours?

you shouldn't put oil on your face ever. not even in a moisturizer, as listed in malady standard edition for esthetics's handbooks used in technical colleges...oils are the main irritants that affect the integumentary system (skin). if a product has oil, especially mineral oil in the first 10 ingredients don't use it.

edit: way after marilyn monroes day max factors pan cake was called the best foundation because it was so light and natural. ok? back in the day everyone had perfect appearing skin because the foundation was thick and heavy and covered everything, but was horrible for the skin.

A thin layer of olive oil before bed will help but remember to wash your face well in the morning if you go out in the sun with it on you can get sunburt. It works great alot of lotions and potions at fine retailers contain olive oil the acids in it help your skin absorb  the olive oil.

u can apply a thin layer at night, rather try to take a tsp orally as a salad dressing or saute some veggies with it .I think it works better for a glowing skin not only for ur face but it shines all ur body.and also try a hair massage with olive oil.The results will convince u surely.

olive oil is a good moisturiser - its fats are very alike to those our skin produces itself.

the problem is, it is rich - your skin will look really fatty. if you get spots? I don't know, cannot tell because I don't know your skin type.

another problem is that olive oil does not have sun protection factors - so your skin will get the full dose of UV-A, which is not too good for it.

my recommendation is: 
use olive oil as a kind of intensive care cream before you go to bed about once or twice a week, except you've got really dry skin (then, if you don't react or get spots, you may do it more often).

Oils are used either on their own or with various essential oils added in a wide range of very high end skin treatments - think of Decleor and Clarins face and body oil ranges.

Oils used in facial treatments include hazelnut, apricot kernel, wheatgerm and, of course, olive oil. These natural products have an affinity with your skin in a way that mineral oils never can. The molecule size of natural oils allows them to penetrate the skin much more effectively, either on their own or to deliver other products than a petrochemical product will

Facial oils are good for all kinds of skin conditions, but on their own will generally have limited benefits.

Who would benefit from using just olive oil? Someone with very dry skin or skin that was prone to eczema or sensitivity problems. It wouldn't be useful for a young normal/oily skin.

If you're going to try it, then try one of two ways. One is to take a tiny tiny bit of oil, the amount that would be on three or four fingertips, and smooth lightly onto the face. You could top that with your usual moisturiser. The other is to use it as a moisturising 'face pack' and put a heavier layer of oil on for ten minutes or so before gently blotting off the excess with tissues.

As with all oils, the more natural state it's in the better - so, ideally, look for one that says it's 'cold pressed' .

Nope no creams or lotions whatever work. The only cosmetic change would be implants. Its very COMMON a large percentage of women suffer from uneven breasts. NOBODY IS SYMMETRICAL remember. It can be embarrassing when choosing a bra but a good lingerie shop with a bra fitter will make sure you find a good supporting bra, even use extra padding in one bra to compensate if you feel uncomfortable. If you're still young chances are you could even out a little more.

Everyone has one breast that's larger than the other, some are just more noticeable than others.  Aside from surgery there's nothing you can do to fix it.  If any of those breast creams or pills or whatever worked, then don't you think a lot less people would be getting implants?

If you are a normal human being, then your left breast will ALWAYS be slightly larger than your right breast.

This is natural to every homo sapiens.

If the difference is too large, then you should consult a doctor.

Oh yes, don't take pills without consulting a doctor. You could create new problems rather than solving the existing ones, if at all this is a problem.

Breast pills, creams, serums, etc. dont work. Not sure if your still a teenager, but if you are, then maybe there is a chance your right breast may catch up to the other. Not sure if I helped, but having one breast slightly bigger than the other apparently isnt uncommon.

I have to apologize if you are already going this route, but if you have "virgin ears" and are old enough to make the choice about getting them pierced, do it the right way and go to a tattoo and piercing shop.

If that was already the plan, hooray! Good for you! Disregard my answer.  ^_-

I'm 16 so i know im underage but im still thinking of getting a tribal tattoo on the top of my right arm. My mum really disagrees with the idea but my dad doesnt mind.
What are your views on tattoos, do you think they make people look better and how do you think girls would see me with it?

I love tattoos. They are a part of my life and body. I have meaning behind every bit of ink that goes on me.
But if I'm being honest Tribal tattoos are overdone and aren't really anything special. From my experience not too many people like tribal except those who actually have it.

Overall, I like tattoos, given they are well thought out, nicely done, not cheap.. etc. Some poeple who have tweety and winnie the pooh all over there arms i think look cheap, as do some other tattoos. And some tattoos are just stupid. I don't think tattoos need to have a meaning, I think you can just get them as a piece of permanent artwork. I have 3 tattoos and none of them really mean anything! I also think you shouldn't regret tattoos, as most of them have SOME meaning, even if it just signified what you liked at that time. Though that doesn't mean you should go and get some fad band name. 
I don't think they make people look "better" persay, but it kind of gives you a certain image, and some people just look like they shouldn't have tattoos. "Example: some really nerdy guy getting like a huge tiger on their arm or something appears as though they are getting it to show how cool they are....
Some girls really like tattoos, some girls really hate tattoos. if your getting it to make girls like you more, I think thats a bad idea. More girls who like tattoos will accept a non-tattooed guy, where as a girl who hates tattoos is less likely to accept a tattooed guy. 
Also, some tattoos seem as though they arent really there for any reason other than the person wanted a tattoo. Which is where my little rant about tribal will fall in. Do you have a reason to get tribal? Because most of the time, it looks like its there for no reason. Unless it means something to you. Half of the time it looks really stupid if it's not done right, so make sure you have the exact design you want. Also, if your thinking into getting that EXACT tattoo, I would actually consider getting it BIGGER, so it covers your whole arm (not all the way downl, but so there isn't white around it) and go to a competent artist that can place it so it flows with the curves of your body. I think that looks really out of place. You need to make sure your tattooo flows with your curves, and most people go way too small for their first one which makes it look out of place.

So make sure your doing it for the right reason and not just to look cool or tough or to get girls.

some girls like tattoos, some dont.  so, that being said, DONT get a tattoo if you're doing it to impress women or get girls.  If you're going to get one, get something that's meaningful to you and something that you wont think is stupid in 5, 10 or 50 YEARS.  think long and hard before getting whatever you get because its PERMANENT.

I am going to be honest with you:

1) Get your own tattoo, don't steal someone else's.
2) I think guys with tribals are douches. Tribals are unoriginal (obviously if you're stealing someone's) and are way overrated.

I personally think tattoos are great, but what's the point if they're unoriginal, meaningless, and ugly?

I am 20 years old and a female. I got my first tattoo when I was 19 (few months shy from being 20). I love my tattoo and sometimes forget that I have it. Mine is on the right side of my lower back. I prefer tattoos that can be easily covered by clothing so that you look appropriate for work or when you get married one day. My opinion on your tattoo...if you want it on your arm I think you should have well defined muscles in your arm because that's hot and if you do get it there you better always make sure your arms are toned. Getting a tattoo is a personal decision and you shouldn't allow others to influence your decision. In the end, it's your body.

Well dude, I am 26. I thought for years before I got my first tat... which was a custom tribal with club with a 13 in the middle of it. I like tribal, but i had to make the design have meaning so I did. I think tattoos shouldn't define who you are, but it is you who defines the tattoo. I have 3 tattoos now, I started getting them in august of this year... If you get tattoos, make sure they have meaning... if you want to have them think about if you want them to be covered or not. All that matters is what you think... not what others think.

I love tattoos on guys and most girls. I like big tattoos. I really think you should re think tribal as it is really a joke now in the tattoo community, almost as bad as an armband. But if you think you will like in still in 2-3 years, then get it. You are young so you have time to think over what you like.

Its really up to you wether you want a tattoo or not. If your dad says your allowed that should be fine. 
I want one done too cause my sister has 4 of them and i love them She has a playboy bunny on her ankle. A heart with the names of her sons  on her lower back and stars on the upper. She also has a butterfly on her arm

I like your design and i think if you are a 100% you wanna get it done then go for it.
Good luck and i hope you have the right decision :)

My thoughts on tattoos:  they're great on people over the age of 18 AND mature enough to make the right decision for themselves. 
Of course, in order to be great, it almost always has to be a somewhat original/meaningful idea.  Not something trendy/insanely common.



So, I think it's stupid for you to get a tattoo because:
-you're 16
-you want tribal, which is a tattoo trend that was on its way out a long time ago
-you want to COPY a tribal tattoo.....copying any tattoo is dumb (to me)
-your father appears to be pointing you in the wrong direction in life
-you appear to only want this tattoo to "look better" to girls

I like Tattoo and I like guys with tattoos, but that should not help you make your decision, you have to get a tattoo because you want it, not to attract girls.

As for tribal, many people say you should not get one. Well, if they don't like it THEY should not get one. You should get a tattoo you like. If you like tribal and know you will like it for a long time you should get it. A tattoo will be on your forever so you should not listen to what other thinks of it, you should listen to what you think of it.

People say you should get a tattoo with meaning. But what does meaning means? To me a cartoon character have meaning, to you a tribal tattoo may have meaning and to someone else a quote or flower may have meaning.

Any tattoo you will get should be what you like. Don't worry about what strangers on the internet think of it, worry about what YOU think of it.

When I see a young guy or girl with a tattoo, I see someone who comes from a home where the mom is working day and night to try to make a living and the kids are without any type of supervision. That may not be the case, but that's what I see. the second thing I think is that there will come a day when regret will happen. tattoos are for a life time unless you get them removed which is costly and painful. The third thing I think is that they are probably in a gang. Again this may not be the case but that what I think. I hope you will decide not to tattoo. Your so young to make a decision that will be with you forever.

Your nose is fine, I'd be worried about the fact you cant breathe through one side. Dont try any home surgery and just try to get it looked at somehow.

Hi LOU,
I live in Oz (not jail; all of you North Americans) and we have a system (if you have no private insurance) that is akin to the NHS.  Therefore I would think that the NHS would correct the deviated nasal septum but not the plastic surgery.  The lump would come under the plastic surgery umbrella and you would not be covered for this.  How about ringing the NHS help line up and clarifying this?
If you got an appointment with plastics rather than ENT (ear nose & throat) you may be able to just go to the appointment and ask the plastics Doc about dealing with the lump as well. (sort of pushing the system a bit :) )

The other thing is that the waiting time on the NHS to see a surgeon would take about a year as it would be viewed as non urgent. C'est la vie, alas.
Oh and by the way if you think the lump needs attention then (b)your(/b) feelings are important, not others perception.
Kind regards,
Tshongololo.

It can likely be completely fixed by insurance (i know in canada it is anyways.. don't know about UK), but you pretty much NEED to get that fixed because of the breathing. They should be able to fix anything else you want at the same time.

Sun screen just offers an increase in your natural protection, so SPF8 means you can stay in the sun 8 times longer than normal, if you have standard skin.  Most sunscreens are normally only effective for a couple of hours, so if you were outside all day, without re-applying your cream in the afternoon you would not have had much protection.

If you want to keep your fair skin year round, it's best to invest in a really high factor sun protection (I use factor 50 on my face and 40 everywhere else), and keep re-applying it regularly - every 2-3 hours.

I am quite tanned but I love my colour as it is. I also spend alot of time in the sun but I find after a week or so the colour does seem to fade (it's possible!) LOL If you want to keep your colour, just keep using your sunscreen and try to stop going out in the sun un necessarily.

Hope this helps sweet! =]

The best idea is not to have any at all. Why would you want to label yourself a moron for the rest of your life ? It's a fashion choice that 95% of people grow out of,  and then regret ever having  done. Removal is painful, expensive and leaves a scar.

Tattoos are an artform, a permenant one. You have to find the one that is right for YOU, not just something that other people think "looks cool". It should have some meaning to you.

I need leg shaving tips for razor burn and things from the ladies :D?



Well, I've read the razor burn symptoms and I don't think I have it, I don't get bumps on my skin or weird rashes or anything, its more like the hair follicles widen and get reder or aggravated after shaving, especially on cold days. It's only ever been on my calves, I blame my sensitive skin. I was wondering if you know any Miracle creams to drastically improve the general texture and appearance of my leg skin, to taught-en it, make it softer and give me a better shave .. :P Sound like such a bloke lol! Any help will be appreciated, Thanks guys! :D XX

Yeah, that's razor burn. Or maybe ingrown hairs. But since you say you get it on cold days, I'd say it's razor burn. Because you get goosebumps and then cut them off when you shave. Just moisturize and use shaving cream. Also, wait until the end of your shower to shave your legs. That way, your hair will be softer when you do shave.

Don;t use the cream that supposdly burns off the hair for you. just put lotion on your legs and wait a little while to shave again. and if your legs are really bad you should tell you parents. maybe you might be having a reaction to the blade you used. Best of luck.

A preventitive measure would be to stop shaving altogether.  Try waxing instead.  There are several everyday creams on the market that will give you legs a better feel and look.  Aloe Vera, Coco Butter, etc.  As far as brand names, Biore and Keri always work for me.

make sure your shaving with shaving cream or lotion, never shave bare that cause bumps and irratations quickly, plus they'll give you a closer shave, after you shave make sure you put on some lotion, perferably non scented lotion cause sometimes the scents chemicals can cause irratations too and that should be fine plus the lotion will make your legs soft, make sure your not using a dull blade cause that sometimes causes it and so will a brand new blade, if it bugs you in the cold try going longer between shaves, yea you'll be a little hairer but whose going to tell your wearing pants. hope that helps

And she said that the nose hurts the most; infact, it's "real bloody ******* painful".

I don't know myself, but coming from a pretty hardcore darling like her, that should mean something.

since your Game Over tattoo is pixelated then stick with the idea of a retro game design.

for instance what game did you play most, what brings back happy memories.

Sonic, mario Bros, Tetris, Ultimate Combat (or any other fighting game), Space Invaders.

go to some gaming sites and see if anything jogs your memory.

Gauges are the size

It's best to have a professional piercer start you off with ear stretching. Generally lobe piercings are a 18 gauge, so you can stretch it 16 g or 14. But this is the ONLY time that is acceptable to skip a size.

Gauges can be found in stores like Hot Topic. Ask the sales reps for help on the sizes. I think you might need a 14 or 16 gauge but im not positve. The smaller the number, the bigger the gauge. You need to kind of force the first gauge in, trust me it wont hurt bad. Then you let your ears get used to that size for at least 2 weeks, and you can move up to the next biggest size from there.

You can stretch them yourself; You need tapers & jewelry.  Gauge is size.  People having "gauges" is bad English.  Buy a taper, push it through your ear, then put the jewelry in.  Do this every few weeks until you're at the size you want.

there are specific earrings for stretching ironically they are called stretchers and they look like cones and you push them through as much as you can let them heal and push it through some more until you get to the size you want be careful not to push it through too much cuz then youll rip your ear and start bleeding its best to go to a piercer and get pierced with a 14g or 12g and buy some stretchers that go up to the size you want and get started.... im warning you now though its hard to get em back down so make sure you want them first.... good luck

NO you don't go to a piercer to get them stretched, do it yourself but don't do it the dumb way you'll mess your ears up and they'll bust...no one wants that. i suggest you get silicone gauges up until the one that you want, start with your basic ear piercing and gradually go higher but wait for them each to heal or you'll be looking at weird octopus ears

Either you can get them pierced normally (with a needle not a gun), let them heal and stretch them yourself or you can go to a piercer who uses dermal punches.
These is like a razor sharp apple corer and will cut the size you want out of your ear.
There is no need to go to a piercer to have them stretched, you can buy the right equipment from piercing shops (online and offline).
Just make sure you use a lot of lubrication (KY works well) and take your time.
Always listen to your body so you don't rip or damage your ear.

When someone refers to the size of a piercing, they refer to the "gauge" of the jewelry worn in it.  It is the same measurement used to measure wire and tubing and pipe and stuff in industrial settings.

If you had your ears pierced with a gun they are probably 20G or 18G.



You don't have to go to a piercer for this sort of thing, just do a lot of research.  I had my ears pierced at 10G when I was 21 - I am 26 now and have since stretched them to 2G.  I did my stretching with spirals.  If you run a search for "stainless steel spiral" you will see what I am talking about.



You will see people talking about tapers when they talk about stretching.  Tapers are lengths of stainless steel that start at the size your ears are currently and gradually increase to the next gauge up.  If you imagine an icicle they are that shape - smaller at the tip and wider at the base!

Spirals are jewelry that are basically circular tapers.  So they start smaller at the tip and coil in to a larger size at the other end.  You can wear them all day and stretch your piercing gradually (if you wear your spirals night and day they will get used to the new size gradually over the course of a few days to a week).  You will want to get the spiral slippery with lube or soap, insert it until your ear feels "hot" and then - after wiping it clean - put on an O-Ring (a little rubber ring that you buy with the jewelry) to keep it in place.  After a few days your piercing will be a bit looser, you can then scoot the spiral in just a bit farther and move the O-Ring up.  Stretching must be done slowly (one gauge at a time) with time to heal (about a month at each gauge) and very very carefully.  If you stretch too fast you can tear your ears or end up with disfigured piercings (google image search "piercing blowout" to see what I mean).

If you don't know anything about stretching, check out the link below.  This is just a search I ran on "about ear stretching".  The first five links will probably give you a lot of great info (not including the video, I cannot see that so I don't know what they are showing!).  BME is a great repository of information on this sort of thing.  But when in doubt, don't hesitate to go and see a piercer.  If you want a price quote, give some area shops a call and ask for a quote on ear stretching.  Make sure to ask if the quote includes jewlery if they don't specifiy!

Good luck!

I'll assume you have a standard piercing in your ear right now (about 16 or 18 gauge ring).  Starting at a 14 is ideal.

You do no need a piercer to stretch your ears.  But if you don't go to a piercer, make sure that you don't skip sizes.  It's not in your best interest to, as this may cause tearing.  And make sure you are getting the right size, some places may have the jewelry labeled wrong (has happened to me).  Before you continue to the next size you're going to want to wait for the newly stretched hole to heal.  And remember to keep the hole and jewelry clean.  Stretching before the hole is healed can also cause tearing.  Tearing will result in scar tissue which will make it harder and painful to stretch.

Now for my personal advice on buying the jewelry:  Acrylic is the cheapest, but also worst jewelry for your ears.  The best is bone or organic jewelry for stretch ears.  HOWEVER, just for the sake of keeping it cheap in getting to where you are going, stick with acrylic jewelry.  For example, I wanted my ears at a 0 gauge, so I bought only acrylic jewelry until I got to size 0.  Now I have glass plugs in.  There's no point in spending a ton of money on jewelry if you aren't going to be wearing that size for long.

I can't speak for all piercers, but mine does not charge for stretching if you provide the jewelry.  You would have to talk with the piercer you have in mind, if you choose to have them stretch it for you.  They do it quick, so it might feel like getting your ears pierced.  When you stretch the holes yourself, obviously, you can push them in at your own pace, which may in the end save you some of the pain.



*** I urge you not to buy jewelry from Hot Topic.  Their sizes are always off.  Every time I have ever bought from there, the size was always bigger than what it says.  The only thing I will buy from them is belly button rings.

gauge refers to the millimetres the hole is in your ear, mine are at a 0gauge which is around 8mm, from a normal piercing you buy tapers in 1mm differenced and gradually work your way up buy forcing them though the piercing (it stings but only a little) each stretch needs a weeks healing time but ive stretched everyday before and returned to normal piercings and then stretched again.
after 10mm its difficult to return to a normal peircing but it does happen.
you can buy and stretch your ears yourself without any help

DON'T listen to the people on here asking why you want to do it and telling you not to.  Do what you want...I can't stand people like that.
With that being said...you have some good answers on here.  I'm up to 9/16".  I won't repeat what everyone else told you but I will tell you, when you start stretching...GO SLOW!  One of my lobes has scar tissue (not too noticeable) and it's hard for me to stretch it much further.  Use a taper when necessary (a long one or spiral)...it is good to go gradual which is what a taper will allow you to do instead of just shoving something in there.  You don't need to go to a piercer unless you feel more comfortable doing it that way.  Basically, do what makes you feel better...go slow...keep them clean...and Good Luck!

I'm sorry to say that theres a chance that the scar will be there, like any other scar when you get a cut or pick a scab. But also with those scars it starts to fade over time and the same thing should happen to your belly piercing scar. Though it probably won't go away completely, you can also try buying some scar fading cream to quicken the process. But its a chance we all take with piercing, scars! I have my nose piercing and I know its going to leave a big ugly dark scar, because I can see it forming under my ring already, but its a risk I took and I might as well stick by it scar or no scar =/

How to get rid of spots on forehead?



I recently have noticed very small, faint spots on my forehead where my side fringe is. there not like proper spots there just lyk small little bumps on my skin and they're not noticable but i'm afraid if I don't do something it could develop into something.
