How can you get pure (Lab Standard) Ammonia, from House-Hold Ammonia?



Another part of the school project requires a little more skill, I need to get pure-ish Ammonia to help produce Ammonium Hydroxide (or Ammonia in water) from an ammonia cleaner. Help =[

No.  And its dangerous.  Ammonia is a toxic corrosive gas.  And ammonium hydroxide is a highly corrosive base.



You wouldn't get high purity anyway so don't even try it.  Reagent grade ammonium hydroxide can't be produced in your kitchen.

Sounds more like you are up to no good.  No teacher would assign something that dangerous and stupid.

LD, read more carefully.  This kid is looking for a source of reagent grade ammonium hydroxide.  Process will be done in his kitchen.  Read the previous question in his profile.  My bet is that this is not for school but some illicit procedure found on the web.  Producing ammonia gas in your kitchen IS DANGEROUS.  What school chemistry lab would not have ammonium hydroxide or send a kid looking for it on his own.  Don't be naive.

You have a school project and so I presume any dangers to you have been explained. On this basis I should just explain that a standard method of determining Ammonia content is to add sodium hydroxide so that the reaction is that NH3(gas) is driven from the ammonium salt(or hydroxide:a REPLACEMENT REACTION).If you are trying to determine the concentration of ammonia base then you use a known quantity of the NaOH(in excess),boil the mixture in a fume cupboard to drive off the freed ammonia,then titrate the NaOH solution.So what you need to do is to add excess NaOH to you ammonia source in a flask and heat:you should collect the evolved ammonia (probably by passing it into ice- cold water to make an ammonium hydroxide solution).It is not too difficult to liquify the ammonia gas but I really think that might present to much danger to you.Good Luck!P.S Dont get too scared by all that danger nonsense,ammonia gas is the effective ingedient in old fashioned smelling salts,BUT you will find that a hooter or peeper full will be uncomfortable and thats about as bad as it gets; unless you are a real nutter!

2. This whole question doesn't really make any sense. There must be more info. 
3. When asking a question just one question mark will suffice.

not really
if one parent has brown eyes and one has blue, the child will have brown eyes.
if both parents have brown eyes the child will have brown eyes and if both parents have blue eyes the child will have blue eyes.
brown is the dominant gene so if 1 parent has brown eyes then so wil the child

no, although it is likly that if both parents have brown eyes then the child would have brown eyes and same goes for both blue and so on. it is also poss for a child to have compleetly differnt colour eys thn both parents, it also depends on the grand parents eye colour ect ect. but when a baby is first born the eye colour they have may change form what it first was

how do mean? if your kid doesn't have the same colour eyes as you then their not yours?

no basically its a mix between the mother and father like hair colour the dominant jean will come out. if both the mother and father have the jean for blue eyes then it's likely the child will have blue eyes.

I have blue eyes and neither of my parents do they have brown and green and my sister has green.

Chemistry. hydrates



?



calcium sulfate hydrate, CaSO4 x XH2o, contains 20.93% water. calculate x for the hydrate. explain steps please



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



OMG YOU HAVE THE SAME AVATAR AS ME!

Anyways first things first.

Since water is 20.93%, calcium sulfate would be 79.07%

So

Molecular mass of calcium sulfate = 40 + 32 + 16 X 4
= 136

79.07% = 136
20.93% = 35.99949412

Since 35.99949412 is the mass of the water in the hydrated salt

Molecular mass of water = 18

35.99949412 / 18 = 1.999971896
= 2

X = 2

Hope you have had all your queries cleared.

Cheers same avatar dude!

Work out moles of NaOH in 45.84 mL of 0.245M solution

Molarity = moles / Litres
therefore moles = molarity x litres
moles NaOH = 0.245 M x 0.04584 L
= 0.01123 moles of NaOH

Equation tells you that 1 mole of NaH2PO4 is required to react with every 2 moles of NaOH.

So the moles of NaH2PO4 required to react with 0.01123 moles of NaOH
= 1/2 x 0.01123 moles 
= 0.005615 moles of NaH2PO4

Now convert moles of NaH2PO4 to mass
moles = mass / molar mass
therefore mass = moles x molar mass
molar mass NaH2PO4 = 22.99 + (2x 1.008) + 30.97 + (4 x 16.00) = 120.0 g/mol
moles NaH2PO4 = 0.005615 mol x 120.0 g/mol
= 0.674 g

Cant figure out Percentage yield!!?



8.9g butanol reacted with 6.0g acetic acid. mass of resultant butyl acetate = 9.8g. what is the % yield? :S



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



1) write balanced equation
2) convert mass reactants to moles reactants
3) determine limiting reagent
4) convert moles limiting reagent to moles product
5) convert moles product to mass product.  this is theoretical mass
6) % yield = actual mass / theoretical mass x 100%

1 C4H9OH + 1 CH3CO2H ----&gt; 1 CH3CO2-C4H9 + 1 H2O
**********
mw C4H9OH = 74.1 g/mole
mw CH3CO2H = 60.1 g/mole

moles C4H9OH = 8.9 g x (1 mole / 74.1 g) = 0.120 mole
moles CH3CO2H = 6.0 g x (1mole / 60.1g) = 0.100 mole
**********
from balanced equation, 1 mole butanol reacts with 1 mole acetic acid
since we have 0.1 mole acetic acid and 0.12 mole butanol, we have excess butanol.  acetic acid is limiting
**********
from balanced equation, 1 mole CH3CO2H ----&gt; 1 mole CH3CO2C4H9
so 0.100 mole CH3CO2H ----&gt; 0.100 mole CH3CO2C4H9
**********
mw CH3CO2C4H9 = 116.2 g/mole
moles = mass/ mw
mass = moles x mw = 0.100 mole x 116.2 g/mole = 11.6 g
**********
% yield = 9.8 g / 11.6 g x 100% = 84%.

The density of air under standard conditions is only 1.239 milligrams per cubic centimeter.
An air bubble adheres to the surface of the solid when it is submerged in the water  will give you the wrong density of solid which is much, much higher.

L x ( g / L) = g...

grams / L is density...



does that help?

*******
only use density of water if your trying to convert L water to grams water...

it depends... if you have X litres of water and you want to conver it to grams you can use water's density. 
if you want to conver anything from litres to grams or viceverse you will need its dencity... the dencity changes for every compound so you cant use water's density for everything

density = m/v if u have 1 litre and u want to conver it...it is:
(density of the water at 4ºCelcius = 1gram/ml) [ml=cc=cm3]
D =m/v
m=d * v  -&gt;  m= 1g/ml * 1 L



-----&gt; 1g/ml * 1000ml



m=



1000gram

if you want to convert 1 liter of HCL to grams u cant simply multiply by 1000 cos the density changes.
the HCL density is 1,18 g/cm3 it is :
m=d *v 
m= 1.18 g/ml



*



1Litre



-----&gt;



1.18g/ml  *  1000ml
m=1180grams

etc etc.. you will need the density

The way you have posed your question, there is no conversion.  Grams are units of mass.  Liters are units of volume.  If you know the density of the matter then you can use that to calculate grams from liters.  Density equals mass divided by volume.



d = m/v

so



m = dv

Density is not often expressed as grams per liter.  More often it is given as kilograms per liter or grams/milliliter.  The numerical value would be the same as there are 1000 grams in a kilogram and 1000 milliliters in a liter.  If this is the case then the formula would result in kilograms so to get grams, multiply by 1000.

You can't without knowing the density of what you're converting. Litres are a measure of volume, grams are a measure of weight.

1 litre of water weighs 1000 grams (1 kilogram) because the density is 1 gram per cc, but a litre of concrete will weigh much more.

Yes. Diet Coke is the choice among carbonated drinks because it has high concentrations of carbonated water, one of the highest of soda's... It's the cabonated water that causes the explosion, so that's why in a nut shell.

It can be done with other soft drinks, yes.
Other candies, yes I cannot name them off the top of my head, but none work as well as Mentos.

<answer>



check the ingredients:

It must be diet soda. It is believed that the chemicals that provide the sweetness affect the reaction. The general roughness of the mint is believed to seed the bubbling process.



The reason this happens is due to a chemical process called nucleation. Bubbles of carbon-dioxide nucleate shortly after the pressure is released from a container of carbonated liquid. Nucleation often occurs more easily at a pre-existing interface (heterogeneous nucleation), as happens on boiling french fries or on string used to make rock-candy. So-called mentos-eruption are a dramatic example.



The surface of mentos (not the colored ones) contain thousands of small indentations (nucleation sites). Each indentation allows CO2 to form and be released from the liquid. Because the number of indentations is high, CO2 is released in great quantity and all at once. Aspartame (the sweetener) also plays a role. The colored mentos have a glazing on the surface, which smooths out the indendations, thereby making nucleation difficult.



Regular seltzer or soda water doesn't work because the CO2 already wants to leave the solution and can easily do so. The sweetener in the diet coke holds the CO2 in solution better, which makes for a more violent reaction

half life is the amount of time it takes for the substance to reduce to half  of what its original size therefore, 90 years is 3 half-lives. If 6g remains then 6 x 2 is 12 (once), 12 x 2 = 24 (twice) and 24 x 2 = 48g

You halve the amount of cesium-131every 30 years. So after 30 years, you have half, after 60 years a quarter and after 90 years, an eighth.



Therefore if you have 6g left after 90 years, you started with 8 times that, so 48g........50 is nearest.

Water proof means it can handle pressure - usually up to say 100 meters or so. When you need to repair or change the battery in such a watch they either have the equipment in the store (or more likely have to send it away for pressure testing).



Water resistant more or less just means that they have a rubber ring on the inside and that the screws don't leak water. However if you wear it in the tub it might take in water, but it should be able to handle the occasional splash or rain.

Water Proof: It talks about the internal specification of the product. A Water Proof Watch is the one, whose internal components are such, that Water cannot cause them any harm. They will not get damaged even with the presence of Water.



Water Resistant: An external specification, which says, the product can Resist Water from entering in. This very Resistence sprecification clarifies that once water gets in despite the resistence provided (or due to the resistance getting damaged), then the internal functioning cannot be protected.



A water proof product seem better than Water Resistant ones.

If a stock solution of isotonic NaCl is 0.9%, how much salt is present in 1L of the solution?



For my answer, I divided 0.9 by 100 and then multiplied by one, and this gave me 9x10^-3 NaCl or 0.009L. However that is wrong, the answer is 9g. I am unsure of how to think of this problem in order to generate the answer. Any help?

Mike is right. 0.9% means 0.9% BY MASS, so you use  1,000g rather than 1 L in the calculation.

<asker's comment>



Now it makes perfect sense. I was thinking 0.9% in weight. But at the same time, I don't think it's fair to not be specific and imply something like that. GRRRRR

Stoichiometry weight percentage hydrate problem?



Hi



I'm having a bit of trouble with the steps behind the following problem. I don't expect you to do the work for me, just help me out with the steps involved as I'm having trouble moving ahead with this problem beyond mole calculations. Any help would be greatly appreciated.



A mixture of Fe2(SO4)3 and its hydrate Fe2(SO4)3.9H2O has a mass of 1.6730 g. After heating to drive off all the water, the mass is only 1.5586 g. What is the weight percentage of Fe2(SO4)3.9H2O in the original mixture?



Molar Masses:



Fe2(SO4)3



3.99.88 g/mol; Fe2(SO4)3.9H2O  562.02 g/mol

Calculate the mass of H2O driven off:
1.6730 - 1.5586 = 0.1144 g
0.1144 g H2O / 18.015 g/mol = 0.006350 mol H2O
0.00635 / 9 = 0.0007056 mol Fe2(SO4)3.9H2O
0.0007056 mol x 562.02 g/mol = 0.3965 g
0.3965 / 1.6730 = 0.2370



23.7% Fe2(SO4)3.9H2O

Left side has 2 O's
Right side has 3 Os, 2Hs, 1 C



if right side=left side then the left side is missing one O, 2Hs, and 1 C

Explain compounds please?  Really urgent and important!?



I'm in grade 11 Chemistry but I always get very confused with compounds, equations, etc.  This is pretty urgent.  I'd appreciate ANY help with these things.



- What are simple ionic compounds?



- Roman numerals in the equations (Iron (II) sulphide for example).



How do we figure out we need to put them?  When do I use them?



- Polyatomic compounds?  What are these?  Anything special about them that I need to know?



- Prefixes like mono, di, tri, hepta, etc.  (example: Silicon tetrafluoride)  When do I use them?



- Suffixes like -ate turning to -ic and -ite turning to -ous.  When do you use these?



Sorry for all these questions.
I've just never understood naming compounds and the teacher doesn't seem to want to explain them to me..
If somebody could explain at least one or two of these, I'd be really grateful :]

Simple ionic compounds are things like NaCl or KCl, an Ion + a Cation.



Iron (II) and other roman numerals mean that is the state the element is in. This is used to distinguish the element from its more common state. Elements don't just exist in one state.



polyatomic compounds are poly-atom-ic, poly means many, poly+atom = many atoms, something like NaCO3 for example.



Those prefixes, mono, di, tri, but, pent, hex, hept, octa, deca, etc. mean 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 in that order.



-suffixes are difficult and many of them are specific and need memorization. "-ides" are simple, monoatomic, negative ions, though. An example is NaCl or NaOH

Here's a rule of thumb:
Acids burn stuff.



Any acid will burn skin but not all will do it quickly of noticeably. i don't know why you want to know and it sound pretty bad. The word 'target' is worrying....
If you want an acid to act fast it needs to be concentrated and relatively strong.

Francium is the most unstable of the first 101 elements, the longest lived isotope, Fr223 has a half life of only 22 minutes.



There is, at most, about 20 to 30 grams of Francium in the earth's crust at any one time.



NO weighable quantity of Francium has ever been prepared or isolated.

lol, r u in wwp north in susca's bio hns class, if ur not then don't kill me  and ignore the comment
and ways on with it



1)  because the atoms in a water molecule are covalently bonded, they have polarities, where oxygen is negative, and hydrogen is positive



Note: if you ever shared somthing, you know its hard to split somthing evenly, in this case, it is hard to spilit the electron evenly between the oxygen and hydrogen atom. In this case the oxygen is a the 'electron hogger' making the oxygen atom a negative charge, and because the oxygen is a 'electron hogger' the hydrogen wants more electrons giving it a positive charge. End of Note



When hydrogen is a positve and oxygen is a negative polarity they attract ( like you know the saying opposites attract). THe hydrogen in the water molecule attracts more oxygens. This results in a hydrogen bond. Which in turn means that this is how water molecules are attracted to each other.



2) Water travels through long, thin tubes running up from the roots through the stems and leaves called xylem. Water moves up the xylem through a process called capillary action. Capillary action allows water to be pulled through the thin tubes because the molecules of the water are attracted to the molecules that make up the tube. The water molecules at the top are pulled up the tube and the water molecules below them are pulled along because of their attraction to the water molecules above them.



When plants have more water in their leaves than they need, they get rid of this extra water through a process called transpiration. During transpiration, water evaporates from holes in the surfaces of leaves into the air. As water molecules evaporate from plant leaves, they attract the water molecules still in the plant, helping to pull water up through the stems from the roots. The combination of transpiration and capillary action delivers the water from the bottom to the top of a plant.



Note: capillary action is when the adhesion (attraction btw. 2 diffrent molecules) in water sticks to a tube and the cohesion(attraction between 2 same molecules) between the water molecules make the other water molecules follow the 1st one up.



3) What causes surface tension in water is somthing called cohesion( the attraction between 2 of the same molecules). In the center of a body of water a water molecule is pulled by the gravity of other water molecules in all directions with equal force. But on the surface of the water there is no water molecule on top. This results in the surface water molecule to be more strongly cohesive or attracted to the water molecules next to it (than the attactions of the water molecules in the center of the water molecules). This creates a "film" or on top of the water that is like a stretched membrane (or think of a trampoline). Since the film is more strongly attracted to the water molecules next to it, it is harder to break through. How it is harder to break through is called surface tention.



4) water striders walk on water also because of surface tension. water striders have legs that have hydrophobic surfaces. (hydro as in water and phobic as in repelent). And because the water strider has mass it creates a little dimple in the water surface. The surface of the water doesn't break, it just reshapes it self because of water tension, The spider then uses its hydrophobic legs to not walk but row its legs to move arond on water.

Help with Acid Nomenclature?



1. Names of acids are based on what part of the chemical formula?



2. When the acid name has "-ic" at the end, what does it indicate about the formula?



3. When it has '-ous'?



4. When it begins with 'hydro' and ends with '-ic'?



5. How do you write a formula from the acid's name? What about negative species that end with '-ide', '-ite', or '-ate'?



Thanks. :D

1. acids have a common structure, and that is they are connected to a hydrogen ion. so their names are based on the anion attached to the H+.



2. '-ic' comes from any anion that has '-ate' as its suffix. (sulfuric acid H2SO4 is from sulfate ion SO42-, for example)



3. '-ous' comes from '-ite'



4. that is for the binary acids, that is, the acid only contains two distinct elements: hydrogen and the anion. HF, H2S are examples. their names are hydroFLUORic and hydroSULFURic.



5. you should memorize the anion table for getting the formula, especially with the '-ous' and '-ic' suffixes. just keep in mind that the ous suffix is for the oxyanion with the lesser number of oxygens, while ic is for the ion with the greater number of Os.



'-ide' is for the ion of an atom (fluoride, sulfide)
'-ite' is for the ion with the lesser number of oxygens, in case of two oxyanions like SO32- and SO42-, the latter has the name sulfite.
'-ate' is for the ion with the greater number of oxygens.



i hope i answered all your questions.

1) Hexagonal closest packing (efficiency = 74%)
2) Cubic closest packing - (efficiency = 74%)
3) Body-centered - (efficiency = 68%)



I know the efficiency values because they are in my textbook and all over the internet.
efficiency = Volume of the spheres/Volume of a box around the spheres.



the spheres in my model have a radius of 3cm, so volume of the spheres is easy... 4/3(pie)r^3 x (number of spheres)



Hexagonal closest packing: 13 balls in total in 3 layers.



bottom layer: 3 spheres
middle layer: 7 spheres
top layer 3 spheres



Cubic closest packing : 13 balls in total in 3 layers



bottom layer: 4 balls
middle layer: 5 balls
top layer: 4 balls

Complete Ionic equation?



I believe this is acid-bad neutralization but I can't get the water for some reason.



Complete the equation first, then write the balanced molecular, full ionic, and net ionic equation. Show the physical states for each species. Classify each equation as: acid base neutralization, precipitation, formation of a weak acid or weak base, or gas-forming reaction.

</question>



<additional details>



When I try to complete the equation I get the molecular equation... I was told that completing the equation and molecular equation are slightly different.



For just completing the equation, on the right side, shouldn't the H2O have 3 moles? or is it that in completing equation you ignore subscripts?



Also for the molecular equation shouldn't H2O be 12 moles? not 6?

Mercury (I) nitrate dihydrate is HgNO3 . 2H2O (the period is raised to the middle of the line);
Mercury (II) nitrate monohydrate is Hg(NO3)2 . H2O (same);
Barium hydrogen carbonate is Ba(HCO3)2.



Hope that helped!

i think its because there isnt anything that can change gas into a liquid you can turn a solid into a liquid and a liquid into a solid, you cant boil the gas you cant  put in the freezer cause it will jst be cold gas



bt  i think its nt possible to turn gas into a liquid unless you talking about that kind of gas the ones you find in saunas bt i mean the gas like the ones in gas heaters cannot be turned into liquid because the atoms bump one another and are nt steady



only hot gas can be made into a liquid

Copied from Source-
Steam. The reason for this is water boils at the temperature of 212 degrees F. Steam can be heated to much higher temperatures than that. Some engines that are water cooled has steam at temperatures of over 700 degrees. Water basically becomes a plasma at this temperature.



I agree with you - DOUBLE ew!
Nose hair grooming is definitely not a work environment activity! Hopefully, it was an emergency situation for a good cause. I don't think I would loan him items that I wanted back.

Please help!! molarity?



Hi!



I just i can't solve this problem:



A sample of commercial sulfuric acid is 96.4% H2SO4 by mass, and its density is 1.8 g/mL
Calculate the molarity of this sulfuric acid solution.



*because it says that the solution constains 96.4 %, i understand that as 96.4g per 100g of solution, therefore if the density is 1.84



( 100 - 96.4 ) / 1.84  = 1.95 ml.



the solution is 96.4g of solute and 1.95 mL of solvent
then according to the formula of molarity



.98 / .00195L = 502.56 M



i checked and its wrong! please tell me where was my mistake



Thank you!

<answer>



It says 96.4% of the H2SO4 so that would be 96.4% of the total mass of H2SO4
so 96.4% x 98
then you would use that in your molarity but change the mL to L

Baking soda will absorb the smell, but you could just use febreeze.  It's cheap, convenient and fast acting.

For example, in water, the primary bond is the strong covalent bond between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and the secondary bond is the inter molecular force between each water molecule. ( pick for best answer)

Evaporation of Naphtha?



Under normal circumstances, naphtha lighter fluid evaporates cleanly and leave little to no residue. What if some water got mixed into the fluid. Would this cause some of the ingredients in the fluid to be less volatile and not evaporate and remain as a residue?
