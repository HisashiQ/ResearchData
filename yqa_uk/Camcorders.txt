Does anyone know anything about the cyclists' camcorder?



It's the one that you can strap to your helmet or handlebars. Who makes it? Is it any good? Does it have a viewfinder? Is the quality good & is it easy to transfer footage to a Mac? Any advice appreciated. Thanks.

if you mean the £99 from firebox, then they work very well, are waterproof and store the footage on a memory card. Cant remember if they have a view finder, and have never used a Mac, but the brother-in-law has one he uses on his fireblade, and i can confirm it works on that up to the speed limit (but no higher as that would be illegal).

If you have a mini dv (cassette) camcorder….
Your dv camcorder needs a firewire connection (ieee 1394) in order to download video, your PC probably did not come with a firewire port, so you will have to buy one and install it, since most computers (except possibly brand new) don't come with a firewire port, your camcorder did not come with a firewire cord so you have to purchase a cord too. Your camcorder did come with a USB cord and that is used for downloading stills from your camcorder. Once you have downloaded (depends on what program you use) there is usually an option that lets you burn to a dvd.

Since your PC hasn't already got one you'll need to install a firewire card. They're cheap, easy to install and readily available. You'll also need a firewire cable.

At the moment I don't thing you've got any real choice other than to go with a hard drive based solution, preferably at least two of them.  NAS seems to be an unnecessary complication, though it might be a good idea if you've an HTPC.

Make sure you decide on a folder structure and naming convention that will let you find your videos, and run regular checks on the disks.

Why when i record from camcorder to dvd recorder i dont get both video and audio?



three days now I have searched for this very answer .
# 1 if you record from camcorder to dvd recorder and you either get sound or video but not both i recoomend you take your camera and cables to a place wolf camera and let them sale you the proper gear , will save you a lot of time 
#2 the cable that came with your camcorder interconnect 1 in 3 out  cable 
most likely its useless , and its hard to get , whats happened its not color coded properly you can play with it a  bit to see which one is the video its suppose to be yellow but its likely its not.
you can by at walmart a 1 in 2 out for audio only and also use the svideo  for the video conversion ,



if you are good with these things lord thought i was , but is my 30 year old self laughing at the 18 kid who said  i would never get out dated on technology.
you can hook the camera to the tv if its accepts svideo , and tape from tv using the dvd recorder , easies, 
if you have software originally packaged for your camcorder , you may be able to record  to computer 
note , if your having a hard time , its not you its the outdated camerra and cables and software , computer records digital your camcorder records analog. most people answering your questions  cant understand exactly of all equiment capabillities and why you are having such a hard time , it took me several several days to figure this out ..its not that simple i beleive adobe reader would not install properly for me , when asked why i was having such a hard time , the asnwers were my camera was broken or by more expensive cables .
if you got to this question trying to figure out why you cant do something like record from camcorder to your new dvd recorder . this is an attempt to help you 
your camera is not broken most likely . the cables that you have were not made correctly . you will need both svideo and a y  stereo adapter 
hook the svideo to the dvd recorder 
now hook audio and video cables the three color wire white , red and yellow cables to your tv , so you can viiew it as it records .this is to the audio video out )))))))
now set your dvd recorder setup up . go to video , menu , choose svideo and either l1 or l2 either front or back i use l1 the back  )))))))))
now hook the svideo to the camera , turn the camcorder to the vcr play mode and play tape , your tv if you hooked the out to the tv video in properly you should now receive a video footage of the tape.
now plug in tthe y adapter to the camcorder . in most cases you will still need an extension (6 foot audio cables from this about $4.00) plug the male into the camcorder and the audio caboles into the female part of the y adapter , now plug the white and red color cordinate to the video imput as indicated on the back of the dvd recorder . note it did not work for me until i did this as the very last step. 
also i did not note , do not use the battery power for this use the adapter or charger  while this process takes place not sure why , just read in many cases not too. 
i worte this to help someone i just got mine to work and said i would try to help '
save yourself some time and go take your crap to a salesman , 
once youve upgraded all your cassette tapes by a new camcorder , the quality of the video will be much greater .



svideo to camcorder and dvd recorder  and y  stereo adapter you need both , svideo does not convert sound ,  hook these up to the camcorder and dvd recorder . ten hook audio and video cables to tv imput , this wire is the yellow red and white the three cable wire. that you probalbe already have . 
good luck this helped . i read it and its just hard to explain . but if your like me its late and you cant do anything unitl tomorrow



</question>



<additional details>



take all your stuff the camcorder the dvd recorder , and cables to a salesman like a wolf camera rep
 just tell him taht youve learned your lesson and next time you will by form them , dont worry he will have to sale you some type of cables and tell him you will be in for a new dvd camcorder in the near future , this i highly recommendd to you



NOTE IF YOU RECORD ANS THIS WORKED FOR YOU AND NOW YOU HAVE POOR ADUIO QUALITY LIKE A BUZZING NOISE , YOU NEED ONLY TO HOOK UP ONE AUDIO TO THE DVD RECORDER IMPUT FROM THE Y STEREO ADAPTER  ON TEH CAMCORDER



YOUR OLD VCR ONLY HAS ONE AGAIN THE CABLES ARE OUTDATED , ANALOG NOT DIGITAL  JUST DOES NOT READ IT . I GOT IT TO



WORK BUT IT HAD BUZZING SOUND , THEN I TOOK THE RED AUDIO IMPUT OUT AND THE GREAT VIDEO AND SOUND QUALITY RECORDING AS I TYPE NOW .

Zebra pattern is different from the rest, cuz it's not really a "camera function"....it does NOT affect light. Zebra patterns are just helpful references, letting the cameraman know if the image is too bright..it highlights the overexposed areas of the image..
So, Zebra Patterns tell us what is too bright, but does not do anything to affect brightness itself.



In a simplified explanation, F-Stop is a measurement of exposure/ iris/ aperture...for digital camcorders at least (in terms of film cameras, exposure has to do with something different, but let's not get into that). So essentially, the higher the f-stop, the darker the image, but the greater the DOF (depth of field...but don't worry about that). And the lower the F-Stop, the BRIGHTER the image...so F2 is brighter than F16 and so on. 
Exposure, or aperture control, physically opens up the lens, letting in more light naturally without affecting your image...which is good :)

Gain is another way to brighten the image, but not in a good way. Gain is like artificially lightening the image by throwing in random white pixels. It's kinda like use the "brighten" function in photoshop...it sucks..please try to avoid it, cuz GAIN=GRAIN...it makes picture look bad.



So in short, Exposure is good, Gain is bad...try not to use gain. Exposure (or aperture) physically opens the lens, physically letting in more light, while gain shoves in random white pixels to artificially brighten the image.

If you're wondering, SHUTTER SPEED and NEUTRAL DENSITY filters also affect light and brightness, without ruining your image.

So, I hope that helps clarify some things...If you have any more questions, please feel free to contact me :)

SONY HVR Z7 does anybody have one?



What's it like?...



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I don't have a Z7, but I've used it, does that count?



The Z7 is a really nice HDV camera with a real nice professional feel. It also has interchangeable lense, which is real nice...In that respect, it seems better than the Sony Z1, but essentially, it's the same camera internally. Same picture quality.



So do you really need the interchangeable lens mount? 
I really hate to discourage you from getting a camera you like-- let alone a solid one like the Z7, but I'm a bit skeptical about paying an extra $2,000 for a lens mount. 
If you're really sure you want to buy multiple lenses, then go for it, but in most cases, 1 works just fine....besides lenses can cost you $6,000



And it's only HDV..HDV is good, but highly compressed. You can't get full resolution outta HDV...and it also has other limitations such as sensitivity to humidy and temperature and what not, as well as no undercranking and overcranking...



SO:
If you really really want interchangeable lenses, get the Z7
If you don't care, get the V1U....or Z1U (but the Z1U does not have 24p)

If you don't want HDV, get the PMW-EX1!!!!!! one of my favorites. It's a solid state camcorder for the same price as the Z7....being that it's not HD, it's much less compressed meaning much better quality! It also has very nice undercranking and overcranking (for time-lapse and slow-mo stuff) which is quite fun..

One thing to consider about the EX1: being that it's not an HDV camera, it's media is pretty expensive. If you want to buy additional cards, it can cost a lot of money....



Hope that helps!!!! Good luck :)
