You'll need to contact the manufacturer and ask what the intervals are for health and safety inspection - I'm fairly sure they vary although health & safety (google it) would be a good idea as they'll give a definitive answer.

Yes it is very likely you will have to have it tested. The owners or operators of the hall are legally obliged to ensure that any electrical item used in the hall (whether it belongs to the hall itself or not) has a Portable Appliance Test (PAT Test) certificate. You local electrician or electrical shop should be able to do it for you. I don't know what the cost might be these days, but it won't be excessive.

Those with internet via cable modem can usually read their signal level by the modems web interface (http://192.168.100.1 for Ambit).

I'm getting -2.7 dBmV now.  I did have a poor line (that's fixed now) where everytime it rained the signal would slowly drop.  At -10 dBmV I would lose sync on the modem (no internet) and could see some noise on the upper cable channels.

SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) is also an important measurement.  Remember, a signal booster is also going to amplify the noise.

Connectors can loose between 1 and 2 dBmV and additional loads from multiple TVs and splitters also are a detriment to your total signal.

A perfect reading is ZERO DB 0db.  -8 DB is a bit low but your TV should handle that easily.  I have always tried for a bit higher, say +10 DB to give the system some headroom

i don't know the quality of the instument you are measuring the dBmv of the cable feed, but the level sounds ok. a normal antenna type amplifier will block your cable internet connection. a special cable amplifier will boost the incoming TV pictures, but will only bypass the internet. my recommendation is if the picture is ok, don't mess with it. if it is not, call the cable provider and they can usually improve both the TV and internet connection if needed.

If you want to do it yourself, you need to find the circuit breaker or fuse that the unit is connected to and turn the breaker OFF or remove the fuse.  Make sure the lift does not work after doing that.  Then you need to find where the lift is connected to AC power and just disconnect the wires.  Make sure to cover ALL the bare ends of the wires after disconnecting them with black electrical tape.  Cover each wire separately.  Then turn the breaker back on or replace the fuse.

to be hounest i think you would lose more then £50 if u buy something and sell it on ebay im a powerseller and my products wholesale so i can get alot cheaper not just that you have ebay costs to think about if you sell something for £400 they will take like £15 and paypal will charge you , but even though they got your name on can you still not sell them to a girl ? 
if theres really nothing you want and cant sell the vouchers then buying something and selling on ebay is really your only option get a T.V or  or a laptop they pay for shipping costs so anything will sell really

Buy something with the vouchers then return it without the receipt and they will give you a credit note which you can then sell on ebay or in the local paper. Or just sell the item you buy. But you will not get full value which ever way you do it.

Was the voucher free?  Did it cost you anything?  If so, was it less than the £50?  If so, use your voucher to get something, then list on eBay.  You may not end up with the total amount of the voucher, but you would still be ahead of the game, right?



Not sure what to get?  Surf eBay to see what kind of electronics are selling and go from there.

Another option - can you purchase something with the voucher then go back to the store at a different location and return it?



Or like someone else suggested, hang out at the stores and find someone buying a big ticket item and offer to swap the £450 voucher for say £350 or £400.  You get the cash and they save £50 to £100 - it would be a win-win situation.

your dvd isnt setup for the right input recording and as a result it stops the recording automatically because it doesnt detect signal coming in.
two ways of connecting this:
1- connect the dvd via scart to the sky box input that says vcr (top scart input), also take note of the input number that you have connected to on the dvd player. when you are ready to record make sure you set the correct recording input  (ex: sky connected to AV 1 on the dvd so you set the recording input as AV 1)

2- connect the sky box to the dvd via standard RF cable (aerial extension type) and then select a analogue channel on the DVD (ex: n 6) and then do a manual tunning to pick up the sky channel (normally 847.25 MHZ or C68). again when you are ready to record make sure you have setup the dvd to the right input channel for recording (lets assume in this case n 6).

What graphing calculator should I get?



My brother is going off to colledge and they recommend to have a TI-89.  We have a TI-84 plus.  I'm looking around shopping for a TI-89.  I've came across a TI-89 platinum or a TI-89 advanced.  The platinum is newer, but cheaper.  Is the platinum not as good?  What would be the best choice?  Thanks.

Depending on your major is what makes the difference on calculators.  A TI-84 is plenty for almost everyone.  The only people who need TI-89's are those in engineering programs.  If you are going that route then you will probably need to go with an 89.  Otherwise, you will get more but it won't be usable to most people without practice.

Now for the two calculators there is not a large difference.  The platinum would work great, especially if it is cheaper.  There are few differences between the two and in all actuality the platinum is probably easier to operate.  Whenever a new calculator with the same number aka 89 comes out the newest model is generally more user friendly.  I have a student with a platinum 89 and it is very similar to an iphone in my opinion with the general workings, just cheaper and lower quality software.

Should I get a surge protector or extension plug lead for my computer system?



A  FUSE
In electronics and electrical engineering a fuse (short for fusible link), is a type of overcurrent protection device. Its essential component is a metal wire or strip that melts when too much current flows, which breaks the circuit in which it is connected, thus protecting the circuit's other components from damage due to excessive current.

My question is that, I have a computer system (computer,speakers, monitor, printer, router and modem) and would like to know if I should get a "surge protector" or a "plug extension lead with a 13amp fuse"?

I heard something about short circuits, power surges and other damaging stuff which can occur, when there's a storm out. I hope that helps a bit for my question to be answered.

You need a surge protector. The idea here is that the surge protector will clamp voltage spikes to a particular level, thus preventing their getting to your electronics.

A fuse protects against electrical overload conditions, but it is far too slow and will not protect against voltage spikes.

You blew some of my brains out with detail. No kidding. Yes you have to have a surge protector on your system, and you cannot connect the printer on the same strip because of its varying current requirements. So you want to have your computer and monitor and speakers surge protected, and your printer too, but that has to be on a separate strip and plugged into a different outlet. Get strips with the highest joule suppression rating you can find and afford. Lightning trashes everything, and if your dad turns on a power saw or something in the basement you could be screwed too. If an appliance shorts out or an air conditioner turns on you are screwed. You need two strips, one for the goods and one for the printer and/or FAX. Now, if you buy an UPS all that stuff comes with it. See if you can afford an UPS.

I highly recommend having something that protects against power surges because you can have power surges with no expectation.  However, if there is a lightening storm, no surge protector will completely protect your electronics, so if you are not at home or you have a lightning storm, you should unplug valuable equipment.  If you have a commercial need for you computer, then I suggest contacting someone who specializes in those needs. Those surge protectors are usually over $500.

I use a UPS for my better kit, but ALWAYS put a decent surge protector in line.  Many are also extension leads now.  Certainly our  one unprotected [until a few months ago] device [a TV] has started showing problems and they often coincide with the loss of a lightbulb in that room.

A surge protector would be a wise decision for use with any high end electronics (computers, television, ect.). When a storm does arise and your computer isn't plugged into a surge protector you risk blowing your power supply and unless you have an extra laying around that you can easily switch out then your computer will be dead until it is replaced.

You should get a surge protector or Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). You should not plug a computer or other sensitive equipment into any source that is only "fuse protected"

First, lets discuss the surge issue:
Even a fast acting fuse will not protect a computer from a surge before it burns out. A surge protector is designed to act near immediately to attempt to regulate the voltage supplied to your computer, either blocking the surge or by shorting to ground voltages above a safe threshold. A fuse melts when an overcurrent goes through it (either because of a short in the equipment, a piece of equipment drawing more than the fuse is rated for, and/or too much current finding a path through the equipment).



When looking at a surge protector, you wish to compare the joules rating on it and the reaction time. You want higher joules rating, and lower reaction time. This is definitely an area where quality is worth paying a little extra.

On a side note, virtually all surge protectors come with a fuse as well - but do not confuse a power strip with a surge protector (many look the same).



Computers and other electronic equipment are sensitive to more than just surges though. Surge protectors do not regulate other things such as brownouts, high voltage (such as your line voltage goes over 127 volts) or poor waveform (AC current in the US should be 60hz).



If you live in an area where you frequently get brownouts, blackouts, high voltage or similar situations, you may wish to spend a few extra bucks on a UPS instead of a surge protector. Most UPS units will switch to battery when the line current (from your outlet) either falls above or below a certain threshold to ensure your computer gets the proper voltage - all while also protecting your computer from surges. If you live in an area with really bad power, you can consider purchasing a high end UPS ($100+) which can also filter AC waveforms to ensure your equipment gets 60hz AC.

Regardless of your choice, there are some common mistakes people make that render a surge protector or UPS useless:
- You MUST have a valid ground connection (3rd pin) which goes to a properly grounded location.

- You MUST connect every component that is interconnected into a surge protector or UPS (such as the monitor, powered speakers and printer... otherwise a surge could potentially carry back through the unprotected device into your computer). This also includes any incoming modem, DSL or cable Internet line (pick a UPS or surge protector with the outlets needed for whichever you have).

- You cannot plug a laser printer into most UPS units (unless they specifically say they are rated for it). Use a very good surge protector for it and leave it off the UPS. When a laserprinter starts it's warmup cycle(s), it draws a lot of current very quickly for a short period of time (when it heats the fuser), which can damage a UPS not designed for it.

If you have any other questions that I havent answered, let me know.

the term transponder (short-for Transmitter-responder and sometimes abbreviated to XPDR, XPNDR, TPDR or TP) has the following meanings:

An automatic device that receives, amplifies, and retransmits a signal on a different frequency (see also broadcast translator). 
An automatic device that transmits a predetermined message in response to a predefined received signal. 
A receiver-transmitter that will generate a reply signal upon proper electronic interrogation. A communications satellite’s channels are called transponders, because each is a separate transceiver or repeater. With digital video data compression and multiplexing, several video and audio channels may travel through a single transponder on a single wideband carrier. Original analog video only has one channel per transponder, with subcarriers for audio and automatic transmission identification service ATIS. Non-multiplexed radio stations can also travel in single channel per carrier (SCPC) mode, with multiple carriers (analog or digital) per transponder. This allows each station to transmit directly to the satellite, rather than paying for a whole transponder, or using landlines to send it to an earth station for multiplexing with other stations. Another type of transponder occurs in identification friend or foe systems in military aviation and in air traffic control secondary surveillance radar (beacon radar) systems for general aviation and commercial aviation. Primary radar works best with large all-metal aircraft, but not so well on small, composite aircraft. Its range is also limited by terrain and rain or snow and also detects unwanted objects such as automobiles, hills and trees. Furthermore it cannot estimate the altitude of an aircraft. Secondary radar overcomes these limitations but it depends on a transponder in the aircraft to respond to interrogations from the ground station to make the plane more visible.

Depending on the type of interrogation, the transponder sends back a transponder code (or "squawk code") (Mode A) or altitude information (Mode C) to help air traffic controllers to identify the aircraft and to maintain separation. Another mode called Mode S (Mode Select) is designed to help air traffic control in busy areas and allow automatic collision avoidance. Mode S transponders are 'backwards compatible' with Modes A & C. Mode S is mandatory in controlled airspace in many countries. Some countries have also required, or are moving towards requiring, that all aircraft be equipped with Mode S, even in uncontrolled airspace. However in the field of general aviation, there have been objections to these moves, because of the cost, size, limited benefit to the users in uncontrolled airspace, and, in the case of balloons and gliders, the power requirements during long flights.

Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is an automatic identification method, relying on storing and remotely retrieving data using devices called RFID tags or transponders.

An RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader.

Most RFID tags contain at least two parts. One is an integrated circuit for storing and processing information, modulating and demodulating a (RF) signal, and other specialized functions. The second is an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal. Chipless RFID allows for discrete identification of tags without an integrated circuit, thereby allowing tags to be printed directly onto assets at a lower cost than traditional tags.

Today, RFID used is in enterprise supply chain management to improve the efficiency of inventory tracking and management. However, growth and adoption in the enterprise supply chain market is limited because current commercial technology does not link the indoor tracking to the overall end-to-end supply chain visibility. Coupled with fair cost-sharing mechanisms, rational motives and justified returns from RFID technology investments are the key ingredients to achieve long-term and sustainable RFID technology adoption.
RFID tags come in three general varieties:- passive, active, or semi-passive (also known as battery-assisted). Passive tags require no internal power source, thus being pure passive devices (they are only active when a reader is nearby to power them), whereas semi-passive and active tags require a power source, usually a small battery.
To communicate, tags respond to queries generating signals that must not create interference with the readers, as arriving signals can be very weak and must be differentiated. Besides backscattering, load modulation techniques can be used to manipulate the reader's field. Typically, backscatter is used in the far field, whereas load modulation applies in the nearfield, within a few wavelengths from the reader. 
There are three different kinds of RFID tags based on their attachment with identified objects, i.e. attachable, implantable and insertion tags. In addition to these conventional RFID tags, Eastman Kodak Company has filed two patent applications for monitoring ingestion of medicine based on a digestible RFID tag.

My window air conditioner constantly makes crackling noises and fills with water.?



At the beginning of summer my boyfriend and I bought a 100 dollar Air conditioner for your window at a whole sale liquidator. We leave it run all day all night. We basically never turn it off, we keep it in the bedroom. Its a smaller unit. Now all of a sudden we wake up to this crackling noise that sounds so loud and crazy its like omg shut it off, and you can see water spitting out from the vent air area. Then my boyfriend gets up pulls it out the window and then turns it upsidedown and all this water comes out. Bascially draining it. Then he puts it back in the window and everything is fine no noise. Sometimes it starts back up right away in a half hour, and sometimes its fine for a couple of days. It always happens in the middle of the night or early morning, it runs fine during the day, but just has to do it when we are sleeping. Im 33 weeks pregnant and I tell my boyfriend it is preparing us for those late night wake ups for the baby ha ha... But seriously.. What is wrong with this POS! its getting so frustrating because sometimes my boyfriend doesnt want to get up and dump the water anymore, and i can't sleep without the white noise and air. I dont remember it making the crackling noises when we got it, but i do remember a week or two later i heard them, but they were very very little and not an annoyance. thanks.!

Air conditioners are supposed to cause condensate to collect. (It's the same thing that happens when condensation collects on the outside of a cold glass/can on a hot day.) This is good, because it makes the room less humid. (And the reason it takes different amount of time to happen is because sometimes the air is more hot and humid than other times.)

The problem is that the unit isn't draining properly. There may be a clog in the hole that the condensate it supposed to be able to drain out of. Check the back of the unit for a drain (it may look like you're supposed to be able to attach a hose to it) and see if there's a clog in it.

Alternatively, you may just need to keep the unit tipped backwards a teensy bit.

I had the same problem. All it is, is the condensation that builds up from the warm air in your room being sucked into the air conditioner and the cold air being blown out. To fix this you can do two things. Empty it every day. Or set the dial to a temperature that the A/C can reach to let it rest for a little bit and let the fan do all the work. Don't worry it isn't anything bad, just water building up,

On a VHS/DVD machine that can covert from VHS to DVD, can I put more than one VHS on one DVD?



I have 5 VHSs each with 5 minutes or less taped onto them, I want to put all of these on one DVD, is that possible? If so, how do I do it?

You can do it on the Sony top of the range model that I have.  As long as you haven't finalized the disc then you can add as many recordings to your DVD as will fit.

Hi, i've had mine for 4 months and i had the same trouble with mine, mine was an RAC one, i reset it and everything but no joy, so i took it back to the shop where i brought it and explained to them what was happening so they gave me a new one. I took it home and tried that one but it was doing the same (it froze), so i took it back again and told them that it wasn't working so they checked it and they said that there were a lot of them freezing and had alot of software problems. I would take it back to the shop and explain to them what is happening and that you have reset it and nothing is happening. Hopefully they will either send it away for you or they will give you a refund. I would advice you to take it back to the shop.

Need to extend cable between aerial and sky box

I was wondering if anyone knows how to extend the aeriel that comes through my external wall and into the back of my sky box so that i can move the sky box to the other side of the room. I have a normal aeriel extension cable, but the bit that goes into the back of the sky box screws on and appears to be different from a normal tv aerial
Any suggestions

Sorry but is a fact that with the S27 (and most Panasonic, JVC and Sony models)  it is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to unlock a Panasonic model WITHOUT a factory service remote, or a clone of the factory service remote.  You would have to get this from Panasonic themselves and so virtually impossible.

Please also do not fall for people wish to sell the solution or some gadget for a few quid/bucks, its a scam and they will not work.

Bose products are, without exception, truly appalling.

Some of the best speakers in the world come from companies like like Krell, Martin Logan, Wilson Audio, Living Voice, Egglstone Works, etc.

But of course, "the best" isn't cheap, is it?.
A pair of Egglstone Works 'The Ivy' will set you back £75,000, for example.

are you sure you put the MP3's in the "music" folder? dont put it in any other folder. i have a chocolate as well, but the second edition with the scroll wheel, i figure its the same. ive never had this problem. make sure the musc files are transferred into the music folder, it should work perfectly. make sure the sd chip is formatted to your phone and not some one elses.

How do I stop my speakers crackling/buzzing?



I've had my PC speakers for about 2-3 years. and for about 8 months they buzz/ crackle when i switch them on.

Sometimes they don't buzz but if my pc has been on for a few hours they do.

The buzzing quietens if i lower the tone. but then the music quality is poor.

Tried cleaning the jacks or the speaker wires but no difference

Is it because my speakers are old or damaged?
Or is there a way to fix it?

Thanks

Mine are doing the same.  I'm afraid they're dying from old age and/or loudness.  It happens.



I reccommend buying a good set of speakers.  I always opted for the cheapest versions, but in the long run it's best to spend a bit and get some that last a long time.

A possible before you bin them.

The connections inside the speakers are loose or the cable where it goes into the plug is also loose: resolder them, a soldering iron will correct this. If you are lucky you will be able to take the speakers apart, if they are secured by screws. They tend to be sealed now: an example of our 'throwaway' society.

Other than that I guess the speaker cones have gone, so down to the shops me thinks.

A ”DVD Region Lock” is technology on DVD players that prevents those who live in one region from successfully viewing a DVD movie that was produced and distributed for a different region. Although you could purchase a DVD movie in the United States and mail it to someone in China ten months before the DVD is released there, the DVD will not play on the recipient's Region 6 DVD player.

The world had been divided by the power of the film houses so that you cannot watch cheaper DVDs in your region.  Any region free format seems to fail (HD) and so you are left at the mercy of (most) hardware makers who match the regions to the DVD.  So 1 for America, 2 for Europe etc.

Luckily the hardware makers are cheap and create most machines the same and set the coding in their factory in China or Taiwan and with the exception of Sony most region locked DVD players can be pretty easily hacked just by pressing keys in a certain order.  This will set you machine to region 9 which is free and you will be able to watch any DVD on it.  I have included a link below but you can also just type in your model and DVD hack and you should find a site.  Never use a site that asks for any personal details, email or asks you to join,  Information on all machine (were possible) are available.

You could also be talking about the same lock on a Computer software DVD player and these are harder to crack.  If you are please re-post your question and the specific software.

Region lock for instance stops you playing USA DVD on UK equipment.  Go & buy a portable multi region DVD player (Hitachi) & connect it via output socket on the DVD to your TV. Use Scart Cable or 1 Jack/3 Jack cable (1 Jack to DVD & 3 Jack to TV - white/red/black). Why a portable DVD player? You can then take your portable DVD player to your friends who have the same problem - your mates then supply the booze & grub for a good night in!!!!!!

A microwave oven uses microwaves, which are basically radio waves, to cook food. The commonly used frequency is roughly 2,500 MHz (2.5 GHz). Radio waves in this frequency range are absorbed by water, fats and sugars. When absorbed, they are converted directly into heat.

Let me add some more additional information you might be interested to know

Microwaves fall into the radio frequency band of electromagnetic radiation. Microwaves should not be confused with x-rays, which are more powerful.
Microwaves have three characteristics that allow them to be used in cooking: they are reflected by metal; they pass through glass, paper, plastic, and similar materials; and they are absorbed by foods.

Microwaves are produced inside the oven by an electron tube called a magnetron. The microwaves bounce back and forth within the metal interior until they are absorbed by food. Microwaves cause the water molecules in food to vibrate, producing heat that cooks the food. That's why foods high in water content, like fresh vegetables, can be cooked more quickly than other foods. The microwave energy is changed to heat as soon as it is absorbed by food.
Although heat is produced directly in the food, microwave ovens do not cook food from the inside out. When thick foods like roasts are cooked, the outer layers are heated and cooked primarily by microwaves while the inside is cooked mainly by the slower conduction of heat from the hot outer layers.

Microwave cooking can be more energy efficient than conventional cooking because foods cook faster and the energy heats only the food, not the oven compartment. Microwave cooking does not reduce the nutritional value of foods any more than conventional cooking. In fact, foods cooked in a microwave oven may keep more of their vitamins and minerals, because microwave ovens can cook more quickly and without adding water.
Glass, paper, ceramic, or plastic containers are used in microwave cooking because the microwaves pass through them. Although such containers cannot be heated by microwaves, they can become hot from the heat of the food cooking inside. Some plastic containers should not be used in a microwave oven, as they can be melted by the heat of the food inside.

Hi Allan

I have a Philips DVD 5980 player which plays AVI's straight off a CD or DVD with absolutely no converting to divx or DVD format.

Just download your AVI's, burn them to DVD as a data file, then chuck the disc in your player and voila, films on your living room telly.

They are great quality as well even on my 42" plasma.

Only about £40 for the player, HDMI 1080p upscaler as well.

Believe me, it is well worth it, especially all the time saved converting between formats. And they play first time, every time.

Also they have USB on the front, so just drag your AVI's from your PC onto the stick and take it out and put it in the front of the player, saves burning DVD as well.

It really is a great little player.

EDIT : Despite what the other answers say I GAURANTEE you this player reads AVI's and plays them with no converting.

You have to convert your video to DVD format (MPEG-2 or VOB) at first, otherwise normal DVD player cant read and play your burned DVD. I always use avs video tools to convert and burn video to DVD to play on my TV, my friends recommend it to me, it's easy to use and works pretty well for me, you may download it for a try, and here is a guide about how to use it

I think Americans should have to produce 1/10 of their own power by riding a stationary bike. This will fix two problems.



If you look into it solar and wind are not all that practical. 
Sure get a windmill. It can produce enough to power a single light bulb and you paid 5K to have it installed.

Solar is still a good source but again the cost out weighs the benefit.

Ive looked into both.



I would vote gas or coal as the cheapest thats why we have used them in the past.

electric is the most common i think... or gas. but only for some things..
btw water is pretty crap because sayy u were going to use a water powered car the gas produced is more poisonus than Co2 which cars produce now.  Solar it would take a week to turn on your light. gas to turn on a light? lol coal is expesive nd i dnt think you can poer your home with it, and wind.. ok well say for sydney australia it would take over 30 thousand square km of wind turbines as ONE windturbine takes up the ecological footprint of a football field. lol

Coal may be cheap but it is a dirty source so forget that.

We all know oil/gas/electric is no longer cheap as it once was.

Solar and wind are cheap: the sun and wind "actually" cost you nothing to tap into outside of the startup costs which can be pretty expensive. But the govt also now has tax credits for those willing to invest.

Look into solar water heaters by Velux (www.veluxusa.com), the company I used to work for sells them and they are a good environmentally aware company. Most people may know them for their skylights.

In reality,  prices can fluctuate remarkably during the course of a year.  Although wind and solar are often touted as "free", the technology necessary to take advantage of them isn't.  And it's rare for producers of that technology - makers of solar panels and storage units, for example - to admit it, those technologies tend to be high maintenance...sorta like 
The Donald's mistresses, heh!



The only thing that will make wind and solar truly competitive will be increased demand.  We as a nation need to step up and insist on independence from oil.  We need to push for a reduction, not increases, in the use of other polluting technologies such as coal and wood.



Will we do it?  Your answer lies in your own willingness to lead the way...

Considering the cost of equipment, Solar and Wind are relatively expensive.  Systems large enough to completely power a home cost well over $20,000 so your break even point is well over 10 years.

Electricity is still the most cost effective to power your home.  Wood is the cheapest for heat, but takes a lot of work on your part, carrying wood, maintaining the fire, removing ashes, cleaning the chimney, etc.

For any of the Green energy sources to be truly effective in helping our environment, they need to be affordable to the common man.  Most people don't have the money to shell out for a solar or wind power source that won't save enough to pay for itself for at least 15 years.  When the cost comes down to the point when most people can afford them, this is when we will start saving the environment.

Unfortunately, gas, oil, coal, electricity, etc, are the most affordable sources of energy right now and will continue to be for the foreseeable future.

If you have enough solar panels, and have extra energy that you don't use, you can be connected to the return power grid and actually make money!!! How positive is that!!!

Also, if you have electricity, get 3-phase electricity, it makes using air conditioners, dryers, stoves and some other specifically designed electricals as efficient as a light globe - or better.

The TeleZapper - www.telezapper.com

Blocks automatic calling computers by faking those tones that are played when a number is disconnected. When the computer hears that it will remove your number from its data base. When actual people hear the tones it they don't usually hang up right away. Especially people you know, who know they have your number right.

The 2.5mm means the diameter of the plug. The non-standard part likely means that it is electrically wired different to what is normally expected, so be careful if you're going to use a 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter here.

This has happened to mine before. Try the batteries again, if not, then switch off the box at the mains for a minute, then back on to reboot it. This usually cures most problems.

I have had the TD-6K for around 3 years now and absolutely love it. From my experience of my kit and trying other Roland models, I could definitely recommend them. Personally I wouldn't go for any other manufacturer.
The HD-1 is the cheapest kit Roland do and seems to come in about £100 over your budget. It's marketed a bit like an executive toy but would certainly make a good practice kit. It will share some sounds with the more expensive models Roland make and has some useful instructional programmes.
I suppose it depends how serious you are about drumming and what you'll want to do with the kit (mess around in your bedroom, gigging etc).
The TDK3 is the cheapest 'proper' kit Roland do, but is a bit basic.
Yamaha do a kit for £500, but I'm afraid I can't comment on it. Yamaha are good brand for other instruments though and their acoustic drums are well endorsed. 
You say you could stretch your budget. In which case I'd say the TD3-K should be your aim. Any higher up the range (unless you'll consider 2nd hand) will be at least double your budget.
As for the Millenium and Alesis, they may be alright, but I wouldn't unless all I wanted was to mess around on a musical toy. It says alot to me that they don't make higher end kits, just cheap ones. For example, the dearest Alesis kit is cheaper than Roland's low end TD3 and in my opinion there must be a reason for that. The triggers may be ok but the modules and sound samples are likely a bit shocking. They would hook up via MIDI to a PC with a suitable sound card running some drum emulator software through an application like Cubase, but unless you're prepared to try and run hooky software, the cost of doing that legit could be way more than a TD9 even.

Using correct power cord for my laptop?



I know that I can use my U.S. laptop in Europe simply using a plug adapter. I already did this and it works fine.

However, I have just noticed that all of my U.S. power cords, including the one I use for my laptop (the cord whose one end connects to the power brick and the other plugs to the wall outlet) have the indication of "125V". They do not say "120V-250V" or similar.

My questions are:

1) So this made me thought that power cords may have their own voltage input limits. Is that true?

2) If so, how come I can use my U.S. power cord with a plug adapter?



3) I have a European power cord as well which has the "220V" indication and that I can connect to the laptop's power brick. 
I was wondering whether you would prefer to use that European power cord or the U.S. power cord with a plug adapter. (My only consideration is to provide utmost safety and compatibility to my laptop in terms of electricity. Convenience is not a consideration for me. Using a European power cord will obviate the need of using a plug adapter, and thus will be more convenient for me. However, as I indicated, convenience is not my no. 1 priority.)

4) Lastly, in terms of ampere (amp), my power cords have different indications. One has 2.5A-250V, one has 2.5A-125V and the other has 7A-125V. I have 2 questions:
a) What kind of effects does the amp value have? i)For instance, would one of these increase charging time? ii) which will lay more pressure on the power brick? Which will make the power brick get hotter? I am asking this because I know that power bricks breaks and needs to be replaced after a certain time, and I would like to use my power brick as long as possible.

5) In light of the foregoing, which is the safest power cord for my U.S. laptop’s power brick that is going to be used in Europe?

I will appreciate if you can answer my questions respectively in order for you to not overlook any of them.

Thanks,

TR_T-Rex

PS. I lost the power cord that came with my laptop. If I had not lost it, I would have definitely used that one.

1) Possibly, but more likely is that the label is just an identifier to tell you what kind of power system the cord was intended for.  However, any wire is going to have a maximum safe voltage and amperage.  Exceeding those specifications could cause the cord to overheat.

2) Most likely, your plug adapter also has simple circuit to reduce the voltage.  If it doesn't, it's an extremely dangerous device, because it would allow you to plug devices intended for low American voltages into a supply with a much higher voltage.  That would be a fire hazard and a lawsuit waiting to happen.
For the sake of completeness, I should also point out that a wire that's safe for 110v can safely be used at higher voltages, as long as amperage is low.

3) Use the European cable instead of the plug adapter.  Your power brick is a voltage-sensing variety, so it can work safely at either voltage.  Using the plug adapter is marginally less safe in that you're using two devices instead of one, each of which is doing voltage conversion.  The plug adapter is probably not as well-built as your laptop power supply, so it's more likely to overheat.

4)



The amperage rating is a safety rating.  One will not supply more or less power to your power brick than the other.  (Well, if you used extremely sensitive measuring equipment, there would be a difference in resistance, but it's of no importance here.)
Also, your laptop uses a specific number of watts.  If the number of watts used stays constant, the amperage will go down as the voltage goes up.  Watts are easy to calculate.  They're Amps*Volts.  The maximum safe wattage for your cords are 625W, 315W, and 875W, respectively.  If your laptop ever comes close to drawing that much power, it is broken.  Generally speaking, a laptop that's running full-tilt while charging its battery with the screen at full brightness won't pull more than 100W.



So the short answer is that the cord you choose will not have any affect on your charging time, nor will it affect the lifetime of your power supply.

5) Use the European (250V) cable.  It's what the Europeans use.  Seems to work for them.

Connection of drum machine and synth?



I have a drum machine and synth with midi input and output on each - how do I connect them and how is it controlled?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You need to connect the 'midi in' of your drum machine to the 'midi out' of your synth and vice versa. Of course it depends on what type of instruments you have, but they should both have a setting called 'midi control channels' or something along those lines. You need to match them. They usually go from 1 to 4 or 1 to 8. 
Email me with the type and manufacturer of your drum machine and synth and I'll see if i can help more. Midi is very difficult to get to grips with unless you've used it before. Taking the steps I mentioned above should produce some results. Feel free to get in touch if needs be though.

Because your radio needs reception to work. By using the aerial it receives radiowaves transmitted by the radio station. When you go under a bridge you are blocking those radiowaves from being received by your aerial. Therefore you do not hear anything!
