Grants are awards based on financial need and you can get these grants by completing the Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA).Sign up for FAFSA, You will qualify for a grant and you can get a student loan. Many grants are awarded based on the student’s financial need, but others are awarded based on ethnicity, religious affiliation, recorded achievements, association, or special interests. The Federal Pell Grant, for example, provides funding for low-income students. Both full-time and part-time students are eligible for this award and there are no requirements placed on minimum grade point average. To be eligible, you must be a citizen of the United States and have a high school diploma or GED.

go to social security office. they will request doctors records and determine if you are elgible-can take a year or two to get approved. they will retro your monthly payments to your application date if you are approved. many people are denied the first time,but you can appeal the decision and their are even lawyers who can help you win your case if repeatedly denied.

You would go to your local social security administration office and tell them that you need to apply for SSI but they will not give you very much money per year. The only other thing you can do is go through your work's insurance if they have a policy that covers that. good luck.

I have had a huge hassle getting my financial aid this semester.  I just recently received my loan disbursement even though my financial aid office told me we would get them 3 weeks ago.  My pell grant check was supposed be here Friday, and I still don't have it either.  I have never had this many problems trying to get my money from the school.  But a little advice for you:  start bugging them.  I called them everyday, along with many other students, until they got tired of it, and finally sent them out.  I understand that you need money, as so did I.  Just be patient, call them everyday, and try to stay as nice as possible.  Good Luck

Yes, filing late can affect the amount you receive.  Your PELL grant and Federal Loans will not be affected, you will receive the same on those no matter what time you file.  However, there are several limited need based funds.  That means, that students who have need are awarded these funds until they run out.  SEOG is one of these funds.  So your school most likely has spend all of their SEOG money at this point, so while you may meet the need requirements, if there is no money left can't award you.  Most state funds are limited and most institutional funds are limited.  The rule is, the earlier you apply, the more aid you may receive.  The FAFSA is available online every year, beginning Jan. 1st for the next academic year.  You should make it your own policy to complete your fafsa before your spring semester ends, that way you can talk with your school and take care of any verification and know what your award is before you leave for the summer.

A question about what is considered an "in-state" college tuition fee.?



Okay so i have a situation type question. Here goes:



If i am applying for a college in a state that i am not a resident of, but i am moving to, and I pay the out of state tuition fee for a year, would I only have to pay the In State fee after living in the state for a year, even though I am currently paying the Out Of State fee?



Or should i just live in the state for a year, then apply?



Many Thanks!

This is a question that gets asked here a lot, because it's an excellent question. Unfortunately, most of the answers that people offer for this question are incorrect. Some of the answers you have been given are partially correct, but as usual, there are some that are just not going to help you very much.



Every state has different rules, because the rules are a matter of state law - and of course, every state's legislature establishes its own laws.



That being said, the general underlying principle in every state is pretty much the same:



You can not move to a new state and attain residency if your primary purpose is to attend school.



Most (but not every state) share another significant stipulation:



You are automatically a resident of the state where your parents are domiciled, unless you are both a legal adult and completely financially independent of your parents. In other words, only a legal adult can establish residency in a state other than the one where their parents live.



You will frequently see advice that suggests that you can move to a state and attend school for a year as an out-of-state residence, and that this will allow you to magically become a state resident for years two, three and four. That is not true.



If you go back above, to where I said that you must move to a new state for a purpose other than to attend school - this is where the misunderstanding comes from.



All states begin with the presumption that you are not moving to that state with the present purpose of making that state your permanent resident. You must overcome that presumption as one part of your residency process. You can overcome that presumption by performing certain acts - such as:



Living in the state for a year
Getting a job and paying state taxes
Buying a home or renting an apartment
Registering a car
Registering to vote
Getting a state driver's license



These are all actions that help you demonstrate that you intend to make this new state your permanent residence - HOWEVER - you could perform every single one of these acts, and that wouldn't make you a state resident - you must still be able to satisfy all of the other parts of the state residency requirements.



Some states have near impossible standards. In many of these states, for example, you must be able to demonstrate that you are living off income and assets that are tied to and kept in that state. In others, you must demonstrate that the new state is your permanent residence by pretty much spending all of your time there. Go and visit your parents for more than 3 weeks in a year, and some states will automatically conclude that you're not really a permanent resident.



Generally speaking (there are exceptions), it is not possible to move to another state so that you can attend college there as a state resident. The rules are specifically designed to prevent exactly this. People who are trying to help are offering information based on what someone told them, or what they honestly believe to be true, but I would strongly recommend that you carefully review the state statute in any state that you are thinking of moving to for school.



The quickest way to find that statute is to enter the terms "tuition", "state residency" and the name of the state in a search engine.



Good luck to you - I hope this information helped.

Typically, you have to be a resident of said state for a year before you can get instate tuition. Check with the rules and regulations of the college you're applying to, but I'll bet you have to live off campus for a year, and change your drivers license and plate. You're not a resident if you have out of state plates, etc. I'd check with the administration dept for specifics though, nobody here can know the specific rules of an unknown college.

You need to speak to the admissions office.  The should have residency or domicile application.  Every school has a different set of criteria for determining who is a resident and who is not.



If you come to the school as at out-of-state student, you will have to prove to your school that you are in that state for purposes other then attending school.  You will most likely have to have a residence other then dorm, and a lease or mortgage with your name on it.  Usually you have to have your driver's license in the new state as well as insurance and register your car in the new state.  You usually have to have a job in that state and file state income taxes to that state, and be able to show that you earn enough money to support yourself without your support coming from your parents, who live in your old state.



So while you can't actually apply until a year from now, I would advise you to get the form/application now so you can see the criteria and have the whole year to make sure you are meeting all of the criteria and then you can actually submit the application at the appropriate time.

You need to check with that school/university/college to see what their definition of in-state means.  When I was in college in South Carolina, you had to have lived there for six months before applying for the in-state status but some states have different rules - you should be able to go to the admissions page in the catalog or website to ascertain their definition of the term.  If in doubt, see if there is a phone number listed in admissions and call asking to speak to a counselor or admissions clerk to make certain of their definition.  If you move to some areas, they see you have a local address and consider you as in-state but you need to find out their procedures and rules.

If you're able to support yourself for the year that you're not considered an in-state resident by the college, that sounds like the more financially sound method. A friend of mine to moved to CA from NH and she did the same thing - she waited to apply to school until she had lived there long enough to be eligible for the in-state tuition. She was happy she waited.

If you are a resident in that state at the time you apply, than you would be "in state". If you won't be a resident in that state for at least the first month or two of school, than you would put "out-of-state." If you plan on moving during the first month or two than contact the school and see what they say.

Does Stanford have a good financial aid/scholarship policy?



I'd really like to go to Stanford but I doubt if my family can afford it.  Does it offer generous financial aid?
And does Caltech have good financial aid/scholarship policies as well?
Thanks!

My Scholarship letter. Suggestions?!?



I was wondering if anyone with any expertise in this area could help make any useful suggestions for my scholarship letter? would be very much appreciated!! It is due very soon, and I don't know many people personally who have good suggestions to make.



Dear Sir/Madam,



I am writing to you to be considered for The --- Scholarship for studying at --- in the year 2009. One of my main reasons for applying for this Scholarship is to increase my motivation to excel in my studies in University.



After I have completed my foundation course, I am keen to further my studies by starting an Engineering Degree, Majoring in Computer Systems Engineering. With this degree, I will have an opportunity to find a suitable job in the IT-Sector where I can be of benefit to ---’s relatively new and expanding Technology Sector. Since I was young I’ve always had deep interests in Computer Systems, and at school I actively pursued and succeeded completing over 16 different Computer Systems and Electronics courses. It was not long before I found it was something I enjoyed, wanted to start a career in and knew I would be able to excel in. I also have within the last 5 years, developed an interest in architecture and currently considering applying for a few interest papers in the near future.



Previously while attending --- High School; I was a member of the A Grade Badminton team as well as participating in the School Orchestra as a violinist. I served as the Leader of the --- Youth Orchestra for a number of years and have been a member of the --- Badminton Club. When I was younger, I had taken piano classes and dropped out due to homework load. Now I have to say I greatly enjoy playing the piano in my spare time revising what I had learnt years ago, and would bring great pleasure for me to take up piano classes again.



One of the largest hindrances in my studies was I wasn’t used to the pressure from my last year of school. The step up to the last year was greater than I anticipated. I never intended to fail, and studied hard to pass. Unfortunately, my efforts fell short and disappointed me greatly. However, this was also a silver lining which boosted my motivation to work even harder next time.



I hope to able to help our community in the near future by improving computer-literacy in schools. This can be accomplished by setting up various computing courses which would help children and high-school aged students understand technology more, aid their studies, and help them use computers more efficiently.



Thank you very much for considering my request. I am eagerly awaiting your positive response.



Yours Gratefully,



---

Let me make sure I know what you're asking. Are you saying your college offered you a financial aid package that isn't enough, and you want to appeal for more aid?



In that case, you need to ask your school's financial aid department to reconsider your case. You'll need to prove to them that you have extraordinary unmet need, changed circumstances, an unusual situation, and/or other hardships that they might not have known about from just your FAFSA.



When you write your letter, be polite and professional (not rude and demanding!). You'll need to explain your situation, and probably include copies of any documentation (things like divorce papers, pink slips, emancipation, etc.) that support your appeal.

That's just to give you the general idea. Contact your school's financial aid department right away and find out exactly what their appeals process involves. You may only have a short period of time to make your appeal, so don't waste any time!

If I get good grades this next semester will I be able to get around $4000 in scholarships?



To put it simply, I'm supporting myself in college, my dad won't contribute any of his income to help me out.  Right now I'm paying through college through loans, but I don't feel comfortable doing that because I don't want to have overwhelming debt when I'm older.



Right now, my education's pretty much covered by a couple of grants.
I have one $2000 grant from my school and one $3500 from Wells Fargo (I'm a teller so it's one of the perks).  So that covers my education, registration.  My only other worry is books and housing.  Day to day expenses I pay through my job's income, and majority of rent too, but I still need some help because I live in CA and it's really expensive.  I was wondering if I get good grades this next semester (3.5 or higher) if I could realistically qualify for a $4000 scholarship so I don't have to put my apartment costs on loans.  (Apartment's about $800/month, and I only make $1200 a month, so it doesn't work out for me to pay without financial help).  Thank you in advance!

as far as i know, it takes more than just your grades to get a scholarship. a lot of scholarships require essays. also, since you live in california, you have to realize that there are A LOT of students competing for the same scholarships as you are. you should register in fastweb.com and see all the many different scholarships available to you. good luck!

Student load repayments help!



Since leaving college 7 years ago, ive never had a job paying over £15,000 therefore still owe the full sum back to Student Loan Company.  Can you please advise/help me to stop worrying, will they be adding interest on to this amount, (if so i dont think i will ever be able to pay it back), and what if i never get a job paying over £15,000, do they write it off at any point?



Im left a single parent of children (through no fault of my own) and it scares me to know this debt is hanging over me with no way of paying it.

NO - Don't consolidate a student loan with another loan.

Student loans DO add interest, but it is only a small amount. I have a student loan as well and am also a single parent now, not earning enough to pay it back at the moment. When you are earning enough they only take a small part of your income, it wont be a lot. I believe they also write off anything you have not paid after 25 years.



I know this seems like a long time, but it is really not as bad as it seems. A normal loan such as a consolidation loan, will add a huge amount of interest and dont care whether you can afford to pay it back or not, they want their money each month. The student loan will only take what you can afford to repay. Dont worry about it!

I have to add that I am from the UK, I dont know where you are so this is based on what I know of UK student loans.

It's written off after so long (I think it's 25 years but I could be completely wrong). So if you never have a job earning over £15000 you will never have to pay back your student loan.

Here's the page on the government website about paying back your student loan, including some stuff about interest and how much you will pay if you ever earn over £15000.

There's no need to worry, they can't take money from you that you don't have and you won't get loan sharks coming after you!

Yes they will be adding interest, you should get a statement every year.

If you get to 65 and have never earned over £15000 then the loan is written off and you never pay it back.

It is the cheapest form of lending so don't worry too much about it. A lot of people are in the same situation.

ICS is a private company so they charge the same fees for everyone. If you are on a low income then you would be better contacting your local college. As well as evening classes some do flexible learning which is similar to a correspondence course.

Neither myself or my friends have recieved their notice yet, they're having to go through hundreds of thousands (probably) of application forms - your EMA will get backdated anyway if they don't send you the notice by the time you start school. Call them! I'm making my dad ring them on Monday, just to make sure everything's alright with the application. :)

If the car is on Hire Purchase, it belongs to the credit company and they will take it back.  Bankruptcy cancels the agreement.  If money was borrowed as a personal loan, the OR has a certain amount of discretion as to whether the car is one of the "tools of his trade".  The credit company go on the list of creditors.  The car goes on the list of assets.

Very, very unlikely that the car will be taken, unless it is of high value, such as a Porsche or Merc etc. You need to make it clear to the OR that you use it for work, and there should be no problem.

Students receive three amounts each year (one per term).  You receive approximately £3000 a year.
On top of that students have to pay their fees every year.  For most students these are paid for them and then they have to pay that back.  The fees are normally around £4000 a year.
Meaning . . . most students will owe £21,000 when they graduate - so trust me times have changed! Whoever said education was free obviously didn't go to University under a Labour government!

Not sure what Empress is talking about...what is that £3000 a year you're talking about for? Because you then mention fees so it can't be that. You can get a maintenance loan or grant but it's means tested. And fees aren't about £4000 a year, they're much closer to £3000. Every student gets a loan to pay off their fees, they start paying it back when they earn over £15000 a year and then they pay back 9% of however much they earn over that amount. If it's not payed back in a certain time it's written off.

The maximum fees for 2008 are actually £3145. Everyone gets a loan from the government, which you don't start paying back until you're earning £15,000 and even then it's only 9% of anything over (i.e. if you earn £16000, you would only pay 9% of the £1000 over 15 thousand). It's something like after 25 years if you haven't paid it back it's written off.

A lot more students are also eligible for a maintenance grant that you DON'T have to pay back. If your household income is less than £25000 you get a full grant of £2835 a year. If your income is between £25,000 and £60,000 you get a partial maintance grant.

You can also get loans to cover living costs too. The maximum available outside of London is £4625. 75% is non-means tested. 25% is means tested. It is paid in three installments at the beginning of each term.

Colleges and universities are also required to offer non repayable bursuries to those recieving a full maintance grant if they charge over a certain amount for fees.

So yeah, if you have a full loan, you can leave university with debts of £21,000. If you're from a lower income household though and you're getting a maintenance grant and bursuries from your college/universities etc, you could only be paying your tuition fees of £9000 back.

Funding postgraduate social work course with bad credit history?



I am in debt from my first degree (student overdraft) and a recent spell where I had to extend an overdraft when I was out of work. I have defaulted quite recently on a repayment. 
I am desperate to train as a social worker but need to consolidate these debts. I know I am entitled to an NHS bursary and a maintenence grant totalling about 6k but need the extra to start afresh financially and relocate for this course

Would the CDL even consider me? 
If not, what other options do I have?
I did consider doing a 2nd undergrad degree where you get a student loan but that means more debt when I qualify :(

The total student support package, what the US and some others call financial aid, includes:

(Studying in England, Wales or Northern Ireland):

Support for Living Costs: 
Maximum of £4,510 ($8,461) for students outside London, or a maximum of £5,565 ($10,440) for students studying inside the London region of England.

Loan for Tuition Fees:  £3,100 ($5,812)
Total Package:  £7,610 ($14,277) or £8,665 ($16,256)



However British students tend not to include the tuition fee loan, talking only about the living costs.  The amount given for living costs is more if a person studies in London region of England, as it is more expensive than the rest of the UK.

People who have lived in Scotland for at least 3 years do not have to pay tuition fees if they go to a Scottish university.  If they choose to go to a university in one of the other 3 home-nations then the Scottish taxpayer covers the amount of tuition they would pay a Scottish University (£1,100 = $2,063) but the student has to take a loan for the rest.  I think Wales might have a similar arrangement for people who live there.

It's pretty complicated because the amount you get is based on things like your parents income level.  In theory everybody should get around the same amount, but students from families with low incomes receive more of the money as a non-repayable grant rather than a loan. There's also something called the 'family contribution' which basically means that the government works out how much of a student's living costs should be paid directly by their parents, and reduces the amount of loan/grant accordingly.  Legally a student can sue their parents for this money, but in the whole of the UK I've only ever heard of one student actually taking them to court:  In my experience most students just don't ask for it.

Mark has pretty much answered your question. The 12k you might have heard of is for postgraduate study; the stipend you get (if you have funding from a research council for example) is usually around this amount, I think the minimum this year is just under 13k.

How can I get aid for college without the FAFSA?



My parents REFUSE to give me their information. Flat out refuse... On top of that, I'd have to use my Mom and Stepdad's info (per the FASFA guidelines because it states to use the info for the parent you lived with the most and my mom had full custody of me) ...which would be useless because my Stepdad makes 500k a year. I haven't lived at home for 4 years and I am currently on medical leave from work so my income is cut, and there is no way I can afford to pay for school. I'm only 22, not married, never been in the service and do not have any children so according to the application I have to file dependent even though I file my own taxes and have my own place in my name.



I need help asap...
Oh , and fyi, my parents wont pay for me to go to school. They will not help me financially in any way shape or form.



</question>



<additional details>



Oh, believe it or not. Guilt tripping will not work. I've tried that since I was 17 and the FAFSA was an assignment in my College prep class.

It might be hard to fathom for most people, but some parents really truly do not care.

Most schools have their own scholarships/grants you can apply for. I am probably mistaken, but I thought if you filed your own taxes and didn't live at home, then you would be considered independent.
The best thing to do is talk to the financial aide officer at your school, they are familiar with every possible situation and can guide you what to do.
Good luck.
BTW..to the person who gave me a "thumbs down" for this answer...you must be very odd..what would you like me to tell her..that if she clicks her heels and makes a wish that mommy and daddy will give her the money then it will happen?  She doesn't have many options other then the ones I gave her. Have a nice day.
Sometimes you just have to suck it up and play by the rules..we all have to do it.

If you decide to borrow money, be aware of what's going on in the student loan industry, today. Studentloanjustice.org has links to articles that expose some of the unethical practices of certain lenders. Schools often receive kickbacks when they push their students to borrow money from these lenders so you can't necessarily trust financial aid advisers either. Since your parents aren't helping you or giving you advice, you need to be sharper than most students when it comes to making decisions about borrowing money.

I'm sorry for your situation.  I see this all too often.

Have you tried having a financial aid officer from the school call and speak to them?  Sometimes having a person of 'authority' discuss this with uncooperative parents helps.  Once a parent/s understands that completing the FAFSA does NOT bind them financially they are a little more willing to follow through.

It's just a thought and sometimes it works.

Does anybody know how I can find a scholarship to get me through nursing school. I am about finish with all the pre-reqs required for the upper - division nursing program at a university. For those who dont know upper- division just means you have a 2-year degree with some other major  and you want to pursue a 4-year degree in nursing. Anyway,although I am almost finish with all my pre-reqs and I'm almost ready to apply to nursing school.I have know clue as to how I am going to support my family while I am in school. I heard working fulltime while in nursing school is a no, no. I do not have the best credit so I do not think I can get approved for student loans. Can any one help??

Your credit score should not affect your eligibility for federal financial aid, including federal student loans, as long as you have not defaulted on any student loans. Eligibility guidelines can be found here: http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/faq003.htm

An excellent site to find scholarship information is FastWeb: http://www.fastweb.com

You might also want to do a web search for "nursing loan forgiveness" that would repay some loans that you may take out. Depending on the program you may need to apply now, or you may need to wait until you get your nursing degree and are employed. There are federal and state programs, such as http://bhpr.hrsa.gov/nursing/loanrepay.h... Guidelines for state programs vary.

Another resource that may be of assistance for scholarships, etc. is http://www.minoritynurse.com/financial/s...

Go to the reference section of your local library, ask for a listing of local charitable trusts, apply for a bursary award from the college your daughter is attending! The Laura Ashley Foundation used to specialise  in assisting young women that were experiencing financial problems with fees for education, try them!
It would be beneficial to fill in the spare time with extra courses.

Call around or ask friends. I usually hear about jobs via word of mouth. Then draft up a nice resume. I have one saved on my computer. even if the job has just an application and asks for no resume, attach one anyway. Dress the job. If your applying at a bar don't wear a suit and if your applying for a desk job don't wear street clothes. When you turn in the application ask to speak to the recruiting director or manager and get some face time in with them and let them know who you are. If you don't get a call back in a week, call them following up on your application. Good luck!

Where do i find support to be able to study psychological counseling?



I have been in an abusive relationship. I know where i went wrong. I want to study counselling to be able to help other young women not fall into the same trap.I am a high school teacher, 29yrs old, a single mother of one. Am from kenya, East Africa, and would really wish to take a masters degree from the USU UNIVERSITY IN KENYA , but cannot make ends meet. I seriously want to become a counsellor and give back to community,my advice to women all over the world. Keep off married men,They are a no go zone.I have such a long story to tell.Sometimes I wish  I could get a chance to talk to other young women on trash and share my experience, I know one day my dream will come true.

What happens when you are rewarded more scholarship money than you need for the school year?



This is not financial aid per say, it is outside scholarships. Not loans. Not grants. Do they take it back? The organizations that awarded them?

If it is already added to your ledger card at whatever school you are at(in other words - deposited toward your tuition/expenses)  then the school has to issue you a credit.  Either that or they can lower your loans.

When you go through Financial Aid you have to fill out a Credit Balance Return form - wherever you designated a credit to go to - whether yourself or your loans - that's where it will go.



Go to the student accounts office or Bursur and ask for a print out of your account with the school - if you are in a credit go to financial aid and ask them where your overages go and if you can be issued a check.



For my students - I take the amount of time they are left in school and divide the overage by how many months and issue a monthly check.

If it's a scholarship that's being awarded for some kind of merit (which scholarships usually are) they wouldn't take any of it back because it would basically be money you earned.

The only way they usually take money back is if it is financial aid, which means the government is giving it to you.

You are supposed to tell your school that you are receiving this money because most would lower your loan amount and use the scholarship money towards your classes. 
If the scholarship organizations give you the money directly, then you can do whatever you want with it, however, you should do the RIGHT thing and use all of it for educational purposes. My organization gives out scholarships and nothing pisses me off more than students saying they are going to buy things like a video game system with the extra money because there are people out there that are unable to even attend school because lack of funds.

Student finance - change of circumstance?



Didn't meet requirements for the course I wanted. Uni offered me the same course with a foundation year. I accepted. A different course means I need to inform Student Finance Direct of the change. I have most of the form filled in apart from the tuition fee for my course 08/09.



Since I'll be on a foundation year 08/09, how much is the tuition fee? The original fee was £3145...doesn't this half or something for a foundation year? I don't know and none of the sites I'm finding are helping. Please help, this is really important!

I got approved a while ago, when I applied for the course I wanted the Fee for it was £3,070, then a couple of weeks ago I got an email from the University saying, "Oh sorry due to blah blah blah, something or other, the Fee has risen to £3,145"

Okay so by now all my Student Finance has been approved and then I have to get in touch with them again and get them to change it to £3,145.



I think no matter what happens to you, you will always get what you asked for although, i'm not liking the idea of the interest fee's being doubled starting this year.  Last year it was 2.4%, now it's 4.8%, we have to pay a hell of a load extra.

Oh yea, should you not have fully got accepted to the course you wanted before applying for student finance, I applied for my course in October and applied for my Student Finance in March, which was the earliest time possible, either way, a foundation year will cost the same as a normal one, it just means that now you have 4 years instead of 3.

Students and parents who must deal with the high cost of a college education have available to them a wide range of student loans. This article offers details on three general types of student loans. Unlike other student loans, application for a specific Stafford Loan should be preceded by the filing of a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA application should be made in the name of the aspiring student. The process of applying for a Stafford Loan differs in a second way from the application process for other student loans - and application for a Stafford Loan does not require a credit check. There is no uniform method for the delivery of money from a Stafford Loan. Some students get the money directly from their school; other Loan recipients get the money from a bank or other lender.In order to get a Signature Loan, a student must attend a four year or two year school on at least a half time basis. That student must also meet certain credit criteria.



http://www.worldbestloans.com/

Like some other student loans, application for the Signature Loan permits the use of a co-signer. In fact, there is a real advantage to applying for a Signature Loan with a co-signer. That process can lead to a reduction in the interest on the loan. And, if after graduation, the student then makes 24 successive payments, the co-signer is removed from responsibility for covering the loan expenses.  If a students plans to go to a community college, then he or she ought to consider getting a Signature Loan. Unlike other student loans, the Signature Loan rewards student applicants who have a good credit rating. Those applicants can get a lower interest rate or a lower application fee.

Transcripts HELP PLEASE!!!! Can I just 'start over'?



I went to a community college a few semesters ago but did poorly because I was unmotivated. I blame myself for my poor academic performance. Currently, I am trying to attend another community college, and get into a nursing program. I was  wondering if the transcript department would DEMAND to see my previous college transcripts, which amount to less than 20 hours and have  less than a 2.0 GPA, or would they be willing to give me an academic fresh start since I have been out of college for a few semesters?



Is there anyway I can just attend general ed required core classes, in order to prep for being accepted into this community colleges nursing program, without having to disclose this my embarressing track record to an advisor?

What's the LIKELYHOOD that they will or will not require to see my previous transcripts? 
(Remember- I don't even want include them; I'd prefer to start over so they don't lower my GPA and chances of being selected for the nursing program. )

Okay, so you had a false start to college, but you're now re-enrolled at a new school, and you're wondering if the past is going to come back to haunt you.

Here's my advice:

Obviously, it's important to work hard, stay focused and get good grades at your new school. If you can, take the same classes again (or their nearest equivalents), and make sure you earn good grades in those classes. Remember, if you want to count any of those old classes towards your degree requirements, you are opening the door to an evaluation of ALL of those old grades, you can't expect to cherry-pick the grades you like, and ask a school to ignore the others.

Use your previous poor performance as a motivation aid. Commit yourself to the determination to demonstrate what you are really capable of.

Then...

When you apply to nursing school...

Tell the nursing school all about those bad grades. "Look at these," you'll say, "I'm not embarrassed by them. Do you know why? Because these motivated me to do THIS!" and then show them your new and improved grades.

When the nursing school compares your D in English Comp with an A the second time around, and that C in Introduction to Biology with yet another A, they'll see how much more mature and focused you were in  your return to school.

If you get the opportunity to write an essay - focus the essay specifically on the "lessons I learned from my horrible college start", and tell the admissions department that you're actually glad you did so poorly, because it took a little shaking up to get you on the right track.

Don't let your old transcripts come back to haunt you by trying to hide from them - instead, use them as Exhibit #1 for just how dedicated and determined and capable you really are.

Good luck to you - I hope that encouraged you a bit.

Does Stanford have a good financial aid/scholarship policy?



I'd really like to go to Stanford but I doubt if my family can afford it.  Does it offer generous financial aid?
And does Caltech have good financial aid/scholarship policies as well?
Thanks!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Okay, how's this for Stanford's financial assistance?



If your mom and dad have a combined income of less than $100,000, a Stanford student pays no tuition.



If your mom and dad have a combined income of less than $60,000 a year, a Stanford students gets room and board thrown in for free, too.



How big of a deal is that?



The estimated cost of tuition, room and board for Stanford this year is $47,212.



Then again, Caltech is no slouch, either. According to the College Money Handbook 2008, Caltech provided sufficient funds to cover 100% of the financial aid need of their entire freshman class.



The issue is not paying for these schools - it's getting in. Either your parents have sufficient funds to pay for your schooling at Stanford or Caltech, or the school will pretty much pick up the tab for you. Caltech accepts fewer than 17% of its applicants and Stanford accepts less than 10%.



I hope this helped - good luck to you!

I can't find anything that I am eligible for.  I am unmarried, have no children, am making minimum wage, and attending school part time.  Am I missing something or am I screwed?

Generally, if you file for your FAFSA's --- you get all available grants and federal loans that apply to you.

Make sure, when going to this website that it has the ".gov" in the web address. There are quite a few impersonators out there.

The Address is www.fafsa.ed.gov

Before filling out your fafsa form however, you must apply for a pin at

www.pin.ed.gov

If you are a dependent, you must also apply for another pin for one of your parents.

The pin is your signature, since everything is now officially done over the computer and no paper forms are allowed to be mailed in. Good Luck!

ALSO: You might be eligible for loans.

Subsidized loans are offered to students based on demonstrated financial need. So as long as your income taxes present this to the government, then you will be able to accept a Fed Dir Sub Loan.

Subsidized loans are the best loans because the federal government pays off the interest of the loan while you are still in school and during the grace period. They start charging you interest only after the grace period, which comes after you've graduated from college.

So, filing your FAFSA's and renewing it each year would make you qualified and/or eligible for:

Scholarships
Federal Loans (Bank loans are evil. Stay away!!)
Federal Grants

Also, if you file your fafsa's it gives your universities financial office the ability to hand out a university scholarship or grant, based on how much more money you would need.

If you receive well beyond the necessary amount of money, you get that back from your school in a form of a refund check.

With this check you can purchase a laptop and textbooks (Which could run you to about $300-$500 a semester, depending on your courses.

I would advise you keep the rest of the money in a high-interest savings account so that if you don't receive much money in the following years, you can dip into your original funds.

Good Luck!!

Hello Every body,



I live in the US and i really have never seen goodness shown to me this
much in my life as i am a struggling mum with three kids and i have been going
through really rough times in my life and my name is Helen
Peters and in all this hard times, a worse incident occured in my life as i
lost my job which was my only means of survival and things became really bad as
i had bills to pay and my last son suffered a knee injury incurred when he fell
from a tree house and the doctors informed me that he needed a surgical
operation for his knee so he could walk again and at this point, life was
useless to me as i have no family and no one to run to and each night, i will
sit down and cry till the break of dun until one day, i read an advert on yahoo
answers of man that stated that he could help people in my shoes with loans and
in my desperate situation, i had no choice but i had to try and so shocking and
suprising, it was like an impossibility becoming a reality, i got a loan of
$75,000 USD even with my bad credit within 48 hours and my sons surgery was done
and thank GOD it was successful and now, i am okay and living in comfort with my
kids and i said to my self, i have never ever seen this kind of wonder in life
and i decided i will tell it to the whole wild world and i need every one to
thank GOD for Mr Patrick Harvey, the man GOD used to rescue me and my family
even when all hope had been lost and gone and i will say to every one, no matter
how dark and sinful the world is today, there are still GOD fearing and reliable
people on earth and if you are in my former situation or require a loan
legitimately, i will advice you contact this loan lender and you can reach him
via patrickharvey12@yahoo.com and i want you all to pray for this man for me.

Student loans are meant to help students who are unable to bear their educational expenses. Student loans are different in different countries in the way they are devised, but then the common types of student loans available are the undergraduate loans, college student loans, private student loans and federal family educational loans. Most of the student loans are issued by the government generally with lower interest rates when compared with the regular loans.

http://www.worldbestloans.com/student-lo...

Student loan repayments are not made until the student completes his graduation. This facility helps him to concentrate on his studies and earn some little amount of money while he is studying, but repayment has to start once he finishes his education. There is a grace period of six months normally after the graduation, meant to be a cushioning period for the student to get into a job and start earning. Under certain circumstances, the federal student loans can be forgiven on an income contingent plan after 25 years. Also the payments are required to be paid off within a minimum period of time.

Yes, you can get a second loan provided that you didn't reach your lifetime cap.  And usually for an undergrad degree you rarely do reach it.  Now what a student loan won't cover is the same level degree ie. a second BA....in order to qualify you would need to consider getting a MA in Elementary Education.  Going this route you may even qualify for the governmental TEACH grant.  For more information go to

STUDENT LOAN QUESTION?



I plan to begin grad school in the spring 09 semester. When I take out a student PLUS loan for grad school that is more than the amount needed for tuition etc., is it possible to receive the check (overages) prior to the start of the semester?  Or does the semester have to start first in January 2009 in order to receive it?



</question>



<additional details>



To answer found-1's question, I am going to a small privately funded school in northwestern NJ.  I attended this same school for my undergrad degree.  Usually I received the overage checks AFTER school started but this is because I took out the loans AFTER school started.  I plan to take out the loan very soon (October) so I am guessing the loan money will not come back around to me until January according to what you have said?

The other person did not answer my question, they explained repayment of the loan I am asking about the overage check you get during the course of the semester generally.

The answer to this question really depends on the school you are going to attend.  I have seen some schools have overage checks ready to go out to non-freshman a week before school starts, but many wont risk this sort of kindness and you will have to wait until a few weeks until after the semester has started (as long as you got your paperwork in by their deadline).  Some folks who miss deadlines may have to wait WAY longer than a few weeks to get money.
Sorry I couldn't be more help.

Once the consolidation company pays the lender, the lender will then send a letter to you stating that they received the money and that you are no longer in default status.  But all that depends on how fast each company moves.  So it can take up to two or four weeks.  And it will be the Loan Guarantor that will remove the default status.

If your school is not recognized by the US Department of Education you aren't going to be able to get any student loan.  In 2004 the only loan source pulled out of the Caribbean, except for those schools that are recognized.

So that you understand the issue, here's what is happening:  The owners of the majority of Caribbean schools that have been in existence for a few years, but are not recognized by the DoE, have knocked on every potential door for student loans.  But in order for a loan source to have any comfort level they want to see the accounting information and compliance with accreditation standards to ensure that any student who attends the school is receiving an adequate education (not that a loan source cares about the education itself, but that a student would have a reasonable chance to graduate and repay the loan).  But a combination of being unwilling to reveal the financial information and a failure to provide an adequate level of education, no loan source has been willing to underwrite any student loans.

About the only two options I can think of for you are seeking a peer-to-peer loan (Google that term to find the web sites) or taking out personal loans in an amount that would cover your education and make the payments all the way through medical school.

Thanks for taking the time to read my question fully. I will check out those peer-peer loans and pray very hard. Thanks!

yes, as far as federal funds and state funds, they may have their institutional funds and can distribute then anyway they wish.

Definately! I think America has great financial aid options, especially if you're low income. Apply for FAFSA, it is based on income, or your parents income. Also you can get school loans. Some of them like the stafford subsidized loan you can pay after you graduate (they give you 6 months after you graduate to start paying!

In order to received financial aid, you must not owe repayment of previous grants. So, being unable to pay this back will not affect you immediately, but you will not be eligible for any other federal grants until you pay this one back.



If you are having big problems paying back this grant, your financial aid office should be able to offer you assistance in locating an alternative funding source to pay this grant back.

you won't be able to receive any future aid until you resolve the grant overpayment.  And yes, they can and will take the money from your tax refund and/or garnish your wages.

Apart from job hunting....how do you spend your time??



I'm unemployed but cant get benefits so am officially broke.:-(



I spend a few hours a day job hunting, either in town, online, going for interviews or all 3. but am finding myself bored the rest of the time as all my friends are workin/in college during the day.



I tidy the house, take my dog out for walks etc but am finding it hard to fill the hours I spend waiting to hear about a job.

Go to college.  Do an Access course.  Great fun, and beneficial.  I'm doing one right now and I am finding it thoroughly enjoyable, and I will be starting university next september.  You can get an ALG or an EMA (adult learning grant, education maintenance allowance) which isn't much but it is better than nothing.  You could also try getting a job in a pub or a restaurant to tide you over until you decide what to do.



Hope you find something soon

Hey, I'm unemployed too!  As of friday... I spent friday crying, monday and tuesday job hunting, and today just in front of the telly and here.  It's so depressing isn't it, I feel so so useless.  However, I remember during school holidays I used to set myself tasks - I had a book list to get through of books I thought I'd better read, like Pride and Prejudice, and Great Expectations, and the Bible.  And during one school holiday I learnt to wolf whistle... boring things like that really.



Ooh, and I'm starting volunteering soon - join me!  As soon as I get rid of this cold I'm going down to the local rspca to do some dog walking or something.

Some vet clinics welcome people who could walk dogs, or you could put an ad offering to do the ironing/some babysitting or help in an old people's home. With Christmas coming shops will be busy and will probably require extra staff.

First, you should apply for all of the government assistance you can, to lower your living expenses.  Also enroll in school and apply for financial aid and scholarships.



I was laid-off two years ago and just got my AA degree last semester.  Currently I am working towards my BA, after which I will be better qualified to work a job that pays decently.



You can also do volunteer work.  Volunteer hours count on your taxes so keep track of them!

I've been employed for about 2 months. Spent one year at university but decided to take a year out to earn money (ironically).



OK, first thing is to make sure you don't become lazy. I spent the first couple of weeks waking up around 4 p.m and going to bed whenever I felt like it. My day consisted of watching daytime tv in my pj's and scratching myself. Time just passes slower though and you go to bed later and later.



At the moment, I try to wake up around 9a.m, have a nice lazy breakfast. Where I move fairly slowly but make myself loads of nice food (big cooked breakfast with coffee). This should take you to around half 10 where you proceed to have a leisurely shower and get ready, until about half 11, 12ish. I then spend the next few hours looking for a job/chasing up interviews etc. After that, I go to the gym. I'm also joining a squash league in about a month so - you may laugh at this - but I just go down on my todd and practice for about half an hour. This takes me to around 5/6ish. I then have dinner.



Then I just try to keep my mind as active as possible and the computer is a great resource for this. I'm teaching myself how to program and have a small business type thing going on ebay, which takes up a few hours. I also go on Y!A (obviously). So that I'm not a complete loner, I will then probably call a friend and have a chat for a bit, waste a bit more time on the computer then head to bed about 12ish.



There are other things to do, but this day costs about £40 a month (gym membership) and as you're unemployed, I'd also assume your skint.



Haha I can't believe I went into so much detail! Meh, proves your point of how bored you get really.



Good luck though!

Join your local library and read. Give yourself the education some of your friends are getting in college. Some of the most successful people on the planet are autodidacts (self taught).



You might also pick up some knowledge and skills that might be useful in getting a job.



Good luck and I hope you get a job soon. I know from personal experience just how demoralising being unemployed can be.

If I've gotten student loans before, can I get any more in the future?



Actually my question is a little more complex than that in the title. I've been accepted into a college, and in order to go, I need some financial aid. So, the school sent me a financial aid form to fill out and send back to them. At the end of the form, there is a terms & conditions section that I have to agree to in order to be eligible for aid. One of the the terms is as follows:



"I certify that I AM NOT in default or owe a refund at ANY institution of post secondary education for a Student Loan, PLUS loan, Federal Insured Student Loan, PELL or FSEOG Grants, College Work Study or National Direct Student Loan."



I know what it means to be in default with a loan, but what I'm not completely certain of is what it means to owe a "refund" to a loan. Does that mean if I am making payments on a loan (or loans) as of right now, I can't apply for any more loans? I presently do owe on some loans, and I just want to make sure that the whole "owing a refund" thing doesn't mean that I won't be eligible for more aid.  Anyways, if anybody out there can help me with this, it would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to sign the form and lie to my school... Just wanna make sure if I sign it, I understand completely the terms and conditions. Thank you much! :-)

You would owe a refund for a student loan if you had borrowed, gone to school, dropped out, but not turned back any funds that the school gave back to you, to the original source of the funding.



The loans are assumed to carry you to graduation or to the next year of you program...so if you bailed, you owe the unused tuition and materials money back.



You should verify your situation with the school to be sure, but from the wording you have here, 'refund' is not the same as making payments on past loans.

A Scholarship Essay over the topic of "Chasing the Dream"?



I am trying to write an scholarship essay with the topic of "Chasing the Dream".
Here is the descriptions of the essay:
The essay may be on any topic of your choosing as long as it includes:



1. Your reason for deciding to attend college - were there any motivating factors that influenced your decision to pursue a college degree?



2. Your chosen college major - please discuss the major you selected and how you arrived at that decision.



3.Any reasons for why you believe you deserve the scholarship.



Let me add some of my personal background. I came to this country 6 years ago, going to college and live the life like a true American had always been my dream but my family wants me to stick with the old tradition and opposing my decision to get my undergrad degree. Although I am on this on my own but it is the concept of "American Dream" that is keeping me going. So do you think I would write a good essay out of this topic? Give suggestions!



Thanks!

The lady at the school was correct.  You were supposed to file the 08-09 FAFSA.  This is for Fall Semester of 2008 (which is already in process) and Spring Semester of 09, which starts in January.  Then you will probably take summer off.  You're seeing an award amount for Fall Semester, because some school start later than others, but if you are not attending, that money will not be disbursed to you or to your school.  That money will just be written off your records and go to somebody else.  Don't worry, you did everything correct!

You need to call them and get it all straightened out. They can help you understand and fix anything if it needs to be fixed. Good luck with it! I had to call them over the phone

The only place that you will get the right answer to your questions is fro the Financial Aid Office of the college that you will attending.  You need to talk with a Financial Aid Counselor at your college.  Your Financial Aid Office may not be award the you will not be attending until the spring semester.  Inter office information flow does not always happen very quickly on some college campuses.

I will be applying to FAFSA in the spring because i will be attending college in the Fall. I don't have much money. My aunt is going to try to help me out for the first year or 2 of college. My mom passed away in Feb. 2006 when i was 14 so is their anyway that i would be able to get more help? As seeing as  my dad is not even involved in my life. How much money does FAFSA usually give to help out for college?

The FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is just a form that you complete to initially apply for Federal financial aid.  The information is sent to the Financial Aid Offices of the colleges that you indicate on the FAFSA.  The Financial Aid Offices of the colleges that received your FAFSA and that you have been accepted at will determine how much Federal aid and institutional aid you qualify for.  Due to your family situation, you should speak with a financial aid counselor at the colleges you are interested in about your financial situation and what additional forms you may need to complete to apply for aid at that school.



A financial aid package, which is offered by the Financial Aid Offices once you have been accepted to the college, includes both federal aid, state aid and institutional aid (the college's own aid).  You need to ask if there are any other forms to be completed to apply for aid from you State or from the college.  Financial Aid programs that are a part of the aid package can be grants, work and loans.

Umm I applied for the FAFSA and got 4,000 and i have been using all of that to pay for books and gas and all that stuff  along with tuiton...but i am pretty sure that you do not pay it back. If you do have to pay it back then half the people at my school need to be aware of this...lol you might wanna get a second opinion i can almost swear you do not have to pay it back. FAFSA amounts vary for different people and their situations. I would suggest being very truthful on it though. It will at least be enough to help you pay half or maybe if you are lucky all of it. I would talk to a high school counselor or maybe go to the college that you are applying to and see them about financial aid. They can give you more advice and information on this and also they can tell you about other forms of financial aid that they provide like scholarships you do not have to pay back.

FAFSA is a loan...remember that it has to be paid back. You must start paying it back 6 months after you graduate (sooner if you drop out).  You are going to want to apply for grants or scholarships, ask you guidance counselor at your high school they should have more information.  There is the Hope learning credit which is like $2, 000 that you can claim on you taxes, if you are still considered dependent your aunt can claim it.  (If Obama wins this will double).



I think it is $5,000 a semester for FAFSA- but do not borrow all of it if you don't need it, it's not worth it to graduate with a huge debt--believe me I made this mistake.

There is no "usual" amount for FAFSA. FAFSA is entirely determined by your and your parent's (or guardian's) income. If you are low-income you can get a lot of aid, if you're middle to upper class you're probably going to get nothing.
Last year, from FAFSA, I received around 16k out of my $20k tuition cost. But that's because my mum made only $4k that year. (And she'll only be making around $12k this year so I'm expecting to see similar results.)

Can you receive Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for an accredited college of Independent Study/Distance Learning?



I am an adult with a good full-time day job who needs a degree to advance my career.  My local colleges do not offer evening classes for the degree I am trying to pursue.  Therefore, I am looking into colleges that offer Independent Study and/or Distance Learning. I found quite a few Independent Study/Distance Learning colleges that are accredited and meets the standards required for my advancement. I have received information from these colleges, as well as information on paying for it. Most offers an institutionall financing program (not affordable), or suggest employer tuitionreimbursementt (I don't qualify) or personal loans such as Sallie Mae (I got denied).  However, none of them mentioned applying for FAFSA. I decided to try it anyhow and tried to complete a FAFSA on the web, but when I went to search for school codes for several accredited Independent Study/Distance Learning colleges, I kept getting the message "no school codes were found".  Can you not receive Federal Financial Aid for this type of education??

Schools that offer only "correspondence-style" Distance Learning Programs are not eligible for participation in the federal student aid system, because they violate the participation standard known as the Correspondence Course limitation.



Schools that offer "telecommunications-style" Distance Learning Programs are eligible for participation.



"A telecommunications course is one that is offered principally through the use of one or more technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between these students and the instructor, whether asynchronously or in “real-time.”



"A correspondence course is a home-study course provided by a school under which the school provides instructional materials, including examinations on the materials, to students who are not physically attending classes at the school. When a student completes a portion of the instructional materials, the student takes the examinations that relate to that portion of the materials and returns the examinations to the school for grading."



If a school offers more than 50% of its courses by correspondence, it is not eligible to participate in the federal aid program.



If your school offers telecommunication courses, it may be eligible to participate, but it must also satisfy other participation criteria.



Here's the thing: The criteria that the Department of Education uses to evaluate schools that apply to the program are criteria that are important to the students, themselves. They all relate to the quality of the program, and the success of the program in graduating and placing students in employment. As you can imagine, participation in the aid system is a big plus for any school, so you really have to wonder why a school would intentionally elect not to participate. If a program does not participate, that's a big red flag for you.



You can get federal aid for distance learning programs, but you'll need to continue searching for schools that are accepted participants. That's your guarantee of quality, institutional control and reliability.



Good luck!

You need to go to the financial aid department at your college and let them know what is going on.  I had the same thing happen to me and all I had to do was prove my income had changed.  I just got a letter stating that I was no longer employed and they sent in the information and I was able to receive more money for school.  Good Luck!

Did you fill out FAFSA? If you qualify for those types of loans your schools financial aid office will be able to help you. If you are offered loan money, you accept, do a quick online quick called entrance counseling, and they will send you the check...do with it what you want. I guess if you didn't fill out FAFSA you could talk to people in your fin aid office and ask about different types of student loans. I have loans through banks too, you can check on websites and apply.

Pick any concentration. Then just make sure to take the general Classes that can apply to any concentration. While taking that first semester, shop around and see what interests you. When you make up your mind, go to the administration offices and change your concentration to whatever it is you choose. Any student counselor can help you with this.
