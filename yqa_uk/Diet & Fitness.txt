How do u stop ''come down'' on pills?



I took some pills last night for the 1st time and now i have the so called ''come down'', my heart is racing and don't wanna even come out of my room!  how can i stop it?



</question>



<additional details>



I had to call in sick for work today as there was no way I would be able to face it, although I am feeling a little better - my heart beat has slowed down and I feel a lot more relaxed.



That was one of the worst experiences i have been through and i'm never gonna touch that dirty drug again!



Thanks for your anwers except for a few - i'm not trying to lose weight!!



The worst thing was I was clubbing untill 6am and then got home about 9am that's when it kicked it in - my body felt tired and wanted to sleep but my brain was 2 active!

sleep. Lots and lots of natural sleep. If you cant sleep then try eating lots of fruit or veg- vitamin c works wonders. Nothing stops it though Im afriad- your brain has to create all the happy hormones you've used up too quickly by taking the pills.

I feel for you, eating won't be easy. I'd suggest just drink some fizzy sugary drinks and get your head down and sleep although thats normally easier said than done.



Edit: To the two idiots directly below these are quite clearly not diet or prescription pills!! I'll let you use your imagination.

Take deep breaths.  Breath in deep for ten seconds, from your belly (you should be able to see it rise), then exhale.  Repeat this several times.  It should slow your heart rate down by 10 bpm.



Also, drink A LOT of water to flush your system.



Don't forget what this feels like, ok?  It is very dangerous.  There are great methods to lose weight; this is, by far, one of the worst.



You will be fine, though. :-)  Don't worry.



Hope this helps!

Additionally:  This is listed in the "Diet and Fitness" section, that is why we thought this was related to diet pills.



Recreational drugs can and will ruin your life. I know someone who has lost everything for the sake of getting high.  If you are at a club, try to challenge yourself by NOT giving in to what others are doing.  Show people that you can have a better time than them without drugs because you are cool like that.  Be confident in who you are, you don't need that crap.  Pills, alcohol, and weed will rob you of your personality and slowly transform you from who you were born to be.  There is nothing wrong with enjoying your youth, dancing, and friends, though!  All the best to you!

theres no way to stop it...your brain has used up all its serotonin in one big hit...which is why you prob felt so good last night...but now, it will take a few days for your brain to get levels back up.



you can try eating foods rich in the amino acid tryptophan which is one of the building blocks of serotonin...chicken, pasta, marmite etc etc.



failing that...go for a walk come back then sleep it off.



learn your lesson and dont do it again...they are bad news matey.

What would you suggest to help me loose weight?



Sorry if this is alot of detail, im just after advice relevant to my situation.
My situation is:
I have a partner, and we have a 4yr old son. We've just moved to the area.



I weigh *gasp* 100kg, or 220lb i think it is.



Im 21, and 157cm short lol i've always been short, and always been curvy, but not fat.



I have 2 medical conditions, Benign Intracranial Hypertension and Poly Cystic Ovaries Syndrome. With the first one, i can't do hard or long exercise, or eat food with too many preservatives etc With polycystic ovaries, as is well known, it's harder to loose weight.
We live on the edge of town, too far to walk 'down the street' or to the shops etc There is no gym in town, or any weight loss centres. We have push bikes on layby for christmas. There are no walking groups around the area, and im not confident starting my own.
I'm getting married october next year. Its a casual wedding so i have the leniency of not having to book my dress 6 months in advance.



I dont know what size i'd like to be when i get married, nor do i have an overall goal weight. I weighed 70kg when i fell pregnant with my son, and its not like i've gotten taller lol
Unfortunately, we dont have much money, so i cant buy fancy food lol or cook elaborate recipes.
I dont smoke, or drink. we dont really eat take away cuz we can't afford it lol



I dont have a big appetite.
I dont like diets. I can't afford supplements.
Rather than a diet, I'd prefer a healthy eating and exercise plan that can also apply to my family.
I have an appointment with a dietician/nutritionist in a month.
I know my BMI. I know I'm overweight, obese even.
Im just after suggestions and advice.

Sounds like you could benefit from a full body cleanse. A friend of mine uses an Acai Berry product, it flushes all the waste out your system.



Shes lost quite a lot of weight and she swears by the stuff. She got it for free too, only had to pay like $5 shipping.

Walking is the best for you right now so you're gonna have to get over your anxiety about starting a walking group alone. Walk in well-lit areas for safety and maybe go to a local school track and you'll meet other walkers as well.
Here are some good ideas:
1. Do something that gets your heart rate up a bit like, walking, running, biking, and swimming.
2. Eat Whole, Organic foods like: Broccoli, Cabbage, Organic Brown Rice, Beans, Spinach, Sweet Potato, Apples, and other fruits and vegetables in their Natural State.
3. Avoid eating corn, white bread, white rice, white potatoes, candy, sodas, chips, and anything else that you already know you shouldn’t be eating.
4. Drink clean water as your beverage of choice. Avoid Fruit drinks and fruit juices (unless YOU juice them yourself)
5. Stop smoking, drinking beer & wine, and drinking coffee.
6. Get 8 hours of sleep each night.
7. Hang out with people who want to be healthy.
8. Avoid anything with High Fructose Corn Syrup.
9. Look into taking a multi-vitamin.
10. Check out this website for excellent health advice: naturalnews.com



Tone up the muscles:



1. Join a gym and get a trainer.
2. If you’re short on cash, start a light stretching & yoga regimen.
3. Do push-ups, and light dumbbell curls for the upper body.
4. As I said above, walk, run, swim, and or bike
5. Take an aerobics class, a yoga class, or some other fitness class.
6. Join the local YMCA.
7. Buy or borrow this book by Bill Pearl called GETTING STRONGER.
In the book, he describes everything you need for a great fitness plan.
8. Crunches & Curl ups for the abs.



Mental Health:



1. Get a friend to talk to each day about your feelings.
2. If you have some money or insurance, get a counselor to talk to.
3. Learn how to meditate.
4. Join a support group for the issue you’re dealing with.
5. Ask your Higher Self (or God) for guidance.
6. Start keeping a diary or journal about your feelings & thoughts.
7. Write a ‘gratitude’ list every night.
8. Do something that makes you happy each day like: listen to your favorite music, draw, paint, write, or anything creative.
9. Do something for someone else who needs help.
10. If the above suggestions don't improve your mental health, talk with your therapist about the possibility of taking some medication.
11. Check out the book FEELING GOOD by David Burns.



Take care of yourself

Worry not! What you definitely don't need to do is to go on a diet. If you do, you will will lose weight, but there is over a 90% chance that you'll put the weight back on again.



To achieve permanent weight loss you need to 'change'...first to understand your current behaviors and then learn new behaviors. You do this by learning new habits...it's really not difficult to do.



I recommend you have a look at the Slim Habit (www.slimhabit.com). This is a weight loss system that will help you to learn 10 new slim habits. The program also includes a Personal Exercise Plan and lots of support. It's not expensive, there are no supplements or 'extras'.



I hope this was helpful...good luck!

when you start to feel stress try doing something else. exercise for example. It releases endorphins to your brain that make you feel good. It will help you feel a hell of a lot less stressed after exercising. I would suggest running, it will give you a runners high and would be a healthier habit. You can do it. you can do anything you set your mind to if you want it bad enough. And when you start thinking the negative thoughts, try to stop your self and think of something positive.

The pattern for losing weight is easy - consume less and move more often - the difficulties surface when we in reality try to put that into operation! There are a lot of stumbling blocks in the real world don't you think?! I uncovered some excellent advice by visiting the website in the box below, they have a lot of instruction, I lost 6 pounds by following their techniques.

It is unhealthy to try and lose too much weight in one week.You are overweight, so I would just concentrate on eating healthier and smarter and exercising more, because at 5 ft 1 9.4 stones is really the max you should be to be considered healthy.

don't try 18 lb in two weeks probably isn't healthy just start learning how to eat healthy and get some more exercise most guys don't like really skinny girls. we like healthy girls. you can lose it in time but its not worth trying to do it all at once.

There are lots of temptations in the big wide world aren't there?!

Everybody is different depending on their height, genes, and frame. You and your friend might be taller than most, hence weigh a little more. Or, you could be a little chubby at this stage in your life. You will grow taller and even out.



Without your height, I cannot determine what your BMI is, thus I cant tell you if you are normal or not.
My advice to you is to not worry about it unless you are severely obese (which I doubt you are). Dont starve yourself, it will only wreak havoc on your body. Exercise and eat healthy foods to stay in shape.



Hope I helped. If you have any more questions I'll be glad to answer them.

The formula is simple.  Eat healthy foods, minimal starch and sugars, primarily protein and green vegetables.  Exercise 6 days a week, alternate weight training and aerobics.



The challenge is staying motivated.



Read books about exercise physiology.  Start with an old book by Covert Bailey called "fit or fat".  But read other authors and articles as well.



Good luck!

Hi,
start counting calories. The simple plan is to eat less than you use. Consult a doctor and ask what calorie-level that is healthy for you (considering height, weight, bmi and other health-conditions you may have).



Start exercising aerobic or running or swimming. You need to work up your pulse -cardio workout is the fastest and most effective way to burn fat.



Cut carbs and fill up on vegetables instead. Weigh your food, try and find a good calorie-calculator online and start writing down everything you eat for a few days. Then it's easier to correct your diet and try to eat more healthy.



Drink at least 2 l of water a day. Water is essential, because if you are dehydrated in anyway, your body will retain water in all places of the body and that alone can make you feel bloated and chunky.



GOOD LUCK -you can do it!!

you are able, aim to do at least 60-90 minutes of moderate physical activity on at least five days a week. (All adults should aim for at least 30 minutes on five days a week. However, 60-90 minutes is recommended if you are overweight or obese and are aiming to lose weight.) Moderate physical activity includes: brisk walking, jogging, dancing, swimming, badminton, tennis, etc. In addition, try to do more in your daily routines. For example, use stairs instead of lifts, walk or cycle to work or school, etc. See separate leaflet called 'Physical Activity for Health' for details.



Top tip - If you are not used to physical activity, try starting with a 30 minute brisk walk every day and then building up from there.



Special 'wonder' diets are often advertised, but they are often not helpful. This is because your old eating habits will usually return after a short 'special diet', and weight often goes back on.



Top tip - it is not usually a special diet that you need, but a life-long change to a healthy diet.



Drink mainly water



Many people use drinks full of calories to quench their thirst. Sugary drinks such as cola, tea and coffee with milk and sugar, milk, and alcoholic drinks, all contain calories. One of the easiest ways to cut back on calories is simply to drink water as your main drink.



Top tip - keep some water in a plastic bottle in the fridge. Chilled water is surprisingly refreshing.



Change of eating habits



Do you have any eating habits that can improve?



Are you eating larger and larger portions when you have a meal? Try to deliberately take smaller portions when you have a meal. Do not feel that you have to 'empty your plate'. Perhaps change the plates that you have in your cupboard (which may be large) to more medium sized plates. In this way you will naturally serve up smaller portions.



What do you have for snacks? Try changing chocolates or cakes for fruit.



Do you have second helpings at meal times when you are really already full?



Skipping meals is usually a bad idea. It sounds a good idea, but many people just become hungry, and have snacks later in the day, and eat too much at the next meal. Eating at regular mealtimes may be a first important change. Three healthy meals a day is best.



Do you always have a pudding? Will a light yoghurt do instead of a sweet pastry?



Do you eat quickly? Are you ready for a second helping before most people have half finished their first plateful? Obese people, on average, eat faster than non-obese people. It is best to train yourself to chew each mouthful for longer, and to eat slowly.
Top tip - three healthy meals each day, including breakfast, is better than skipping meals. Eat slowly, chew longer.



Planning what you eat



It is important to plan ahead. Perhaps you could plan each day's meals and recipes the day before. In this way you will know exactly how much food you will be eating. This is better than looking in the cupboard and fridge before mealtimes or snacks to see what is there.



It is best to separate eating from other activities, as this helps to you keep to your planned eating for the day. So, try not to eat whilst on the move, whilst watching TV, during meetings, etc.



Top tip - plan tomorrows eating today.



Lifestyle change for life



To lose weight and to keep it off, it is vital that you are motivated, really want to lose weight, and want to improve aspects of your lifestyle. Some people lose weight by strict dieting for a short period. However, as soon as the diet is over, they often go back to their old eating habits, and the weight goes straight back on. Losing weight, and then keeping it off, needs a whole change of attitude and lifestyle for life. This includes such things as:



the type of foods and drink that you normally buy.



the type of meals that you eat.



your pattern of eating.



the amount of physical activity that you do.
Top tip - ask family or friends to help and encourage you to keep to a healthy lifestyle.



Be realistic



What is your goal weight? Many people aim to get down to a 'perfect' weight. This is often unrealistic and may never be achieved. If the weight that you aim for is too low, you are likely to become fed up about slow progress, and give up. To lose 5 kg is good. To lose 10 kg is excellent. (10 kg is about one and a half stone.)



Top tip - in most cases, most health benefits come from losing the first 5-10% of your weight. This is often about 5-10 kg.

I have had this operation and can tell you that it does not make you gain weight. The gallbladder does not store all the fat out of your food either, you must have misunderstood.



The gallbladder is a small pear-shaped organ that sits under the liver on the right side of the abdomen. The gallbladder concentrates and stores a greenish-brown liquid called bile that is made by the liver. When a person eats food, the gallbladder contracts and sends bile into the small intestine through tubes called bile ducts, where it helps break down fats in the food.

i have had my gallbladder removed.
the reason he is taking it out is to not cause problems,
i asked him if there was a specific diet to follow, & he's like nope, that's what we removed it for !
i mean, yuo should eat healthy anyways.
i've just noticed when i eat fatty foods, or anything that the gallbladder would digest slower, goes through me quicker.
like if yuo eat somehitng like mcdonalds, you'll probably get the runs.
because it won't take long to digest, because it doesn't go through your gallbladder anymore.
i just get the runs when i eat greasy food, which is something i barely do because the runs isn't fun. haha..
but sometimes i treat myself to some rotten ronnies.
the only fast food that hasn't given me the runs is burger king.
but yeah, just watch what you eat. you just have to eat a bit of everything to see what your body will do with it.
& how not having yuor gallbladder will react to it.
get to know your system all over again. haha.
like i said, for me, it's greasy foods.



i haven't gained weight from it, or lost weight from it.but do remember everybody is different.

Well protein bars have a lot of protein, but most also have a ton of calories and could be a small mean. I would say make a protein shake with whey protein, but I'm assuming you cant just whip out a blender whenever you want a snack. I would say nuts are a good idea. Yes, they have a ton of fat, but it is VERY healthy fat. Actually, the fat from almonds are great for you, and they also have a nice bit of protein. They're also really easy to eat anywhere at anytime. Hope it helps!

water is great for your body. water naturally flushes waste from your body and with it being cold, im not sure, however, if it takes your body having to keep warm when it is cold outside and uses energy to do that maybe it works with water in those terms also!

If you lose much more, you'll start getting really sick.
105 is not enough for someone you're age.
Maybe more like, 115 or something.
You can keep going to the gym to build muscle, but you don't need to lose any more weight.

Firstly... the amount of exercise you are doing is UNHEALTHY love! You are underweight as it is. Go to the doc and talk to them about it if anything and don't ask people on here coz some might just give some nasty advice on binge dieting.



Take care of yourself and have fun with life, and spend that gym money on something like sailing or abseiling.

if you are going to the gym as much as you say you are and are eating right then the only 2  reasons that I can think of is that you are probably either plateaued or you are losing body fat but also gaining muscle weight. Stop looking at the scale and start looking in the mirror and if you can see that your body is changing for the better then leave it be. If you feel you have plateaued then try this workout and diet.

TIPS



Add any fresh herb to any dish to rev up the flavor or add 1 tbsp. Ms. Dash to rice or fish and poultry to give it a zing. You can even add some cajun spice to just about anything if you like it hot. There is an also fresh squeeze of lime and lemon that takes the food to a tropical place. Don’t be afraid to mix and match your dishes as long as you stay within your counts for that meal and for that day. Remember that you need to eat for what you have coming up not for what you have already done. Say if you know you are going to take a nap after a meal then don’t eat so many carbs because you will not be burning them off.



do all of these for 60 seconds for 1 set and 5 minute warm up stretch and 5 minute cool down stretch with a 30 second rest in between. and you should stay tone and muscular while helping to burn fat. They are separated into 3 days. then do some cardio in between those and make sure to get plenty of rest and eat plenty of protein and carbs. If you do all of this, then you will need to increase your caloric intake as well. hope this helps and if you have any questions about the workout then email me. p.s. to keep lean muscle this workout uses body weight and no more than 10 lb. weights for men and 5 lb weights for women. If you are a beginner then try 30 seconds and rest for 10-15 in between the workout.start with 30 seconds for beginner and rest for 10-15 seconds. The entire workout lasts 25-28 minutes when done at the full 60 second time. Mix in c

She's a little overweight, but not by much. The best way to calculate whether you are underweight, normal, overweight, or obese is by calculating your BMI (Body Mass Index). http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/



She's at a 25.4. The normal weight calculation is 18.5-24.9.



Just reassure her that she looks fine and pretty. Try exercising together. It's a lot easier to lose weight when you have close support.

Nope. It sounds like around 800 calories, depending on how much pb you put on the sandwiches. A lot of it depends on your weight, but for an average male you will want around 2200 calories a day to maintain your weight. And since breakfast should be the largest meal of your day, its not too much at all as long as you dont have a huge lunch or dinner.

Yeah, that was a bit too much. Although peanut butter can be healthy too much is just as bad as over eating with other stuff.



I found that if i make toast or a bagel with peanut butter on it it fills me up more. idk why. maybe try that instead of 2 sandwhiches, eat two pieces of toast with peanut butter on top.



As for the apple, dont add any extra peanut butter. If you want you can take some off of your toast for the apple or somethin like that.



Im just sayin this to try keepin the calories and fat undre control. one serving of peanut butter is usually 16 grams of fat, so for breakfast you've already eaten over half your daily limits (if on 2000 calorie diet) if your eating less you might be already done with your daily fat intake limit.



Just read labels! good luck

It depends on your height, weight, muscle mass, and activity level. That certainly is a lot of breakfast (5 tbsp peanut butter=lots of fat, 4 slices bread=lots of carbs) but if you are continuously exercising then you should be okay. If your sitting at a desk in an office, maybe you could try something lighter(Skip the peanut butter on the apple, have just one sandwhich, or have some granola with low-fat milk and a banana. Yogurt is also great, or a not-too-sugary breakfast bar.)
Hope I helped!!

The key for losing weight is easy - consume less and move more often - the difficulties appear when we really try to put that into practice! There are plenty of stumbling blocks in the big wide world aren't there?! I learned some splendid advice by checking out the web portal in the box below, they have plenty of tips and tricks, I melted away 7 pounds by following their techniques.

Probably faster. Eating quickly doesnt give your body the chance to tell when its full thus you eat way more than needed. If you chew each bite 20 times you will get full ALOT faster. I need to start doing it, i just get tired of chewing sometims but it does work. lol

You may gain weight quickly if you eat fast.  It takes your brain about 20 minutes to know that your stomach is full.  You will not realize that you ate too much until it is too late.  Also, eating fast can give you gas, indigestion, or heartburn!

If you're not hungry, then why are you hungry? Usually, when my stomach feels empty and it's growling, then I know I'm hungry. Most mornings I'm done with breakfast by 7:30. Usually, by 11 again, I'm hungry. I don't always get to get a snack then if I'm caring for my daughter, but I know I'm hungry. Yesterday morning, I was hungry again by ten, so I had a banana. By 11 I was hungry again (I did give a small part of the banana to my daughter with her breakfast), so I had a slice of whole wheat bread with some Smart Balance. I didn't get to eat my all natural PB sandwhich with all-natural fruit spread until a couple of hours later, after my husband and went to vote and we stopped to drop off our health insurance papers. Had I not had anything at ten, thinking I could wait or thinking, "Gee, even though my body is telling me I'm hungry, I can't possibly be because it's not lunch time yet," I might have just passed out somewhere along the way, as it was at least five hours until I was able to have lunch.



However, this is just me and my body. You could be different.

yeah, it might be cause your eating breakfast too early. or maybe your eating the wrong kind of stuff for breakfast? What do you eat? I've found that Special K cereal is reallly good cause i just eat a bowl of that in the morning and it keeps me full right till lunch :).



otherwise, bring a little snack to school and eat it between a class when  you feel hungry. like a banana or some om that drinkable-yougurt stuff or maybe a small sandwhich. just to keep you from being hungry (cause it like impossible to concentrate in class when your hungry :P).

Yes, push ups will work out the entire upper body (to a degree). Mainly, though, push ups help increase chest strength. Triceps are also targeted, especially if you try a closer hand positioning.

It depends on how u do ur push up.  With hands close to ur body it will build your body, it will build triceps.  With arms at chest level shoulder length apart it will build your chest and triceps.  It doesn't help biceps.

Poor Diet+Lack of Exercise=Depression? ?



I work at a restaurant so I'm always surrounded by food and am always making trips to the pop machine and drinking tall glasses of pop - at least 2 or 3 during an 8-hour shift. I come home late and usually eat whatever's around (with a glass of pop) or very often I get fast food on the way home. Between going to classes and working, I don't exercise much....so, is it kind of a no-brainer that I'm depressed and have low-esteem lately? Will changing my eating habits have a considerable impact on my depression/anxiety? Also, I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder, but maybe it's the caffeine from all the pop?

It is a possibility to lose weight fast but you should be realistic and accept that if you lose weight rapidly then you will without doubt put it all back on again just as rapidly. I lost 9 pounds for the last month when I had a special celebration to attend, and I did it by following the guidance supplied on the website in the box below.

I would bet it's more likely to be the sugar from the pop.  Try switching to diet pop or better yet, unsweetened tea.  And don't forget, all that extra sugar puts you at higher risk for diabetes.

I would think so. If you eat poorly, your body will feel bad, and be weighed down by it. Exercise releases endorphins, which make you happy. So yes, Body feeling bad + no exercise= depression.
Try to drink water instead of the pop (no diet soda either)
For breakfast, have something healthy and lite, like a bowl of granola with low-fat milk, banana, and maybe a little honey.
For lunch, try a whole-grain sandwhich with no mayo and lean meat, like turkey or ham. Have a fruit and maybe a snack like a healthy granola bar with your lunch.
For dinner, (grilled) chicken ceasar salad with lo-fat dressing, or whole grain pasta with tomato sauce and a side salad with lo-fat dressing, or a bowl of brothy soup(quite low in calories, but watch out for the sodium)
To get some exerxise, start small. Walk a little extra, do a few situps or pushups and jumping jacks when you wake up. Walk up the stairs. Remember you have to look for oppurtunities to exercise!'

It's quite feasible. I've read things about the correlation between poor health choices and mental health. However, I eat very well and I have been feeling bummed lately. That's just due to my current life circumstances. Anyway, I know people who eat poorly and continue to complain about how they feel, physically and mentally. I've also read that even diet soda is not very "diet" in terms of health. (There is something in the November issue of "Prevention" [I looked for it on the site, but didn't see it; Perhaps the library has a copy] and from the December 2007 issue of "Experience Life" http://www.experiencelifemag.com/issues/... )



I think it makes sense-- The body runs on real food as the body is real and whole. Given artificial junk and the body reacts negatively.



Being surrounded by food isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you're going for the white bread, the meats, the fried stuff, then it's bad. Also, if you don't just want water, squeeze a lemon or two in it, that might be of some help.



I think that changing your habits will have a positive effect, even if you don't exercise much. (I have worked restaurant and I don't remember getting to sit much.)



Do a search for "nutrition and depression" and see what you come up with. I'm thinking of the Dr. Andrew Weil site, but I don't know what it is, just do a search.



Also, the holistic health section might have people who could help you as well.

If you work don't work out the same body parts every day, then it's fine. Like, if you work out chest on Monday, then work out a different muscle the next day.

As long as you're not putting an undue strain on your body, (ie, working your arms to total failure).



If you work the dumbbells until your arms feel tired, but not "dead", then it's ok to do it everyday.  If you're working your arms to exhaustion, then you need to allow a day or two of rest in between sessions to allow the muscles to heal.

Sit ups aren't great for the abs. They also cause a lot of tension on your back that can mess you up down the road.



The absolute best ab exercise is the crunch. There are two types of crunches, and the one I'll tell about now is the best for toning abs. This method will also take fat off your stomach faster than you'd believe.



Lay on your back with your feet underneath something for support, such as a kitchen counter or even your bed. Place both hands under your head with your elbows pointing up. (Make sure they stay that way throughout the exercise)



Now, keeping your lower back straight, lift your head all the way up until your elbow reaches your knees. What you want to do is touch your right elbow to your left leg, and then slowly recline back so that your head is on the floor again. Now do the same process again, this time touching your left elbow to your right leg.



This left-to-right rotation is what really tones the lower abs and sides. Do as many of these as you can possibly push yourself to do, and then add five more. :)

Sure, you can do it, but I don't know how healthy it would be to do two cheesy diets right after each other or at all. I don't get the reasonings behind the Sacred Heart Diet, but I didn't take the time to look at the whole thing. My suggestion is to just avoid meat and animal products and to eat however much you want of whole grains, fruits, veggies, beans, etc. and avoid anything with enriched flour, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors and colors and anything that looks as though it was created in a lab by man and not in nature by God. That's what I do, and at six feet, 155 pounds (give or take five, probably more give) it's worked for me. I don't consider it a "diet" in the pop culture sense of the word, but how I choose to live. The one thing I don't do, that I wish I did do, is exercise. My heart would be a lot healthier and happier, though I probably would be skinnier. Eh. (When we move, we're going to make one of the bedrooms a video, video game [including our Wii]/exercise room. Now lets see how much it's used for the latter, excluding Wii games, as I would like to pick up yoga again.)



I hope this has been of some help.

First of all, a person that is hungry should eat. No one should starve themselves, but rather eat good, healthy food to lose weight. Drinking coffee with the meal is not bad, unless it's before bedtime. Try to limit your caffeineated drinks to none 3 hours before bedtime. Coffee is great in the morning as it helps jumpstart metabolism and helps get your day going. Coffee is also a dieuretic and in some people it has a laxative effect. I'd say no more than 4-5 cups a day though max.

i think what ur going to do sounds great (might even try it myself) its eating healthy, but still enjoying ur food! and exercise aswell, i say well done for losing weight in a good way, unlike some people i read about on here.



This way of doing it will also ensure longer lasting results as the weight will reduce slowly, and its easy to keep up after x

Hey christine, i realize it can be difficult dropping fat but there is a fantastic website that you should try http://stripthefat.notlong.com



I have been on it for 3 months and it is working out fantastic



I am actually really surprised that it is working so great as i have tried just about everything under the sun before.



Some of the main things it taught me werehow to get into the right frame of mind for losing weight. Also how to trick my body into feeling full without any harmful pills or anything like that.



It also provides a great list of foods to avoid and it's not the obvious ones, and also 10 foods that are the best for losing weight. Iwould say if you just folowed these 2 lists on their own without all the other info you would be well on your way to losing massive amounts of weight.



Good Luck christine.

I think the 1st 2 questions are BS... Anyway you diet plan looks good, you're getting just about enough calories. But it also depends on how much you used to consume and how much less you're consuming and how much you're losing working out. Just remember 3500 calories is equal to 1 pound. So if you're consuming that much less a week + losing them through your workouts you can lose 1 pound a week. If you want to lose 25 pounds thats 25 weeks. But if you cut your calories by 3500 a week and yyou're burning like 1500 a week in your workouts thats a pound and a half a week and it will take you about 19 weeks.. You can get the idea now :) Good luck!

Yes, that sounds good.  I think you can even add one more snack if you need it.  Another thing you can do is mix up your cardio sometimes.  Instead of doing the elliptical everyday, go outside for a fast walk for 30 min.  If you have any hand weights, it would be great to incorporate some weight bearing exercises into your routine.  Having extra muscle helps your body burn more calories.  Good luck and keep up the good work!

If you could keep that up it would certainly loose you weight. But the question is, can you keep it up for the 70ish dayishs it would take for you to lose that weight? If you can, that's great, but think about maybe taking every 3rd day off from your diet and breaking even in calories that day.



Also, crunches give you a pretty belly, but they don't burn that many calories. Keep in mind when losing weight you want to focus on calories most.



Oh, and to get the 70ish days. I'd guess a 5'1 woman would burn about 2350 calories doing what you're doing (maybe more, depending on your day today life). There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat, and your diet and exercise would keep your metabolism up. So I did 25(pounds) / ((2340ish - 1150ish)\3500).
Okay sounds great, but keep it up!

Go to Wal-Mart and get the RCA MP3 Sport player.  It's about $40-$50 and holds a ton of songs, stopwatch, water resistant, FM radio and BMI calculator.



You can wear it on your arm or wrist and feedthe headphones through your shirt sleeve so the cord doesn't get in your way.  Don't play it too loud in case someone speaks to you....you want to be able to hear if you're called.

If you gain muscle you won't lose as much weight, as muscle weighs more than fat so don't expect miraculous weight loss and muscle tone.  If you want to tone up you  need to increase what exercise you are doing, just a little at a time, don't over do it.  good luck.

Swim.



It works all your muscle groups but not to the point where you will pack on kilos of muscle!



You will tone your muscle groups and burn fat.



Keep your calorie intake below 2000 a day and make sure the calories you do eat are from healthy nutritional foods and not junkfood with minimal nutritional value.



Its hard to tell without actually seeing your arms and legs, but women tend to store fat in their legs and arms so perhaps there are a few thing layers of fat casing you to believe your legs and arms are very muscular.



BTW, I wasnt saying guys dont store fat, they just tend to store fat around the mid section first.

How can I control my binge eating? have you ever been to therapy for an eating disorder?



I literally can't stop eating. I go into a frenzy and just raid my kitchen.



I have tried associating food with an emotion but i can't seem to find a connection with any particular emotion. I have tried several diets, all of which have failed miserably.



I am sick of the guilt I feel after eating. I hate that I can't control myself...I'm not too overweight....YET!!!!

i'm actually a "recovered" anorexic who went into a pretty serious spiral of binge eating while "recovering"... and i still do it sometimes, which is terrible.



i have heard of counseling to treat it, but it tends to be more helpful in cases where there is a real underlying emotional problem (e.g. abuse).  what i'm doing (and it's slowly been working for me- but note- it DOES TAKE A WHILE to work) is literally recording EVERYTHING that goes into my mouth.  i'm sure you've heard or read that before, but i find that recording EVERYTHING, especially on binge days, helps me to really stop on think when i'm about to go on a binge ("the last time i did this i ate _____ calories, half of them were in bread! i don't even LIKE bread!" that kind of thing).



it's a lot easier to stop yourself if you know you'll feel guilty writing it down later.

Good question.



The problem is that you've stretched your stomach to the point where you cannot get that "full" feeling until you eat a lot of food.  The solution is to shrink your stomach.  Yes, this can happen, and without surgery or a clamp inside of you.



Some people skip breakfast, and end up eating 2 large meals every day.  You end up becoming like a camel, storing up food for the rest of the day, stretching out your stomach to fit all that food in.



I eat 5 or 6 meals a day, but when the sun goes down, I've eaten the same amount of food as anyone who eats 2 large meals.  It is hard to get started, because at first the smaller meals won't give the "full" feeling, but after a while, your stomach shrinks, and you end up feeling satisfied more often.  Also, it speeds up your metabolism and makes your body store less energy as fat.



That's the physical side of things anyway.  Mentally, there is no quick fix.  You must have the willpower and determination to want to lose weight.  No one can give that to you but yourself.  So if that's the real issue, stop asking for help, you're wasting your time.  Instead try and find some way to reward yourself.  Take up a sport you really love, or go out and LARP instead of playing table top games, whatever you can find that you're passionate about that will keep you active.  I was a huge anime fan and loved Jet Li movies, so I took up martial arts.  Then you can stop focusing on your weight and start focusing on getting better at your activity.

When you eat meals (bfast/lunch/dinner or snacks) make sure you eat fiber and protein. Fiber and protein help fill you up on less food and keep you fuller longer. Try snacking on whole wheat pretzels or whole wheat Goldfish. With breakfast try scrambled eggs with whole wheat or whole grain toast. For dinner, or lunch, eat brown rice instead of white rice.



If you need to eat processed food look for things that have a lot of fiber in them. Look for Soluble & Insoluble fiber - these will determine how full you will feel.



However!!!!! Drink a lot of water. Switching suddenly to a high fiber diet may cause some gastrointestinal problems (constipation for one) so make sure that you slowly introduce high fiber products into your diet over the course of three or four weeks. Let your body adjust and drink lots of water. You may be able to do it faster but listen to your body and snack smart. Eat more fruits & vegetables, too they are great sources of natural fiber, sugar and protein.

for your poll answer NO.
however, do be careful bc this may cause you to relapse. is it possible for you to see a dietitian? this helped me with my past ED.'s. the very same happened to me but then, it stabilized with discipline. your body is not used to allowing food to live in you for a long period of time and is storing it for a "just in case" scenario. your body is smart. however, you do need to stabilize your eating. even stable eating may cause you to gain weight, but it will eventually stabilize as it gets used to food being a part of your daily life. esp. being mia, your body is storing massive amounts of fluid. this too will stabilize if you maintain healthy eating patterns. remember this, the more you go back and forth btwn eating healthy and reverting back to ED you will tend to be a heavier adult bc your body is retaining what it can to survive. as i said, your body is smart and has to use its defense mechanisms to survive.



i hope you can get with a dietitian and a therapist to deal with the root issues of your eating. we can eat right, but as long as those feelings that trigger us to revert are there, you will continue this destructive pattern of eating behavior. this compulsive eating is just another manifestation of an ED..
i hope you find peace and health.

If you really want to lose weight fast, the best way is to just stop eating a lot.  Eat minimally so that you wont faint, but otherwise, you will lose weight quickly.  This is not a long term fix nor is this healthy for you.  To sustain the weight loss you will have to eat right and exercise.

Eat high protien(Chicken, Turkey, Fish)...and very low carbohydrates(under 20g)...for 3 weeks.  By the 3rd day your body should go into a state of Ketosis..which eats away at your fat!  You should lose about 5 pounds of water weight in 5 days and by the 10th day you should lose 5 pounds of fat, so 10 days to lose 10 pounds...not bad for watching what you eat!

Exercise is of course always the key to looking AND feeling absolutely gorgeous!  It's great for complexion and overall health.



A few changes to the diet will also help to improve how one looks and feels.  Cutting out (or greatly reducing) sugars, saturated fats, hydrogenated oils and processed foods (anything from a can, a box, or a fast food place) can help to lose a few unwanted pounds safely and quickly. Increase daily water intake to half of your weight in ounces.  You will notice a change within two weeks.  Not only will you look great, but your energy level and confidence will soar.



Make sure to eat a healthy breakfast to jump start your metabolism for the day!  And try to eat something healthy at least every four hours during the day to keep it going.



There are some detox diets out there that can produce the same results, but be sure that if you go that route to choose one that seems more logical and less drastic.... if it seems unnatural... it probably is.



Good luck and have a great time at your event!

The key for losing weight is easy - eat less food and workout more often - the problems appear when we actually try to put that into operation! There are lots of temptations out there don't you think?!

lossing weight isnt all about not eating less food. Food actually helps you lose weight, it allows your matabalism to work harder because it takes energy for it to work.



You want to eat healthyer, less fatning foods. Then of course working out. I personaly run, which it takes alot of running to lose weight. You also cant count your weight right after you work out from doing something either, be carefull.. all you look at after you work out is lose in water weight, so when you eat again you see that all back on the scale.



Just work out, sweat alot, and work hard while eating better...

A complete back workout should consist of working 4 areas on the back..



The lats(for width, the 'wings' of your back), traps( the big muscles visible on either side of your neck, from the front view, which also run down either side of your spine, to the middle of your back), your rhomboids (the muscles around your shoulder blades), and your lower back (to give that 'christmas tree' look to your lower back, and to support a strong, healthy back).



The pic you posted has all these muscles developed to a good level.  here's what you need to do to get the same.



Lats:



Wide-grip pulldowns.  3 x 8-12



Underhand pulldowns(closer grip). 2 x 8-12



Traps:  Barbell/Dumbell Shrugs:  4 x 8-12



Rhomboids:  Barbell/Seated Cable Rows.  4 x 8-12



Lower Back:  Hyperextensions  3-4 x 8-12



This is a compete back workout, and can be done all together in the same workout.  Use weight that is heavy enough to do the number of reps required.  If you can do more than 12, up the weight.



Allow a month to two before you expect to see any significant improvement in your back muscles, visibly, anyway.



You can do this workout a maximum of twice a week, with at least 2-3 days rest between sessions.

The width of your back depends on the width of your shoulders and narrowness of your hips. those are genetic factors.
Beyond that, you can strengthen and enlarge the back muscles by cable rows, bent over rows, dumbell rows, one arm rows, wide rip chinups behind the neck, etc..
Don't overlook deadlifts.

My friend, you need to discover delicious delicious smoothies and fruits... health food does not have to mean boring, tasteless or unsatisfying food. Search the web for fruit recipes, buy lots of fruits, not just apples... mangos starfruit, kiwi, peaches, strawberries, if its not in season, the buy it frozen! (but not from a can, canning destroys many enzymes, some vitamins and often adds calories... as well as interfering with the taste)
Lots of fruits, lots of vegetables with SPICES many cultures have a wide array of hot ethnic spices... these make healthier foods even more appealing =)

Lots of protein.  Eat a snack or a small meal every 3-4 hours.  Like maybe half a sandwich and a piece of fruit.  But make sure you get protein every time.  And no junk food at all.  You'll be surprised how hungry you DON'T get because it keeps your blood glucose level stable.

I know what you mean about salads. I'm the same way.
Try steamed veggies! Especially broccoli! They're warm, taste good, healthy, and filling. Veggie burgers are good too if you're into that. Or a stir-fry with rice and veggies and seasoning and some type of protein. So good. And try lots of delicious, exotic fruits. Better than a fatty donut any day!

The pattern for losing weight is easy - consume less and move more often - the difficulties surface when we in reality try to put that into operation! There are a lot of stumbling blocks in the real world don't you think?! I uncovered some excellent advice by visiting the website in the box below, they have a lot of instruction, I lost 6 pounds by following their techniques.

i lose about 20 pounds in the last 6 weeks by using this acai berry stuff. i didn't really believe that it would work but they were giving out free trials online so i decided to try it and it actually works. it does some kind of chemical change in your body that changes the intake of your calories or something along those lines. if your interested, you can go to http://nuurl.us/8d30b to find out more information and if you want get a free trial. it really helped me out

How can I maintain my weight? ?



So I lost about 13 pounds in the last 2 weeks. And I have Homecoming in 2 weeks, and I'm going to finish my diet for this week, and on Monday I'm going to send my dress in so I can get it let in, because it's strapless, and if it's too loose it could fall off!



So Homecoming is next Friday, and I don't want to lose anymore weight, but I don't want to gain it all back.



So how many calories per day should I eat in order to maintain my weight of 115 right now?



I'm 15 and 5"1

Stick to the recommended daily intake for women, if i remember correctly; roughly 1750-2100 calories should do the trick. It all depends on your daily routine, if you are active then you will need to increase your intake by a few hundred calories.

When you get your biceps cut won't it also get your shoulders cut?



you know that line difined line that cums in ur shoulders between ur biceps an triceps wen ur built?...how do u get that cut line...i was thinking that if i jus build my biceps an triceps i cud get it now is that true?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The only way to put muscle mass on your biceps and triceps is by consuming more calories than you can burn, and by resistance-training.  If you want them cut, you have to burn more calories than you take in.  You can't get cut and put on muscle mass at the same time, it is physiologically impossible.



And, you can't specifically get your biceps or shoulders cut.  There is no such thing as spot-reduction, where you can get rid of body fat from a specific area in the body.  You can only reduce overall body fat.



A thumbs down? I suppose what all the research and scientists have shown are wrong then?

Save your money and pay for a gym membership, most weight loss pills are rip offs and do nothing for you.
There's no need to diet, stay within your RDA calorie intake (1800-2100 calories) and work harder in the gym; focusing on cardiovascular work outs.

Frankly, I don't think there really is a best weight loss pill because I don't think they work long term - long term they help you gain weight because the weight loss is unsustainable.



Ok... so you're thinking only about december - but that's a relatively short time in the history of your life - don't do something now that messes up your metabolism in the long term and changes your body composition so that you'll find it much harder to maintain and lose weight after you've used them.  Besides this whole idea of diet pills 'working' is one that fascinates me..... in my opinion.....



* If you can't maintain the weight loss without following the regime forever, it hasn't worked.



* If it restricts, deprives or tells you what or when to eat - you aren't living naturally and it hasn't worked.



* If it hasn't freed you from a fear of regaining what you've lost - it hasn't worked.



* If it hasn't helped you work out the underlying issues for why you were eating - it hasn't worked.



* If it hasn't helped you to think of exercise as something to enjoy - it hasn't worked.



* If it hasn't helped you fall more in like with yourself even if you have lost weight - it hasn't worked.



* If it hasn't freed your from a dieting mentality - it hasn't worked.



*It it hasn't left you with making healthier nutritional and exercising choices because you 'want to' and not because you 'have to' - it hasn't worked.



*If you still think of food and your body as enemies instead of friends - it hasn't worked.



*If you still fear the scale - it hasn't worked.

once you have gone through puberty and your growth spurt then you should have no problem lifting weights... doing sit ups, crunches and push ups are alright for you to do at your age because you are not pushing your bones to any limit...when you lift weights without fully developed bones then you can cause some harm.  I would make an appointment with your family doctor for a physical and ask him the question adn that will be your safest and best answer.

Keep it simple. Eat mostly green vegetables and lean meat. Skip all white foods. Skip all sauces. Drink 8 glasses of cold water a day. Your body burns calories as it warms up the water.

Sit ups are great for you abs you should aim to start off with about 4 sets of 8 and then gradually build up to longer sessions. As for the losing weight aim for 1-2lns weekly by cutting down on sugary fatty foods. Eat lots of fresh veg and some fruit and fish and chicken are good for you

I am not huge either but I lost 14 lbs with palates and tae bo. Alot of veggies and lean meats eat like 5 small meals a day. Drink alot of water throughout your day no soda. The palates has helped my stomach in a way that regular crunches never did. Get winsor palates so you can do the three step cd program and work up to it. trust me it works and you will be so happy with the results

If your bike is adjusted properly you should get a total body work out.

cycling and swimming really compliment one another ... or cycling and modern dance moves to music if a pool is not available.

Well, they make specific jeans that have like a butt lift in them to make it look bigger.  Otherwise leg excersises and things like that will only tone you up and make it more firm not bigger necessarily.  donuts? But you can't be for sure that it won't go to your hips before your butt LOL:)

diet, number one.  To have good abs, you must have very little body fat to expose them.  then you'll need to start doing crunches, and weighted crunches, from various angle.



Remember that developing your abs is one of the more difficult thigs to do.  It takes time.  Be patient.

you need to do cardio or else no amount of ab exercises will matter.  you need cardio to get your body fat % low enough for the abs to show - otherwise you will still have a layer of fat over your abs.



and squats dont do squat for abs, they are for thighs and butts.  you need to do "core" exercises, like crunchs, planks, using stability balls or resistance bands.

Rice is healthy as long as it is cooked properly as it can be a breeding ground for bacteria. You must make sure you eat it piping hot or straight from the fridge. Before cooking make sure it is thoroughly rinsed to get rid of some of the starches and bacteria.

Have you tried to blast away body fat like Angelina Jolie? She was on a heavy protein diet, eating lots of meat and fish. Water was a vital element too. She drank about five liters per day, because water diminishes the hunger and keeps your body hydrated. I read about this at http://www.projectweightloss.com/index.p...

The *BEST* advice I can give you as I've had issues with my own weight for many years is not to try out any type of fad diet...they just don't work for the long-term and can seriously hurt you in the end.



If you'd like to check out a diet that helped me and people just like you all over the 'net, please try out http://tinyurl.com/5xvtea (Fat Loss 4 Idiots). Please don't let the program's name scare you lol because it really does work!

I almost giggled outloud when I read your question.  Most of us girls could do that just by "thinking" about it.  It still blows me away that there are people out there who have trouble "gaining" weight.  I guess that any Wieder protein and carb mix should work well.  If you have a GNC store near you, that's a great place for weight gaining powders, plus they have a knowledgable staff to answer your health questions (I'm assuming you want to do it healthy).

GNC sells a weight gainer to ad weight , through adding muscle. It's not too expensive, it has creatine, and protien in it , along with a-lot of other goodies. To achieve that much of a weight gain, you would have to use steroids, which are dangerous not to mention illegal.

Any form of strenuous exercise will make you feel motivated.
A good healthy diet will strengthen your immune system.



Twisting your body into various shapes will have little if any benefit.
Simply biology will always triumph over "fashionable" and "spiritual" hobbies.



Ofc continue Yoga if you enjoy it... but don't delude yourself into believing it has amazing health benefits.

Yoga is known for its amazing power to boost the systems of the body. A good yoga workout massages and nourishes every single organ in the body. Each cell is caressed and nourished.



Yoga helps lower stress hormones which can compromise the immune system, while also conditioning and giving love to the lungs and respiratory tract. The lymphatic system is strengthened and toxins are swept away. You may notice that you get far fewer illnesses when you have a regular yoga practice.



Personally, I haven't been sick this year at all. I have been a little surprised just how well I have been. I do have a fairly high immune system, but normally I would have had a minor cold or at least a moment of feeling under the weather by this time of year. This year... nothing! Just great health!



So what I have I done differently? I always take vitamin C and Zinc... this year and last year. I have been eating more immune system boosting super foods, but somehow there seems to be more to the story...



Last year I was doing yoga once a week, but it has only been this year that my passion has lead me to practice as often as possible and really see what happens when you twist your body into mad positions on almost daily basis.



Recently, I had a slight sore throat. The next morning as I walked to my Ashtanga yoga class, my nose was definitely dripping a little bit. When I stepped into class, I needed a tissue and I was a slightly concerned that my practice might be tricky with a cold brewing.



By the time I got to triangle pose (about 20 minutes)... there was no dripping nose whatsoever.



I left the class feeling fantastic (as always)... and realised that the cold had totally disappeared. And I haven't had one symptom since! In fact, I am once again feeling above average in my health, which when I think about it is a definite improvement from last year.



I practice in an Ashtanga yoga class and lately we have been in a small room with lots of heaters...so the sweat is dripping (not the nose.) I can't imagine the amount of toxins and germs that must be forced to exit the body through the sweat glands.



More than ever, I am convinced of the incredibly powerful effect that yoga can have on our immune systems and overall wellbeing.



1. Downward Dog Clears the Sinuses and and congestion.



2. Tortoise and Shoulder stand stimulate the Thymus gland to boost the immune system



3. Camel Pose and Backbends flush out the lungs



4. Corpse pose and Child's pose give the body a chance to integrate the postures and provide deep healing.

Every few years or so, there's always a new miracle "diet pill" on the market. You don't need them. to lose weight, just keep it simple. Eat mostly green vegetables and lean meats. Skip all white foods (bread, potatoes, pasta). Drink 8 glasses of cold water a day. Your body burns calories as it warms the water up.

yes it works!!
i'm one of those that "tried everything" so i decided to give alli a shot. i lost about 12 lbs in 2 weeks. but beware, you need to stick to the calorie intake they suggest for you. there will be oil spotting and it stains your clothes. i heard all the rumors about people going #2 in their pants but that never happened. there are times when you better hope there is a bathroom around cuz when you gotta go.. you really gotta go. the pills push excess fat outta your body so you'll be seeing orange oil spots in the toilet. and if you eat more than the recommended amount of calories then it'll leak out into your pants. i ruined 2 pairs of jeans cuz of it. so there's no cheating allowed. but if you have the willpower then i highly suggest trying it. you can usually get a coupon at myalli.com. its like $10 off. and at about $60 a bottle, its worth it :)

My son is the same way.  Just make sure you are eating healthy-fruts and leafy vegetables.  The saying goes-if it was made by man, dont' eat it (soda, candy, etc...)  If its found naturally-much away.  With my son, the tall, thin body type runs in the male side of the family so he's just always going to be trim but he eats healthy and spends time away from the computer and tv as much as I can make him!  Good luck and plz don't worry your self too much

I've been eating disordered for years and swung between overweight and underweight. As a result, I have lost a lot of muscle tone and whilst my bmi is 20.5 (low end of healthy) - I am pretty flabby. I want to basically firm up, to gain some muscle and lose some fat. I have health problems which makes strenuous exercise difficult so am after suggestions of exercise that will help, but not take too much out of me. What would people recommend?



I am still on a low calorie diet (1000-1200) a day. I'm assuming I will need to eat more calories to gain muscle? But I'm scared that if I put my calories up all I will do is gain fat. But at the moment on low calorie diet, all I am doing is losing muscle!! Stuck in a rut.



Any ideas?

I would like to gain weight. Supplements are off the table as they as unhealthy and cost prohibitive. I was wondering how realistic it will be to go to a general doctor and ask them to put me on Megace ES or Marinol.  Anybody have any experience with this? Thanks

Pardon me, but supplements are off the table because they're 'unhealthy'? Yet you want to be put on prescription appetite enhancers, the later having debatable usefullness and, oh right, being THC (ala mary-jane). You've got to be kidding.



If you want to gain weight, at least do it in a healthy manner, i.e.: away from any drugs you can possibly avoid.

yeah, you'd lose any healthy weight that you had. The cottage cheese would aid in keeping it but in the end it just would not have enough nutrients to do it.

No. You cannot easily lose weight on a diet that is so heavy in carbohydrates and saturated fat. Besides that, you are also clogging your arteries eating this way. To lose weight, just keep it simple. Eat mostly green vegetables and lean meat. Skip all white foods. Drink 8 glasses of cold water a day. Your body burns calories as it warms the water up.

It honestly depends on how much of it you eat.  If you reduce your overall caloric intake, you will lose weight.  If you increase it, you gain.  It's pretty simple.  With that said, choosing those two foods is not a healthy way to lose weight as they don't have much in the way of nutritional value and you'll probably cause other health problems by doing that.



The other thing to consider is that mac and cheese is high in calories so you will have to eat less of it than many other foods you could've chosen to meet your reduced calorie intake.

I wouldn't recommend dieting ever! Save yourself some time and work towards something that will last. If you ate only macaroni and cheese and cottage cheese...Not only will you probably end up insanely constipated, but you're missing crucial nutrients needed to keep your body in working order. You'll most likely experience stomach aches and headaches among other side effects of mistreating your body due to malnutrition. It took you a long time to gain all your excess weight. You can't expect it to just fall off without doing any work. I know you didn't ask for an opinion on something else that works -- But you serioulsy need to know that the ONLY thing that does work is better food choices and exercise!!! Good luck!

The protein doesn't know if you are a girl or a boy, so what works for one works for the other. And the diet you describe is pretty high in protein, but you may want to toss in some peanuts or soybeans and cheese to get another hit of it.

You need to incorporate more fruits and vegetables too. Legumes are loaded with protein, soy, nuts,eggs or try a protein shake if you having trouble eating some of these things. You need some whole grains in your diet too, think balance, it's healthiest.

Your meals do sound healthy and well balanced. Make sure to mix up what you eat every day though so that you don't continually eat the same thing. Eating the same "healthy" meals every single day turns out to be unhealthy in the end.



Try looking at http://www.mypyramid.gov/index.html for an idea of what really makes your mealplan healthy. It is all about balance and getting the right amounts and enough of each food group. That ensures that you get all of the vitamins you need to be healthy and all the calories you need for energy.



Good luck staying healthy!

The optimal fiber intake should be 25g for woman 30 for man.



If you eat too little you will have constipation, a slowing of the intestinal tract. That results in very few or unproductive bowel movements.
Too much fiber or too much all at once can cause gas, flatulence, abdominal pain, or diarrhea.



Shoot for 5-9 grams with every meal and a few snacks like apples or bananas.

The big deal about fiber is getting enough to keep your bowels moving.  I'm sure there is a lot of other benefits, but I don't believe all of it.  Some say cleaning your bowels can stop cancer, etc etc, but then they say that isn't proven at all either and just bowel rinses trying to sell products.  But, it is good to get cleaned out.

I don't know but I do know that when I eat without making a point to get some fiber I can get some terrible stools.  If I make a point to get some fiber in there it's usually a fine poop.  Other things that make it slide out easier:  plenty of water, green tea.

I found a free 2 week Acai Berry trial at http://getacaiberry.info where I only had to pay a couple of dollars for shipping. It's a really good deal and I highly recommend it!

You cannot become anorexic. It is a disorder/disease in the same way that measles affects you.
The only way to control your weight is have a healthy diet and do exercise! You can still control it and fell happy about yourself but not eating isn't the way to do it.

That's kind of contradictory, and I'm not being rude, just truthful.  People with anorexia can't control it either.  You can control exercise though, and eating healthier, lower fat foods.  I've never heard of someone who wanted to be anorexic.



If you become anorexic by choice, you should also be ready for all of the sickness that develops from it.  And it's not just a head cold type of sickness... like a never get out of bed sickness.  You might even live in the hopital for awhile.  Also, you could die from it as well, so you know, keep that in mind.

Avoid being anorexic. It's a condition where you do not eat or you eat in severely smaller amounts. If not treated, it is deadly. Never get into the habit of being anorexic. If you are self-conscious of your weight, go on a honest diet and stick to it. If you still have problems, talk to your doctor about a proper solution.

Anorexia is a mental disease and it's not something you should want, If you want to lose weight you should do it the healthy way, though diet and exercise. By being anorexic you are damaging your health and looks and risk death. Your hair will suffer and your skin will suffer and your muscles will decrease, starving yourself also makes you put on weight as they body stores every nutrient it can get and turns it into fat. Bad idea all together.

You cannot safely lose that much weight in that short of a time. You have a better shot of losing 60 lbs in 7 months.



You need to reduce your calorie intake and start exercising. Exercise will help you with the inches.

A couple of months ago I decided to start dieting again, but this time I used a supplement called Acai Berry. I think I first heard about it when it was rated the number one super food by Oprah and Rachael Ray.



I found a free 2 week Acai Berry trial at http://getacaiberry.info where I only had to pay a couple of dollars for shipping. It's a really good deal and I highly recommend it!



I stared taking Acai Berry and it worked amazingly well. I started loosing pounds fast. Fast forward to today and I am 32 pounds lighter than I was just two short month ago! I love this product!

120 pounds is not a healthy goal for 7 months.  People who loose between 0.5 - 2 pounds a week are the most likely to keep it off long term, so you should aim for that.  7 months is approximately 30 weeks, so could realistically aim to loose 60 pounds over 7 months, still a large accomplishment!  I'd make a chart and track your weight and measurements weekly so you can actually see the progress.  You need to get rid of 1000 calories each day to loose 2 pounds a week.  You could do that by eating less / better and doing some cardio work.  Building muscle doing weight training will help too since muscle burns way more calories than fat even when your just sitting around the house.



Good luck to you!!

When  losing  weight,  you should follow the dual course: exercise and
diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger
appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow
underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without
exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For
diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food
after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on
your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If
you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey
cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your
diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to
calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,
start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the
most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a
lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,
disjointed  bones and so on) For targeting your problem areas, check up
these  Workout  Exercises  :  Weight Training, Plyometrics , Stretches
(Flexibility),  Pilates,  Ball, Cardio Dumbbells, Cables etc. 100's Of
Exercises.  They  have animated photos, so it's easy to understand how

I don't think it is possible either, however, there is no trick or magic that is going to make the weight come off.  No matter what diet or program you follow, you need to burn more calories than you take in.  Find something that works for you and stick with it.  Be sure to ease into an exercise regimen if you have been relatively inactive for some time.

Sit ups: Please note that sit-ups can be a strenuous activity on the lower back. Understanding how to get a six pack and not damage yourself in the process is critical. Do not strain yourself; build up this type of exercise slowly. Twisting during this exercise (left elbow to right knee) is NOT effective and put the lower back under tremendous stress. If you feel even the slightest twinge, then stop.



In order to strengthen your abs, care and technique are necessary. Effective sit-ups need to pull the torso towards the knees from a lying position only using the abdominal group of muscles. If you have your legs straight on the floor then more powerful muscles in the legs will do most of the work.
To counteract this you should bend your knees while sitting up and so make the abdominal muscles feel the burn. If you gather a momentum you will not be working the muscles effectively. Only by slowly raising and lowering will you achieve the best results.



Leg lifts: The challenge with this exercise is to keep your legs straight and not to let your feet touch the floor.



Lie of the floor with your hands by your sides. Keeping your legs straight lift them to 90 Degree and back down but to do allow then to touch the ground, repeat back to the 90 degrees position.



Jacknife Sit-ups: Discover how to get a six pack the hard way with this intense workout.
Start as you would in the position to do sit-ups with your hands at your sides.



Without bending your knees, simultaneously lift you legs in the air and your head and shoulder so that your whole body makes a V-shape. If you can manage it the try to touch your toes.



Then relax and go back to the starting position.



V-ups: This exercise requires good balance and strong core muscles. It can be performed on a bench but can also be carried out on a mat on the floor(but don't let those legs touch the floor).
Bending your knees, simultaneously lift your legs and your torso so they form a V as you can see from the photo. Then go back to the relax position, during this exercise you arms should remain horizontal.



The Static hold: Get into the push-up position but with your forearms touching the ground. Make sure your body is a straight line from your shoulders down to your toes and hold that position for a minimum of 1 minute.



This exercise strengthen your core abdominal muscles. Repeat this exercise more and more as you strengthen the core muscles.



Understanding how to get a six pack through strengthening your core muscles is key to achieving great abs!

Here's some weight loss tip's:



- Exercise 6 to 7 days a week.



- And try to break your workout into two different sessions, this gives your metabolism a jolt.



- Drink 6 to 8 cups of water a day. And try to drink ice cold water, it burns more calories.



- Take enough vitamins, especially ones that promote weight loss (such as 1800 mg. of Fish Oil, Vitamin B Complex, Co-enzyme Q-10, ect. Do your research).



- Drink green tea or take green tea pills ( it's been shown to speed up your metabolism).



- For your metabolism's sake, eat within 1 hour of waking up and don't eat 3 hours before you go to bed.



- Try a vegan or vegetarian diet (it worked for me :D).



- Drink 12 oz. of warm lemon water (use the juice of 1/2 a lemon) with a little sea salt every morning. This will detoxify your body and make your skin look amazing.



- Or, if giving up meat just isn't your thing, just count calories. Try to have around 1200 a day.



- Try to avoid white, bleached, or enriched flour.



- Stay away from high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oils.



- Eat every 2 to 4 hours to keep your metabolism going.



- Eat 5 to 6 small meals a day to keep your metabolism up.



- Try to get 6 to 8 hours of sleep. When your body is deprived of sleep your appiteite increases by 15%.



- Sugar and artificial sweeteners are the devil. If you have a sweet tooth, grab some fruit.



- Avoid all junk food, fast food, and fried food.



- Try only drinking water, tea, and black coffee. There are so many hidden calories in drinks.



- Eat whole grain foods and healthy fats (like olives, avacados, nuts, ect) and stay away from refined or "bad" carbs.

my best advice is to start keeping a diet diary. Record your intake for the day, as well as how much exercise youre getting in. Im sure you know the types of foods you should be eating, so it really helps to sort out your problem areas when theyre all laid out on paper.



Also, stay motivated. Get a mental picture of how amazing you'll look in 10lbs and focus on that. You can do it!!

Your an adult, you need to do this for you and forget your families comments and criticisms. If your not happy with your weight change it because you want to not for anyone else. Eating meat doesnt make you fat just make sure you eat lean cuts. Good luck xxxx

You are a fantastic size from the sound of it! The average weight for a woman is 165 lbs and average height is 5'4". You are a little bit shorter than average, but your weight is much lower.



If you are concerned about looking great in your dress, adding a little tone is the best way to do it. Just 30 minutes a day, or at least every few days can really make a difference. If you exercise, your weight might actually go up, but don't be alarmed! Muscle weighs more than fat, but will look sleeker in your dress.



Congratulations on your upcoming marriage, and focus more on that great new husband you will have rather than the numbers on a scale. The way he feels about you is far more important than that.

To be cliche- the only one that can answer that in the terms your speaking of is you and your groom. Toning is more or less not going to help you appear thinner at this point, it is far more important when and if you reach about 120lbs.



Medically speaking yes it would be healthy to lose a little weight, possibly 10pounds since I am not sure of your body structure. My girlfriend is 5'4 and 105ish but she is tiny. 135 is not unhealthy but 125 would be better.



Honestly though, it's not what you have it's how you use it. If you want to look good in that dress your best bet is to watch your diet and exercise a little more and if you lose weight you lose weight. If not just walk up there and be confident and sexy and no one will even notice your few extra pounds. Trust me, I've seen fat girls look way sexier than they should just by their confidence.

If you wanna look good don't worry about excess body fat; worry about a lack of muscle tone.  Make it a point to tone up before your wedding.  If you start eating healthy, rotate strength training every muscle group lightly, and being more active, (I'm avoiding mentioning jogging or other boring cardio) you can tone up and lose any excess body fat in the process.

<question>



How's my exercise routine?



I walk 1.8 miles to college and back each day (5 days a week). About 35 minutes, that's about an hour and ten minutes a day walking.



I go gym 4 times a week, to do 15 minutes running and 15 minutes either more cardio, or weights.



I'm trying to lose weight, I weigh about 20 stone (280 lbs) I'm 6'1 and I'm 17. If I eat a balanced 1700 calorie a day diet, do you think I will start losing weight?



I've walked to college and back everyday for a year now, and the gym I can keep up if it's in small sessions like 4* a week, any more and I'll get fed up.



</question>



<additional details>



No, last year I used to eat a lot a day so all that walking just kept my weight stable, now I've like halved my daily intake.

Don't skip the weights.  Your body needs lean muscle to help burn off that fat.  Since you walk to school, just do your weight training when you go to the gym if that's all you can fit in.  Also, diet is 80% of losing or maintaing weight.  Eat clean!

Try jogging some of the way to school.  It will up your cardio some and stay at the gym a little longer.  Even an extra 15 minutes.  Also if you cut your calories by some each day you will lose.  It is very simple...you have to burn 3500 more calories than you consume to lose 1 pound.

Walking or running can be a waste of time unless your heart rate is at its max. take your age and subtract from 220. That's your maximum heart rate. Keep your heart beating at 80% of that for 15-20 a day. The weight will fall off. Also if your weight lifting remember the more muscle you have the more calories you burn. Make your weight training count circuit train its fast and doesn't take alot of time. With all that and the fact that your 17 you wont need to diet at all. Good luck bro.

You just need to dive in head first. CUt out "white" foods like bread, pasta, rice and sugar. No sweets, soda, or fried foods. Eat lean meats and protiens like chicken, fish, beans, and eggs. Eat 5 small meals a day instead of 3 large meals. Eat lots of veggies and fruit and not so much meat and dairy. Look at lables. Last but not least, 30-60 mins of cardio a day and some light weight training will make all the difference. You can start off walking, it will be easy on you. Use light dumb bells (5-12 lbs) and work your arms, do crunches, and if you can get a gym membership talk to a trainer. Good luck!

I too had this problem.  I have since dropped 98 pounds.  I joined Weight Watchers.  It is a great program that still allows to you to eat normal food, not special products.  It teaches you the steps you need to follow to drop the weight in a safe manner and to keep it off.  I went from a size 24 to a size 12 in about 10 months.  It allows you to still have the foods you love, just not necessarily as much as you had before (ie macaroni and cheese, ice cream, etc).  It also helps because there are no "off-limit" foods and I was never hungry.

Hi there,
You may be trying but you could be doing the wrong things.
You are not gonna put on weight by eating saturated fats and sugar, at least that is not the healthy way.
Try eating foods like healthy oils (macadamia, nut), egg yolks, protein shakes (if you search it up on the internet it will give you an idea), salty nuts, avocado..
If you are having trouble call in to your local doctor, and they might be able to give you a helping hand.

plz urgent thanksss



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Please be careful when doing such harsh exercises....and remember, Arnold devoted his LIFE at that time to perfecting those beautiful muscles.  It isn't something that you should try to attain unless your going for the title of Mr. Universe.  You need to have Symmetry, NOT just your arms or you'll end up looking weird......look at popeye!  There's a lot of bodybuilder magazines that you can buy which give great articles on proper workouts for your physique...no one can give you definate types and sets/reps on this site without knowing your particular body type and goals and still maintain a healthy body.

Unfortunately you cant just lose fat off one area (without liposuction which cannot be done on your face!)



You lose fat evenly off your whole body so once you lose a bit of weight your face will slim down a bit too.



Remember to do it the healthy way - crazy diets like eating nothing but watercress soup do not work!

Ok your dimples are not disappearing for no reason. Your body is storing excess energy as fat in your facial area. The fat storing order is different from one person to another. One might get fat around the waist first while some get fat in their face first and then other areas respectively.



To avoid this you need to maintain a diet that is sufficient for your daily calorie requirement. Anything excess will show up in your face. Exercise will help too but that's too much work right ? Some people choose the balance between both.

A questionn about net carbs...?



i read this
net carbs - Net carbs are determined by subtracting those carbohydrates that have a negligible effect on blood sugar levels from the total carbohydrates. Examples include fiber, glycerin & maltitol, which may or may not be listed on the label. Example: If the label reads: Total Carbohydrates 20g, 15g Sugar Alcohol, 1g Dietary Fiber. Subtract Sugar Alcohol and Dietary Fiber. The effective carb count is 1g. (20 –15 – 1 = 4).



soo when i eat something w/ fiber or sugar alcohol im not really getting all the carbs in me?? what does this mean exactly

"If I was going to advise people to avoid a single ingredient in "low carb" products, it would be maltitol. The other sugar alcohols range from a little to a lot better than maltitol, with erythritol being the best"



hey i wasn't sure either. but i always made sure to eat lots of fiber lol.

That depends on what your goals are.  Are you trying to lose weight? Gain weight?  Just be healthy?  Breakfast cereals are pretty high in calories, but are pretty healthy compared to other favorite breakfasts in America.  Depending on your goals that number changes.

Hi,



I'm no nutritionist by the way, but I did read somewhere about daily calorie count and calorie count per meal. You know, the total for males is 2,500 calories, 90g fat, 310g carbohydrate to maintain a healthy weight?



Well, there's also a guideline for how many calories you should eat "per meal", and I think this is where a lot of people fall down and gain weight.
Some info here: http://www.vhi.ie/hfiles/hf-461.jsp , the Irish health insurance website, comparing the "full Irish" or "full English" breakfast to your daily limits!



I'm sure medical organisations or nutrition websites have thresholds for calorie intake per meal.



If I was to guess, since breakfast essentially "kick-starts" your metabolism for the day, 600kcal is loads.



Guess it all depends if you want to eat 3 square meals, or snack mid-morning...

I'm afraid that is not a realistic target! Your not going to lose 100 pounds in a month!



Weight loss is a simple input and output balance, if you eat more calories than your body burns up in a day, you will gain weight. To lose weight, you need a healthy reduced calorie diet and daily vigorous exercise. Less in, more out
You should be looking to lose on average 1-2lbs a week.

A realistic level of weight loss is 2 lb a week and few people sustain that long term. You might lose a half stone in a month if you work at it using both diet and vigorous exercise.

You need to lose the fat off the stomach first, sit-ups will do nothing because the fat is still there.  You need to do cardo exercises, walking or running will help burn calories and take off the fat.  Also, eat whole grains.  Studies show that people who eat whole grains, as opposed to refined and processed foods, have less belly fat.

Go see your family physician for a checkup and ask if you're at a healthy weight. Don't try and guess that on your own. Regardless, ask about herbal methods to reduce or eliminate bloating that are safe for children. Do not use celebrity photos or videos as a healthy comparison for your body type. Do not trust your peers or any unschooled family members to give you safe and sound advice on this important health subject. Know that even if it turns out you need to lose fat that you are still an attractive young lady.



If your physician supports it, consult with a professional nutritionist and lifestyle expert or seek out their media. Be highly selective and avoid all fads, whatsoever. If you need to lose weight, an adult can usually only lose about two pounds a week safely, your rate is probably less. Make a healthy plan. Most of all, BE REALISTIC.

Elderly diets - what to include/exclude?



Doing research on diets for elderly people.



What food groups should be included and excluded, and why?
Also, what effect would this have on their body?
Would they be lacking in any nutrients/vitamins?
And any certain nutrients or vitamins that should be included?

Many elderly are on special diets-low sodium, diabetic, for example.
See if you can go to a Nursing Home during meal time and observe what is served and how it is served -is the food chopped up for those who don't have teeth? Is salt on the table? Are some people fed? The dietitian at a nursing home may welcome you to interview him/her

Like everyone they will need a balanced diet which includes their five a day, calcium as they get older will be a good thing, the main problem with the elderly is dehydration, the elderly associate drinking fluids with going to the toilet more frequently, which sometimes due to immobility is a problem. It's always best to keep foods simple with the elderly, often as they get older they are less able to tolerate highly spiced and fatty diets (which really should be avoided anyway). Try and stick to a low sodium diet (to be honest this is general advise for ALL age groups, we all should do this.



Actual Vitamin D and calcium supplements are a waste of time for the elderly, it's better to include calcium it in their diet.

hmmm... my friend is using herbalife and it really worked on her... i'm starting taking the supplement too... my mom said that when you want to lose weight, you have to take it AFTER every meal... when you want to gain weight... you have to take it 30 mins BEFORE each meal... in my case, i'm taking it 30 mins before meal as i am too skinny...



maybe your problem is about the way you take it...

It's unlikely this will be of much benefit. For effective weight loss, you need a healthy reduced calorie diet COMBINED with daily vigorous exercise (60-90 minutes daily) Either on it's own is unlikely to make much impact. Weight loss is a simple input and output balance, if you eat more calories than your body burns up in a day, you will gain weight. Your not getting the balance right. Less in, more out!



Your exercise regime sounds fine by the way.

A specific diet does not work for everyone. Each body/metabloism is different. I believe you need to find your body type and follow that diet, or your blood type and follow that type of diet.
My sister went on a low calorie diet and lost a lot of weight over a 12 month period. She felt great following that type of diet. I tried her diet and it did nothing. Yeah, sure I lost a few kg's in the beginning, but then I just stopped. Felt crappy all the time, headaches, etc....
I read a very good book called Eat Right For Your Blood Type. I followed that diet (and still am) and I feel excellent. I have reached my ideal weight and have maintained it for the past 18 months. It was very difficult at first because a lot of the foods that my blood type should avoid, were of course all my favourite types of foods. But I just made adjustments and have reaped the benefits.
I really think this is the best way to lose weight and stay healthy. Give the book a go. It's very well written and makes sense to me!
Hope this helps you

How much weight can I lose?



Okay, I started out at 283 lbs (any rude or mean-spirited answers will be reported, so don't waste my time or yours) and anyhow, since I've changed my eating habits (not dieting, because this is a permanent lifestyle change) and exercising by walking an hour a day in the park, I'm down to 272 since like, a week ago. I've been keeping a diary of what I eat every day. If I continue to eat like this and take a brisk 1-hour walk every day, how fast should the weight start coming off? What's the maximum you think I can lose per week and also, any opinions or advice would be nice as well. Here's what I'm eating.

I think you are doing really well. I would keep it up but keep making sure you still get a variety of foods. Also, diet sodas are actually not the best thing- but it shouldn't matter too much if you keep your water intake up too.



If you are looking for a great new diet program, you can try Strip That Fat - http://www.stripthatfatcoupon.com It comes with a diet generator where you type in the foods you like and generate meal plans around that to keep losing weight in a healthy way.

I think the best and healthiest approach is 1-2 lbs a week. That's4- 8 lbs a month, 48 lbs - 96 lbs a Year! I also think you need more protein for lean muscle mass. (Lean meat, chicken, fish 4 oz servings at lunch and dinner) Also more food in general. Try 6 meals a day, you're only going 3 now. I would go crazy in a short time. Enjoy your breakfast too girl. Eat a hand full of nuts every now and then too. I like the whole grains idea and the fruit. you just need more frequency.

the best is to take it at night so you have a good poo when you wake up in the morning and thats all. i recommend only taking a small amount to start to see how your body reacts, then add the dosage as you feel needed. dont take it everyday for more than a week though or your body will learn to depend on it and thats never good...

1. I think it would be a good idea to eat fruit with yoghurt and museli in the morning. Or you could have a high proiten breakfast eg. omlette with capsicum, cheese and ham.



2. Doing a variety of excersizes is always best, but I think the treadmill would burn most calories, especially if you move your arms t the same time.

How much fruit is too much (sugar) per day?



i stay away from table sugar but i would like to burn more fat and gain muscle. i work out regularly as i work at golds gym and eat tons of protein and everything i need to, to gain muscle and reduce body fat. however since i dont believe in energy drinks, i tend to crave fruit and natural sugar for energy... i think its effecting my fat loss though cuz i mostly burn carbs... how much natural sugar should you consume a day and what can i do to improve my energy?

Yes I agree that you can lose weight using this method.



Any form of exerting exercise will allow your body to shed weight. As long as the exercise is consistent.  Don't forget to drink water before, during and after your workout as suggested on a lot of fitness tv programs. Very good exercises are taught by Denise Austin. Especially for beginners.  She may be on your local listings. Good luck.

i'm 12 and 100 pounds too, i'm slender. i am on the tall side though, so it depends on height. i wouldn't go on a diet, but make sure you get enough of each food group and get around 2000-2500 calories a day

lol..



flexing is what makes them bulge. the only thing that will make your biceps more noticable is to work them out. Do curls and stuff to make them bigger- also do tricep workouts, because if your triceps are bigger they'll push your bi's out and make them look even bigger than they are.



Big arms are a result of hours of hard work in the gym, so get in there and get to work.. there is no ASAP magic method.

Want to know the reason(s) why some people look like they have "buldging biceps w/o flexing?



1) They work out regularly and their Bicep and Tricep Bracii are taunt from it and Hypotrophed ( enlarged)



2) They have a low body fat so there is less " protective skin" on top of the muscle, so you end up getting more of a buldged look.



Ok, so you are doing these things ( working out and burning fat) but you want to offer the illusion of having " Buldging Biceps "?



It is as simple as a wardrobe switch



Start wearing tighter shirts.  If you are normally a large, go down to a medium.  If your abs havent caught up then wear a tank top Underneath it ( tucked in to keep excess from showing)  If the shirt is too short... put it on the floor, step on the shoulders and grab the bottom with your hands.. now lightly, but firmly stretch the material.. Don;t worry, if it is cotton it will give...... Put it on and leave it untucked and POOF!!!  you have the illusion of sleeve stretchign biceps until your workout regimen catches up.



Hope this helps :)

Unless you already have decent sized arms, and just need sometihng to boost vascularity, the best advice I can give you is to start putting on more muscle, and eventually the size of your biceps will always be noticable to everyone.



Also, do not overlook the TRICEPS!!!!!! The triceps are visibly much larger, and make up 2/3 of the visual part of the region. You should never focus on just one muscle group, as this will make you look foolish rather than cool in the eyes of those whom it really matters.



OK.........here's probably the answer you would have wanted to hear from the very beginning:



NITRIC OXIDE BOOSTERS



These will help your muscles pump up quickly after just a few exercises, and the pump will last for quite a while after you've gotten your blood pumping!

How do i tone my upper back and first ab?



I want to know how you can tone your back?
Im not overweight however i find that when i wear a bra, or if im wearing my bikini, it digs in, or collects excess area. Its really annoying and i want to know how to tone this area up.



Also, the area under my breasts..like the 'first ab' - the area on top of bottom of my lungs-  i find really hard to tone. I know how to tone my stomach area etc, but i just can't seem to tone the part above my actual stomach

Bent over rows help upper back your elbows should be parallel to shoulders. Try shrugs with the weight held behind your back.  Cable rows are als extremely helpful, again for upper back, keep your arms abducted to 90 degrees, try to pinch shoulder blades together when exercising. 5 sets, low weight. Negatives 2X as long as positive.



The upper part of the six pack: suck stomach muscles in then do crunch.  1 set, to fatigue--good burn

I'm an ideal weight, but still fat (PICTURES INSIDE)?



I started my weight loss in February 2008, i have lost 5 stone (70 lbs) in 9 months.



- I'm a male
- 20 years old
- I now weigh 10 stone 12 pounds (152 lbs)
- I am 5"9 tall
- According to BMI websites, i am the ideal weight for my height



- I do at least 30 minutes of exercise per day (walking, jogging, cross-country machine)



- I do weight training every 2 days (dumbbells, flys, bench press, push-ups, squats)



- My diet is very good, i eat 5-6 small meals per day and have been very successful



------------------------------



I'm very happy that i have lost so much weight in only 9 months, but I'm slightly disappointed that my body is still far from perfect. My man-boobs are still quite big, so i don't have the confidence to wear t-shirts in public that often - My stomach is still not flat, I'm not sure whether it's fat or excess skin (?) Also, i have fat/skin on my back, which stands out.



What should i do? Should i cut down my cardio? Because i don't want to be underweight and skinny. Please help me out guys!

I'd have to say try weight lifting and more muscle toning excercises.  Cardio is good for burning fat but toning is what you need.

Sometimes body shape is just genetic and even though you are a healthy weight you carry "pockets" of fat in certain areas, which are "problem areas", now i don't promote surgery as a solution for weight problems, but if you are saying you do all these things and still have these pockets of fat, then it may be that liposuction would be a good choice for you. Toning will help so keep doing abdominal exercises such as crunches and sit ups.



BTW i am just a stay at home mum, i am not a surgeon or an affiliate of anything but i have seen cases like yours before where only lipo has worked.

Oh it's you again Polly,  Look you seem obsessed with food in general and your diet. You posted pictures of yourself the other day, and myself and the other 30 odd people that answered told you, you are not fat! . We ALL (even me) have binge eating days, I had one yesterday. As long as you don't do this all the time, it is not an issue. You need to include daily exercise in your life.

You need to adjust your attitude to food and/or yourself. There are phycological reasons for this sort of behaviour but I'm not qualified to comment on those. What I will say is try to think of food as fuel (this is helped if you exercise - as suggested above). Food should not be viewed as a drug or punishment nor used to alter your mood.



If you binge through hunger - then try to sort out a decent diet that doesn't leave you starving and make sure you have something healthy to hand like carrots.

Im not sure of exercises, hopefully some one else can help you on that one. But alot of women are like this. try maybe darker colours on the bottom to try and make them appear slimmer. if she wears heels tell her to make sure they dont have a strap round the front of the ankle as that will make them appear chubbier. i know all these tips as i have really slim legs so do the opposite to try and make mine appear fuller !



Anyway...this may be no use to you but i thought id put it down anyway. hopefully you'll get some good answers for exercises. good luck!

You're feeling less sore because it IS working. Your bodies are getting stronger.



Push yourself just a little bit more each time. For example, run 1 1/2 laps, then walk one lap. It's important to strike a balance between pushing yourself and overdoing it. It's good to be a little sore the next day, but not so sore that you have to put off exercising so you don't hurt yourself.



It sounds like you're both doing a great job; keep it up!

yes it is very possible... Those are the common fat places on our bodies. Stomach, thighs, hips.....You can easily pick up weight there, but when you want to loose it it can be a pain in the butt. When you consume too much fat usually they will end up there

196 pound male (14 stone), 6ft, with a belly! want to lose weight! ?



Hi, I am starting the gym tommorow.



I am a 23 year old male, 14 stone (196 pounds) and 6ft.



My bmi is slightly into the overweight, however I am increasingly concerned that i am putting on weight. My stomach is an issue as I have gone up a trouser size. And looking at old pictures my face seems much bigger than what it used to be!



Anyway, does anybody have any tips out there? I have lose weight before but i was living on my own then, and was probably down to not eating!



I want to lose the belly and tone up. I am not interested in becoming the next sly stallone, just want to be able to fit my clothes again!



Thanks

<answer>



I lost 1.5 stone (21 lb) from 12st to 10.5st (I'm 5 foot 8) last year as my jeans were starting to get a bit tight.



I cut out the starches (bread, potatoes, rice, pasta) and started eating lots of fruits and vegetables and lean meats. I'm not talking about Atkins here, but starches are basically "filler foods" with little nutritional value but lots of calories.
Also, once you cut out the bread, you will be cutting out the butters and fats that go with them, and high calorie sandwiches.



Then do a little exercise every day (A mile or two run should be enough) and the weight will drop off.



Once the weight is off it may be possible to relax the diet a bit (maybe at weekends) and maintain the weight, but you can't go back to old habits or the weight will go straight back on.



Remember it's a change in lifestyle and there are no short term fixes.



Good luck :)

Plz help me...lack of interest in food...?



lately ive just lost alot of interest in food. i still like what i like, but ive also gone off alot of foods. And also, because my dinner break is at 1.10 pm in the week, im usually past hungry by then, and i dont eat much for breakfast as its too early for me. so im not easting as much as i should be. i used to eat like every hour, but now im getting used to been hungry that its not bothering me that much anymore.



the thing is i am naturally slim, and am one of those people who have to work hard to keep weight on. so this is worrying me now and i wondered if any1 had any tips for how i can figure out eating when my dinner is so late in the day. and why do you think ive gone off a lot of foods?



by the way i dont have an eating disorder or anything, i realise that im probably too slim and i do want help to put some weight on.



(5 ft 6, and weight about 7st 5lb.)



So any help would be great thanks. sorry its so long.

Carry something with you.



Take like almonds or raisins in a bag and then munch on them when you get hungry.



Also force yourself to eat a bowl of something in the morning.



Lastly, if you are not craving food, go back to your comfort foods that you always love.

Last year i desperately wanted to lose weight so i thought if i don't do it now, i never will and i didn't want to spend the rest of my young life  overweight.



So i started in late september last year and went for a four mile walk at least 3 times a week.  (sometimes everyday) I cut down on chips, chocolate, cakes, basically anything that was fattening.



For the first couple of months it was hard but as soon as people started to notice and i wacomplimenteded on my figure it kinda gave me the extra boost i needed to carry on.  Now i have dropped 3 dress sizes in 4 months and believe me it was sooo worth it!!
You need to find an exercise regime that suits you personally, even if it is walking.



You will soon see the results....go for it girl!!!!

Sometimes I have problems getting motivated to work out. But once i get over it and actually go to the gym and spend an hour or so there i feel so good i don't wanna quit.
So the next day even if i still don't feel motivated i just remember how great i felt the day before, and i go anyway. And find out i still love it just as much.
Working out just feels awesome. My wife does the same thing. It's a lot of work if you're really into it, but you feel rejuvenated. Also. I don't work out for other people. I work out for myself. If i were to work out just so i'm more accepted by other people i most likely wouldn't enjoy it half as much.



Just do it. grab your running shoes and go out there. It also helps if you can find a friend or someone else you know to join you. Always made it easier for me to get in after some time off. Join a class if you have to.

Finding the motivation to exercise involves a combination of starting with short workouts (and then lengthening them over time, when your body and mind feel ready), making sure you're doing an exercise you like, and changing up your exercise routine when you get stuck in a rut.



I mainly walk (outdoors), but I do it because I love it. I also do Pilates for the same reason, but I did try a couple of yoga classes to see if I'd like that to; I didn't, so I don't do yoga. I used to do aerobics in the living room, but after five years of it almost everday, I got burned out and moved on to something else. I'm into swimming and tap dancing as well (yep, just get some cheap tap shoes, beginning DVDs, tap mats to tap if you don't already have a good floor, and you're all set), but I know I like them because I've tried them out. That said, I can't stand the gym. Experimentation is the key to finding what you really like.



When I haven't exercised for a while, I make the effort to do something for a minimum of 3 days a week for at least 3 weeks (they say that habits form in 21 days). When I'm on point, I find myself working out for at least 60 minutes/day 5 days a week; but I never beat myself up if I'm not on point, or even if I don't feel like exercising.



Keeping the benefits of exercise in mind is also a motivator. It makes you feel great (especially if your prone to depression), you get your body in shape, and you don't have to starve yourself because you're burning calories (you can't have brownies and pizza everyday, but you know what I mean).



Brainstorm physical activity that you'd find interesting (not what other people tell you is interesting), start slowly with 20-30 min workouts, remind yourself of the benefits, and accept where your body is and what it can do without beating yourself up over it.



And don't forget to have fun!

Fats, proteins, and carbs are converted into energy by the muscles. This energy then leaves the body mainly in the form of heat (through the maintenance of body temperature) but also in some other forms (sound energy for example).



Remember that energy cannot be made or destroyed, just changed from one form to another.



There are many chemical reactions that take place within the body to allow muscles to convert foods to useable enery. A useful link is here:

When you 'lose weight' your body burns fat that has previously been  stored, for energy. It's like raiding the fridge when you're hungry! You need energy, the body raids your fat stores. If we stick with the fridge analogy, when you raid it, it leaves the fridge emptier - your body raids your fat stores, they get smaller.



Fat is metabolised, or burned, when the pancreas releases an enzyme called lipase which breaks down the fat so it can pass through the digestive system and be converted to the energy your body needs.



You can get more info by typing in 'fat metabolism' into any search engine.

With the diet of red tea, at a rate of 4 cups per day, it was observed a loss up to 7 pounds in 5 days. This diet is thus an excellent starting point when one starts a diet and should be followed of a balanced diet to ensure the slimming and not to suffer from a yo-yo effect.



If one achieved the goal and lost 6 or 7 pounds in 5 days, one will gradually add other food to the proposed menus: meats, dairy products, etc., and so not lose the benefit of the diet.

It takes time to tone up. You need to set a realistic goal, Oct. 18th is not an ideal deadline for noticeable changes.  There are many factors that contribute to your wants. Information such as current exercise and diet, available time and resources for an exercise program, and metabolism rate is required. Now these are just the basics, as you get more involved with a plan, more information about your physiology and dietary intake will be necessary in order to give accurate advice for your fitness program.



You could start though by curls and tricep extensions, running 3-4 miles a day will be a huge bonus. If you cannot run then perform some sort of moderate cardio for at least 30 minutes a day (you will burn exponentially more kcals anything more than 30 mins. at a time)

How do I lose my "belly" and tone up?



I am quite overweight and currently on a diet, however, I would like to achieve a flat stomach. I am not sure what to do first.. lose the weight and then tone up or both at the same time. If I do both at the same time, will my stomach become larger as it will be toning the muscles before I have lost the weight?

People always want to overcomplicate it but its really very simple, eat less and exercise more.



Diets don't work.  The best thing is to SLOWLY evolve your diet into making healthier choices.



Same with exercise, slowly increase your exercise amount.  Aerobic exercise (such as walking, running, swimming or x-country skiing) is the best for fat loss.



Resistance training is good for strengthening muscles and can be done at the same time but its not as effective for weight loss.



There is such a thing as muscle 'tone' but for the most part 'toning' is a misunderstood and misrepresented marketing ploy for all the hundreds of sham products out there.

To achieve what you want you need to change your diet so it is full of low fat and low carb foods and no junk food, sugary foods and drinks.



Then you need to focus on doing cardio exercises at least 3/4 times a week for a minimum of 25 mins.  This will get your body into fat burning mode and will have an effect on the size of your belly.



The toning exercises are good too - The Plank, crunches, scissor kicks etc and you should do those after your cardio but remember that the cardio and diet is where you will get the flat stomach from.  the toning is simply to help define the muscles so don't just do 100 sit ups every night.

if you want to loose weight and have a toned stomach you need to do some crunches or sit-ups that will get you a flat stomach. and if you want to loose weight try to exercise more often. for ex. try to walk at for at least 30 min. or you could workout at the gym.

Using things that are made to work out your abs will not actually give you a flat stomach if you have fat there. It may give you stronger stomach muscles, but they will still be covered in fat.



Do lots and lots of cardio (running, aerobics, biking, swimming, etc.) This will help you drop excess fat. You can also do some weightlifting, because building muscle also helps you drop fat since it uses more of the calories that you take in than fat does.



Once your stomach is a bit smaller, then start with the crunches or anything made to tone the abs. But continue with the cardio work, it's very healthy and will help you drop more weight or at least keep any weight that you've dropped, from coming back.



Good luck!

What would be a better form of excericise?



I have two options,



1) Boxing gym with some machines and free weight dumbells but no barbells, daily boxing classes focusing on drillsand technique.



2) Full weight gym with everything you can imagine in terms of machines and free weights. Cardio would be on a machine.



What would be the best option for overall conditioning. I miss doing the bench and leg press etc but at the same time there is nothing like doing 5 rounds on a punch bag with someone coaching you.



Any experienced people have any guidance.



Also how often can I train a week, i usually do around 4 days on Cardio and strength and then take 3 days off.

It all depends on your body type.. some people put on weight like it's nothing and some people can't do it to save their life. I'd say you can expect anywhere from 5-10 pounds, depending on where you are right now.



If you're training 6 days a week make sure you're getting a good split so you don't overtrain your muscles.. for example don't do something involving triceps 3 days in a row, be sure to vary things up and give yourself time to rest. Let your body tell you what to and what not to work.. if your upper body is sore but your schedule has you doing a chest workout, take it really light or take that day off till you recover. The recovery stage is when your muscles actually grow, so if you don't get good rest you will accomplish nothing.



be sure to add abs and core exercises in as well.. too many people weight train like madmen and completely forget stuff like abs.



good luck!

Because if you watch what you eat (and more importantly, exercise regularly) , you *can* enjoy a few glasses of wine or some beers or a cocktail without going crazy about how many calories you are consuming.  I am am healthy and fit and I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner or a few beers on the weekend.  I'm not going to beat myself up about it.

Im glad someone finally brought this up because this is very true. I know way too many guy (and gals) that get in big health kicks and start dieting and working out but never lay off of the drinking and they wonder why they arnt seeing good results. Im am actually guilty of this myself, I worked out and dieted hardcore last year but still came home to a six pack of beer every night. Now that Ive quit drinking, the pounds literally have fallen off of me. I weighed 225 in January (had big muscles, and a big gut too) and now weigh 185 (solid muscle, no gut). With all the calories you cut, you gain them back and then some with every drink you have!

you need good abs to be a better distance runner? I was under the impression it was a bit more involved with your legs and cardio :\



Anyway, there is no BEST ab workout.. but there are thousands of variations on basic ones so you can find which one you like best. Google "ab workouts" and you'll get millions of results, most with pics and videos that show you how to do them. My personal favorite exercises are flutter kicks and "full-body" sit-ups done on a bench.

6 Second Abs, it's a simple machine that clicks 3 times as you go down and 3 times as you go up, doing it in 6 seconds (1 second a click) is supposed to be the best way. You can get them from eBay for around £12, it's basically a crunch machine.

i prefer the bicycle ones.
the one where you have your hands at your temples and you keep on rotating elbow to opposite knee and its continous motion. so your abs never stop working. to raise the level on that, you can use a medicine ball or dumbells.
but you need to work out all areas of your abs to increase stamina and strength. obliques, lower back. the whole core.
back extensions, where you lay face down like superman, but take your hands and put them up on your temples again and while keeping your lower body still and on the ground, lift your upper half of your body off the ground and hold and go back down.



to make it harder you can go up and twist left then right and thats a rlly good lower back core workout.

protein builds muscle so make sure to include lean meats in your diet. also healthy protein shakes are not only really yummy, but they help get your protein in without sabotaging your diet. i would suggest Standard Process SP Complete shake mix. it's an all natural protein shake mix that you can make quickly and it will really help. it's what i have for breakfast every morning. :) and just another tip, hitting the gym too often can actually slow down your success.



hope this helps!

Are you wanting to be anorexic? I'd hope not. But the best way to stay in shape would be to exercise. Do 15 minutes of cardio and 20 minutes of an intense muscular workout and you should be fine.

You really should be eating around 1700 calories a day for someone your age.  Eating 500 calories a day will only make your metabolism slow down and you will gain weight.  Just make sure that you exercise and eat right (fruits, veggies, complex carbs, lean meats) and you will be fine.

eating fewer calories does not help with weight loss. it slows down your metabolism which slows down your rate at which you burn calories. my advice is to eat at least 1100 calories per day. however, make sure what you're eating is healthy. the best route is to go all natural and organic. honestly, your bmi (body mass index which measures your body fat based on your weight and height) is right where it needs to be. it's 20.3 and a healthy bmi is between 18.5 and 24.9. if you would really like to get healthy, i would suggest doing the standard process purification program. it's a 3 week detoxification program which helps your body get rid of all its toxins. if you do it correctly, you will lose the amount of weight necessary to make sure you are healthy.



i hope this helps!

Get a hobby. Really, we started knitting with the knifty knitter, and I don't eat as much because I am working on my project.



Option 2-Take one bite and then BURY IT in the trash. The first bite is the only good one anyway.



Option 3-Eat it and don't have any candy for the rest of the week. The candy is the first thing to burn, so you won't be getting rid of fat you already have.

Just throw the candy into the bin... you can do it. Dont worry though, if you are doing really good on your diet and excersise regime, you can always treat yourself to a candy bar at the end of the week! Only a small one though...Ok maybe one of your choice if you do exceptionally well. Good Luck!!

i think thats a really good diet because you got lots of fruits and vegetables in, also because of the wholemeal bap, that means extra fibre



having porridge for lunch is i guess a good idea since it releases enegry really slow, so you wont be snacking in the middle



yup thats pretty healthyy

You shouldn't lift any weights until the initial pain goes away. You should ice your shoulder now until the swelling goes down.



Work out other parts of your body and cardio.



When you get back to the pool, ice EVERY time you get out.



Ask your coach which exercises you can do outside the pool to help build your muscles in your shoulder. Slowly, low weight.

You might want to add some push ups for the chest muscles.  The power that you gain will aid in performing explosive moves inside of the pool.  There is also nothing working your back so do some seated rowing on a machine or using the cable pulleys.  When you are doing the bench press ensure that you do the three types (reg, incline, and decline), that way you target all three heads of the chest muscles.



Good Luck!!

If you think you have swimmers shoulder then you should probably see a physio just to make sure...
I personally wouldn't do any exercises that involve using the shoulder, however any core or lower body exercises will be fine.
To overcome this problem it might be worth working with an experienced coach or swimmer to develop a better shoulder roll.



This usually not only helps get rid of the problem, but also makes for a more efficient stroke.



Hope this helps

Your best bet, is do what I'm doing. Get healthy, stave active, so keep drinking a lot of water, its so good for you, you don't even know. Now, you should start running, two to three times a week. (I recently registered at a gym, which is useful) Start lifting weights, start doing exercise. Exercise at least every two days. Think of how people think of you, and how it angers you; or the people you love and who you are doing it for. Exercise, and plenty of water and positive thoughts is what will lead you through life. Eat well, take vitamins, ect..

I recommend these exercises 4 to 5 times per week:



Crunches
Bicycle Crunches
Planks
Side Planks
Torso Twists



Do one set each with 30 seconds rest between exercises. Rest 3 minutes. Repeat. You'll be in agony at the end of the 2nd cycle. As you get better, increase the number of reps per exercise or increase to 3 cycles, keeping rep and rest parameters same.



Finally, you should be getting at least 30 mins of cardio 5x a week to get your body fat down real low. You need to be at least 8% bodyfat for a full 6 pack to show. And you know of course that to do this, you need to be dieting correctly.

No, that is too little of time to get into shape. I would give it about 2 months at least. Work out (with weights) On Mon., Wed. and Fri. Do cardio On Tues, Thurs, and Sat. and rest on Sunday. Within two months you will be toned and "ripped".

In order to gain muscle tone and definition you need to lift weights.  Cardio is only helpful when you want to lose body fat.  I would develop a lifting program that targets specific muscle groups during specific days of the week.



For example,
Monday: bicep, tricep, back
Tuesday: Rest
Wednesday: Legs
Thursday: Rest
Friday: Back & shoulders



All muscles require 24 -48 hours of rest in order to repair the damage that is done by lifting the weights.  Training this way (depending on the weight) should start to produce results in about 3-5 weeks.  This process will not quick fix anything.  It is hard and will take time but the results will be rewarding.  If there was a quick and easy way, don't you think that everyone would look great.



Good Luck!!

Is eating every hour healthier then every 2-3?



i know people say its supposed to speed up your metabolism when you eat 5-6 small meals every 2-3 hours each day rather than 3 big meals. but would it work even more if i ate something small but healthy every hour? i have the time forthis and i wouldnt mind it. i just want to know if it would be as effective. thanks!

That is such a good question!  Everything I read (articles, research papers, books, etc.) list the standard 2-3 hours.  I think that there is probably a reason for that.  I don't think our digestive systems would be able to process food like that.

Eating every hour is too often. The reason people say to eat every 2 to 3 hours is because your body technically goes into starvation mode after 3 hours and starts eating at your muscles (a catabolic state). For building muscle you need to be in an anabolic state, where you body is building muscle instead of burning it for energy. Eating every 2 to 3 hours also keeps you from over eating when its time to have your main meals (breakfest, lunch and dinner) which will cause you body to store more fat. Stick with 5 to 6 meals a day and you'll do fine; every hour will just make you fat.

You wouldnt loose ANY weight. You body will be starved and will hold on to the fat for dear life just to keep you body functioning properly. I dont know why people think there is  a "miracle solution" to loosing weight. The ONLY way to loose weight is to eat right, drink plenty of water, and EXERCISING!!!

You won't lose ANY weight because your body isn't getting enough food and will most probably store the food you are taking in as fat.  You will also feel very tired and weak all the time, you will look ill! Also when the 30 days is up you will just put weight on straight away.



I know this isn't what you want to hear but if your serious about losing weight cut out junk food eat lots of fruit and veg and exercise!



Also when you're hungry 9 times out of 10 it's because you are thirsty so have a glass of water first and if your hungry after that have some food.



Good luck.

With the diet of red tea, at a rate of 4 cups per day, it was observed a loss up to 7 pounds in 5 days. This diet is thus an excellent starting point when one starts a diet and should be followed of a balanced diet to ensure the slimming and not to suffer from a yo-yo effect.



If one achieved the goal and lost 6 or 7 pounds in 5 days, one will gradually add other food to the proposed menus: meats, dairy products, etc., and so not lose the benefit of the diet.

You are nowhere NEAR overweight. The average adult man is 5'9" and 190 lbs. The people in your class might appear a lot skinner than you because you are much more grown up than them. You are already taller than the average man, and weigh much less. As you grow older, you will have bigger muscles (as you clearly do) and will overall seem thicker. This does not make you fat, it makes you more of a man than your peers.



Another problem is that it is really hard to get comparison between yourself and those in your class. You can never see yourself from a distance the same way you see them. The view from looking down on the rest of your body, or in a mirror are not accurate. Plus the clothes you wear can drastically effect how you look. You aren't overweight at all, so don't be so hard on yourself. If you are really struggling with that issue, try talking to your school counselor. Talking to your counselor doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with you. They are there to help you deal with things that stress you out such at this.



After you talk to your counselor, you could try eating a more balanced diet and exercising regularly if you are still concerned. The most important part is that you are healthy, not that you are a certain weight. Look at http://www.mypyramid.gov/ for ideas about how much of each food group you should be eating in a day. Eating a balanced diet will ensure that you get all of the vitamins that you need to keep growing and to stay a healthy weight. To build tone that will make you look nice and lean, try joining a sports team at your school or biking or walking around your neighbor hood or a local park a few days a week.



You most definitely are not even close to overweight or fat. You are actually UNDERweight if anything. Try your best to stay healthy, talk to your counselor, and don't compare yourself to others in your class. All of you are growing at that age, some of you faster than others.

By just looking at it, you're no where near overweight. Since you're tall and you ownly weigh about 57kg. If you're unsure, google "Calculate BMI" and type in your height and weight to find your BMI. If your BMI ranges around 18.5-24.5, you're normal weight.

Well, I am not totally sure why you are just targeting certain muscles, but if you want someone else's advice, this is what I would say:



Do all the varieties of push ups  (( wide, regular, and Diamond))
Do allot of pull ups----also using different approaches......wide & narrow ,and regular grip.



Put your feet up on a bench, have your arms on another bench behind you, extend all the way down---making a 90 degree angle with your arms, and go back up......repeat this as many times as you can. This is an AWESOME Triceps work out.



Using the Row machine works out the triceps, however its primary purpose is your Lattisimus Dorsi.



I would HIGHLY suggest developing your ENTIRE upper body. Doing only a couple muscle groups will make your upper body look totally out of proportion. I'll take your word for it that you are actually doing your lower body workout, but make sure everything stays in proportion.



Best of wishes!

No - the muscle you will gain from sit ups is already there - you are simply toning them up and you are not using weights to gain extra muscle so I wouldn't be worried about that.  Why don't you try running on the treadmill in between walking and this will help you get into the fat burning zone and help speed up your metabolism?

I think she is not right. Before gaining muscle you have to lose the fat. so doing that and dieting you'll lose fat.



Try to drink red tea, According to studies' made in relation to the red tea, it was observed that the people having an overweight lost up to 18 pounds only with its absorption. People having a moderated overweight, up to 12 pounds and people having a light overweight, between 4 and 7 pounds.



With the diet of red tea, at a rate of 4 cups per day, it was observed a loss up to 7 pounds in 5 days. This diet is thus an excellent starting point when one starts a diet and should be followed of a balanced diet to ensure the slimming and not to suffer from a yo-yo effect.

no that person is wrong. The situps will give you muscle tone in your stomach , but still burn fat. The treadmill  is cardio and will definately burn fat.It would take an awful lot of either to cause any weight gain. Stay away from a lot of push-ups or pull-ups though!

Is this a good life style change plan? ( diet )?



I trying to do a life style change on my own! I'm very over weight at 25 years old being 209lbs at only 5' 2". I kinda just blew up over a year period never changing any of my eating habits or activity habits, I have 3 kids but I didn't start gaining weight till my youngest child turned a year old, so ?
I just don't have the will power to "DIET" so im doing a life style change, here is what im doing....
I'm not restricting any foods
I'm eating small portions every 3 hours 4-5 times a day
staying at or under 1,200 cal a day
and drinking at least 8 bottles of water a day
writing everything I consume down with the time



Now I know I need to exercise but I need to get used to one change at a time. So for now I jump on the treadmill when I'm thinking about it, do 200 crunches every other day, I have weights that I curl when on the computer or watching tv, and I play catch with my husband or children every day. Right now I'm just trying to sneak exercise in my daily routine till I can get the discipline to follow a regiment.



So am I on the right track?
Do you think I will see a change?
I also threw away my scale because I didn't what to get discouraged!
one more thing I normally drink beer on a regular basis but I have gave it up too, haven't had any in a week, and it I have a beer in the future I plan on staying in my daily cal range and only drinking one ever so offten.

Diet Pills. Nuphedrine? Ephedrine?



first off to make things clear,



i DONT need any answers along the lines of no, don't take diet pills they dont work, are full of chemicals blah blah blah. heard enough of those, and am and wil not be swayed over. so don't waste your time.



i live in singapore, small island, anyways i;ve read somewhere that pills containing ephedrine (ephedra/ ma huang) works really well. but they're supposedly illegal?



does anyone know where to get them in singapore? or is it illegal?



and does anyone know if Nuphedrine works just as well? and is it possible to buy it in singapore?



oh and any other thermogenic or other diet pills that actually work well would help too^^



and please state if you tried them yourself, and how well they worked...



thankyou!

Generally, with such a massive amount of weight to lose, some saggy skin is inevitable. I know it's tough to hear but that's usually the case.



One thing your friend can do to minimize this effect is to lose weight VERY gradually, I'm talking about something like 1lb per week. At this rate, the body has time to adapt to the loss in fat mass.



Another thing to do is to build up muscle mass. With some muscle to "fill up" the space left by the lost fat, the skin will appear to sag less. That's why I will normally never agree to take on a client for fat loss if they're unwilling to do weight training. To me, it is absolutely essential to do both.



Other than that I'm really not sure what else can be done. She should consult her doctor for more information about possible surgical intervention if really necessary.

Toning the muscles will help to fill the gaps.  See fat occupies more space inside of the body and muscle takes up less space, so gaining muscle will make her look slim but it also helps to fill in some of the void that will be left after losing the fat.  Her skin will sag but the younger you are the more your skin can take.  Also losing weight at the slower rate will allow the skin to spring back into its original shape.

I have a friend who is working towards losing approx 60kg. She has the same concerns and has currently lost 20kg and is happy so far. She uses herbalife and takes a vitamin that supposedly strengthens your skin tone to help prevent sagging. I guess it would also depend on whether she has stretch marks, as not much can be done about them. You could suggest she looks at this site www.naturalw8loss4u.info. My friend has been crash dieting for yrs on every diet you could think of. She says this is the best one with the best results she has been on yet, and that says alot coming from her. Hope this helps.

Her skin will definitely sag if she loses that much weight. Any stretch marks she might have in the body might become more obvious too. Of course your friend can always consult a doctor and see if anything can be done about that



Um... how does your friend intend to lose that much weight? It's not healthy to go on crash diets, you know, and they rarely work anyway... Please ask her to consult a doctor about that as well

It takes time. It took time to get bigger, it'll take time to get smaller. Exercising is important. Toning exercise is even more important. I use essential oils, for most of my health needs. http://www.youngliving.us/products.asp is cool. You should get a book and/talk to one of their oil people or whatever to find which ones will help. Also remember the foods you put in your body have a MAJOR effect on , well, every part of your body. Green veggies, raw fruits and veggies are key, they're alive. They regenerate your live body. VERY important. But most of all remember. You can't turn back the clock. If you got big and your skin gets saggy in the losing, you will have to live with some saggy skin. You really do reap what you sow. Just be thankful you were able to lose the weight, and take care of your body form now on. Trust me I know.

Well, I'm a big fan of tightening you stomach muscles and doing twists and standing side crunches as I cook or watch tv.  I do leg lifts while I watch tv for as long as I can all day long.  When I pick things up I do squats and add like 20 -30 at the moment when I have time.  When I'm on my knees to get things from under the furniture I do donkey kicks and stuff....I climb the stairs to my 9th floor apartment when I'm in my sneakers....
Good luck...I'm all about working out without working out....hope you find your things....that you can do all day as I do....and works...

How to get rid of your "love handles"



1) grab 2 dumbbells of moderate weight
2) stand up with arms at your side
3) bend sideways with legs straight and try to touch the outside of your ankle with the dumbbell
4) return to sneutral position
5) Do the opposite side
6) return to neutral
You have done 1 rep. Now do 9 more and that is 1 set, now do 3 more sets = 4 sets and that is a good "love handle workout"



Inner thighs. Adduction and Abduction



Mostly gym machines are for this but you can get by without it.



1) Grab a "dodge ball" or a half deflated basketball
2) sit down and put it between your thighs
3) press inward with your thighs as far as you can and hold it for 3 sec.
4) return to neutral position
That was 1 rep, do 9 more for 1 set, do 3 more sets for 4 sets and that is a decent workout for your inner thighs



You can also do:



Lay on your side with your hand cradling your head and your legs outstetched and toes poitned
Lift one leg as high as you can and hold it for 3 sec
Slowly drop it back to neutral position
that is 1 rep, do it 9 more, that is 1 set, do it 3 more sets that is 4 sets... NOW flip over to other side and repeat.... That is another good thigh/bun workout.



Also Leg lifts and sit ups will help you as well.  Just remember to do proper form.  WHen doing sit ups NEVER rest your chin against your cchest or interlace your fingers behind your head.  Instead, lift your chin upwards and put your hands at the sides of your head ( this will prevent your natural reaction to want to "pull" your head up when the resistance gets tough"



I hope this helps

Not talking about "slim fast" or anything like that, I'm talking about a high quality, high protein, high fiber meal replacement shake to drink 1 or 2 times a day because I don't have the time to cook nor eat healthy meals. I work 13 hours a day (including drive time), gym, have dogs, sleep... my days are so full that if I'm hungry I might just stop and get a big mac and I'm so tired of doing that! I'm trying to BE healthy and it's getting a little difficult. What types of meal supplements would you suggest? Thanks!

Bodybuilding.com sells a product called "Muscle Juice 2488"  This is a Whey protein shake that is VERY filling, packed with protein and other ECC,NECC, and is VERY affordable.  ( 32.00 shipped for a 10.75 lb bucket.)  Take it at least twice a day and you won;t have to worry about being hungry for a while :)



You can get a Special K proteinbar at the grocery store that has a solid 5g of protein per bar ( which is nice for a little bar).



Other than that try packing grapes or other fruit with you on your endeavors to snack on.

Why don't you try to pack all of our meals for the next day the night before.  Our bodies require nutrition via food and not liquids.  Liquids break down too fast in the body and you will eat more then you think when you go to eat because you will feel so hungry.  It takes work but the benefits work out in the end.



If you really must eat the shakes and bars ensure that they contain the following:
Shakes: 26g protein, 3g fat or less, 5g of carbs of less
Bars: 20g of fat or less, 20g protein or more, 50g of carbs or less



Not all bars and shakes are truly health.  Some of the bars are worse then eating a snickers or other chocolate bar.

The best source of nutrition i have come across is herbalife shakes. They are a balanced meal replacement and were invented for the nasa astronauts. They taste great also. It contains vitamins,minerals, 18 amino acids. You can have 2 a day as meal replacements and still get the correct daily intake of nutrition. Go to www.naturalw8loss4u.info.

I'm about 70 pounds over weight and I'm so tired of being fat. and well frankly so is my b/f of almost 4 years. He's never really seen me when i used to be thin but he's seen pictures of me and wants me to look like that. well so do i. but for some reason i can't seem to lose the weight. I'm 25 and have a 2 year old daughter. I've reduced my food intake by a lot. and i'm constantly moving around at my work ( walking, bending down, squatting etc) i can't figure out why i'm not losing anything. please if anyone can give me some suggestions I'm getting desperate.

you really dont need to loose weight. trying diets at young ages can damage your hormones. just start healthy eating or slowly remove a few fatty snacks from your diet and maybe you will drop some weight. try eating 5-6 smaller meals a day. your not fat and you have a really nice body to be proud of.

It looks like you may have a lot of muscle on your body.  You are also in the average BMI at about 24 I think.  20lbs lost would be very unhealthy for you at most lose 5 or 10lbs you can easily do this by exercising at least three times a week and making a good note of what you eat.

Couple question about whey powder drinks.?



Should i drink it on my "off days" when i dont workout? my abs have flattened alot in a short amount of time due to eating right and working out. But im shooting for 6 pack abs or just some ab muscles that are visible and i drink the "ON Gold standard" Whey protein choclate mint drink and im sore right now from yesterdays workout. and i was wondering this since I heard this drink turns extra fat into muscle, would this result in getting 6 pack abs even on my off days of not working out?

This is a topic that is widely debated in the health and fitness arenas. The anti-supplement camp says that a person can get all of the nutrients they need by eating a variety of healthy foods in the right proportions. They suggest eating at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day along with enough dairy products, lean protein and whole grains. In their minds the supplement manufacturers are just out to get your money.



The pro-supplement camp, however, says that the produce that is available today is being grown in soil that is increasingly depleted due to over-cultivation and lack of proper rotation techniques and contains far less vitamins and nutrients than it did back in the old days. They claim that you would have to eat way too much food and consume far too many calories to meet your nutrient requirements. I tend to agree and would suggest a good multi-vitamin to most people.



You should seek a vitamin without iron, however, because the ferrous sulfate they use as an iron supplement is difficult to assimilate in the body (especially when taken at the same time as calcium) and adequate iron can be consumed through small portions of lean red meat and green leafy vegetables.



When it comes to all the supplements for weight lifters, there is just as much debate. While some of these supplements have been proven to improve gains slightly, I am not sure the benefits outweigh the costs for most of these types of supplements. Other than maybe taking an amino-acid supplement post workout (a good whey protein shake will have all the amino-acids you need for proper recovery), I would suggest saving your hard earned money for more important things.



What about caffeine? Studies have shown an increase in performance and endurance when taking a caffeine supplement (cola, coffee, green tea or “energy drinks”) before a cardio workout. Another touted “benefit” of caffeine is that it boosts the metabolism. Since your program does not include a cardio workout and you do not want to increase your metabolism (you are burning calories too quickly already), I would strongly advise avoiding caffeine altogether.

Whey protein is quickly metabolised therefore best taken before a workout. Soy protein is slowly metablised so its best to use a protein that contains both. Fat does not turn into muscle. You need to build muscle in turn to burn body fat. My bf uses herbalife protein shake drink daily and only goes to the gym twice a wk maximum. He says it helps him keep the muscle he has built over the yrs even if he misses a week or so at the gym. I get it from www.naturalw8loss4u.info for him.

i got weighed at home the other day, and OUR scales have me as 13st 5lb, and i've been to the gym since then, so i can't have gained THAT much weight in the space of a couple of days.



i don't eat much as it is, and what i do eat, is generally really healthy and good for me.



i checked again today with our scales, and again, according to them i am 13st 5lb.

Odds are, neither one is really right.  Unless they have been calibrated recently, most scales are off by a few pounds.  Home scales are notorious for being inaccurate.  The trick is to find one that is reliably inaccurate.  If one gives you the same weight day after day, or shows a weight gain or loss that is consistent with your exercise and eating habits, use that one to track your weight.



One other thing to consider - always weigh yourself when you're wearing the same type of clothes.  Either wear the same shoes, shirt, pants, etc, or weigh yourself only in your underwear, or something so that you don't have to try to fudge the figure to account for what you're wearing that day.

The only scales you can really trust in my opinion are the doctor's type (with sliding weights).



But don't get hung up on body weight - it doesn't matter as much as body compostion i.e: bodyfat %.



I find it's best just to weigh at one place consistently (bathroom scales, once a week) and ignore any other scales as they vary so much.

Well, of coarse we'd all go for the tummy tuck but be smart about it. If, you can afford it and you don't have a bunch of medical problems, then set the date for 3 mos from whenever and start exercising, that way you prepare your body and mind for the post surgery. Get it? You'll be sore but when you heal your gonna want to show your stuff, so if try to start exercising (when you really never have) your gonna give up quicker. If you already had a routine you will keep your shape. My cousin was not really a big girl, size 9/11 after 3 kids. Got lipo and then later a tuck/ tighten. But because she didn't maintain an exercise routine she gained a lot of fat back within a year.

How can I avoid saggy skin after I loose weight?



I weigh 360lbs. Most of it is in my THIGHS and abdomen. I'm a male. I'm 5'7" and I'm 18 years old. I've decided it's about time to do something about this weight because I always weighed like 320lbs and thne somehow over the summer i jumped to 360 so it's time to get serious. I'm just wondering how am I going to avoid having saggy skin?



My mom tells me not to worry about it because I'm young and my skin will snap back. But I've never heard of a young person with over 200lbs to loose who's skin snapped back? Please help me with this. I mean i'll much rather stay over weight with good skin than to be skinny with saggy skin. That may sound shallow, but that's just how i feel.

Take your time in losing the fat, dont try and lose all that weight too quickly or then you will have loose skin. Also take up weight training and try and build as much muscle as you can while doing your cardio. Eat all the healthy foods that are good for the skin and have vitamins which the skin needs. Drink LOADS of water as this will help you to keep your skin hydrated and will also help you lose the fat.

There is no possible way to know. There are CALORIE burn calculators, but even they are dependent upon your current weight, height, gender, etc, not to mention the speed at which you jog, incline, etc.



As iffy as it is to try to determine calories burned it is impossible, to separate out grams of fat burned.

you need to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound of fat..  so assuming you burn around 500 calories for a 45 minute jog, that would be like 1/7th of a pound..  so 7 45 minute jogs would be 1 pound..

Why am I always so hungry?



I am not super skinny, or fat, just normal I have a flat tummy.  But I am always hungry, and I mean always.  I am always thinking about food, even when I am really busy all I will think about is what I am going to eat when I am done with whatever is I am doing.  I eat all the time, my boyfriend has called me a fat kid in disguise because I eat so much, I eat more than he does and I feel fat when I do but I'm always starving.  I try and eat healthy and do for the most part, but there are always something I eat that isn't the healthiest. Why am I always so extremely hungry?



</question>



<additional details>



My exercise is walking to and from class, and around campus.



I usually have 1 or 2 bowls of cereal- not sugary kind with skim milk or today I had two pieces of toast with peanut butter



For lunch I had a turkey and cheese sandwich, an apple, a bowl full of grapes, and a few handfuls of pretzels



I then had a snack, some celery and hummus and some goldfish



Then for dinner tonight we had pizza- I know its not the healthiest per se but it had green peppers and ham- but I had 4 or 5 pieces, plus a salad with vingarette dressing.



I have then had ice cream since then.



I'm sorry if I sound stupid or something but what do you mean worm yourself?  I have never been checked for worms to my knowledge.

Your probably not eating the right foods.



You need to be eating a lot of protein, drinking 8 glasses of water a day and have a larger meal for breakfast. If you eat junk food & soft drinks that only makes you want more food. It keeps you full for a bit but then your hungry again and you want more junk food.



Exercising can also decrease appetite.

How do i get the camel hump on my bicep?



hey all, i been working out for about 2 weeks now, havent started taking whey protein yet, but i will this comming week.
i have been focusing on my biceps, as i would like nice big arms, but whenever i tense, my muscle mainly shows towards the back of the bicep area....if you get me... like some people have the camel hump, which is the big lump directly in the center of the bicep, i want that. does it have something to do with growth or puberty? im 15 and 5'5

thanks in advance

and ure 15, you dont need to work out, if you work out at such a young age ure muscles will deteriorate quciker as you grow older. also the moment you stop working out your muscle will become fat, and i can garuentee at 15 you wont continue working out all year round.

Your rate of development will have something to do with being able to produce the look you want.  As far as the "hump", along with the normal bicep exercises try adding the two following movements:

1.  Zottman Curl
This is a normal bicep dumbell curl in the positive direction.  At the top of the curl, turn your palms 180 degrees and finish the negative portion of the curl.

2.  Modification to the Dumbell Curl and Hammer Curls
At the top of the motion (end of the positive motion), add a twisting motion that turns your palms outward.  This will only result in about 45 degrees of twist as you get to the top of the motion but will help in the results you are looking for.

As far as the whey protein, this will not help you build muscle unless you are having problems getting your required protein intake.  It will come in useful postworkout though as you will need both fast burning protein and fast burning carbs as soon as you finish your last rep - at minimum within one hour of your workout.

Good luck!!

it takes a long time for you to see a difference when i started weight lifting friends would go with me but then eventually drop out as they saw no difference. You have to be patient. Just understand and respect that your getting stronger and strength is impressive for the girls to you know. It will takes around 3 to 4 months to see a good enough difference but if you wanna get big 4 times a week training for two year and your sorted.

You don't say what age you are. If you are in your early teens this is extreme, if you are older then it's probably ok, just make sure you are eating enough to keep your strength up. Plenty of red meat, fish and fruit. these food groups contain all the carbs vitamins and nutrients you need. Good luck and I hope you see the results you desire soon.

This is a very good start but it is not all about exercise. Up your protein intake by having a protein shakeor bar 20-30 minutes after your work out but make sure it is lowin saturated fat. Also up your daily protein intake. Apparently body builders eat double their weight in protein to get desired effects. Good luck.

If u run in ur room u would nt have an air conditioning on. Its better yet if u board up ur windows also.

The thing is that the room get closed up of air intake and it becomes hot and u will sweat alot. so an half an run would exhaust u more.

Secondly if u run from wall to wall u have to turn back and in this turning back u stretch ur muscles. This strenthens them and u increase ur potential at sports

It's impossible to lose that much weight in 3 weeks, unless you don't eat a single thing and drink only water, and even at that i'd guess it'd be about 2 or 3 stone. It's silly to starve yourself, because you'll end up putting the weight back on when you're finished, the best thing to do is to eat healthily and exercise regularly and in time you will lose weight.

4 stone would require some difficult choices. You would have to chose not one but the two limbs you would miss least and have them removed. Sustained weight loss is usually in the order of 1 to 1  1/2 lbs a week!

The problem with your question is that if you look in "search for questions" it comes up 30 times every day. I have had some criticism for repeatedly using the same answer, but since I am happy with my answer, and the questions are the same, I don't see the issue with recycling the same answer.

In practise for problems that came up on a regular basis we tended to use patient leaflets to avoid having to repeat ourselves this seemed a sensible use of resources. What follows is thus in effect me information leaflet.

Weight loss and fitness is always a long term commitment and never a quick fix. If you really want to reduce your weight a bit, this is a complex regime, that should help, I would get a pencil to write it down, in case you forget any of the intricate details.

Currently only using the criteria 'lose weight' there are 9,419 questions and answers on Answers already. Mis-spell it as 'loose weight' and you get another 2,633! 'Weight loss' will add another 1,883. 'Too fat ' 15,515 and 'overweight' 2,692 and 'over weight' 26,269!!!!!.

'Diet Pills' gives 607, Green tea 482, Hoodia 195, 'pink patch' 119, 'Xenical' 91 'Reductil' 78, 'Slim fast' 215 (and Slimfast 69 ), lipotrim 44 and 'orlistat' 40 . Do you spot a pattern here? OMG that is 60,000 questions with the same basic theme, wanting to lose weight!

Here comes the only answer, no tricks, no pills, no short cuts, If you really want to lose weight, loose weight, not be too fat or overweight, follow these instructions carefully:-

1) Eat less
2) Take regular vigorous exercise

Repeat 1 + 2 forever

If you are up to it, I suggest buying a video called Butt and Thighs in the Windsor pilates series.



It worked wonders on me! Just do it 5 times a week and within about 10 days you will notice a major difference. But, you do have to pair it with a healthy diet plan.



But, if you are not willing to buy it, you could do 3 sets, 10 reps of squates. 3 sets, 10 reps of plies. (Feet set about 3 feet apart, toes pointing out, and dip like you would if you were doing squates.)  Also, do some lunges, those are good for toning not only your butt and outer thighs, the also target your inner thighs which is something ALL women need to work at.



I hope this was somewhat helpful.

Good luck!

Try doing more exercises like sit-ups, sit-ups help your stomach muscles and back, and if your girlfriends really like you they won't care if you're fat. Don't try any diets as it doesn't work.

And also lol 3 girlfriends, you shouldn't really have THAT much, one is enough imo, and what if they find out, you'll have no gfs left.

Let me tell you what worked for me,.You should lift weights three times a week about 30 minutes a day, and remember to take no longer than 30 second breaks inbetween reps. This way your body releases lactaid into your bloodstream,which pulverizes fat all over your body. Eat small meals, incorporate lean proteins such as fish and chicken, drink lots of water, then drink green tea right before bed. But what really did it for me was this great new system, the link is below.

Please i need help!!!! UPPER BODY



hello at the moment i have a multigym and i use it every day......and a lot a day.....

i am trying to build my upper body so i am doing a lot of bench presses.....high weights with low reps......is this right...

i am also doing triceps pull downs and lat pull downs.....at nights i do 200 crunches and around 150 push ups.......

am i doing the right things to build my upper body......mainly pecs...



finally how long will it take to see a difference in my upper body....i can already lift a heavier weights but i cant see a visual difference

all suggestions are welcome



</question>

<answer>



...Your training program is retarded. First of all, you shouldn't be working out more than once a day if you want to build mass. You should have short workouts between 45 minutes and an hour. It should be get in...lift...get out while conserving as many calories as you can. Also, its pointless to do the same workout two days in a row. Your muscles need several days to recover. I work one muscle group per day... about 3 - 4 exercises... with no more than 11 heavy sets per day. I take saturday and sunday off to rest.



Plus...pushups are not going to do anything for mass. They might tone you up a bit but theyre not going to build muscle. I would save the calories and not do them unless you do a few good ones as a warm before your workout.

You  should be lifting heavy enough that you can only do 6 reps at the most per set.



Eat lots of calories and lots of protein.

Why don't you just save your money and diet yourself.



Its not rocket science.

Eat less calories.
Eat less sugar.
Eat plenty of protein.
Avoid saturated and trans fat.
Poly and Mono unsaturated are fine.
Eat 5 small meals per day instead of 3 big ones.

Drink 8 glasses of water.

There you go... a diet.

To be honest, I think it's a load of nonsense. It's just another weight-loss gimmick for people to waste money on. I think you should just rely on your own common sense when preparing your meals. Eat healthy, balanced meals and just watch your portions.

Not enough protein here AT ALL... as well, too much in the way of simple carbs.  Here's my feedback:

Breakfast - Nesquik is garbage - that has to go.  Too much bread, that's 600 calories in bread alone for breakfast.  Switch to a fibre/whole grain cereal with your milk.  Drop the honey and eat a banana instead.

Lunch - Vegetable soup is good if the sodium is low.  Spaghetti with seafood can make or break you.  If you have creamy sauces and white pasta, the heathiness will be sacrificed.  Keep the soup, and switch the pasta to a salad with a lean protein or a stirfry.  A brown rice dish works really well for lunch as well.  Another easy solution is to eat burgers with the lettuce as the bun.

Dinner - I don't really see any substance food here... just sort of random stuff thrown together.  Again, toast is unneeded.  Carrots aren't the best choice of vegetable.  Grape juice not needed.  Make a stirfry or salad (depending on which one you had for lunch) with a different type of protein from lunch, some fresh veggies, and a healthy sauce.

Breakfast: Yogurt.

Snacks: Fruit.

With this you will lose the weight quickly but heathily.

Only drink water and run for 30 minutes a day.
These might help aswell, there really good search them on youtube as yahoo won't let me post them :

Yes actually you can, but not by eating or sporting. The only thing that would work is to "have your knees done" by elective surgery to increase your height and its not that expensive as you might think! There's a website called "Make Me Taller" check it out!

Nothing is happening because nothing works!
I don't know how many times I've answered this question now, but seriously, no sports work, stretching or hanging off trees, drinking milk - nothing.
You might grow naturally with a few more years of age but that is purely because of your DNA, which you cannot change.
You can't stimulate the growth of your bone structure to increase height, it's impossible, how would it work? 
The only thing you can do is improve health and density of your bones.

Your maximum height potential is determined at the moment of conception by your genetics, I am afraid though toxins, infections accidents and malnutrition can reduce it, nothing can increase it.

Stretching before and after each workout helps to prevent soreness and become more flexible.  However, aggressive stretching can actually HURT the muscle.  So no, it doesn't develop the muscle.

In what way? Stretching is stretching! Its not going to lead to increased muslce mass like weight lifting does. Its generally good for flexibility and suppleness, as well as stress relief. Tension headaches are caused by tight, tense muslce, stretching can releive the knots and tension and relax the mucles.

You need more speed less weights, in other words weights will NOT make you lose weight in fact they can add it, you need fast and cardio, bike or treadmill or anything that lifts your pulse/ heart rate. Look at The Worlds Strongest Man, strong as an Ox but as heavy as a double decker.
 Five pounds of muscle will weigh the same as five pounds of fat but the fat will take take up more space, so if you are carrying 150 lbs of fat you would be a lot bigger than if you were carrying 150 lbs of muscle.

its very hard to build lean muscle and burn fat at the same time. a lot of bodybuilders and dieteers will go through a loading season (usually fall, winter) where they focus just on eating a lot and gaining strength and muscle mass and not really worrying about fat. then when spring rolls along, they start doing more cardio which will shed that fat, and they will have that muscle. when you do cardio, it burns fat, and unfortunately muscle. get it?

Muscle and Fat weigh exactly the same. One kilo of muscle weighs exactly the same as one kilo of fat. Think about it, a kilo of anything wieghs exactly a kilo.



Fat does have more mass than muscle. That is why a kilo of fat is larger than a kilo of muscle. It is like comparing a pillow weighing one kilo to a rock weighing one kilo. The pillow if fluffy and much larger than a rock of equal weight.

Weight training usually will make you loose inches off of your belly, butt and legs, but not make you loose weight. 
You will weigh approximately the same, but develop a better physical shape and become stronger.

It takes 90 days of weight training to get into shape. It won't happen over night so don't become discouraged.

Hmm, you can still do it, it will help get you in shape BUT just because the Olympics are on and you have decided that's what you want to do now, you probably have a lot of catching up to do--Those gurls have been doing gymnastics since they were in diapers.

With persistance, you can do anything you want.
Your weight is not permanent!
You might have a lot of trouble doing something if you are holding excess fat -as opposed to someone who was skinner but you can do anything you set your mind too. If you want to do gymnastics that badly, training and changing your diet will help you reach your goal!

It's determined by genetics, but generaly if you get your body fat percentage to around 10% or lower then a six pack should show. In my opinion Crunches really are the best way to get results if you use good form on them. The main part of a six pack is having a low body fat.You just need to make sure you don't eat things with alot of fat or sugar to loose the weight.

Taking pills will not boost your metabolism.  HOWEVER I would recommend Lipo 6 30 minutes before your workouts.  it is nothing more than caffeine however you will increase you intensity of the workout and thus increase your metabolism indirectly

Eating breakfast and working out in the morning are the 2 best ways to accelerate your metablosim.  Also eat small snacks 5-6 times a day with healthy snacks like yogurt, low fat string cheese, almonds, and fruit.

Well its more than just an exercise (and a ab lounge which is a waste of money) to get a 6 pack...

Eat right.
This means no Taco Bell, Wendy's, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, or fried things.
Do eat the good stuff, obviously, fruits, veggies. Chicken, Lean beef (or for a better alternative turkey meat. Tastes just like beef. Turkey burgers, Turkey meat sauce spaghetti, etc..)

Drink Right.
This means no soda, juices, beer. Don't waste calories on liquids.
Do drink the good stuff, water... period. For a little vest throw in a lemon. And if you must get drunk, drink liquor, less calories. Try to stick with clear liquor. The darker the color the more byproducts that are produced.

Stay active.
Tennis is good. Play some basketball, workout, swim, swim, swim, run, go dancing.
http://www.caloriecontrol.org/exercalc.h... &lt;-- A fun website that calculates colories burned in lots and lots of activities.

http://www.customizedworkouts.com BUT for your exercise go to this website... They have a ton of ab routines. It's free to sign up and you can download your workouts to your ipod and it'll play video and instruct on how to do the exercise.

good luck

Good luck

10 double crunches
10 left leg crunch toward you and extend
10 right leg crunch toward you and extend
10 left leg straight up and down
10 right leg straight up and down

Do those everyday for about a month and you will have strong abs
Don't forget to stretch before and after you work out and drink plenty of water not only during exercising but also the day before to make sure that you are good and hydrated.

How long a day should I jog in order for it to be effective in my weight loss plan?



I have decided to eat fruits and veggies as a main diet..and I'm not yet sure what sort of meats to eat yet.



However how many minutes should I jog for it to work for me, given my diet plan?  I am 158lbs, 5'9.  I'm not sure how much I'm looking to lose yet but definitly a bit, given my body type.

To be honest with you, it would actually be more affective to take it to the track and give 100% for as long as you can. Maybe 100 meter sprints as hard as you can.

Doing this will cause you to burn out more calories rather than to jog slow for a long time.



Also, make sure you are eating a good breakfast to speed up your metabolism.

You haven't given us a diet plan.  A diet plan would include a calorie count.



You can lose weight without exercise because in the end, weight loss is about using more calories than you eat.  Eating less than you need, forcing the body to use fat.

But exercise IS a great thing to do while you are dieting, forcing the body to lose fat not bone or muscle too.  A good cardio exercise should get your heart rate elevated for at least 20 to 30 minutes.  And you should include some strength training several times a week.  I like to alternate so that I'm not doing the same exercise two days in a row.  Your body needs some down time, some rest time in there somewhere.  Don't run every day.  Spend 20 or 30 minutes doing some mat-core muscle exercises or some other form of strength exercises using bands, free weights, home gyms, etc.

Did you know your body loses more calories when it's resting than during the exercise time of your day?  Most of your calories will be lost when you are sleeping, sitting, etc.  So do those strength training, weights, bands, core exercise types of things so you can build your muscle mass and burn more calories when your body is at rest.

By the way, every day you should be getting at least TWO dairy.  Say 1% milk or low fat yogurt.  Also you should get some starch.  Whole grain breads, cooked cereal, whole grain pasta.  And you need healthy fat...something like smart balance on your bread, Olive Oil, fish oil pills.  Your Protein should be lean such as low fat cottage cheese for breakfast.  Skinless turkey, chicken, lean pork, fish, etc. And if you are going to diet take some multi vitamins so you don't deprive yourself of nutrition.  Salad?  Use dark greens.  Lots to learn, I suggest you read up on eating healthy and avoid diets that try to cut out carbs, protein, etc.



Eat your dairy, Starch, Fruit, Vegetable, Protein, and healthy fats and multi-vitamins.  Don't fall for a fad diet.

if you dont eat breakfast your body thinks that it is not getting any food that day and so starts to use your body fats. I would assume that continues during the morning and therefore you are not hungry during that proccess?

Its your metabolism. When you don't eat in the morning your metabolism puts you into a minor starvation mode and slows way down thus you won't be hungry for longer. When you do eat in the morning it speeds your metabolism up to where it burns fats much quicker, so you will naturally be hungry quicker. thats why they say to eat 4 or 5 small meals throughout they day. It speeds up your metabolism and makes u much healthier.

when there's food in your stomach, it produces stomach acids to break the food down. When your breakfast (usually small, even worse if it's cereal) has been broken down, you have all this stomach acid that you normally wouldn't have. this is what make you feel peckish, as opposed to feeling properly starving.. ie it's your stomach that feels hungry not your brain.

..and i say cereal is worse because milk is alkaline and so takes even more acid to break down

It s very important to eat breakfast in the morning as a source of energy for the whole day if u skip it later on you will get tired and start felling sick from hunger it makes u hungry because it opens up your apetite in the morning but if u dont it closes it down and expects no food as if u have already had some

Why would you want to work out for 5 hours? unless if its because you are practicing for some sort of activity (eg: sports meet, marathon, the olympics) Anyways, if you lose an average of 300calories per hour, that would mean that you can lose up to 1500 for the five hours of exercise.



If your body needs at least 1600calories a day to work (this is excluding ANY sort of activity, only bodily/organ functions) then you can eat about 3100calories a day without GAINING or LOSING weight. It will be the same.



If you want to lose the weight, cut back on 500 calories if possible.



The point it, dont eat too much if you want to lose weight.

k, i don't wanna tell you to starve yourself, it seems wrong, especially since you said yourself you're tiny already. it seems to me you're doing alot of leg excercise in attempts to lose leg muscle, maybe just try being lazy :) do your sit ups, and everything else, just don't do leg excercises and stick with that for aobut 8 weeks, see how it works, if it doesn't THEN maybe think about starving yourself, or better yet go to a gym and ask a personal trainer for their advice. please try to avoid starving yourself though, it's really hard on the body.

You will lose the muscle fine, cos you will be dead in a casket due to heart failure or some other organ damage caused by starvation.

What you should do is stop wearing heals for a month. reduce the size of the muscle.  massage your legs and go to the gym and ask the trainer how to develop the other muscles to balance it out.

a. you'll lose fat first. Fat is literally stored on your body to be there as sustenance when you are starving. after you use up all your fat then your muscles and organs will deteriorate. at that point you will need to be hospitalized because you will be dying.

b.if you exercise you will actually build muscle and lose fat.



c. the only way for muscles to get smaller is to just not use them..

When you starve yourself you lose fat first. Then muscle.
Also you don't get a choice where the fat or muscle is lost.

No, it won't work sorry. You're genetically predisposed for larger legs. 
You need to work with that in the style of clothes and length of skirts you wear. Contact an image consultant.

It sounds like you have a problem ,what ever you do dont starve yourself  your brain will tell your body to store any calorific products in your body ,this means that any fats  will be stored as long as possible to survive any attack upon it .when your body goes into this mode it slows down the fats and water are the first things to go your body will then prioritise which systems close down in order for you to survive you wont be able to pee so a build up of toxins causes you to have a renal failure kidneys and liver .
so with this thought dont do it eat small meals at more regular times

muscle is usually grown and shows strength, if you want less muscle you should stop doing leg exercises..



not eating is a dumb idea and your body isn't going to go "oh now theres no food so i better get rid of that little bit of muscle on the leg"  sorry doesn't work like that. anyone that goes on diets like that will tell you the weight comes right back

plus alot of people think a runners legs or an athletes legs are attractive.



muscular arms makes a chick look like a body builder, not legs..  legs are hot

First thing I would do is ask a few men if they like your legs, you may be surprised and want to keep them.

Which part of the leg pops out? 
Its probably just how you were made and not a lot to do about it.

If you starve you will loose fat first before muscle, the first muscles to go will be the upper body then torso then lower body.

Starving is not good, you get unhealthy, sick and tired. Everyone should eat a healthy balanced diet and that consists of protein from white meat and fish and soya, healthy carbs from colourful veg and multigrains and drink 2 litres water.

You mention Depression, I know you may be thinking that the depression comes from you being unhappy with your leg, I think if you can realise that the depression may have come first.
I would think about things that may have been bothering you or stuff that may have happened in your life before you started to think about the muscles in your leg. 
I believe that if you sort some other issues out in your life and circumstances then you will not even be thinking about your legs or may change your mind and think they are great!

If you relly think you are depressed, don't start changing your body, go and see your doctor, they can help.

Take Care.

Starving isn't a good solution for anything. I'm "afraid" that there's no solution, just changing your shoes or change your mind. If you starve yourself, you'll loose fat and tonicity, and you won't look good. 
If you stop eating, you'll feel really bad plus a lot of consequences (dry skin, loss of hair, teeth pain, etc.)

Take it easy. Nobody likes their own body.

The problem with your question is that if you look in "search for questions" it comes up 30 times every day. I have had some criticism for repeatedly using the same answer, but since I am happy with my answer, and the questions are the same, I don't see the issue with recycling the same answer.

In practise for problems that came up on a regular basis we tended to use patient leaflets to avoid having to repeat ourselves this seemed a sensible use of resources. What follows is thus in effect me information leaflet.

Weight loss and fitness is always a long term commitment and never a quick fix. If you really want to reduce your weight a bit, this is a complex regime, that should help, I would get a pencil to write it down, in case you forget any of the intricate details.

Currently only using the criteria 'lose weight' there are 9,419 questions and answers on Answers already. Mis-spell it as 'loose weight' and you get another 2,633! 'Weight loss' will add another 1,883. 'Too fat ' 15,515 and 'overweight' 2,692 and 'over weight' 26,269!!!!!.

I highly suggest the 6 Week Body Makeover, it is a life changing experience. My husband and I started it at the end of June my husband has lost 22lbs and I have lost 15lbs. It has a great support team, plus you get support on-line in forums and in chat-rooms. I have learned so much since I have started the 6WBMO. I also thought well I have 30 days to return it so I'll try it. There is no way I would return this program, I knew that after the first week when I started seeing results. My husband has not been this low in weight in over 8 years. We tried other diets, we exercised, nothing was working.
This does!!

If i was you i would find a bmi calculator on the internet. just type bmi calculator into google and ti should come up 
They give you a rough idea of how overweight you are.
However the aren't exact as it varies from person to person for instance your large frame and tall build will mean that you carry a little more weight than most people.
tip
the best way to lose weight is a balanced and healthy diet fresh fruit and no snacks 
and when you go to the gym run for about 20 minutes and then walk for 40 minutes. Walking burns more calories than running, (it's to do with your optimum heart rate) and the tone up with small weights

If you have a small frame then around 140. For a medium frame 150 and for a large frame around 160. That is the weight that you should be if you want a healthy bmi. If you are more muscular than you should weigh more though. It would help if you can say how much you weigh right now, if you do then we would be able to help more. Also, what type of frame do you have?
Hope that helped!!!! :D

I am afraid you are not going to lose weight without going to any personal effort. Hypnotherapy specifically, comes out no better for weight loss than it does as an aid to smoking cessation, scoring no better than placebo. I am afraid with a hopeless attitude like that to weight loss, you are just going to join the desperately doomed!

that's actually pretty obese, especially at your age. to be an adult at 5'2 and 232 pounds would be bad, but considering you are 11 you really do need to look into losing some weight. it could cause some serious problems when you get older.

i wouldn't eat so many calories in the morning either... maybe one bowl from now on?

You should exercise for an hour each day, intensively. And don't just take my advice: GO AND SEE A DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. This is grossly overweight and could create health problems for the rest of your life.

Please see someone about this. I am 5'8" and 174 pounds, and I am overweight a little. I'm not intending to be offensive, but that kind of weight is ridiculous for someone your age. Please see a health-care professional.

heres what i think..
 u might not actually be "fat"
r u athletic?
r u muscular?
cause muscle cells can weigh twice or three times as much as fat cells...
so it could just be a lot of muscles...
but 232 pounds for a 5'2 11 year old girl is still alot...
im pretty sure u meant 132 because idk how its possible to be 232 at 5'2 when ur only 11....
but excersizing only 20 minutes each WEEK is not enough
u should try to excersize atleast 30 minutes to 1 hour EVERY DAY...and thats not only because your overweight...thats what an average person should do to stay healthy..
good luck and i hope i helped! 
:D

Cut back on the fast food and the sandwich 3-4 times a day. It's okay to have a sandwich a day but not that much. Replace it with something healthier.

They recommend 30 min exercise each day. And that does not include normal daily activity.

I am not going to say anything mean. Because I don't like it when I hear it........

Check with you doctor before starting any diet and exercise. ( if you choose )



In one of your answers you say you do track and dance. Im confused... How are you doing those at 20 min a week. If you do do those you shouldn't weigh that. Maybe you are one of many that have trouble losing weight.

ok you know what, you make it sound like your the only one, i have the same problem, i'm also 13 and i'm over weight. Listen, dont beat yourself down about it, in your picture you look soo pretty, i'm not even kidding. Also, you tried to be anorexic- okay that wont work. I have friends that are anorexic and they are friggin ugly- i hope they dont read this lol. any way, losing weight is not that hard. I went down from being 146 to 139 in loke one week. I didnt starve my self, i just began to watch what i ate. and the truth is EVERYTHING that you eat will end up in the same place. wheather its chocolate or veggetables it will all end up in the toilet. i'm not trying to gross you out, but why not just take the healthier choice. and there is nothing worng with eating some sweats once in while. substitute chips for carrot stick without dressing. carrots tast great. stay away from salty foods- nuts are very fatty, just take them out of your diet. and this is what helped me to lose weight, count your calories. tell your self you wont eat more than like 1500 calories a day, and i know exersicing sux, but maybe you can do somethin you like. i love dancing so i close my room, put on the radio and start dancing like crazy. This relly helps you lose weight. And a lot of people have cellulite, i have it dont worry about it, okay. and strech marks dont always mean that your fat. DOnt look down at your self. DONT ever call your self fat- that will bring you self-esteem down and make it even harder to lose weight!
GOOD LUCK!

You dont have to be skinny to be beautiful
And dont worry so much about your appearance.. its what's inside that counts.
And size does not matter at all.... people should never judge others by appearances. If they do, they have their own insecurities they are trying to hide.

Don't go anorexic and don't say horrible things about yourself because people will like you for who you are. you don't really want to go stick thin like those size 0 models. it really is not pleasant. you will come to an age where your metabolism is very fast and you will shed weight. i'm 16 and I'm trying to gain weight because I'm so skinny!you should be happy as you are. don't let anyone tell you otherwise!

13 is very young to be worrying about guys liking you and having cellulite.  What you need is a good healthy diet and an exercise regime.  The best thing you can do is go to a personal trainer, dietitian or doctor who can write you a good diet and tell you what exercise would be best to help you lose weight.  Just not eating doesn't work because you just get ill and have to eat again and that makes the weight come piling back on.  It's a good idea to eat load and loads of vegetables because they are low in calories and high in nutritional value.  Running is probably the best exercise you can do to lose weight.  If you ran for 30 minutes a day everyday you'd notice a big change in a couple of months.
It's best to get advice from some sort of fitness professional to get the most out of your diet and exercise.

If your BMI is between 30 and 39.9 you're obese. This means you're well over the ideal weight for your height. This could cause serious health problems and affect your life expectancy.



Are you eating more than the recommended amount of calories per day? Are you getting enough exercise? Once you gain the confidence to start exercising regularly you'll notice a huge difference.

Speak with your GP for advice if you've tried to lose weight without success. 
As part of a healthy well-balanced diet, cut down on salt and alcohol. Try to eat more fresh fruit and vegetables. Also, eat smaller portions at mealtimes and avoid snacking between meals.



This is no reason for you to try and starve yourself as it could affect your health worse.
Also try and eat more soup and drink plenty of water, as this bloats the stomach, making you feel more full and less hungry,

Good luck, and a guy will like you for who you are, not what you look like :o)

you should walk a lot and drink lots of water, stay away from bad food like junk and stuff and don't just sit around all day,standing burns a lot of calories.

You are gorgeous girly!
You're first biggest mistake is not loving yourself and putting yourself down! That is NOT ok!

You're second mistake is NOT EATING! I've tried that and throwing up in my younger days when trying to lose a lot of weight. I lost at most 25 lbs in one month, but then gained it all back the next month plus 15 lbs!

Eating disorders are not healthy and will not help you out in the end, only do your body more harm.

You should try Weight Watchers if that's available to you, they have an awesome program that has helped thousands of people!

Being 13 if that's not an option, just try all things in moderation. Don't deprive yourself of things you love on a 'strict' diet that eventually will just make you quit and then over eat on all the things you've been missing. Portions is huge, eat normal but eat less and more often. And, get active! You don't have to have an expensive gym membership to get in shape! You can go for walks around your neighborhood, dance around your bedroom, use water filled milk jugs as weights to build muscle. You should do at least 30 min of cardio 3 times a week! And drink WATER lots and lots of WATER! Also, a multi-vitamin everyday would be good while trying to lose weight.

You can do it! :)

Good luck!
Muah!

Relax, take it easy........and please stop doing that aneorexic buisness bacause that can be bad for you and it is certainly not help, as i will explain...

I have recently lost one stone, and it has taken about a month....this may seem long but trust me, losing weight is not a five minute thing......but the news gets better.....

You dont have to slave away at a bike or going running hours on end to lose weight, although that is one way of doing it...... all i have done is start cutting down on what i was eatting, big time, chocolate in moderation, cakes biscuits etc are watched carefully.

Another thing I did was to have a bit more get up and go about me......I live in south wales which has many mountains,,,,, i now see each one as a challenge or obsticle in my way to a new healthier me....get out, even if it is for a brisk walk it is burning carlories......

The third and final thing that I have changed is that I started drinking tea....green tea.......it is known for its weight loss properties and it is in nearly every weight loss product about....it may not taste very nice but it will help you lose weight even quicker...it is also very cheap.

The next step to take, if you doubt yourself......is a will power test....go to asda and buy some ready hot cooked chicken from the hot counter... take it home and remove every bit of chicken from the bone without eatting it.....not a single bit!



This is very difficult but if you complete the test successfully you have proved to yourself that you have to power, you have the key to success.

One last point.....dont starve yourself.....you body will react to being starved by storing even more fat to keep as energy reserves.....and dont give into weight loss products...they can be very bad for you and can have strange side effects.....



Remember......you have the power......you have the key to success...dont give in......have patience.........

Good luck,

Matt.

Being anorexic is not going to help you, it can kill you. :( You have to have more confidence in yourself. You are not fat and you are not ugly. I used to think about myself like that too for a while, it just made things worse. If you really think you are fat than talk to your parents about it and maybe they can put you on a diet. You are only thirteen, you will lose weight as you age too. And remember, personality counts not looks. I hope that helps. :)

How many kms do I need to run to lose 5kg?



I'm 16 and I weigh around 63kg and I need to lose around 5kg because lately I've put on weight really quickly and I need to lose it again. I've never been on a diet before and I don't plan to but I was hoping someone could tell me how much exercise I need to do to lose the weight again.
I would also like to know how many calories I need to burn to lose that much weight and roughly how many kms I need to run. I'm hoping to lose it in about 3 weeks to a month..
Answers much appreciated

hello. losing weight and how many kilometres you run, arent linked... you cant run a certain amount of kms to lose a certain amount of weight... also, understand that a "diet" doesnt mean you eat less... it means you eat less JUNK!

to lose weight = exercise to burn more calories than the amount you eat...

this doesnt mean you eat one meal a day and run for hours... it means you eat 5-7 SMALL and HEALTHY meals a day, and do about 45 minutes of walking or jogging in the morning. that should do it.

Take Jogging Morning and evening
distance is not a thing in Calorie  burning
Burn your Calories at least one hour 
You have to Jogg 2 hours every day (Morning& Evening)

If you feel that is difficult take one hour (at least) walk... :)

5kg isn't so bad, you'll be able to do that easily!

I'd run every second day. You can mix it up a bit - 3km one day, 5km the next session.  Add some sprints when you can (short distances).  30 mins to 45 is a good amount of time. On the days you aren't running you could walk, cycle, swim.

Cut out the junk, drink water (not juice and fizzy drink), more fresh fruit and vegetables. You don't have to diet - just eat healthy.

A couple of times a week do some toning exercises to build muscle. There are some ideas here:  http://www.abc-of-fitness.com/info/fitne...

A kilo a week is pretty good going, you might lose it a little faster but try to take your time.

Firstly, you should tell your friend that she shouldn't let herself be unhappy simply because she doesn't have a boyfriend. Boyfriends don't make your life what it is. Like you said, you're only 13. There will be plenty of time to find a guy that will love your friend for her, whether she's overweight or not.
Other than that, I would say she should be outgoing and friendly, and if she becomes friends with some guys she's interested in, they may develop an attraction to her. I've seen many overweight girls with boyfriends, so it's not impossible.

And of course, I'm sure your friend knows this, but she would be better off losing some weight. Not for a guy, but for herself. She'd feel better physically and mentally.

First of all, just FYI, you two are at an age where peers are mean about weight, clothes, everything! I remember people in middle school being horrible to each other. I know that it would be easy for an adult to tell you that you are too young to worry about having a boyfriend, because I remember being a teen and it was important! Boys at that age are sooo shy too and totally afraid of rejection. They aren't going to ask her out if they don't know for sure that she is going to say yes. All of my friends in high school were on a 24/7 diet because we were so worried about boys. If she wants to go on a diet this is a fine age to do it. But guys will pay more attention to her if she is confident and out-going with them over her being a size two. My crush my freshman year of high school picked a "chubby" girl over me (who was anorexic and a size 4) because she was more friendly and confident with him. Tell her to be confident with herself and she will be fine!

a healthy weight to gain weight is by putting on muscle weight. so start lifting a little weights and get yourself some whey protein. i would recommend 100% whey protein ON.. remember eat good good with balanced amount of fats,carbs,protein and workout. after your workouts eat a scoop of protein plus some simple carbs like sugar. good luck!

Energy Balance and Weight Management - Understanding energy balance is the key to losing weight or maintain weight successfully.

Calorie intake &gt; Calorie use ==&gt; Weight Gain

Calorie intake = Calorie use ==&gt; No change in body weight

Calorie intake &lt; Calorie use ==&gt; Weight loss

Losing weight does not mean avoiding food. Instead, eat less food that is high in fat and added sugar. Eat a variety of plant-based food like whole grains, fruit and vegetables. These food provide bulk and promote the feeling of fullness.

Eat regular meals and avoid skipping meals as it may lead to overeating at subsequent meals.

Move more - Exercise

Physical activity is an essential part of any effective weight loss programme. It helps burn calories and builds muscles.

Yes there is a healthy way to gain weight. You should do weight training to gain lean muscle. This method is much slower than gaining fat (which is very unhealthy) and you will also reap the benefits of a hot bod.

Fruit-Bananas especially

Veggies- Broccoli and Spinach

Eat at least two of these items in every meal and you will start to have a healthy gain.  Also, Protein shakes before each workout help.  But, only if your going to work out.

You can switch to larger portions; instead of one piece of toast, have two. Heartier foods also help. Whole grain foods work well for this. General Mills cereal company recently came out with a big line of whole grain versions of their usuals (Lucky Charms, Cheerios, etc). Also, muscle weighs more than fat, and starting an exercise routine can cause water weight. If you have stomach problems or diarrhea, you could be dealing with a bigger problem. Also, if you're young (like 13 years old) you have a lot more growing to do, and most people grow into their figure, sometimes even becoming 'chunky'. There's a link I added to kidshealth, and even if you are over 18, it still has some nice tips. All of their articles are well written, and most by doctors.

I you need to gain weight.  Any way you do it is healthy.  Don't listen to the diet crazed society we live in that claims fat and carbs are bad.  Most Americans are overweight, that's why high cal and fatty foods are "bad for you." To gain weight you just need to up your calorie intake and limit exercise.  You don't need to lift weights unless you want to be a body builder.  As a recovering anorexic I feel your pain.  It's hard to gain weight.  You probably get full too quickly right? Here's some high cal foods you can try.

Drink These
-ensure plus or boost plus
-whole milk
-milkshakes
-fruit juice and nectars
-smoothies

Add these to Drinks
-whey or soy protein powder
-carnation instant breakfast
-nonfat dried milk

Add in these snacks
-ice cream
-fage total (the full fat kind)
-bagels and cream cheese
-muffins
-cake, brownies, cookies
-oatmeal (made with milk and add a couple bananas to it)
-peanut butter banana and honey on a bagel or thick bread
-dried fruit



Add these to foods you already eat
-full fat salad dressings or olive oil
-mayonnaise
-butter
-sour cream
-creamy pasta sauces like Alfredo
-potatoes
-corn
-peas
-avocados
-flax seeds
-any kind of beans
-granola
-cheese (as long as it's not lowfat)
-bologna, salami, and other fatty deli meats
-nuts and peanut butter
-bananas

Hello
First, I understand where you're coming from. My name is Mary and I am posting this because I know what it’s like to be over weight and feel your life spiraling out of control. I was almost 360 pounds, struggling with my health and looking for a way out. Seriously, I would have done almost anything to make a change in my life. And I did, with very little success. Pills, therapy, even working out were getting me nowhere.

No matter what I tried I never really saw a change because I could not stop my love of eating. It’s so hard for people to understand when they haven’t faced this struggle. Everyone just says that you have to will power. But if you are like me, you know there is much more to it.

I realized I was holding my life in my hands and I made the decision to find a way out of my self-inflicted nightmare. After years of struggle and countless nights studying the ins and outs of exercise science I finally stumbled onto a Fat Loss program that caused me to lose 143 pounds and still allowed me to enjoy the foods I love. This is nothing like what you have done before. Fat Loss program changed my life and I could not believe just how easy it was.

I want you to discover the key that turned my life around.

go  wheat  free. No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food after 7
p.m.  People  achieve  marvellous  results  with it. Depending on your initial  weight,  you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If you don't eat  wheat  then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey cakes, you don't  eat  junk  food,  and  you don't eat biscuits. But your diet is still  balanced. It costs nothing, and you do not have to calculate points or
to buy special meals or plans.

Since I started to work out I was looking for a good weight loss product (I only wanted something 100% natural). I was on a diet but I felt that I needed a little "help" so I decided to try this great detoxification colon cleanse and I had fantastic results. You can check their website at 
http://www.diet-happy.us , they give you a free trial and you only pay $4.95 shipping and handling.

The problem with your question is that if you look in "search for questions" it comes up 30 times every day. I have had some criticism for repeatedly using the same answer, but since I am happy with my answer, and the questions are the same, I don't see the issue with recycling the same answer.

In practise for problems that came up on a regular basis we tended to use patient leaflets to avoid having to repeat ourselves this seemed a sensible use of resources. What follows is thus in effect me information leaflet.

Weight loss and fitness is always a long term commitment and never a quick fix. If you really want to reduce your weight a bit, this is a complex regime, that should help, I would get a pencil to write it down, in case you forget any of the intricate details.

Currently only using the criteria 'lose weight' there are 9,151 questions and answers on Answers already. Mis-spell it as 'loose weight' and you get another 2,554! 'Weight loss' will add another 1,839. 'Too fat ' 15,167 and 'overweight' 2,630 and 'over weight' 25,588!!!!!.

'Diet Pills' gives 593, Hoodia 194, 'pink patch' 116, 'Xenical' 89 'Reductil' 75, 'Slim fast' 213 (and Slimfast 69 ), lipotrim 44 and 'orlistat' 39 . Do you spot a pattern here? OMG that is over 38,000 questions with the same basic theme, wanting to lose weight!

Here comes the only answer, no tricks, no pills, no short cuts, If you really want to lose weight, loose weight, not be too fat or overweight, follow these instructions carefully:-

1) Eat less
2) Take regular vigorous exercise



Repeat 1+2 forever

You also need to find a strenuous physical activity that you actually enjoy, it might just be walking.

<question>



How do i get my bf to start making healthier choices?



Ok my bf is 22, at least 140kg (even though he insists he is only 115kg) and 6ft tall. I know he is not 115kg cos i am 96kg at the moment due to being 8 months pregnant and he is much bigger than me! He doesn't have the healthiest diet (hardly eats any fruit or veg)and doesn't do ANY excercise. Even when i go for a short walk he won't come with me because he is too tired.



He has said that he knows he needs to lose weight and he wants too- he just doesnt want to make any changes for this to happen. I've tried making healthier meals but he wont eat the vegies.



I'm out of ideas and running out of energy to keep encouraging him to try.  i'm even getting to the stage where i'm not physically attracted to him anymore.  But more than anything want him to be there later in life for our children.



Any ideas?



</question>



<additional details>



When we first met he was probably 115 kgs but it's obvious that he has put on substancial amount of weight since then- perhaps getting too comfortable with the relationship.



Dont get me wrong i still love him with all my heart and i am worried about him thats the only reason i am wanting him to be healthier.  And i'm not saying i'm perfect either i know i'm over weight too- but at this stage in my pregnancy i'm doing as much as i can including eating well!

It's all very well for people to say 'dont nag!' but the fact is your bf is quite overweight which means there are health risks involved and you're obviously concerned. Being overweight can lead to high blood pressure, diabetes, and in severe cases it can cause a heart attack.

I understand this must be difficult and awkward for you. My thought is to sit him down and explain this to him. Explain that you absolutely love and adore him, but you're concerned about his health and eating habits, and you hate seeing him unfit because it affects his quality of life and will later affect his ability to be the best father he can be if he continues on the road he's going.

Be supportive of him and encouraging, and write down a list of meals that you (and him- he needs to get involved too. It shouldn't be you doing all the work!) will make every night for dinner. The best advice I can give you is to make eating a planned activity. If all the food is prepared and ready to go he is less likely to go look for snacks. An excellent cookbook is Cook Yourself Thin, which has the yummiest foods such as lasagne, chocolate cake, etc in it except *healthy* versions. I strongly advise you get this book because we used it in my family and no-one could tell the difference, but they were eating 10 times healthier and were sneakily getting serves of fruits and vegies without knowing ;-)

Also make going for walks a time for both of you. Say its important to you that he becomes involved. Even a 20 minute walk per day (if you can manage due to your pregnancy!) If you can do it at 8 months, he can do it at 0 months lol!

Good luck and I hope some of this helps. Just stay positive, lead by example, and encourage him, because weight can be a sensitive issue. Just reassure him you love him, but want to see him healthier so you can lead a long and happy life together.

Thank you for this advice... its helped alot rather than just saying dont nag- bacause honestly i dont nag him at all really & losing weight for myself at this stage in pregnancy is not as easy as it sounds!

Shall I gain the weight if I stop training?



So I have a school holidays and in the previous month, in July I was training everyday in the morning for 30 minutes and in addition to this every evening for 45 minutes. Now I've got no time to stand up early in the morning and get back to the training. I'm eating less than 1600 calories and burning more than 2000 calories. I want to lose 3 kilos in 1 month, so that I didn't harm my health condition. How can I deal with this problem? Shall I gain if I stop training in the morning?

You won't gain if you keep your calories in check. If you're working out less than you used to now, you are going to require fewer calories.

What's the easiest way for a 15 year old boy to loose weight the fastest, prefferably using a bike?



I really am not into sports but I enjoy cycling and rarely enjoy running. What is the easiest and quickest way for a 15 year old male like me to loose weight without buying any exercising machines. The only place I can cycle in are in parks and canal paths. How often would I need to cycle and for how long on the weekend to loose 1 stone? Are there any little exercises I could do regularily during the week too like sit-ups?

Let me tell you what worked for me,.You should lift weights three times a week about 30 minutes a day, and remember to take no longer than 30 second breaks inbetween reps. This way your body releases lactaid into your bloodstream,which pulverizes fat all over your body. Eat small meals, incorporate lean proteins such as fish and chicken, drink lots of water, then drink green tea right before bed. But what really did it for me was this great new system, the link is below.

keep a food diary.  Then cut out the little things that add up.  Also, try better versions of what you eat.  As far as exercises.  switch it up.  one day, ride as far as you can. This will build endurance.  Then the next day, only do a third of that, but do it as fast as you can.  Push-ups and ab crunches suck to do, but they really are the best thing out there.  They are free and don't need equipment.  As far as quick weight loss, the quicker you lose it, the quicker it will come back.  slow and even are the best bet.  Good luck

All the exercise in the world means nothing if you don't eat well.

personally, I prefer to eat something (carbohydrate) very small before working out.  then within an hour of working out, eat something w/ protein.  (chocolate milk is the best)

when you work out is up to you and your schedule.  some people can't work out at night b/c it keeps them awake.  some people can't workout in the morning.  just up to the individual.

your body burn more calories on the long run if you eat something before exercising. half of a banana is great... because after sleeping for 8 hours ( or the amount you get) the body needs to refuel.



once you're hungry your brain doesn't communicate with the rest of your body as it should, making your workout harder and not as effective as you may want it. after you work out, take a shower and have a make yourself a fruit smoothie, without sugar, that should give you a great energy boost through the next couple of hours

make sure you stretch out really well after exercise, and if you are still sore, put some ice on it. I like to stretch out again after i ice my legs as well. Try to keep moving, to keep the blood flowing, that will also help.

Cut down your eating until your stomach actually hurts all day. Then ride an elliptical or run for a good 30 minutes. I'm not kidding about the eating part, if your stomach hurts, it wants food that you normally give it. Bribing  it of food for most of the day will cause your stomach to shrink, thus you eat less without even trying.

When we want to get rid of body fat, there is no way to specifically burn fat from one part of the body. Doing sit ups won't burn the fat that is covering your abs and doing tricep extensions won't get rid of the fat that is covering your triceps. The only thing you can do is lose weight all around and eventually the problem area will also improve. The way to burn fat is through a calorie restricted diet in conjunction with an exercise routine that will burn calories. Activities that burn calories include running, biking, swimming and other high intensity activities.

You need to eat healthy all day long.  Start with breakfast.  Eat several small meals throughout the day to reset your metabolism.  You need to eat from all food groups and eliminate junk food from your diet.
You also need to get moving.  Start a complete exercise program of stretching, strengthening, and cardiovascular exercises.  And if you have trouble staying motivated, a fitness partner can be a great motivator for your lifestyle change.

Tips for Loosing Weight
By
minootoo

You must count calories and at least in initial stages write down what you are going to eat and when then stay on that list. Your total calories for the week must not exceed, 1500 x 7 = 10,500 calories this will give you leave way to indulge at special occasions like wedding and parties, but you must write down what you eat and account for the calories latter and adjust the total intake next week.

Please read my article on this subject and follow them.
While at it build your body too, while reducing by doing body parts specific exercises.

If you are not too old, then best way to reduce your weight is to increase your height.

Vegetarians have a big advantage, in loosing weight, it cost less and they can satisfy the hunger more easily, some vegetables have only a few calories per pound, so they can fill themselves up with it before enjoying each meal, and never go hungry.



Most people should take one a day water soluble multi-vitamins when on this program; they can be purchased at the pharmacy near you.

********
Increasing the Height 
By 
minootoo

In rare cases, you can increase the height up to age 30.

Cycling is good exercise and fun too.

You need to adjust the seat so that when you paddle from seating position you will actually stretch your legs, it is a difficult position but doable. For safety you need to be on track and not in traffic, safety first.

The FEW things I did at least helped me.

Swimming.



Not just playing in water, but serious laps type swimming, do not try to beat the clock but steady full strokes swimming. Remember slow and steady wins the race.

Stretching exercises on floor.

Find them on line.

Chin ups.

Full stretch type.

Swinging from a rope.

Full stretch climbing.

In other words do things that require stretching.
STRETCH-STRETCH-STRETCH-STRETCH

PS

In the morning after good night sleep every one is about 1/2 inch to 1 inch taller. This is because the soft tissue between the bones recovers during the time when there is no weight on them.

Older people loose height due to bone loss. I was 5', 7'' I am only 5', 5".

Issue of Genes:



You know only the active genes but genes can stay dormant for generations.

I believe that every one has some tall height genes, dormant or active; I again believe that certain exercises can activate those.

Again Swimming:



You will start out with half a lap and build up day by day, half a lap at a time. Then you will swim non stop for 1/2 an hour.

The speed is not important but you must use various strokes and do them correctly, completely, slowly and perfectly. This way you will have full stretch, and its benefit.

Eating healthy foods and taking rest as specially sleeping soundly at night is very important. Most people need 8 hours of good sound sleep per night, some need more and few get by with 4 hours only.

In the mean time use high hills and take advantage of hair-do, wardrobe can do wonders too; vertical striped clothing can create a taller look for most people.

Hormones:

Under strict supervision of a doctor they do wonders but the side effects are delayed and unpredictable so doctors do not like to use them.

Surgical Procedures:

There are surgical procedures but most doctors will not do them till the person is 30 years or so. They also have to be very short.

Life Style Change Program for Loosing Weight
By
minootoo

Who needs to loose weight?

Answer is simply not every one, only the over weight person.

Who is over weight?

This is simple, it is easy to find out and it is available on line, it is call Body Mass Index, and calculations are simple. According to this calculation if you find your self say only 10 pounds more, you may not be over weight. Remember every one is slightly different and you can just watch it, on your own and not let it get out of hand.

What is the reason for being over weight?

This is also simple, have doctor check you out for any physical or hormonal abnormalities. The doctor should be advising you of your ideal weight even though you have already figured out the ideal weight and you are seen a doctor because your weight is not where it should be according to BMI.

Basic understanding of loosing weight.

Every one uses calories at all time. There may be some exceptions to this rule, for most of us; the rate of use, even when we are resting, we use 65 calories per hour minimum. This comes to1560 calories per day. The actual range is between 65 and 100 calories per hour. This is consistent with heart rate of 60 to 80 bits per minute.

Simply put any person eating only say 1500 calories a day, and moderately active, will not put on any additional weight. At this level of calories consumption the person should loose some weight over long haul, depending on the individual rate of metabolism.

What is a healthy weight loss?

When one tries to loose weight, one should loose excess fat; there should be a healthy loss of weight. Loosing muscles tissue is unhealthy.

How much is one pound of body fat?

One pound of body fat weight is approximately same as one pound of butter. If you look at a one pound package of butter, you will see it contains between 3200 to 3600 calories. This means that each time a person burns 3600 more calories then what the person takes in, the person will loose one pound.

How many pounds should a person loose in a month?

Any one that is trying to trim down can figure out how long it took to put on the excess pounds. The fact is; it did not happen over night. It usually creeps up, but the person realizes one day suddenly.

This is why a person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Do not wait for New Year.

Taking above in to consideration a person should not loose more then 2 pounds per month. If a person looses any thing more then that, chances are that the person will not be able to maintain the weight loss. It will take extra efforts to loose and it will take extra efforts to keep it off. Remember slow and steady wins the race.



When an overweight person should start loosing weight?

At once. The person should not be in a hurry to loose weight. The person should start at once but go slowly. Again do not wait for New Year.

How does body react to weight lose?

Any time there is depletion of fat beyond certain level, the body reacts by slowing down metabolism, so that it can build up fat. If the body is use to say 2000 calories per day and detects only 1500 calories per day for considerable length of time it reacts to the situation by reducing the rate of metabolism. When this happens one need to help body by increasing activity. Usually takes about four weeks for body to react.

What is the relationship between body and body fat?

Under ideal condition fat act as a reserved energy source for our body. Certain level of fat is good for healthy living and even may save our life in certain life threatening situations. Every one should have minimum required level of fat on their body.

What if there is no weight loss at 1500 calories in take level?

This is a rear occurrence. Do not panic. The body has slowed down the metabolism to such a great extent that you must help it. The only way to help is to increase activities, this means you have to exercise. You do not need to join Gym but you can go on an an half an hour walk every day or batter still engage in a power walk for same duration. Power walk burns 250 calories per mile and walk burns 100 calories per mile approximately.

What is the importance of body fat for a female?

Females require little more body fat then men. In the absence of certain required level of body fat, females are not able to function properly; in particular they may not be able to conceive. You can find lot more about this on internet.

At 1500 calories intake per day what one must drink and eat?

Drink

One gallon of liquids most of witch should be in the form of water (zero calories).
Calories should be accounted for all other liquids.

Why water?

Water is a universal solvent, means it dissolves almost every thing at least in very minute quantities. This helps purification of body.

Eat

What should be your proportionate in take of fat, Proteins and Complex Carbohydrates?

This depends on what your need are.

1. Need to reduce fat.

Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.
Complex Carbohydrates: 30 percent of 1500 calories per day = 450 calories.
Proteins: 60 percent of 1500 calories per day = 900 calories.

2. Need more energy.

Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.
Complex Carbohydrates: 40 percent of 1500 calories per day = 450 calories.
Proteins: 50 percent of 1500 calories per day = 750 calories.

3. Need to reduce weight only.

Fat: 25 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 375 calories.
Complex Carbohydrates: 25 percent of 1500 calories per day = 375 calories.
Proteins: 50 percent of 1500 calories per day = 750 calories.

4. Need to increase muscles bulk, but still reduce weight.

Fat: 10 percent of 1500 calorie per day = 150 calories.
Complex Carbohydrates: 15 percent of 1500 calories per day = 225 calories.
Proteins: 75 percent of 1500 calories per day = 1125 calories.
Exercise the muscles you want to develop, you can find right exercise on line, recommend use of light weights.

The problem with your question is that if you look in "search for questions" it comes up 30 times every day. I have had some criticism for repeatedly using the same answer, but since I am happy with my answer, and the questions are the same, I don't see the issue with recycling the same answer.

In practise for problems that came up on a regular basis we tended to use patient leaflets to avoid having to repeat ourselves this seemed a sensible use of resources. What follows is thus in effect me information leaflet.

Weight loss and fitness is always a long term commitment and never a quick fix. If you really want to reduce your weight a bit, this is a complex regime, that should help, I would get a pencil to write it down, in case you forget any of the intricate details.

Currently only using the criteria 'lose weight' there are 9,419 questions and answers on Answers already. Mis-spell it as 'loose weight' and you get another 2,633! 'Weight loss' will add another 1,883. 'Too fat ' 15,515 and 'overweight' 2,692 and 'over weight' 26,269!!!!!.

'Diet Pills' gives 607, Green tea 482, Hoodia 195, 'pink patch' 119, 'Xenical' 91 'Reductil' 78, 'Slim fast' 215 (and Slimfast 69 ), lipotrim 44 and 'orlistat' 40 . Do you spot a pattern here? OMG that is 60,000 questions with the same basic theme, wanting to lose weight!

Here comes the only answer, no tricks, no pills, no short cuts, If you really want to lose weight, loose weight, not be too fat or overweight, follow these instructions carefully:-

1) Eat less
2) Take regular vigorous exercise

Repeat 1 + 2 forever

It is not possible to spot reduce fat in just one part of your body, like your stomach. In order to lose stomach fat you will need to lose the fat all over your body.

In short you may need to start:

1) Eating healthier, this means:

Eat smaller meals
Eat more meals a day
Don’t starve yourself
Eat more vegetables and fruit
Drink more water
Less sugars and empty calories (less soft drinks, cakes, cookies)
Switch to whole wheat versions of your bread and pasta, brown rice instead of white rice

2) Exercising:

Forget crunches, crunches work your ab muscles but they don't burn enough calories to lose belly fat, if you do hundreds of crunches daily you will have great abs but you wont see them under your belly fat.
Prefer full body exercises they burn the most calories and increase you metabolism for a few hours after your workout.
Get a training partner or a fitness trainer, a very worthwhile investment - of the money you save on junk food for example =)

Try also to reduce stress and get enough sleep. Both of these are related to weight gain and emotional eating.

I wish I could to give a short and comprehensive answer to this question. But I believe it´s impossible.
Metabolism is so different with each individual that there can´t be general rules how to influence it.

You may need to clean the body from toxins first, then adopt new diet and new eating habits. Perhaps a hole new approach to food/beverage. 
Metabolism (exchange of chemical materials within an organism) is there to "keep you alive and healthy" so to say.



In shortest, try to use natural food (avoid pre-fabricated food), good fat sources (olive oil and butter), sugar free beverage, A LOTS OF FRUITS, eat smaller amounts of food and keep moving (avoid long sitting). Good long walk is basically enough if you have no time for sports.

A question for women who are 5ft 4 or under. Do any of you have trouble sometimes when buying trousers?



I mean that the trousers that are sold in shops.  They make the legs too long.  The people who make women's trousers should consider that not all women have long legs.

I'm 5, 1. I have the exact problem, its not just trousers but jeans as well.
New Look used to do a 29" leg which was great but they got rid of it which is annoying.
Also not every shop does a petite range and if they do it barely exists lol. Usually in the corner of the shop.

yeah i have trouble with this too. I dont know exactly how tall i am because im in a wheelchair and havent been measured, but its really awkward when buying jeans/trousers etc because i am unable to try them on in the shop, so when i get home if they are too long i have to take them to this woman near my local shopping centre and she alters them. Its quite annoying though because i end up paying twice for them because it costs about £10 to get them altered! Oh well, they say good things come in small packages! :D

Let me tell you what worked for me,.You should lift weights three times a week about 30 minutes a day, and remember to take no longer than 30 second breaks inbetween reps. This way your body releases lactaid into your bloodstream,which pulverizes fat all over your body. Eat small meals, incorporate lean proteins such as fish and chicken, drink lots of water, then drink green tea right before bed. But what really did it for me was this great new system, the link is below.

Even though this is technically a cleanse, not a diet, the 'Master Cleanse' or lemonade diet, is really good at helping your body rid its self of toxins and in turn, about 20 pounds of weight in 10 days... ( For me anyway)... Google the cleanse and even though it looks difficult it becomes easier as the days go by :)

the best way to lose weight is to push your body to its limit



what i mean is to do something like run, jog, or something else that will tire you quick but always push yourself till you are nearly dead sweat, it may sound unhealthy but it get you fit and you will lose a lot of weight quickly,

for healthy diet eat a lot of protein foods, fish, eggs, chicken, beans.

and you must not eat anything that is unhealthy, like fry ups!!!!

basicly dont eat anything nice!!!

The problem with your question is that if you look in "search for questions" it comes up 30 times every day. I have had some criticism for repeatedly using the same answer, but since I am happy with my answer, and the questions are the same, I don't see the issue with recycling the same answer.

In practise for problems that came up on a regular basis we tended to use patient leaflets to avoid having to repeat ourselves this seemed a sensible use of resources. What follows is thus in effect me information leaflet.

Weight loss and fitness is always a long term commitment and never a quick fix. If you really want to reduce your weight a bit, this is a complex regime, that should help, I would get a pencil to write it down, in case you forget any of the intricate details.

Currently only using the criteria 'lose weight' there are 9,419 questions and answers on Answers already. Mis-spell it as 'loose weight' and you get another 2,633! 'Weight loss' will add another 1,883. 'Too fat ' 15,515 and 'overweight' 2,692 and 'over weight' 26,269!!!!!.

'Diet Pills' gives 607, Green tea 482, Hoodia 195, 'pink patch' 119, 'Xenical' 91 'Reductil' 78, 'Slim fast' 215 (and Slimfast 69 ), lipotrim 44 and 'orlistat' 40 . Do you spot a pattern here? OMG that is 60,000 questions with the same basic theme, wanting to lose weight!

Here comes the only answer, no tricks, no pills, no short cuts, If you really want to lose weight, loose weight, not be too fat or overweight, follow these instructions carefully:-

1) Eat less
2) Take regular vigorous exercise

Repeat 1 + 2 forever

For two weeks i've taken up a challenge..?



i've gained 2 stone over two years and now i'm desperate to lose weight, even shift a stone would be great or even a toned stomach would be great!



i've stocked up on cereal because obviously it says "take our two week challenge" for two weeks eat two bowls of cereal a day and a healthy meal sometime throughout the day....

my parents are going away for 3 weeks and luckily i've no money to go out and luckily i've got a rowing machine, dunbells and an excercising ball (including a workout dvd).



is it possible that if i train each day and do this cereal diet would something happen after two weeks?



is there any specific excercises that i should do?



is this diet thing safe?

yes it is safe except if that's the only thing you're relying on for full nutrition, and oh YES definitely something would happen after this hard-work (which sounds like it's stressing you & that's not a good thing for your health!), but will you be able to see the CHANGE? it really depends on which part of your body can lose weights the most! so yeah just dont give up! good luck, hun.

it works for me,
i don't have a schedule or anything but usually i have whole grain cereals with NO SUGAR in the morning and in the evening, i have fish or chicken cooked in the OVEN NOT FRIED and this works for me just fine!! :D

These kind of diets dont work!

of course you will loose weight if your only eating cereal and the specail K snacks you need proper meals

try eating more often and having more meals but make them smaller that way your metabolism will work faster to burn carbs more easily

plus once this 2 weeks are up and you go back to your normal eating you will just put the weight back on

same with if you eat next to nothing your body will grab on to all the food it can when you go back to eating normally  because it will be scared your going to do this again

and also remember food thats low in fat is normally high in sugar

you have the right idea with the exercise though why not just increase the exercise and eat healthy food and keep a food diary?

and if you get bored doing exercises on your own which you no dobt will why not go swimming with your friends that way it wont feel like exercise or you could go jogging somewhere or get your bikes out

plus it is summer so why not just go for long walks thats what i do daily and go on my lateral thigh trainer :)

ooh and btw what age are you?

Hey,

I am a trainer for many years and i would say you go for heavier weights with 8-10 reps and 4 sets! Plus implement this creatine monohydrate it will help you with your gains and will give you more results, plus you will be able to lift heavier weights in the gym with it...

Almost everything you are doing is incorrect , I suggest you do a little research as to understand and learn the basic practises of weight training, I don't intend for this to sound disrespectful but to avoid flamming never ask a bodybuilder how to "tone" your biceps.

You shouldn't be doing more than 20 reps, you need more weight no matter what you are going for. Use a heavier weight so that your muscle gives out after 15-20 reps. wait 30 seconds between sets and do 3-5 sets.
Also, the concept of more reps less weight for toning and more weight less reps for mass building has been proven to be wrong. After some studies, they found that less weight more reps builds endurance, not toning and that more weight less reps build strength not mass. However, they have now found that to also be inaccurate. They have now found that what truly build the muscle is your mind. You have to focus and concentrate on the muscle as you do it. Do slow controlled reps looking in the mirror and at your muscle and imagine it building the way you want it to. Feel the muscle tissue growing and even after your work out spend some time visualizing the muscle tissues repairing the micro rips your workout created. 
Hope this helps.
Peace.

jogging is a great way to get into shape. another excellent sport is swimming. btw, the bmi does not take into account muscle. if you have a lot of muscle then you may actually be at a healthy weight for your height despite what the bmi says. the bmi is not a perfect predictor of whether someone is healthy or not. it's only good to go by if you don't have a lot of muscle.

Yea running is very good for losing weight. However i would be careful and take it slowly to begin with and build the miles up gradually or else you end up with all sorts of injuries it can be bad for your knees and ankles. And if you don't already you could cut out chocolate and sweets if you eat them and eat plenty of food and veg. There are plenty of websites on the internet that give you different exercises you can do at home which are quite good i sometimes go on sparkpeople.com and its free

First off the worlds idea of fat has gotten out of hand. I say exercise but don't concentrate on loosing weight! Concentrate on being healthy and fit. I was 130 lbs at your age and was not fat. I had lots of muscle and was very fit! I also was a size 12. Funny how back then it was considered fit and now I see tones of sites saying if your size 12 and above your fat! It also matter what your height is? You said you are 5'10" and 140 lbs. Just put it this way a girl my height at 5'4" should way between 120 and 140lbs. At your height it gives you more room to weigh a little more and still not be fat. Check out these sites on weights, heights and sizes!  If 140 is fat for you then gosh I was a junk at 5'4". however I know that's not to be true! I was very fit and was even a Letterman on the swim team! Check out these sites to help you and don't stress it to much . Just be healthy!

P.S. I went ahead and calculated your BMI and you are in a normal to average range! That is exactly where you want to be! Also your height index to weight is right where it should be too. Any skinnier and you'd be a skeleton at your height! Like I said exercise to be healthy and gain muscle not to lose weight. Also don't freak out if you gain a few pounds because muscle ways more than fat! Good luck!

Protein whey? fat-burners eg. lean system 7??



hi all~ i got about 3.5weeks to look good in bikini before holiday but not a clue about those supplyment stuff. Currently using a ccombination of balanced diet + excercising, looking into buying a supplyment too to help speed up the result a little.



while fat-burners obviously burns fat, should i be taking protein whey too(not sure if it helps burn fat too or purely for building muscles.... but then again building lean muscles helps burn fat doesnt it?)?

am not big, but would like to sculp down d excess fat that's covering my muscles and be more toned. i suppose that  = building abit more muscles too??

as u can see i really dont have a clue about supplyments!! would be great if someone can clear it up a little for me =]  n possibly provide the good brands without side-effects eg. spots, gas liver failure etc  + where i can get them from? eg Hollands & B? ^_^"  many thanks!

this article tells you all of the diet & calories, training and suppliments to use to lose body fat. (it is aimed towards male bodybuilders mainly but the concept is the same).



the site also sells suppliements that are really good (i have used them for ages) and are also very cheap

personally i would go for:
impact whey protein (take at breakfast and after workouts)
waxy maize starch (take after workouts with protein)
alcar

a glass of skim milk with a scoop of whey protien and a v8

just healthy diet changes with mild exersizes alone will help you lose the "baby fat" that plaugues most people

Make sure you are getting enought protein. Because of your kickboxing you wont be resting to build muscle, so you need to up your protein.Also you will find that it may be a problem to kickox particularly if you get sore after a workout. But you may be alright. Bodybuilding and martial arts are simular but with different types of pain in each. Good luck.

Am I eating to little to lose weight?



I am a 35 year man who is 345 pounds. I try to work out for about 30 minutes a day at the gym usually 4 or 5 times a week. I am eating 2200 calories in a day with about 5 meals spread throughout the day about every 2-3 hours apart. My last meal is around 6 to 6:30 pm. According to every calorie deficit calculator I read, this is not enough food and I will not lose weight with these numbers, but I feel like this is TOO MUCH food and if I eat more I will gain weight? I ordered a body bugg through my gym and it says that I burn around 3900 calories in a day. Can someone give me their advice on what I should do? Should I eat another 500 calories which is approximately 1 to 1 1/2 more meals or can I have this much of a deficit in a day and still lose weight. Is my body getting enough calories for the day?

I know for a fact that the average person cant eat under 1,200 calories a day - thats unhealthy. I would say you could eat 2200 a day, and as you lose more weight youll most likely want to eat less! and your body will need less because you wont burn as much during the day.

I would recommend you getting enough calories.  Try eating more fruit.  A banana has about 100 calories so eat 5.  I would eat more fruit that this a day.  I typically eat about 2lbs of grapes in the morning (600 calories) 10 bananas for lunch and a big green salad (1lb of spinach plus).

You need to consume quite a lot of calories for your weight.  3450 (your weight times ten) calories PLUS activities (ranging anywhere from 500 PLUS depending on activity level).

You are doing fine. However, It is depend on what you eat all the day. If you make your meal with lot of carb/salt/sugar food with low calories and little fruit or veggie in each meal. It will takes long way to lose weight. My suggest you to eat a lots of Fruits and Veggie as possible with meat (limit 3oz in each meal). After you follow with diet programs from doctor or website information. you will be lose weight lots in the future. It is happen to me. I have same problem like you have been.

Please don't get obsessed with your weight. What is more important is if you feel healthy, look healthy, and are eating a well balanced diet with plenty of fruit, vegetables and calcium foods.  You are what you eat. If you are eating properly, then your weight can  be determined by how your body stores fat or burns calories. This can sometimes be inherited. Are your mum, dad and siblings slim?  My granddaughter is the same age as you, Her weight is 8stone 8lbs, and her height is 5 feet 6 inches. She is slim, without being skinny. Hope this helps answer your question.

It depends on how much you lost, but that definitely could happen. It typically happens when you've had major weight loss. 
Working out doesn't really help reduce the skin, just the fat underneath it. The skin is pretty elastic so it tends to stay stretched out.
Maybe try some skin firming cremes (Neutrogena has some good ones).

Could someone give me an please example of a daily eating plan for my age, height and weight?



I don't think I am eating enough and most of what I am eating is not very healthy so I don't think I'm doing myself any good and I would like to change that.

I am 14 years old
I weigh 105lbs
My height is 5'5''

I run for 20 minutes each day, I do 200 sit ups and I use 2kg weights every day.

I don't want to slow my metabolism down, infact the opposite but I think the way i'm going at the moment may eventually have a bad effect on my metabolic rate. I am eating as little as 1000 calories a day on some occasions, half of which will consist of bad food.

Please help.
Thank you.

Define bad food?

My recommendations.

Start the day with a large breakfast.

Fruit Juice a bowl of cereal or muesli  and use yogurt instead of milk with fruit or



fruit juice two slices  brown or wholemeal toast with honey or the sort of jam or fruit conserve that should have visible bits of fruit and hence fiber in it.

for a weekend treat buy croissants or have pikelets or  crumpets or something. Real butter will not hurt you.



Morning snack fruit or fruit juice



when you get sick of fruit and need a treat  small pastry or cake or muffin if its made with real butter and fruit or is middle to low gi



Lunch 
Anything high protein and low fat ideally with some salad greens.

If you're fed up with salad try leaves of Englsih spinach with some chutney for flavor. For protein you could use any leftover sliced meat or buy sliced meat from the nearest deli

you could buy a whole cooked chicken if you can afford one and that will give you a weeks supply of meat for lunch and evening meals and other things added

Evening meal protein pasta steamed or stirfried vegies 
roast vegies or meat if low fat and cooked with olive or vegie oil

desert something with fruit ! only one portion

evening or study homework snack.

hot chocolate or milo lower fat than a solid bar

A muffin or one biscuit

if you need to stay awake to study or you're out taking a long run or walk for energy a SMALL chocolate bar or portion is okay IF its REAL dark 70% cocoa theobromn eis good for the brain

In other words eat three times eat sensiblely and mix protein carbos and vegies and fruit with some diary



If you have a dog alternate running with a slow long walk with the dog and get a book showing the nearest scenic walks !

WATER WATER WATER



If you get the urge for fuzzy drinks drink water instead

A occassional "soft" drink in summer to dehydrate is okay?

Try mixing real ginger ale or beer the sort that has bits of ginger in it with diluted fruit juice. Mix this together and put it in a small plastic bottle. Leave some room at the top. Put the bottle in the freezer overnight. Voilia as it melts you have a slurpie smoothie thingy thats healthy to hit the spot!

first off you should be doing 45 minutes of cardio a day(anything that keeps the heartbeat up - skipping, running, jogging, walking fast, etc) and 15 minutes of strength training to speed up your metabolism

make sure you are also having 8 glasses of cold water a day - the colder it is the better because your body has to warm it down to room temperature and to do that it uses the fat from your body... Eat 4-6 small meals a day every 2-3 hours to keep your metabolism up also and dont eat before 4 hours of going to bed.

MEAL PLAN:

Breakfast: Oatmeal with skim milk OR museli mixed with low-fat yogurt & have some fruit with your breakfast too (kiwi, strawberries, etc)

snack: small apple

lunch: chicken salad or a deli-sandwich (ham, tomato, lettuce, NO cheese on wholemeal bread)..



snack: rice crackers or low-fat cracker biscuits OR 2 tsp cottage cheese

Dinner: soup & vegies, skinless chicken (grilled) with vegies or some fish with vegies.

Snack (optional): low-fat yogurt or fruit



Also every now and again you can have a small portion of icecreams or muffins or cupcakes etc.. just dont go overboard!

Avoid what's known as "processed free glutamate", a neurotoxic flavor enhancer that's both harmful and addictive. You won't be able to know in which foods to find it unless you know the ingredients and foods that contain it. MSG is just one of those many ingredients. FYI, consumption of processed free glutamate has been linked to Obesity, Migranes, Headaches, Learning Disabilities, Sleep Disorders and many more health problems that the health industry doesn't want you to know so that all those food/beverage corporations will make big $$ as well as your doctors.



The FDA claims that all glutamate (including processed free glutamate) is generally safe, but then why do independent studies prove that it's a toxic? Also, you'll see sodium and fat measured on labels even if there's none at all, but you won't see glutamate labeled and measured even though the food/beverage contains it.



Yes, even some whole wheat breads contain that neurotoxin through the use of malted barley flour and yeast extract.

Check out http://www.msgtruth.com/avoid.htm for the complete list of ingredients/foods to avoid.
And check out http://www.msgmyth.com for more information about how harmful and addictive glutamate consumption can be to your health!

FYI, just by avoiding all those foods with hidden "processed free glutamate", I've lost at least 20 pound in 5 months.

If you stick to that kind of a truly smart diet, you'll not only save a lot of money (by being less hungry and going to the doctor less), but also become healthier!

It is impossible to do in a week. But with a few minor changes you could possibly see a difference in a few weeks.



1. Most peoples problem are sodas and junk food. (Pepsi and potato chips are my weakness.) But if you limit yourself to one 12 ounce can of soda a day (every other day is better) and skip the junk by substituting a healthy snack. Fruit is sweet and healthy. And a type of nut, like peanuts, are salty but still very good for you. 
2. Do simple things at first like parking farther away and walking to a store or taking the stairs instead of the elevator.  My best bud an I go to our local mall to walk on Saturday mornings. We are not shoppers but the mall makes an excellent, cool environment to exercise. 
3. Jogging, running, and swimming laps are great ways to slim down and get more healthy. Also, though it might sound fruity, in an aerobic class you can burn up to 500 calories in just one session.



Hope this helped. Check out my source websites. Good luck!

There is no "true way" to lose weight. I can't believe the sources that people feed into these days. It's simply a matter of cutting your caloric intake and burning more calories through daily exercise. Whether you take it to an extreme case is your personal choice and risk. Anyone who says it's not healthy is a hypocrite, because I'm sure it's just as unhealthy as when they eat fast food, sip on sodas, and snack on candies, so hush up and please keep to yourself.



As for your question, you can lose about 5-7 pounds of water weight by doing some jogging for an hour and a half or so. Do this for a week and cut back on your calories and you'll see results. I'm not saying you won't feel exhausted and depleted, I'm simply giving you the information you want without criticism. I've fluctuated through many body weights and I know how it feels and what it takes to get there, whether it's the "healthy" way or the "unhealthy" way.

The thing you need to know is that there are no shortcuts.

Eat less, exercise more is the right answer.

I started running, drinking more water, eating square meals and cut out the snacking and I managed to lose about 6lbs in about 6 weeks which has stayed off.

Crash dieting, you just put it back on. If you start out in the winter then by spring you should be more confident with your body.

The most common cause of obesity is poor diet and/or eating habits and a lack of exercise.  Other factors that can lead to obesity include glandular malfunctions, diabetes, hypoglycemia, emotional tension, boredom, and a simple love of food.  Obesity has also been linked to food sensitivities and/or allergies.  Food your body cannot use or that is a poison to your system is stored in the tissues and causes water retention.  Ironically, poor nutrition may be an important factor in obesity.  When there is inadequate intake of certain essential nutrients, fat is not easily or adequately burned and can accumulate in the body.



The amount of calories required varies from person to person. There is no need to worry about the amount of calories you consume as about eating the proper foods.  Rotate your foods, and be sure to eat a variety of foods.  Eat meals that consist of a balance of proteins, complex carbohydrates, and some fat.  Proteins can increase your metabolic rate by as much as 30%, and help to balance the release of insulin by prompting secretion of the pancreatic hormone glucagons.  Protein-induced glucagons, mobilizes fats from the tissues in which it is stored, thus aiding in weight loss.  By eating balanced meals you get more steady blood sugar levels and the ability to burn stored body fat for long-term weight loss.  Eat mainly plant proteins, such as nut, seeds, and grains.

Eat fresh fruits and an abundance of raw vegetables.  Have one meal each day that consists entirely of vegetables and fruits.  Use more low calorie vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery, cucumbers, green beans, kale, lettuce, onions, radishes, spinach, and turnips.  Eat more of the low calorie, low-carbohydrate fruits including,  apples, cantaloupe, grapefruit, strawberries, and watermelon.

Eat foods raw where possible.  Drink 8 – 10 glasses of water each day.  Also include home made fruit juices and vegetable juices in your diet.  Eat a wide variety of fruits and vegetables - at least all kinds that you can get your hands on.  Just eat more of the low cal., low carb ones.

it takes a whole lot of commitment and you have to ask yourself how badly you want to lose weight.
start by trying an all water diet first, see how much you can handle at once. don't drink any sugary drinks like soda or even some juices.
water is the healthiest and most natural drink there is. 
do that for about a week or week and a half and when you can achieve that, take the next step

cut down on junk foods. eat like a cross country runner. instead of having a snack with your lunch, try eating a larger lunch. for ex: put more ham or turkey in your sandwich so that it'll fill you up better. that way, you won't need the snacks to go along with it. when you do need a snack, eat rice cakes and carrot sticks.



exercising is also key. don't force yourself to do so much at once. its important to adjust to the workload slowly so you can lose weight in a healthier way. you can try going to some gym but running on your own is a great way to get excersise. make sure you drink lots of water, stretch and if you think you can handle it, do 5 sets of 50 crunches, cherry pickers, or obliques. this will strengthen your stomach muscles and sculp off that fat. don't run just until you feel tired. that's when you actually start burning that fat. start off with at least a mile a day and when that gets easier, go for 4-6.



believe in yourself. don't ever think that there's no way you'll be able to do this. you just need to push yourself and put in hard work. i know it's easy to say but believe me, i know.

good luck. hopes this helps :D

There is no fast way to lose weight. If you're looking for a healthy way to lose significant weight in a month, you're not gonna find one. It's best to stick the the obvious with diet and exercise, and raise your metabolism rate. Your metabolism is the rate at which you burn calories. It's the best way if you want to lose weight in a steady, healthy pace.

1. Eat small frequent meals: Having 4 to 6 small healthy meals a day instead of eating 3 big meals a day is a better way to stop going into 'starvation mode.' In 'starvation mode' your body will hold on to the calories it has until your next meal. Don't extend the time between meals.

2. Drink water. Remember the "8 by 8" rule? (drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day) This isn't necessarily healthy. The amount of water you drink each day depends on your age, height, and activity level. Divide your weight by two, this is the amount of ounces of water you'll need each day to maintain a healthy weight. &lt;--That's a smart way to do it ;)

Tips to increase your water intake:
- Carry a bottle or container of water where ever you go, you'll get used to drinking water at hand, whenever you feel a bit thirsty.
- Keep a glass of water next to you on your computer desk if you spend a long time on the computer. (like I do)
- If you dislike the taste of water, you can always add some lemon or flavoring to your drink. Just avoid dissolvants high in sugar.

3. Aerobic Exercise is the best way to lose weight and gain muscle quickly. This is simple! Aerobic exercise can be something like running, riding your bike, or going up a flight of stairs. Working out for only a half hour, 3 times a week is the recommended amount of exercise you should have.



This is hard, and will take commitment. Ask a friend to try out this with you, this can help a lot. You won't feel alone and can someone to lean on when you feel like you need to give up. Try your best, and I hope you the best of luck!

One word - commitment. 
If you are so willing to change your life to an extent in order to lose weight, the rest won't be as much of a problem. When it's time to exersize, be excited to get in shape. Listen to music before - tell yourself you'll have fun doing it. Use something as a motivation. Do you want to lose weight because it will build your confidence? So you can fit into the jeans you want? So you can attract the opposite sex? MOTIVATION is what you need. Once you have a proper sleep schedule and time to exersize each day, learn to treat yourself with the same quantity of the right foods each day. Think about the results ! You can do it.

If you are looking to add some weight to your frame, then you are on the right track by not wanting fatty foods.  The basis of gaining healthy weight is to still eat the good foods.  Simply by adding 200-300 calories to your daily intake.  Example is if right now you eat 1400 or so you would begin to eat 1600-1700.  You can do this by adding more fruits and vegetables.  Eating more protein with your dinner.  Just little tweaks to the food you already eat (if healthy) is good.

Diet and Weight help?



I'm a 21 year old male, weighing in at around 164.  I have recently come down from about 186 which I did from changing my diet to a lot of grilled chicken / salads (without dressing) and fruits and veggies.  I eat a lot of apples and bananas for snacks and the chicken salads for meals.

Though I do see a big difference in my stomach size, its still flabby and still a gut.

I bike about 20 minutes to and from work every day.  And am constantly on my feet at work.  A lot of times lifting and moving things around.

Ive been doing about 150 crunches a night but that does not seem to be helping at all.

Does any one have any advice?



</question>



<additional details>



I could start running if I have the energy (I work crazy hours)



Also, is eating like 6-8 apples and/or bananas  (if not more) a day really good, or not so good for me.  I work at Trader Joe's (A very healthy grocery store)  where when I get hungry I just grab an apple or banana and just eat one or two to hold me over until I can get my meal in.

I used to do push ups until I hurt my neck/shoulder muscle so I thought I would take a break but I guess I'll start again.

Thanks for your help.

Yes, it sounds like you're doing a lot of the right things.  Your diet sounds healthy.  You might want to keep a food log for a week or two so that you can really analyze it and see if you can make any improvements anywhere.  You can print one out here:
http://www.easy-weightloss-tips.com/eat-...
and then after a week or two, compare it to this page to see if you're doing as well as you think.



Make sure that you aren't drinking sweet drinks, even diet soda.  Water should be your main source of hydration.  Sweet drinks play havoc with the mid-section.

Your activity sounds good too.  I would definitely keep up the crunches and I would add push ups.  They help your core too.  On this page:http://www.easy-weightloss-tips.com/targ...
you'll find some excellent abs/belly exercises that you can do at home with no special equipment.



Is running a possibility for you?  That would also help strengthen your core.



Other than that, I would just say, "be patient."  If you're doing all these things right, then it's only a matter of time before you'll see the results you want!  Good luck!!

I got operated and got stitches on my lower tummy because I had a baby. They told me not to do anything for 2 months in a half..just walking and then after that I was told just to do cardio. Meaning just jogging, running, or using the oliptical. If you do weight right now,,that might damage your cut so you have to be careful. So just start by doing that and once your done..you can look on the web like google it and you'll be amazed at all the refults you will find..good luck!!!

Which foods or ingredients in foods will make my baby gain more weight ?



My 10 month old is in the 25th percentile, falling from the 50th from his last check up. I want to get him back to where he was, but he refuses to eat from a spoon, so I make him formula/ oatmeal/fruit concoctions in his bottle, which he drinks. I also feed him puffs, and  pasta he will eat as finger foods. He is allergic to dairy and soy, so it makes it difficult what to feed him. What else can I feed him? I try to feed him foods higher in calories and I try to feed him as often as I can, but it usually ends up being a waste, as he doesnt always like to eat/drink. How can i make him gain weight?

Please read this response in its entirety because what you don't know CAN hurt you.



Just make sure your baby avoids "processed free glutamate", a neurotoxic flavor enhancer that's both harmful and addictive to all humans, especially to babies. You won't be able to know in which foods to find it in because the FDA allows companies to let it be unlabled, so you, as a smart consumer, must know the ingredients and foods that contain it (see below).  MSG is just one of those many ingredients. FYI, consumption of processed free glutamate has been linked to Obesity, Migranes, Headaches, Learning Disabilities, Sleep Disorders and many more health problems that the health industry doesn't want you to know so that all those food/beverage corporations as well as your doctors will make big $$ while your health goes down.



The FDA claims that all glutamate (including processed free glutamate) is generally safe, but then why do independent studies prove that it's a toxic? Also, you'll see sodium and fat measured on labels even if there's none at all, but you won't see glutamate labeled and measured even though the food/beverage contains it.



The FDA also claims that all glutamate is natural, but, in reality, the processed free glutamate that's hidden is not the same glutamate that you'd find in natural, unprocessed foods such as tomatoes and mushrooms. So, because of the FDA's deceptive rules and regulation, you'll even find processed free glutamate in ingredients such as "natural flavor/flavors".



Yes, even some whole wheat breads contain that neurotoxin through the use of malted barley flour and yeast extract.

Check out http://www.msgtruth.com/avoid.htm for the complete list of ingredients/foods to avoid.
And check out http://www.msgmyth.com for more information about how harmful and addictive glutamate consumption can be to your health!

FYI, just by avoiding all those foods with hidden "processed free glutamate", I've lost at least 20 pound in 5 months.

If you stick to that kind of a truly smart diet, you'll not only save a lot of money (by being less hungry and going to the doctor less), but also become healthier!

And, don't forget: Knowledge is power!

No, you should be fine if you always stretch remember to work out lower body 1 day and then upper body the next. If you try to work out upper body 2 days again you will end up breaking down your muscle growth. I'm a senior in HS and my team won state weight lifting 3 years in a row. Don't ever try to bench if your shoulder is bothering you either!

Would having a blood pressure result of 167/102 just before a fitness test affect a person's performance?



</question>



<additional details>



Reason for asking: I had a pre-joining fitness test the otherday (involved running on a treadmill) for the navy and they took my blood pressure just before the test. Just wanted to know whether having a higher blood pressure than usual would affect my running?

The reading of 167/102 is rather high,more so considering that you are a young person.Your pressure reading would not actually alter your running performance but it would cause your blood pressure to go even higher.Exercise in the long term is good for lowering blood pressure but that is over a period of time as it strengthens the heart muscles.You cannot run a marathon and expect your pressure to be lower than when you started.Exercise causes both the heart rate and blood pressure to rise.
The reason that your blood pressure was raised could be that maybe you were nervous,i would see your GP about the blood pressure as it is rather high.I hope this has been of some help to you and good luck with your chosen career.

Will this work in one week? Is it safe?



Ok in just over a week I have a reunion with some old mates, and I wanna lose a bit of belly.

It's about 4-5lbs I wanna get rid of, what exercises should I do? If I eat this will I be able to lose it?

Breakfast - muesli with low fat low sugar yoghurt OR porridge made with skimmed milk PLUS maybe a piece of fruit, caffinated coffee with skimmed milk

Lunch - wholemeal bread, tuna, tiny bit of low fat mayo, cucumber, lettuce, tomatoes

Dinner - pasta OR potatoes PLUS lots of veg and maybe a low fat meat substitute or fish (I'm a fish eating veggie, or whatever).

2 1/2 litres of water a day, and maybe some green tea or mint tea in the evenings if I need filling up - I tend to snack in the evenings.

Will this work?
If I keep doing it how much will I lose after this first week?
Is there anything I should cut out?
Is it too much food to lose this weight?
What exercise should I do?

Thanks

first let me start by telling you that I normally would never give this advice- however since you're trying to lose 5 lbs in a week I'd skip the exercise(just for that week though). Long bouts at the gym will only make you hungry and not to mention that muscle is more dense than fat and gaining muscle right now could counter act the weight loss you may experience from your diet. Especially if you normally don't work out-one week of excessive crunches will not do anything (except make you really sore)!  So,again, let me stress... this is not what i would suggest for long term weight loss, but for the time being it just might work.

I dont know if it will work,but it's not really safe.the safest amount to lose in a week is 2-3 pounds ish.try drinking green tea and dandelion tea..they're supposed to help with water retention which can shift pounds as quickly as overnight.but only if you have a little water retention,Lol. try eating that diet you planned,and for exercise,try cycling everyday-at least 2/3 miles-swimming-set yourself a certain amount of lengths,e.g 25 lengths a day-running,boxing,etc.rowing is good too :) and walk as much as you can...hope i helped.

Cardio is what helps lose weight. Try to eat more veggies than pasta/potatoes. It's better to eat small, frequent meals with lots of veggies/fruits as snacks throughout the day than 3 typical meals.



I have to say though....seems like you're a bit obsessing...No one will notice a 4-5lb difference.

I am not an expert in weight loss, but have tried diet and exercise all my life. There are three major factors to be considered in order to assess your possibilities of losing those 5 pounds:
1) Your age. If you are young, you have a better chance to lose weight fast, If you are over 40 your chances are not that good.
2) The caloric value in your regular daily intake of food vs the amount of food you are proposing. If there is a big difference (i.e.you usually eat a higher-calorie dinner or lunch), you are at a good chance of losing it. But if you live on salads and fish....well...I'm guessing you may have to starve yourself...
3) The amount of exercise you are used to vs the amount of exercise you are willing to put out that week. If you walk 20-30 minutes a day, try increasing it to one hour, even split it, half in the morning and half in the evening...etc.
Other than that, I recommend watching out for those carbohidrates (particularly their glycemic index, since they make you feel hungry quickly) and increasing the amount of low-fat protein instead, which makes you feel full for a longer time and thus, better for avoiding snacking. What works for me with the night snacking business is slowly peeling and eating a whole orange or frozen mixed berries.
If you are in good condition and fairly fit, I would suggest jogging for intervals along with the walking. Jogging/Running slims you like nothing else (too bad I cant) Don't do any weight or resistance training this week, as it will make your muscles swollen and you will increase in weight. Good luck!!! You will look and feel wonderful...but be careful not to overdo it!!!

There are several treatment options for stretch marks. The degree of success with any treatment will be impacted by your age, your skin tone and even your diet. Treatment options include:

Surgical methods
Dermabrasion, chemical peels, or laser surgery can be used to address unwanted stretch marks.

Lotions and creams
Over-the-counter stretch mark treatments are available. Ask your doctor to recommend one. And, if you are pregnant, discuss your concern with your doctor at the beginning of your pregnancy, before stretch marks develop, so that preventive treatment can be started.

Diet and exercise
Drink plenty of water. Adequate hydration keeps your skin soft and less likely to develop stretch marks. Caffeine can increase your risk of stretch marks. If you're stuck on your caffeinated coffee or tea, make sure you balance the fluids. Drink just as much—or more—water as you drink coffee, tea, or soda. Stretch marks can also result from nutritional deficiency. Be sure to consume foods that promote skin health: foods rich in zinc, such as nuts or fish; foods high in vitamins A and C, such as carrots and citrus fruits and milk; protein-rich foods, such as eggs.

It's best to be in the care of a surgeon or dermatologist. He or she can determine which treatment approach is best for you.

While not in any way bad for you "super foods" are a marketing con. They're not that super or a panacea for all our ills.

There was a tv programme on not too long ago that examined the nutritional content of some of the popular "super foods" and shall we say the "may help with..." claims and often repeated stories are somewhat over hyped.

Eat them by all means but don't consider them a cure all.

the less fat in the milk the more lactose in it. if you have switched to low fat or non fat try going back to whole  milk.

Yes it is.  Your body uses lactose, which is an enzyme, to break down dairy when you eat it.  Biologically speaking we're not supposed to drink milk past infancy, especially not that of another species.  Some people's bodies produce lactose for their whole life, while others only produce so much.  The body can stop producing the enzyme, and then your body can't break down dairy and you become lactose intolerant.  You can try taking lactaid, or another supplement that contains lactose, which will allow you to eat dairy.  You just take it before you eat ice cream, or whatever.



There are a lot of dairy alternatives out there.  I mean, you can still eat dairy, it will just make you sick.  Personally I'll occasionally eat a piece of cheesecake or some Ben and Jerry's (looove Everything But The...) and just deal with the consequences.  I would go to the doctor first.  Like I said, it takes adjusting, but you can do it.  : )  Good luck!

Think about how guilty you will feel after you have eaten it! and think about how good you will feel about yourself and how your gaining self-control that you dont eat it.



Think about the perfect body your trying to get - that chocolate bar aint helping you get there.

no one can give you the discipline or motivation that you're asking for - you have to find it in yourself. take a deep breath, and go over the pro's and con's of eating the chocolate bar (sure, it tastes good, but it's a nutrient-free 200 calorie snack that will make you full for about 10 minutes.) drink some water, eat some saltines - do anything to distract yourself from the chocolate bar. give it away to someone around the house, if necessary.
know that you're much better off if you don't eat the chocolate bar. =]

</answer from>



<answer>



lots of calisthenics and cardio, combined with a diet of lean meats and vegetables in which you eat a small meal about every 2-3 hours while awake. The idea is to get your body burning fat, gaining/maintaining muscle. By eating many little meals throughout the day, you keep your bloodsugar stable and prevent your body from storing calories as fat.

Is there a nice way to ask your girlfriend to lose some weight?



I workout all the time and very hygienic, and I always dress good for my girl, but it seems she is not even trying to look after her physique (she can eat..no joking around here). And I'm becoming less attracted to her. So my question is...is there a nice way to ask my girlfriend to lose some weight? She doesn't have to be miss America or anything I'm just talking about 10 of 15 pounds.



Guys do you know what I'm talking about here? And girls whats the best way to approach her about this? Thanks in advance...

Depends on where you are in the relationship. Just be serious, don't be mean, sit her down and say something like "While I still care deeply about you blah blah, my health is important to me and it worries me that you seem to be letting yours go" i dunno, you get the gist. or you can start calling her "my little meatball"

i know what you mean, i had the same thing with my girlfriend.  just make sure she knows that you still love her and that you want her to take care of herself.  and if you want to trick her, just say that you might be putting on some weight that you dont want and ask her to work out with you, that way she benefits from it as well and it can be a relationship builder.

Invite her to work out with you. If she does not want to, then suggest she get exercise in another form and that she should maintain a healthy diet. Make it clear to her in as nice a way as possible that her physical attractiveness is important to you. If she is unwilling to listen to you, then maybe she is not the right person for you.



Whatever you do, do it with sensitivity, try to assure her that she has no reason to lose her self-esteem -- you don't want her to develop an eating disorder.

Well, I dont think there is a really 'nice' way to say you need to lose weight.



Maybe ask her to go on walks with you, or jogs and go do exercise together and make it a regular thing that you guys always do.



Also when you eat together or eat out together, convince her to always go for the healthiest thing and maybe even cook her some healthy things every once in a while..



Maybe even tell her to go aerobics class with some of her friends or dance class, etc



Or maybe say instead of you need to lose weight, say you think she needs to have a healthier lifestyle or something like that ?



But good luck with it !

Yes, there is a nice way.
Actually, there are nice ways..



1. Tell her you're concerned about her health, too much is like too little, they both hurt, they both matter.



2. Remind her how to healthy.



3. Invite her to work out with you. You do it all the time, so bring her. You can also use this as bonding time with each other. "Compete" so that she'll try hard.



4. Go to a check up wit her, so that the doctor can tell her and not you, if you can't really come up with a line.



5. You can just be honest to her that you're losing interest because she's eating and eating. Don't be mean that you don't like fat girls.
Tell her that it's like the only thing she does, and you need other things. Tell her you do your best for her, and she just doesn't give anything back.



6. Ask help from her friends because no matter how they say it, they're cool. That's how girls are.



Just accept her. Be polite, but be honest.
Hope I helped. :]

Honestly theres never an easy way to tell anyone that they dont look good, especially girls because some try really hard but in ur case oviously she is not trying
Approach her and sit down with her and tell her that u dress up and u like looking good for her but u feel as though she doesnt do the same, tell her that u try hard to look good for her then tell her that u would appreciate it if she would dress up or try loosing some weight,and tell her that u r feeling more unatractive to her and she will get the point,

Do not tell her she's fat and do not bring atractiveness into it. She will probably get offended and become defesive/hurt.



Tell her that you care, not about her looks, but about her health. After all if she was healthy, she would be eating low-calorie meals and working out and would inevitably lose weight. Tell her that you are worried about her wellbeing, and that you are worried she may get sick, and you love her too much to see her hurt health. If you approach it this way, l think she might take it better and feel more positive about changing her behavior

her feelings are going to get hurt and she's going to get pissed at you if you tell her flat-out that you want her to lose weight and you don't think she's attractive anymore (i mean, listen to how this would sound in your head - totally disrespectful, right?).



as her boyfriend - she's counting on you to help boost her self esteem, not totally damage it by doing what a lot of guys do - criticizing the way her body looks.



try to send small hints. for her birthday, or christmas - buy her a piece of clothing that she's wanted for a long time - but in a size too small. find some excuse to do some kind of active activity with her (although nothing that screams "weight loss!"). for example - go skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, hiking through the woods, etc.  instead of eating out, cook her a "romantic" (and coincidentally, healthy) meal. make comments about how you like when she takes care of her body, tell her that you think eating healthy & working out is sexy.



if none of this works, and you still want to date her - tell her that you wish she'd take better care of herself, tell her that you're concerned about her health. DON'T use the words "fat" or "lose weight" - i can guarantee that NO girl wants to hear those words from anyone, let alone her boyfriend. and if all else fails, what more can you do, but break up with her? you can't help that she doesn't know how to take care of herself & that you're not attracted to her any longer.
good luck & i hope things work out for you. =]

Loosing 100 pounds in a month would be near impossible and very unhealthy, but loosing a smaller amount can be done!



Start by looking at your eating habits.
- Try replacing soda & sugar filled drinks with water.
- Cut out fast food, (It is so bad for you!)
- Try portioning your sizes



Then start by re-vamping your exercise routine.
- Try doing a workout in the morning and before you go to bed daily.
(This can be stretches, crunches, yoga . . .)
- Also, a few times a week fit in a quick jog, walk the dog, play basketball, just get moving for about an hour.



If you keep up a healthy menu and live an active lifestyle, you will not only loose weight, but also be overall healthier!



Hope this helps! Have a blast at the party!!

Listen, if you lose that much weight, you will not only be seriously, deathly unhealthy, but you will be anorexic, too.



You see, if you starve yourself, your body goes into starvation mode, and you don't burn as many calories as fast. This means that when you start eating normal again, you will pack on the pounds faster than you can count.



True, you are a tad overweight, but at your age it is okay to be a little overweight as you are still growing.



I would aim at losing five pounds a month, and only losing 30-40 pounds in total.



Seriously. Please don't kill yourself over weight. It's not worth it. People will judge you by your personality, not your weight if they are good people.



Remember, you are a wonderful person, and if other people can't see that, it is their loss and you should ignore them. You are better than that.



Good luck.

You don't say how tall you are, but the following should help:



The standard baseline is 100 lbs. at 5'. For every inch over 5', add 4 lbs. for a small frame, 5 lbs. for a medium frame and 6 lbs. for a large frame.



Check this website to see what your BMI is: http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/. Just plug in your height and weight.



What I suggest is for you to concentrate on eating healthfully, limiting sweets and exercising in moderation. Avoiding "white" foods such as sugar, flour, potatoes and rice will help you lose weight pretty quickly. HOWEVER, if you go back to your old way of eating (junk and too much of it), you'll just regain it. Permanent weight loss can be successful only through permanent lifestyle change. You should probably take a good multi-vitamin and drink plenty of milk or take a calcium supplement. Avoid drinking a lot of soda pop since many of them, especially colas, contain phosphorous which leaches calcium out of your bones.



If you start RIGHT NOW, you may be able to lose 12-16 lbs. in 4 weeks, BUT NO CHEATING with the "white" foods!!



You'll look great at any weight if you put on a big smile, act confident, and be nice to everyone around you!!!



Good Luck!!

I do triathlon training (spinning cycling, track and swim) and have been weight training for over 5 years. What i have found unbelievable helpful is taking Coenzyme Q10 and CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid, plant-derived). I have noticed a difference in my stamina and muscle development, as well as in my skin and hair. These can be taken safely, as long as you buy good quality products and follow the label indications. I get mine at my local GNC.



And please, don't even think about trying stuff like Red Line or Hydroxycut, they are really bad for your health.

You could also pick up a good, high potency B-Complex, as well as, some chromium.  Besides being good for you, these two items will also increase your energy, speed up your metabolism, and help turn food into energy.

sure, i am fortunately able to gain muscle mass quickly however i am not able to loose the weight. if you are really active i would suggest eating more carbs.



change your work out routines.- change the rotation of days, the types of lifts you do for the same muscle group. (i.e. i find for chest when i plateu doing bench i switch to doing dumbell bench press.)
cut the reps down for a few weeks, then increase the reps and decrese the weight.



simple changing of routines will add greatly to your progress. when you confuse the muscle it constantly has to adapt....

Sounds to me like your an ECTOMORPH



All I can say is this:



Multiply your weight by 1.5



This number is the amount of grams of protein you need PER DAY.



Sometimes even I, a Mesomorph get STUCK at a particular weight, bodybuilders in progress call this a plateau, but if you continue doing all the right healthy things, and continue to work out, you will get over this plateau.



Gakic
Creakic
Leukic



These three supplements should get you over this.....if taken all together. You can buy these at a local GNC.

your training is good
as long as u are only training each muscle once a week, no more then that
and as long as u are not working out longer then 40 - 60 mins, after that its too much
and u should be doing heavier weights, lower reps...



stick with the supplments, your doing well

I love Bolthouse, Odwalla, and Naked brand fruit smoothies - you can find them at grocery & health food stores, and they usually are FILLED with protein, fruits, veggies, antioxidents, and other nutrients. Although, they definitely can get expensive (around 3-4 dollars for a small bottle), but the upside is that you don't have to buy any ingredients =].



If you decide to make your own smoothies - well, don't be afraid to experiment! My advice is to avoid putting dairy (milk/ice cream) in your shake - just because that can make it a bit unhealthier. Try adding nuts (for protein and good fats) and lots and lots of fresh fruit. Use as little sugar as possible to get the most out of the smoothie.

I'm an Ex-Bulimic, and I am in desperate need of help... ?



Hey guys,



I was bulimic/anorexic for about 2 years, to the point where I was even hospitalized due to it. I've had a few setbacks where I've almost fallen back into it time and again, but I always stopped myself before I could cause more damage to myself... (not saying I still do it, because I will never...ever.. resort to it again)  and I haven't resorted to it in about a year now.



Anyways, my question is:



What would be the best way for an ex-bulimic to lose weight? I've dieted, I've exercised excessively, I've taken vitamin supplements (B-complex, lipoic acic, acai, etc). But I still haven't seen one budge on the scale! And I've been doing this for months now! Does anyone have any advice for me before my mind goes nuts and convinces me to fall back into the vicious cycle of eating disorders? (which I never want to happen again, but its the only way that has ever worked for me unfortunately),  I could sure use it!

I would make an appointment with a dietician. Explain your history and ask them to help you to put a plan together. With your recent history I would try not to self-regulate. Asking someone professional and objective to talk you through how much you need to lose and how best to do this.



Good luck.

<answer>



Generics are just the same product not made by the original patent holder.



Pls do not consider using steroids for body building.  The natural look is far more attractive to women and a lot safer.  These steroids can cause some serious sides effects such as anger problems, osteoporosis, mood swings, sterility, which can be permanent and cancer.



Think very carefully.  You must balance your desire for a pumped up body against the dangers to your health and life.

The best thing is to cut out sweets and crisps and fatty food and find a form of exercise you enjoy and go for it. Dancing swimming walking tennis.  The number of calories you burn has to exceed your intake for you to lose weight.  Good luck

AVOID dieting and restricting calories. Also? don't fall for gimmicks, such as magic diet pills, crazy weight loss devices, and other expensive and useless things. You can easily lose weight by starting to do more cardio exercise, and of course eating healthier on a daily basis.



-Definitely get into an exercising routine, and try to find something that you enjoy! If you're in school, definitely try to join a sport - even if you think you won't like it. Sports will give you the excuse to exercise nearly every day, and it can also be fun & interesting & you can meet new friends.
-Drink water. Water is ESSENTIAL for you & your body - and definitely does help with losing weight. Water gives you minerals, increases circulation, and of course suppresses your appetite. Try to drink water (or 100% juice) instead of pop, coffee, or any other carbonated beverage. Water's definitely better for you.
-Change one small eating habit at a time; take it week by week. Start eating more fruits during the first week, eat more veggies the second, switch your milk from whole to skim the third, etc. Making small changes over time will definitely help you more in the long run than trying (& failing) at dieting.
Good luck =]

What is your height? Height has a role with weight.



Losing weight is very easy if you follow simple techniques - avoid junk foods and eat fat free foods. Walk at least 2 miles a day - these will help you lose weight quickly.

Since you are young, you have the blessing of a youthful metabolism.  Once you start a sensible eating / activity plan, you should be able to return to a more healthy weight quickly.  I've personally found that having feedback really helps me keep on top of my diet.  I'm using a web based calorie / exercise tracking tool.



So whenever I eat something, I immediately log it.  When I do activities, I log it also.  I get to see my caloric intake/burn for the day.  It helps to see how many calories you're taking in daily.  The website is: http://www.livestrong.com/thedailyplate



They also have a lot of foods listed so you can immediately determine calories for something you're eating.  If you can't find what you're eating, you can input it yourself manually.  I've been using this tool, and I've already lost 10 pounds.  Remember that slow and steady wins the race.  Use whatever tools work best for you.

I skip breakfast and lunch all the time and only eat a cookie or two until supper... *sigh* I can't stop, though, because I am, like, NEVER hungry...I always have high levels of energy, though and am the brightest person in class (...or so they say...) and well, very athletic for a person who's not interested in sports. Well, I just don't think I have a very normal lifestyle, yet it's so hard to change. I mean, who else do you know that barely eats, yet is the most energetic and brightest (...with MY class, it's not hard, lol...) girl in her class!? Ugh... I don't even know what I'm trying to ask... umm... How can I change, I guess...?

I do this sometimes (when I'm mad at myself for binging) but I don't feel good afterwards. I don't have any energy and my heart speeds up. Plus I get dizzy.



I don't recommend it. It's not very healthy and it will slow down your metabolism. Please try to eat something! I don't want you to get hurt! You're one of my bestest contacts and friends on here! ♥



When you eat breakfast, it wakes your body up and you'll burn the calories by lunch. For breakfast just eat a little (don't STUFF yourself)! Start off with half of a banana or a Quaker Oatmeal Breakfast Cookie (they are good for you, and also tasty!) until you develope hunger. Once you start eating regularly at a fixed time your body will get hungry. Peanut butter on toast with a little honey drizzled on top is also good.



For lunch, try Smucker's Uncrustables. They are tiny little pockets (white bread) filled with either grilled cheese, peanut butter and honey, peanut butter and grape, or peanut butter and strawberry jelly. They are snack-sized, so maybe an apple or some trail mix with it if you can. Then as you start to get hungry after training your body to eat lunch, you can go for full-sized sandwhiches if you can't do that now.



Also, tend to eat your snacks / junk food during the day and NOT after dinner. Your body burns the most calories during the day, so that way you can eat and not regret it.



Good luck, and please take care! Try what I said - if you think you have energy now, just wait! It'll be like stuffing you with hyper-active sugar pills! XD And who doesn't enjoy hyper energy?

wow actually you are UNDERWEIGHT!!
I am only an inch talller than you, should weigh about 120 or a lil less. wow
umm i have days like that except i eat more than you lol. I sometime dont eat breakfast and just eat lunch and by the time i get home im not hungry for supper. ...hmmm idk lol
but you really should try and eat something normal before dinner. Later in life you will regret it because you are making your metabolism slow way down and  eventually it will make you gain a lot of weight if you ever start eating normal. so you should probably try eating a little better each day.

You are messing with your metabolism and it's going to bite you in the a** eventually.  This bad habit can lead you right down the road to diabetes, thyroid disease and many other metabolic disorders.  Your 'lots of energy' is like the state when someone is hyper due to being over tired.  It's very stressful on your body.  I was the same way as a teenager and just didn't eat until supper, even into my 20s.  It catches up with you.



If you want to change, try to plan out what you will eat in advance.  When I don't do this, I go completely off track.  Try to have nutritious snacks like fruit and just graze during the day, without having meals.  You'll feel more normal if you aren't used to eating at that time.



My co workers now tell me to 'GO EAT'.  You could also try powerbars, having smoothies for breakfast and protien shakes.  Maybe you have some people who support you and can do the same?

The fat in Ice Cream comes from the cream...Low Fat ice cream is ice cream with the Milk fat or cream removed or reduced (ie. Low fat milk)...Same thing with milk ... 1%



2%...that's the Cream/fat content...What you need to look at is...The Total Calories of the Ice Cream and the Calories from Fat...All Food labels should have this information...Simple math divide the two to get a percentage of Calories from fat...foods over 20% is not recommended or at least limit the amount you eat...this is only a rule of thumb ...as some food maybe a high percentage in fat..but it's good fat...ie. Nuts...Good Luck

some ideas:



-start exercising more often.



-drink more water (8 glasses a day!).



-walk or bike to the places that you'd normally bus or be driven to.



-try to eat less junk food, and eat more fruits & veggies.



-be creative & learn to like healthy cooking! experiment with recipes. try to get your family involved with your goal of healthy eating.
-become a vegetarian.
-join a sport with school! (not only is this a good way to get a workout in, but who knows? you could really like a sport & not even know it yet!)
quit drinking pop(soda) or any kind of carbonated beverage. (this means diet, regular, most flavored waters, etc.) instead, drink water or 100% fruit juice!
-try to eat balanced meals instead of skipping meals & eating one big meal. this will help speed up your metabolism, which will make you lose weight. =]
-don't weigh yourself often! we often think we've gained weight when really, it's just fluctuating due to water weight & bloating. so if the scale tells you something you don't want to hear - don't freak out. use how you feel, and how you look as a measurement of how healthy/thin you are becoming.
-don't stress over it. you're 13 - your body has so many changes to go through yet (it sounds corny, but it's true), and as you get older - you'll naturally lose some of your baby fat as you go through puberty. so, really, don't stress too much over this.



and honestly, don't even worry about dieting or restricting calories - just try to recognize your unhealthy habits & change them for the better. good luck! =]

if your 13 you could join a sport and if you dont want to do that you could go out side to play a game like football or something and if not that just change how you eat, lay off the chips, snacks and cokes. and eat tuna or chicken or peanut butter and drink nothin but water. and every night before bed do some crunches and push ups, i guarantee you'll lose weight.

Can flabby arms and thighs be fixed with exercise?



I gained 23 kilos last year due to illness and now im off my medication I want to lose weight. My arms are extremely flabby underneath ( like bat wing arms) and they hang. It is gross. My thighs are also extrememly flabby. Anyway I started at the gym, going 5 days for an hour each day but going to try and build up to more. I do some cardio like treadmill and cross trainer and then weight machines which I love!!! Will doing this result in fixing my arms and thighs or should I do something else?? I also plan to do some different classes. Thanks in advance.

I would recommend pilates at a pilates studio with pilates equipments. It works out your whole body and will tone it into long lean muscles versus weight machines will build short bulky muscles.

TWO words overall: Focus and confidence. I believe in you. I used to be fat but I joined my local gym and chose a subject at school that involved food and nutrition. Your teachers will give you valuable information too. To increase your agility and strength, stick to low GI foods such as fish, legumes, poultry and pasta. Protein is the main key to power and good carbohydrates are all about stamina. I could provide you will a diet schedule if you find this answer helpful enough. Cheers.Good luck! All the best!

What are some simple exercises? ?



i recently broke both my ankles (dont ask), so my movement is very limited for the next few months.



my cousins husband told me he gained 15-20 pounds when he broke his ankle, so im trying to avoid this.



been doing sit ups, the one where you lay on your back and fold your body in half. kind of like toe touches..... but on your back, and the one where you run, but on your back. like your riding a invisible bike upside down.



these are killing my back though. any other ideas would be really appreciated. maybe some kind of in place cardio.



i also thought of getting a wheel chair, but i live in mountain terrain so its some what impossible to get around in one

lie on the floor. now holding on to a chair raise both legs straight up in the air now swing them down until they are about 5cm from the ground. Repeat 10 times and do 3 sets. you can do this with a friend instead of a chair by grabbing your friends ankles.



another thing you can do is lie on the floor then raise your legs and oretend your riding a stationery bike in the air.

You really shouldn't fast. It's an unhealthy way to lose weight and you'll just end up gaining the pounds back. You can still lose weight just by eating 1,280-1,800 calories (depending on exercise) instead of the normal daily value of 2,200-2,500.



Skim milk has the full calcium of milk and is usually 60+ calories less. Yogurt is a good source as well.
Vegetables that you can eat as a snack (baby carrots, edamame, celery, etc.) are good and low caloric.
Just a handful of raw nuts (walnuts, almonds, pine nuts, etc.) can keep you full.

So people think starving themselves will make them lose weight but of course this is not the case.



If you're going to have smaller portions, make sure they are regular too. Going hungry, then eating and then going hungry again won't do you any good.



Also exercise when you can but don't over do it!

If you are trying to gain lean muscle mass, then protein is the ultimate supplement in order to accomplish this, because it supplies nutrients to the muscle fibers you tear down when you work out in order to re-build them.  Protein powder is usually a good resource because it is easy to digest and fairly inexspensive.  Hope this helps!

To gain weigt, its going to be a bit difficult as you are on a vegetarian diet. You need lots of meats, chicken etc, you know proteinous foods which are muscle building. You also need lots of carbs for energy because weight bearing exercises are no joke and require lots of energy if you are not carry it out efficiently.
Goodluck.

your silly you know.
go to this website:
http://www.whatsmybmi.com/
it calculates your body mass index (BMI)
it tells you whether or not you are a healthy weight and what your potential weight range is.
and you will quite clearly see that you are a healthy weight.
I have been a skinny person all my life. some people have even suggested that i have anorexia, but i dont. i have been trying to put on weight for year now. trust me once you do this.. its a long way back. and sometimes there is even no way back to the point were it is life threatening.
you must realise that if your exercising and eating healthy reguarly..
than that is the way your body is suppose to be!
go onto google images and type in anorexia? is that what you wanna look like?

your weight is perfect for your height.  the reason you're not losing anything is bc when your body is a perfect weight, it will naturally stop losing.  in other words, your body knows it's perfect, and isn't able to lose.

You just need to starve yourself to the extent where it's unhealthy. Although you requested for me not to write advice, you really shouldn't. There are plenty of ways to lose weight without effecting your long term health.



Just cut down on your eating. Moderation is the key, with any food.

Yes, all those foods are low GI foods which are sufficient in your diet to provide you with all sorts or nutrients such as Vitamin C and D and good source of protein and carbohydrates. But you need to balance your diet out with some poultry and meat. Stick to a limit of intake and you'll be extremely healthy. Good luck!

Yes and it is likely that your hair will become brittle because it isn't getting the vitamins, proteins, etc., that it needs to grow properly.  Try eating smaller portions of what you normally eat.  And see a doctor for a balanced diet.

if you only eat vegetables on your diet you will loose energy...
you will no longer had power to run your daily activities..
my best diet suggestion is..to reduce the amount of carbohydrates...
for e.g. eat potatoes that is stewed with any salt...
even if you eat vegetables don't over cooked it, or put any additional ingredients, because it will reduce the amount of vitamins and nutritions inside..
hope it will help, dont forget to exercise while you do your diet..

Of course you will. It contains zero fat! Depending on how long you undertake this diet it will inevitably end in you becoming very ill.



It's a bad idea.
Be sensible and eat a varied diet of healthy low fat foods and watch your portion sizes.
You don't need to starve yourself to loose weight.

Yes, very bad for you.  Starving your body makes it go into fat storing mode, so once you do eat, all that food is stored as fat.

Is may work right now, but it's not good for you and you may gain more weight later. When you don't eat when you're hungry, your body stores whatever it does get as fat because it doesn't know when it will get food again. You will hold on to your food longer, and your metabolism will slow down. When you do decide to eat something really bad or eat more again, you will actually gain weight and it will be harder to lose because of your metabolism. Just find a way to exercise regularly and eat several small healthy meals a day and you will lose it the right way and keep it off. Good luck!

What I suggest is... go to the gym everyday. Or go jogging, whichever you prefer. In order to lose weight healthily, you have to take that pain. Pain is good, it means you're working yourself and trust me it does work. Try doing a mile and a half on the treadmill (2.4), record your time, and next time, try to beat that.
Eat breakfast, lunch, and fruit in between. You don't have to cut out sugar completely, after a work out treat yourself to some chocolate. If you were working out hard enough you would have lost the calories from that choc already.
Then obviously keep having small meals until about 9/10pm.

Yes, it is bad. Starvation diets can have a terrible effect on your body as well as diet pills. 95% of all people who try fad diets and starvation techniques will gain all of that weight back in a year or two. Here are some of the lesser known side effects of this kind of diet:



* Weight gain.
* Depression.
* Food cravings.
* Feeling tired and listless.
* Constant hunger.
* Reduced interest in sex.
* Chronic fatigue.
* Hypothyroidism.
* Hormone imbalance.
* Scaly skin or eczema.
* Premature wrinkling of the skin.
* Dandruff or dull, lifeless hair.
* Mood swings.
* Chronic yeast infections.
* Poor immune system- frequent colds or respiratory illnesses.
* Digestive problems.

Here's what I found on line.



One answer
One meal a day is not enough to keep a person going. After a while, the body resists, goes into starvation mode, and holds on to body fat. If you want to lose weight and avoid yo-yo dieting, you should eat small meals throughout the day. This will improve your metabolism.
An additional answer
I am a Muslim. We fast in Ramadan. We wake up to have a meal before sunrise (which could be 3-4 o'clock in the morning), and don't eat all day, not even water until sunset (this can vary from 4 o'clock in winter to 9 o'clock in summer - like now). Last Ramadan started towards the end of September and lasted for one month. I lost one whole stone (14 pounds) that month from eating only one meal in the evening. Now its June, and have since put it back on because of eating burgers and crisps and chocolates and other junk. I will be started to eat one meal in the evening again tomorrow to lose the weight again. Healthy meals obviously.
Exercise helps. If you burn off 800 calories during the day when you are not eating, (I do this by jumping rope for 1 hour) and have a 300-400 calories meal - which is enough to fill you up in the evening. You have burned 400 excess calories that day, which add up over a week and help the weight come off. Of course, you can burn more calories and lose more weight.
An additional answer
Eating one meal per day will slow down your metabolism and eat away lean muscle mass. If you lose lean muscle instead of body fat, this will radically slow down your ability to lose weight in the future. Eating only one meal per day is also likely to encourage you eat junk food. By eating small frequent healthy meals and exercising, you will improve your metabolism and create lean muscle mass. Lean muscle in turn, further increases your metabolic rate.
Additional Answer
I've done both ways. I've lost weight the 'proper way' eating the 5-6 meals and working out like a fiend at the gym. As some have mentioned you will only have weight loss, when you calories burned, exceeds calories consumed. However, recently over 5 yrs of not having time for the gym, packed on 50lbs. And balloned up to 225. I tried the unhealthy approach of one meal a day, using coffee as my boost during the morning and day, and eating a sensible lunch. Heck even some of the dinners were not sensible. Me being a steak fanatic, I've had some monster porterhouses.
Now this said, I DID lose a lot of weight in a short time. In 30 days, I lost 35 pounds!! and for the most part my main exercise was brisk walking 3 miles. Some days twice. So for someone to say, a one day a meal doesn't work is wrong. If you have the luxury of time and the money for a gym membership, you can do it the 'correct way' and lost the same weight over 6 months or longer.
Admittedly, one day a meal is not for the weak willed. I think the big win for me, was going back to the mind set I had when I worked out, that eating was a function(boo-hoo, do I hear a chef crying), and not to be savored and enjoyed everytime with a greasy cheeseburger. And my dinner meals are ususally pretty moderate. Even try the subway thing on occassion, perhaps I'll be the next Jared.
Also, one last note, again to the naysayers testament. There are some moments durnig the diet, when I would have a cocktail or two at night to knock out early to ease the stomach pangs. And some of the walking sessions, were tough. But the body is amazing, it can adjust. Now I'm in the process of slowly upping the calories, to a maintenance phase. So far so good. No weight gain.
An additional answer
Well, I was going to try only eating once a day, but thanks to the answers that said DONT DO IT grabed my attention. I know when to listen, and I thank you for that. It just makes sence that the metabolism will slow down, and maybe I will get fatter. NO WAY! I only have 20 pounds to lose and I will try eating 5 to 6 meals a day and exercise and green tea. thanks again
An additional answer
In the long term, eating one meal per day will slow down your metabolism. This will make it much harder for you to lose weight in the future.
To lose excess body fat and to increase your metabolism, eat a meal about every three waking hours (5 or 6 meals per day). You will not be eating more food; you will simply be spreading it throughout the day. Each of those five or six feedings should contain at least 15 grams of unprocessed protein (from natural sources) for a female or at least 20 grams per feeding for a male.
This one change alone will speed up your metabolism and help to curb food cravings.
You can do more to boost your metabolism besides eating well.
For example, proper strength training will increase lean muscle. Lean muscle is your metabolic furnace that will burn extra energy (calories) 24 hours a day. Similarly, brisk walking for several miles daily will burn extra calories during and immediately after walks.

From what I've heard, most doctors say the same thing:



Our bodies are designed to function properly. They are designed to cleanse out toxins and keep our colons clean. Any "one-off" health solution like this (diets, colon cleansings, etc.) are designed to make money. If you REALLY want to keep your colon clean and your body running well, eat healthily, drink lots of water, and make sure you consume enough fiber every day.



If you still have questions, ask your doctor.

Imagine my surprise to come across a question about a product I've personally used.  I bought the Colonix colon cleanse program in addition to an herbal supplement that replenishes the local flora in your digestive system once you're done cleaning everything out.  A coworker of mine was constantly going on and on about his quarterly colon cleanses and some people swear by them.  I believe what the first guy said in part because I think when people eat the right stuff our bodies stay healthy but after years of putting the wrong stuff in it takes a really long time to get it out with help.



When you consider for a moment the things I saw coming out of my body when I used this product I would have to say that this is more than just a money maker.  My recommendation is that you do two rounds of Colonix if this is your first time and you're over thirty.  If you're not over thirty or close to it then you should be okay with just one round.  It's been almost a year since I used the product so I'm probably a little off on the amount in the containers you get but I'm pretty sure you get enough to do two courses should you wish to repeat the process.



The important thing is to follow the directions exactly and not make any substitutions to the treatment.  You might want to add a vitamin supplement if you're not taking one but don't detract from the program...and don't forget the tea.  Don't microwave the tea pouch IN the water...heat the water up and THEN add your tea bad and let it steep.  The longer it steeps the stronger it gets...but let it go for about five minutes...and squeeze out the water from the bags.  You won't regret it...it's very effective.

To lose weight you just have to eat healthy (lots of fruit and veg, 3 meals a day, snack of healthy foods if hungry) and do about an hours of exercise a day.
To maintain your weight eat about 1500 - 2000 calories (no more) and exercise about 3 times a week at least.
Hope that helps a bit.

Well no one on this site can give you a proper answer for that because none of us know your body type. BMI is not accurrate so we can't base it off of that. It depends on your body type, percentage of body fat, how much muscle you have, and what you want.
DO NOT make a particular weight to be a goal because if you are doing exercises your fat and muscles proportions will change and muscle weights more then fat.
I suggest that you find out your body fat percentage and set your goal to be in a healthy body fat range. Everyone has a different bone structure and amount of muscle so a weight to height can't work because everyone is built differently. I am 5 ft 5in and 160 lb andthing less then 145lb would not be practical for me because of my body type where as someone my exact same height and weight looks much heavier then I am. THere are even people that weight less then me that look heavier then me or more then me that look less them me. SO height to weight is not the answer.
Make sure you are eating a proper diet but don't debribe yourself of the things you like because then you will binge. Get some cardio activity in. Since you are young weight training is a not a very good idea so you are better off with calestetics (push ups, crunches, leg lifts, ect.) You can find many of them on different websites.
Your goal should be to look and feel fit and healthy and the suggestions above will help you to achieve that. You can feel free to contact me at any time and I can go further into details with you.

As a rule of thumb (not taking into account age, sex, lean muscle mass, etc.), your ideal weight can be determined by multiplying your inches over five feet by five and adding 100.  So, in your case, 4 times 5 = 20 + 100 = 120 as a goal weight.



Don't use a time factor for your goal.  Because you only need to lose 20 pounds, make "eating healthy" your goal and shoot for one pound a week.  Do this by cutting about 250 calories out of your diet each day and burning off another 250 calories through exercise (daily walks, bike rides, etc.).  If you do this and lose the weight this way, it will stay off and you will learn healthy habits for life which will help ensure that you don't have chronic weight problems.  When you set a time factor, you're setting yourself up for disappointment and failure.  Your body will lose the weight in it's own natural time with your assistance.



This page can help you learn what "eating healthy" is all about.  Good luck!

DONT set a weight loss goal.  Weight isn't important.  It's how your body looks.  A girl might be 5'3" and weigh 120 pounds because she's muscular.  The best way to lose weight is not to diet.  Cut out all soda, candy, and junk food.  DONT EAT ANY.  This works for me.  I'm 5'2" and weigh 97 lbs.  The main thing is soda.  My friend is fat, no offense, and she eats little.  The main thing is she drinks soda instead of water.  Stick to water and you'll be fine.  Remember, health foods rock in the end!

I cannot complete all set of exercises in gym as I feel fatigue, what to do ?



I have joined gym primarily due for weight loss. I joined around 3 months back when I weighted 214lbs and now I weight 189lbs. I follow cardio and weight training alternate days. From whatever set of exercises I have been asked I always leave 2 exercises .



these set of exercises what I work on besides the warmups



01.front press pulley
02.bench press pulley
03.dumbbell biceps curling
04.dumbbell triceps curling
05.barbell biceps curling
06.barbell triceps curling
07.barbell rowing



I usually leave barbell rowing and front press pulley because I get exhausted with remaining exercises , I cannot push myself but later I feel bad of not working out 100% what I am meant too.



How should I tackle my problem ? and complete all set of exercises without feeling fatigue ?

One way to get rid of your fatigure is to stay hydrated. Make sure to drink something before, during, and after workout. Also, are you eating anything before workout? Your body will need certain carbs for energy. You need a mix of simple and complex carbs before, and simple carbs after a workout. Your simple carbs would be something like fruit, something with sugar, or baked potato. Complex carbs would be like cereal, toast, something like that. These tips should surely help get rid of your fatigue.



Also, sometimes listening to music while working out can help motivate you to keep on going.

While doing exercises, the primary rule is you should not over exert. You should know your capacity and then venture. Otherwise it will lead to complications. Pick up gradually. Leaving one or two exercises is not going to matter at all.

you seem to just be doing mainly arm exercises- this is why you are fatiguing quicker than planned. you are supposed to mix it up, for example you seem to be doing circuit training so start with one set of dumbells, then do sit ups, then squats, then go back to arms. if you keep up working the same muscles over and over the lactic acid will consume alot more than hoped (this is what increases the rate of fatigue). so basically, mix it up, that way you can fit more in!

Everyone likes a small waist! Whether it's the 'hourglass' for women, or the 'V' for men, it involves  tapering at the waist.
For the chest- used to pull the arm in at the shoulder: pec flyes,  the benchpress(incline, flat and decline) and the pushup must be included.
The back has 2 main muscles, which, if exercise, will exercise all the other muscles as well.
The lats (latissimus dorsi)- Used to pull the arms down, pull back with hands at navel level. Do pullups, bent-over rows, 1-arm dumbell rows, dips.
Traps(trapezius)- Used to retract, lift or depress the shoulder blades.
Especially retract, so focus on rowing at chest level e.g upright row, high cable row,reverse flye.
Overhead/military presses are good too.
For waist, crunches, planks and swiss-ball rotations work well.
Good luck!

Nope, not bad at all.  What have I always been telling you? Lol.  Upon awakening and post-workout are two times of day glycogen is depleted from the muscles and liver, so insulin spikes caused by rapid rising in blood sugar levels will cause glycogen to be stored in the liver and muscle, as opposed to adipose tissue.



This is because as long as the muscles and liver are not sufficient in glycogen deposits, that is where glycogen will be stored.  If you want to have "bad" carbohydrates, post-workout and upon awakening are the time to do it.  The carbohydrates are needed to replenish glycogen depleted from the muscles and liver to bring up energy levels again.



Edit: The sugars from carbohydrates is the same, carbohydrates all break down to glucose.  It is only the source of the carbohydrates that can differ.  After a workout, the carbohydrates from cake are fine.  Unless the muscles and liver already have sufficient glycogen, the glucose gets stored as glycogen in the muscles and liver.



If not, the glucose gets stored as glycogen in adipose tissue.  After a workout glycogen from the muscles and liver is depleted, so it is essentially fine to consume carbohydrates from cake post-workout.  The downside is that there are other ingredients that aren't too healthy in cake, but it is negligible if you eat junk food now and then.



Edit: If the meal had a really large amount of carbohydrates then glycogen was still depleted from the muscles and liver (although not as much as if you weren't to have a high carb meal pre-workout), so your muscles and liver still probably didn't have as much glycogen as they should, so the cake should be fine.

If you had to pick any time of the day to have cake after your workout would be the best, because that's when carbs and sugar are least likely to be stored as fat as they are stored to replenish some glycogen. Of course you wouldn't want to do this everyday but if you're lifting heavy and have it it's not gonna make a difference.

Your idea of sugars providing some energy for fuel is almost correct. The sugar from the cake is not the right type for that..that will mostly go as fat storage...don't panic though it's not a lot as long as you didn't eat a lot or continue to (just have a piece cause you can't resist) believe me I know it's tough. The body will convert the right foods to the proper sugar for an energy source...and I can say...it's not cake.

You can eat anything anytime you want in moderation!  I assume you didn't eat the whole cake?  What your goals are makes a big difference.  If you want to lose weight, watch how much you are eating and what you are taking away to make up those calories.  If you are just trying to stay fit or build muscle, I don't see how a few sweets (that running probably raises your metabolism enough for the hours afterward to burn off) are going to hurt as long as the rest of your diet is balanced.

Well mate, it isnt clean food... but you know, a little indiscretion here and there isn't going to set you back either. That bit of cake is prolly about 700-1000 Calories.. which is 45 minutes on an exercise bike.



Yes, directly after a workout is probably the best time to be indiscrete about what you eat.. but you know.. building muscle needs good nutrition so it's all about what you put in your mouth.

walking helps a lot. i lost quite a bit from walking. if you have a dog, maybe take him/her for a walk to your nearest park.



stopping snacking when you're bored is a help and eating healthy meals.



don't go on diets because they don't necessarily work.



don't do any muscle workouts as they build up your muscle and don't get rid of fat.



hope this helps :)

Eat much less meat and sugar, and much less fat. A woman needs only 20 grams of fat a day so count the fat grams on anything you eat and don't go over 20. Fruits, veggies, legumes, and grains are very very low in fat. You can eat all you want and loose weight.

Have diet control. I mean regulated timely food. Have quality vegetarian food without much oil or gravy. Reduce fat content in your food. Take enough water.



Exercise at least for twenty minutes in the morning and twenty minutes in the evening. Or get involved in some physical game like football, volley ball, tennis, badminton, etc. Otherwise walking is a must. Or learn some Yoga exercises.

hi.



You need to lose some kg, so you have to make small changes to your nutrition habits.



Some physical activity will help you too.
I suggest you:
1) Do cardio - 30 min or less 4 times a week;



2) Eat more foods with your breakfast and less with your dinner;



3) Eat less carbos and fats and more protein;



there are so many weight loss tips, which can help you. Good thing is that they are already organized here: http://bodyfitwork.com/weight-loss-tips/...

As someone else said, most natural foods consumed in moderation are healthy.  Most food bars are junk in that they have too many carbs/sugar or the protein is made from collagen which our bodies don't absorb well when consumed.  Additionally, lots of low fat foods
substitute sugar for taste, so the decrease in fat/calories is deceptive compared to what effect they have on fat storage.



One issue to consider is nutrient density.  Many cereals are touted as heart healthy because they have little to no saturated fat & they contain fiber.  Problem is, most of the cereals manufactured by Post, Kellogg's, & other brands are loaded with sugar, which itself is not heart healthy.  The meager amount of fiber doesn't negate the sugar content (each gram of fiber blunts 1 gram of other types of carbohydrates, such that your body secretes slightly less insulin- which can be a fat storing hormone).  Likewise, bagels & muffins aren't that healthy compared to other sources of fiber.  Fruits with equivalent caloric/carbohydrate content would offer more nutrition via phytochemicals that fight cancer & such.



With that said, fruits can be unhealthy when consumed in *massive* smoothies.  We can't physically eat as much liquid as we can swallow.  Additionally, liquid carbs are absorbed twice as quickly as solid carbs, causing a more rapid insulin spike (increasing the likelihood that they will be stored as fat).



The best things tend to be the closest ones to their naturally occurring state.



------
To add to what has been written, yes, I think having 5 apples (22 grams of carbs per medium apple) & 2 carrots (8 grams each) would be too many carbs for most people in a single sitting.  Altogether, that would be 126 g of carbs, which could act like much more in its juice state.  That's over a third of the RDA for carbs (300 g) from a single smoothie.  Good nutrients in those foods, but too many carbs (& perhaps fiber) in a single shot, possibly contributing to diarrhea & consequent malabsorption of what you just consumed.  If you exercised intensely, you might be able to handle around 60-80 carbs in post workout meal without gaining fat.



Here's a good start: a hand sized portion of meat (assuming you're not vegetarian), a medium apple, & a 7 in carrot or hand sized equivalent of broccoli crowns would be a balanced meal.  That would give you adequate protein, fat, carbs, fiber, plus a multitude of vitamins, minerals, & phytochemicals.  Never consume carbs on their own; always eat them with protein & fat.  Balance your meals to include sufficient sizes from every food group.



There are portion strategies that can help you without putting in much effort.  Instead of 3 meals a day, you could break them into 5 small meals a day, getting the same nutritional benefit while lowering the likelihood of storing some of the calories as fat.  This lowers overall insulin secretion & makes it work more efficiently.



Shopping in the right sections of the store can give you good food ideas.  The periphery of the store generally has the best real foods (fruits, vegetables, meat, chicken, fish, cheese, yogurt, etc.).

SlimFast shakes and bars.  The bars' first ingredient is sugar - not something that will help you lose weight. All pre-made protein shakes also contain soy.



So I have to say it - soy.  It's touted as a health food and it is NOT. A lot of women feel tired and their doctor's chalk it up to menopause, when really the soy in their diet is hurting their thyroid and making them tired. It happened to me.



Bread and rice and potatoes - okay in moderation but too many people base their diet on these things and become overweight as a result. Some get diabetes. I no longer eat these rice or potatoes and 100% whole wheat bread only once a week.

moderation is really important.
make your portion sizes smaller and eat more frequent through out the day.
A lot of people think Nuts are really good for you, but a very small amount of nuts has A LOT of calories in it. You would be surprised. Also Granola cereal... its like 350 calories a cup with out milk. So watch out for those.
Also dairy products like cheese. Cheese is really bad for you, really fattening. Don't put cheese on your sandwich you'll be saving 140 calories for not putting on 2 slices.
and drink skim milk if you drink milk.
Best of Luck! :)

This is a great question. Soy is probably number 1 on the list. What they don't tell you is that soy beans contain goitrogens which MUST be fermented before eating. Asian countries eat fermented soy foods like tempeh and miso and they eat roughly two teaspoons of soy per day not truck loads as we all think. Plus they also eat a lot of ocean foods like fish and seaweed which contain iodine . This would counterbalance the suppressant effect on the thyroid. The thyroid of course controls our metabolism and our ability to burn calories!



Low fat foods are unhealthy. Your body has a great need for saturated fat and cholesterol and contrary to popular belief there is actually no documented studies out there that prove the correlation between saturated fats and cholesterol to heart disease.
Regarding weight, if you go to the supermarket, you will notice a whole array of low or no fat foods but all the DIET foods contain no carbohydrates or sugar. This is because sugar which also comes from carbohydrates is turned into fat at a faster rate than any other macronutrient (protein and fats). The food industry is well aware of the fact that fatty foods are NOT the culprits. All farm animals are fed only grains for a few weeks before slaughter to fatten them up. Pigs given skim milk as opposed to whole milk will get fat.



Cholesterol is vital! Without it you die and when levels drop low enough you get sick. Our livers have an enzyme which controls the rate of cholesterol production by our bodies. Meaning, if we halve our intake of cholesterol containing foods, our liver senses this drop and immediately increases the production of cholesterol by our bodies. The more cholesterol containing foods one eats, the less the body has to produce and vice versa.



Cholesterol lowering drugs (statins) work by blocking this enzyme so when you lower your food intake of cholesterol, your body is unable to produce the rest that is needed and this results in lower blood levels which evidently causes a false security of lowering your risk of heart disease.



Too much fruit. The fruits these days are all hybrids and bred for size and sugar content only. Most fruits are picked unripe when their nutrient contents are low and are then later gassed to ripen them. Also, fruits contain a sugar called fructose which is metabolised differently than other sugars. It is sent straight to the liver where, if not immediately burned for energy will turn straight into FAT!. This is well documented. Look it up search fructose/dangers/fat...and you will find quotes like this:



"Research from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in Baltimore, Maryland, shows fructose is more lipogenic (fat forming) than any other sugar or starch. "



Low Carb diets. Also not very healthy. If carbohydrates are restricted to a low enough level the body produces ketones which makes the body very acidic which is what happens to diabectics when they overshoot their insulin requirements. This is an emergency. Ketones are produced as a result of incomplete fat burning and are used by the central nervous system as a "back-up" fuel when sugar levels are low. You are not actually burning fat, because sugar is needed to completely burn fat for energy in cells. This is a fact.



Keep it simple and have everything in moderation. Even alcohol. Don't vilify the fats and know that eating them won't make you fat. I believe its the other way around actually.

Diet alone won't get you results. If you really want to lose this much weight in very little time then I'm afraid the weight loss boot camp is the way to go...



But if you feel that your workouts is enough, then a low carbohydrates, and high protein diet is usually the way to go and have fruits or yogurt for snacks so you'll maximize your metabolism.



Also, try to never miss breakfast. Imagine your body is a car, for it to run it needs gas. Our bodies need fuel to burn those calories. If you skip breakfast (1st meal) then your body won't have enough fuel through the day to burn calories. How is it important? Imagine our metabolism is an ice cream cone - the type that has a tip on the bottom. Our metabolism is exactly like it. Our metabolism is at highest in the morning and eventually slows down as the day ends. You need to take advantage of that by providing your body enough fuel to burn stored calories when your metabolism is at its highest (in the morning).



You see a lot of healthy grains in people's diet because it makes you feel fuller longer so you don't eat much. It also helps to cleanse the body - thus making people more likely to go to the toilet more than those who don't eat them.



Oh, and probably the most important thing is to drink LOTS and LOTS of water everyday (lay off the pop, alcohol, and anything you get in fast food restaurants). Sometimes, we are just thirsty and we mistake thirst for being hungry then we eat more when we have to.



Also, keep away from diet pills. Some just increases your heart rate so you burn calories faster even when standing still .. that's dangerous as some cases could lead to heart failures and such.



Keep in mind that what I've said are just tips. They're not guidelines. Checking with your doctor first though would be more responsible. Good Luck  and I hope you achieve your goals. Take care!

Try sit-ups and crunches.
If your slim your tum will always naturally stick out a little bit after a meal but this will only be short term.

Dont worry about your tummy after you have eaten this is a normal bodily response, sit ups are great but you could always try doing them a lot slower than normal, not just up and back down, try to hold them for about 10 seconds half way up and same with back down, increase it after you abs stop aching to 20 seconds, and upwards, just remember that your stomach will need room for the food to digest so dont go pushing yourself especially straight after a meal, hope this helps, goodluck! :)

No. If you're only 13 and your height is only 5'2, that's bad. You should exercise, the normal weight for a 13 year old girl who is only 5'2 is 100. Maybe, you're a little bit chubby. I thought, in your question, you were asking if a 141 year-old man is a good age for a 13 year old girl, I almost said he could be your great grandfather. Anyways, are you eating a lot? If you don't take a proper diet, you'll get fat, and that may lead to diabetes or obesity.

I'd agree with Bobz for session time (~45min; the quicker the harder, therefore better) and times to work a muscle group per week (~2-3; need 36-72 hours of rest), but I have to disagree with muscle groups per session.



Split training works, granted, but is needlessly complicated for most people. You have to be careful you arn't doubling up on a muscle group (e.g.: monday- chest, tuesday- triceps/shoulders =BAD) and you need to visit the gym just about every day. Doing a total body workout 3 days a week is equally effective, and just simpler. You can easily complete a good total body session in about 45minutes. If you're spending much more time then that, you just arn't working hard enough.



Again, they both work, so pick the one that works best for your temperament and schedule.

It all depends on your body type, but the best work out for an average person should take 30-45 minutes, and you should do it at least 3 times a week. I would not hit more than 2 groups together. For example :



Back+ Chest  / Legs + Shoulders / biceps + triceps.

Well my mum is 52 and does body combat, she is one of the fittest people in her class and that's because she has never stopped challenging herself. She has also just qualified as a gym instructor and kettlebell trainer.



Your friends are talking absolute rubbish. I imagine they are not into fitness themselves otherwise they'd know it's very important to keep your cardio fitness levels up especially as you get older. People don't get out of shape because of age, they get out of shape because they stop challenging themselves.



So when your friends get in their 40's and you are in your 50's and way fitter than them, they might want to take a leaf out of your book!



P.S. And remember, it's also important to do strength training and weight lifting for building muscle and improving bone density.

i'm trying to shape up because i feel like i could be slimmer.
my wrists, knees, and elbows are really thin and bony..
is this how i'm naturally supposed to be?

no fried food, sugar, or something that looks gross. organic things [fruit vegies n stuff] works good. look at the nutrients in the package or wherever it is. look on google and read a couple links about the vitaminA/B/C protien and calcium purposes/benefits. it helped me a lot.

Ephdra and Ephedrine Alkaloids?



Ephedra, Sida Cordifolia and Ma Huang (ephedra in Chinese) are the natural herbs which contain the active ingredient Ephedrine Alkaloids.  This is why it is very important to look at the amount of alkaloids when seeking an Ephedra diet.



What overweight women and men have learned is that for years virtually every professional bodybuilder, informed fitness expert and successful personal trainer would tell you the same thing. Whether you want to accelerate the burning of excess body fat, boost your metabolic rate, heighten your thermogenic output or increase your energy level, there is nothing stronger or more effective than the "thermogenic cocktail" of Ephedra, Caffeine, and Aspirin (The E/C/A- Stack").

Weight watchers ginger and lemon cookies.



A slice of rye bread.



And by "healthier" I don't mean  lowest in calories.

Anything is healthier than white bread, but you could try wholemeal if you get sick of eating rye bread as it doesn't have much taste.

Breads prepared from finely grounded flour (wheat /rye) r never healthier. U should always prefer BROWN BREAD.That is the healthiest.
Forget about cookies & pastries.They r harmful in long run.

There is this stuff you can buy called Weight Gain. It comes in a powder and you just mix it with water. It's like a shake, it comes in vanilla and chocolate. That works pretty well.

I struggle with gaining weight too. In order to gain weight you need to eat 5 to 6 times a day and increase your calories.



It takes 3500 calories to gain 1 pound. Your friend should try adding an extra 300 - 500 calories per day and she needs to take it slow. This usually adds about 1-2 pounds per week. When she sees that she's not gaining weight anymore, she needs to increase the calories again by 300-500 per day.  Keep doing this until she's at the weight she wants.



It's also important to incorporate some kind of physical activity. It doesn't have to be strenuous, she needs more strength and resistance training, not too much cardio.



If she's already eating 3 meals a day, she can add a couple of snacks. And don't listen to all the dieters out there. When someone needs to gain weight they also need to increase their fat intake. Not junk food but healthy food. Nuts are a great source of healthy fats and protein and so is red meat. Shakes and smoothies are good too!



A dietician/nutritionist once told me to eat all the food that overweight people cannot eat but do it in moderation.



Hope this helps.



p.s. Drink whole milk, not skim or 2%.

First off, don't over do your exercising, or else you'll get weaker instead of stronger. Be sure to eat more healthy foods and less junk food, that will help your muscles get the proper nutrients they need. Don't worry if you dont seem to be getting anywhere because you are twelve and you have years to work up to the strength you want. my best advice would be to not over work yourself, cuz that would be reallly bad for you.

Find yourself a personal heart rate monitor, it comes with a chest band, to record the information and then sends it to a wrist watch.



Most decent brand heart rate monitors can also transfer the information onto the display of the machine you are using.



You know this will be accurate because you program you stats into the watch before hand, so it knows your body type and age, then by reading your heart rate will calculate exactly the amount of calories burned.

Healthy weight loss tips
http://weightlossweightloss.blogspot.com...



Strength training and aerobic exercise --Aerobic exercise burns a lot of calories, Strength training increases metabolism by increasing lean muscle mass which helps in long term weight loss.



Eat fruits and vegetables --Increase your intake of fiber rich foods
They are low in calories but high in fiber. Fiber is digested slower, keeps us feeling fuller longer



Eat breakfast everyday --



Eat smaller, more frequent meals--



Replace white rice, bread, and pasta with brown rice and whole-grain products--



Drink more water--Water suppresses the appetite naturally and helps the body metabolize stored fat.



Increase your protein intake--Protein makes us feel full. It is also important in replacing and building muscle tissue. More muscles burn more fat. It helps to increase your metabolism - which burns calories.



Do not skip meals--Skipping meals makes you hungry which you tend to compensate by eating a lot later.



Spice up your food--Spices boosts metabolism, suppresses appetite, reduce fat absorption



Eat Negative calorie food --Negative calorie foods are foods, which use more calories to digest than the calories the foods actually contain.



Take the stairs and park your car further away from the shops--



Eat slowly--Chewing your food longer will help prevent you from over eating.



Cut down the sugar intake---

Losing that much weight in 29 days won't matter because you could wind up in the hospital. Go buy some Spanx if you are worried about your stomach. Many people wear them to give a more flattering line. You are not too heavy at all. You might want to think more positively about yourself.
