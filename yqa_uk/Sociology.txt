the term Generation Y was originally derived from the children of the War Generation ( those born in the 1940's) these were termed W-Generation their children Generation X and their Children Generation Y and so on.

although this has now taken  on a 20 year periods with their arbitrary dates and descriptive texts.

Generation Z 2001 -2020  (new millennium or Internet Generation)
Generation Y 1981- 2000



(min baby boom)
Generation X 1961 - 1980  (baby boomer)
Generation W 1941 - 1960 (war generation)

Well it's cool to pass time, but I never would want to get addicted to it. I rather spend time actually meeting people in person, through different social events and with friends. People can be whoever they want on the internet and of course it's entertaining but I don't want to live too much of my life through the screen. You know just spend a couple of hours than go do other things or get some other hobbies you can balance the two it's nothing to be ashamed of.

I've never visited facebook, so thanks for the tip.  If it's just so crap, what have they done to your brain to make you want to keep coming back?

Pluck that out and you'll be back to normal again.  Back in the really bonkers world with the rest of us.

Trick is to not let the loonies take over the asylum - i sometimes wonder if they have!!!  you get that sometimes?
