I remember the first time i missed the bus.  I was talking to my friend and we didn't even realize that everyone else had left, so when we stopped talking and saw that it was ONLY the two of us in the cafeteria, we kinda freaked out.  But looking back on it, it's hysterical.

Sweetie, don't stress. Look, I'm 15 and hate school too, because of all the bitching that happens. I have been through so much with girls spreading rumours about me, bullying and as if that wasn't enough, exam stress. Whenever you feel down, go to your friends and if it's really serious, talk to a school counsellor about it. I can't wait til I finish school and go to college (I heard things are less bitchy there). Just remember that school is only a couple of years but your career will last and affect the rest of your life, so stick at the hard work hunnie and it will pay off
hope that helps. please email me if you need more help or someone to talk to--x

I usually just try to ignore the things i dislike and focus on the things i DO like. I'm sure all of you have at least one fun friend in school right?

I've been homeschooled for awhile and let me tell you, as fun as it sounds, it's extremely BORING. School is allot more fun because there are actually guys there, and your parents aren't your teachers. Ever had a parent as a teacher? Let me tell you, its not fun. Enjoy school. You have to learn not to care about what other people think about you. In a couple of years you won't ever see them again, so who cares? Being homeschooled is way worse than school ever was. You'd think it'd be easier, but it's not. It's allot more stressful having to worry about grading your own freakin tests and quizzes. (Yeah like your parents are going to do it by themselves) Plus it gets lonely :(

How old are you? You can go to college at age 14, it is unusual but with the new diplomas starting it will become more common.

If you were ding GCSE''s at college you would probably be with a class of 17 year olds who didn't get the grades or you could be with adult learners.

I too wanted to be home schooled, I hated school so much so I can understand how you feel.

You need to talk to someone and see exactly what your options are.

how old are you?
i'm 15 and my mother bought my school skirt for next year today
i havent been in for one day since te start of these holidays
ive met a load of new people
had a load of great days
got myself a boyfriend
and life is really looking up

i tried it on and actually had some kind of breakdown
i understand exactly how you feel.
that was around 6ish... i haven't spoken to anyone since then 'cos i felt too miserable...it's half 1 in the morning where i am

the thing is that if you're anywhere near my age, there's actually less than a year left for me now
i've messed up my GCSEs
and i'm failing
i'm way behind everyone else because even the idea of going to that place stops me from sleeping and turns me into some irritating teenager instead of the average human being i normally am...

my advice to you is to just stick it out
i know that sounds crappy but life carries on and the thing is that the happier you can force yourself to believe you are, the easier it is for you to carry on and be triumphant in the end and get on with your life

I really feel for you, its like reading my daughters thoughts, she is exactly the same as you very shy and not at all outgoing.  I tell her be true to yourself and people will be drawn to you because you are quiet I know some girls are prettier and more popular but believe me and i'm talking from experience those girls as they get older either loose face with people in school or people realise what bitches they are and ditch them.



I was shy at school but as you get older, confidence grows and never let anyone put you down, your as good as them, if not better, so don't let them ruin your grades and there'll be some great friends to be made in future years.

Try and just be yourself, i know its easier said than done, but that is the only advice i can give. If people really like you then you will find true friendship with them and if they don't, then, do you really want to hang round with people like that? If you find you are struggling to fit in, or they are giving you some hassle or whatever, just imagine them sat on the toilet straining to open their bowels! hahahaha, my teacher told my brother that when he used to get intimidated by other kids at school and it worked, cos no matter how cool or clever or smart people are, we all look stupid on the toilet! hahahaha.

If the friends you have now are "sure" to ditch you, they can't be very good friends can they?

Not every girl in your year is nasty or a snob, surely?! Have you tried talking to girls in other years?



I understand what you are going through though. School can be a very lonely place at times. Just remember, you are a good person and don't feel like you have to change who you are to fit in or to make friends. Concentrate on your school work and don't let things get in the way of doing well. I know sitting next to someone you don't know might feel uncomfortable, but you never know, they might be really nice and you may end up making friends with them. The same principle goes for when your classes change and you will be with new people. When I was at school the same thing happened, and while I didn't really like it at first, I found that I was making friends with people I didn't know before, and that was a good thing.



I really hope all goes well. Just smile and try to be positive about it.

if your current friends are worth having they will stick around, if they don't then they don'tdeserve to be friends with you. i struggled to make friends at school because i was chronically shy but i joined one after school club and having a common interest is a real ice breaker. hope things go well this term and try not to worry!

Don't care too much about what your classmates think of you, just be yourself.  I'm shy at my school too and find that it's best just to ignore their criticism.  You can hang around with whoever you want, just remember that after your done with school you'll probably never see these people again.



One way to feel confident about this year is to think that everyone else dreads going back to school too.

Okay, try one on one friend. Like, invite a friend or a person that you do not like and try like having them over and stuff. Remember, only you and the friend. You can do that and they will realize you are still a great friend and they could still be friends with you.

Hope this helps!

your  school should have a list of needed supplies, it will be different for every school. Try looking up the school website. I would think the basic things you would need would be:

notebook paper
pencils 
pens
highlighters
folders (some require the kind that have prongs, other schools only let you use pocket folders)
spiral notebooks

my son is going into 8th grade this year and he also had to have
a calculator
printer paper
envelopes
postcard stamps (don't ask me??)
and composition notebooks

every school is different and you really need to find out what your school requires.

You should have 2 binders.
One for the morning, one for the afternoon (it's a lot easier)
Dividers
pencils and pens obviously
probably white out.
a folder for homework would come in handy, so you don't have to bring your binders home everynight.

I used to think finding binders that lasted a whole year was a lost cause. I would get binders and they would break within the first few months, sometimes even the first few weeks of school!

However, two years ago I tried Staples brand 3 ring binders and every single one of them lasted the whole year without ever breaking!

I am not sure if you have a Staples near you or where you live, but I will give you the link to the website so just in case, you could try ordering it online.

It is called the "better binder" D ring.
The D ring is important because it is the kind that will not break, due to the way they designed it. It also will not make it hard for you to turn pages unlike many other binders that try and solve the breaking rings problem.



Also, I should note that they come in various different colors too you are not limited to just black, like it shows in the link.

Has anyone ever heard of school phobia?



one of my friends claims she has it. i've tried several times to get her to go to school, even showing up at her house. she says that she doesnt know why but she just cant get herself to go and when it comes down to the second of someone telling her she needs to get up and go she has a panic attack. her mom, every morning, has hours fights with her but she just starts crying hyrterically and hyperventalating. she says she can't explain exactly how she feels, but she swears it just not because she's lazy and doesn't feel like going. she's talked to her school councler, but her school isnt the best and isn't tying to do too much to get her going. i dont know what to do, but i'm so scared shes this is going to ruin her furture. she's a senior in highschool and is behind in many many creddits because of this "school phobia" and a few other reasons. i don't really even know how shes a senior this year but when she does go to school she works very hard and makes up all her work. if anyone has heard of this could you explain more? could  you suggest anything i could do to help?

I experienced this but it wasn't necessarily 'school' phobia it was more of a 'sociophobia'. I had panic attacks every day. I had many panic attacks in school because you feel trapped. You have to sit in a class room for hrs at a time and to get out of it you have to ask for permission, you have to raise your hand and ask in front of the whole class room or get up and walk up to the teacher and ask. These things may seem like no-brainers to you or to most people but when you have a phobia you can NOT function normally. I couldn't even go to a  store like Target because the isles are too big and there's people coming 'at you' from every angle, from everywhere. I couldn't go inside a small convenience store either. When I had to I would mentally map out my way in and out and it was terrible. I took the city bus back then so waiting at the bus stop was very uncomfortable since there were a lot of  cars passing by. Walking home from the bus stop was a dread as well. I could not cope with it. By the time I would get to my home I would lock myself in my room and cover my face under the blankets and just cry my heart out. I wanted to cover my face even as I was locked in my room. I didn't want anyone to see me. Driving was very hard for me also, many times I had to get out of the freeway and park. Maintaining a job was hard also because the scenerio just changed from 'school' to 'work' but the phobia remained the same. I had the worse sociophobia ever. You also become extremely sensitive to light. Your senses are more sensitized. I did not have an understanding family so it was even more difficult for me. I would lock myself in my room for days at a time. I avoided school. I couldn't even sit in the kitchen table and eat because of my family members around. I couldn't sit in the living room and watch TV with my family because I could see everything with such intensity: my brother scratching his head, someone blinking, someone getting up, I was terrified in my seat when I did try to socialize with them. As I write this I realize how delusional I sound but that's how my reality was. I got on Paxil and then Paxil CR (control release). Both are pills to treat sociophobia. Weather your friend wants to go on meds or not is a whole other issue but she can try therapy, there's a lot of books on Sociophobia and panic attacks. A good one is "From Panic to Power" by Lucinda Bassett. You seem like a concerned friend, pick a book for her trust me she'll appreciate it a whole lot! The book is going to seem like the Bible seems to religious people for her! It's truly going to be helpful. Also there are some natural pills she can take, sort of like vitamins, they're called Saint John's Worth and they are for mental well being. Also if she has a good diet with lots of veggies she is going to feel better, she needs all the vitamins she can get to have a better chemical balance in her brain and also her body. Other things to look into are meditation and yoga. 
Also check her arms. Make sure she is not cutting herself. I know it sounds terrible but I know quite a few  people with sociophobias and panic attacks that use that as a way to release their anger for not being able to cope with life and face 'school'. If you do check her arms don't be obvious about it. Just look at her arms but make sure she doesn't see you do it. You don't want to give her ideas either. 
I hope this helped. I am ok now. I took paxil for 7 yrs. I am able to function normally for the most part lol. I have been off of paxil for years. I am able to go on top of a stage now and start dancing. I enjoy doing this very much it gives me a sense of freedom that I know I once was unable to experience. I have had steady employment since getting out of high school. I graduated from high school. I did some college. She'll get out of this. She'll be ok. She's lucky to have a friend like you. Also look up support groups in your area. I joined a support group as well to help me in my journey to recovery.

I love my friends and my teachers. The discipline in the school - walking in lines, being tidy and wearing clean shoes and clothes... all these things would be remembered when we go to college. Hanging out with friends , eating in canteen - its totally fun

38 single mom of two kids, just been laid off . I want to go to school. Is it possible to collect unemployment?



I live in Washington state and am planning on filing for unemployment since I was laid off due to lack of work. This would be my first time ever doing this and wanted to know if I decided to go to school to learn a new trade in a couple of months. Would I still be able to collect unemployment.? I searched the WA state unemployment website, but I wonder if anyone has first hand experience.

Several years ago I was laid off for a similar reason and the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation paid my tuition to attend college for 2 years as a re-training effort. This was in a different state than Washington, but I should think that would be a similar policy/option in all states.



Good luck! Hang in there! :)

Thank you for the reply. I will definately look into that. I read on the WA state UE site saying that you can take up to 12 credits to still qualify but over 12 is full time, which they say will disqualify you. I have a couple of semesters where I will be 2 credits over. I really appreciate the info

I live in Washington State as well.
I would assume that if you were to go to college, you would still qualify for unemployment. I do have to admit though that I have not read anything officially about it yet, because I have not had to file for unemployment.

However, I would assume that if you were going to college it would be to help yourself get a new job, but would not qualify as being employed, therefore you are still without a job and should be able to qualify for unemployment. :)

Realistically very few will win an appeal, you will need to have a very strong case to do so.

Put together your facts - make sure you can back them up.  My neighbours girl has won her appeal to get into the local school on the basis of her asthma.  The school is closer to home,  she can walk, and not two bus journeys and an hour and a half journey like the school she was allocated.  Her GP and consultant at the hospital both wrote on her behalf.

Put forward your best case - back it up if you can and then keep your fingers crossed.

Good Luck

OK, its a bit sneaky but when I went for appeal I said that it was the school that all my daughters friends were going to and that she had had a really mixed up life at home and that she enjoyed school and felt stable there and that if she didnt go to the school she wanted with her friends that I felt it would mentally damage her.

Is there any where I could learn these things?



Today I looked at my theory test C.D ROM for driving and the test report I looked at gave me the lowest percentage for Traffic signs, car control, pedestrians and mechanic knowledge.



</question>



<additional details>



P.s I have a high way code book for the road signs. Is there any websites that I could read infomation of.



The reason I get stuck with car control is because I am in an atomatic, but the test sometimes asks what to do in a manual car. I am clueless what you would do in a manual car most of the time when these questions come up.

Hi Louise,
Learn to drive in manual gearbox, automatic is not how you learn to drive.
The items in high way code, are obvoice, just drive safely and have respect for other road users.
Unfortunatly, people that have passed their test, have little respect for others, which is why there are so many deaths on our roads.
Regards and best of luck.
