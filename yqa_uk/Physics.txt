Tap a crystal surface with something like the bottom of a spoon. It will ring like a bell.  Ordinary glass will give a dull thud.  An expert can tell the quality of crystal by this sound.

It's not theoretically possible to travel faster than the speed of light, which is time travel. So no, it's not possible according to current knowledge in science.

If humans could find a way of traveling faster than the speed of light, we could reach a planet, then look behind us in time to see ourselves arriving.

It is possible and supported by what we currently know about physics. The problem is that we can only travel to the future. The theory of relativity states that anything approaching the speed of light will slow down, and so the faster something moves, the slower it will age, and so by going extremely fast for even a few seconds, it will appear as if you've been gone for a much longer time, which is basically traveling to the future. However, I don't believe traveling to the past is possible.

You would be traveling through time if you were sucked into a large black hole. The massivness of the black hole warps the usual pattern of timespace.
That's how they suck in matter, including light.
If you were sucked into a black hole, first your legs would be while your shoulders are pushed together. You would be moving so fast that it would seem like the fastest instance to you but anyone who was watching from a distance would see the whole thing happen slower.

If humans could travel as fast as the speed of light then that would be time-travel. This would also warp timespace.
But this will never happen because it is impossible for any object with any mass to travel that fast, only massless particles and waves.

So this means that it is only possible for an object to travel forward in time...
I hope you can make sense out of that.

Traveling backwards in time? No, it is not possible.
Traveling forwards in time? Yes, you're doing it right now, in fact.

Time is a funky thing, y'know. There are ways to slow it down (like a guy said on this page) through Time Dilation, as explained by the theory of General Relativty.



But in short, time travel is possible - but only when traveling forward in time.

its not possible as we know with our current technology. Einstein believed the only constant was the speed of light and his general relativity states that energy is converted into mass (E=mc^2). Therefore, when approaching the speed of light, energy is converted into mass, making it more difficult to accelerate. However, it is thought that time does slow down near large objects such as planets. Therefore, time is not constant and can change, however, obviously, you can not travel bak in time lol. We simply move forward with the curved space-time continuum. But if someone goes out into space, they would seem to have aged as time is slower on a planet as said before

The question says use graphical methods so get some  paper-Draw on it the x & y axes . Draw a line ,length 8 cm along the x axis on the left hand side of the y axis . put a little arrow on the end pointing where its going. Now draw a line of length 9.4cm at an angle of 37.5degrees to the x axis starting at the end of vector B and put a little arrow on the end.  Now join the little arrow on the end of vector A to the beginning of vector B, which in this case, happens to be the origin of the graph.Put a little arrow at the end of the line This new line is the sum of the vectors A & B . Measure the length and get your protractor and measure the angle. That's the first bit done .
Now do exactly the same again only this time use -B which will of course go in the opposite direction to B. 
In doing these sorts of problems always remember that the next vector should always start from the little arrow at the end of the previous vector, and you should therefore end up with a loop with all the arrows pointing the same way round the loop.

Marie Skłodowska–Curie (7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a physicist and chemist of Polish upbringing and, subsequently, French citizenship. She was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity, the only person honored with Nobel Prizes in two different sciences, and the first female professor at the University of Paris.

She was born Mania Skłodowska in Warsaw, Vistula Country, Russian Empire, and lived there until she was 24. In 1891 she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she obtained her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. It was when she applayed at Sorbonne that she changed her name to Marie Sklodowska. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw. Her husband Pierre Curie was also a fellow-Nobel-laureate, as were her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie and her son-in-law Frédéric Joliot-Curie.

Her achievements include the creation of a theory of radioactivity (a term coined by her and Pierre), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two new elements, radium and polonium. It was also under her personal direction that the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms ("cancers"), using radioactive isotopes.

While an actively loyal French citizen, she never lost her sense of Polish identity. She named the first new chemical element that she discovered (1898) "polonium" for her native country, and in 1932 she founded a Radium Institute (now the Maria Skłodowska–Curie Institute of Oncology) in her home town Warsaw, headed by her physician-sister Bronisława.

How tall?
S = distance = ?
U = initial velocity = 0
T = time = 20secs
A = 9.8
Formula for distance: S = UT + 0.5AT^2
Therefore S = 0.5x9.8x20^2
S = 4.9x400
S = 1960 metres tall
Final velocity when hits the ground?
V = U + AT
therefore V = 0 + 9.8 x 20
final velocity = 196 metres per second
very tall building!!

I would say that the eggs never had enough milk in them or were not beaten properly. And as eggs whites are very light it was this that rose rather than the yolk mixture. Do the eggs for about 20 seconds the mix up a with a fork and then carry on cooking for another 1 min or so (depending on your microwave). Far better than cooking in saucepan and less mess.

At one end of the egg there is an air pocket. This is separated from the albumen and yolk by a sealed membrane.

When heated the air expands until its pressure ruptures the shell in an explosion.

Since the contents have also expanded, to some degree, they explode in a similar fashion.

It is the explosion of the air sac that  provides the initial disintegration.

Microwave oven - egg, not a good idea unless..
You must puncture the yolk sack if you are doing any thing with eggs in  M/W oven.

The yolk is contained in it's sack, liken it to the womb, virtually indestructable,so when you apply ''heat'' i.e m/w energy the yolk heats up and like every thing when you heat it, the yolk expands. The ''sack'' will stretch so far then burst with considerable ''pressure'' and spread yolk into every conceivble nook and crany in side the oven.

In extreme cases, I have seen as a M/W oven engineer, the oven doors blow the windows out, the inner cavity liner distort beyond recognition, and in the case of ''I was only warming the babies bottle from the fridge'' with the bottle lid still screwed on tight, this one actually ripped the door of, and planted if firmly in to the opposite wall of the kitchen. 
Had any one been in it's flight path, ...........................................
Any thing, everthing you put into a microwave oven must be able to expand with out any restrictions. 
The rate of expansion varies in differing food substances hence the differing cooking times for foods etc.
Another thing not to do with you M/w oven is dry your trainers after you have washed them. These too can catch fire!!! (Then you can hot foot it down to the pub and tell eveyone how to dry their shoes!!)
Not sure what you can and can't put in it..
If in doubt leave it out.
If all else fails read the instructions.

Water quickly becomes superheated steam pressure suddemly increases which expands rapidly but has nowhere to go until the shell fails dramatically.

You have to stir eggs in the microwave every few seconds when doing scrambled egg! As soon as it starts to souffle give it a stir! It goes to a solid rubbery mass if not! You also need to stop before it looks done as the heat will continue to eaqualise and continue cooking! It's quite an art to make it well in a microwave!

Cool, pretty eggciting, but do be very careful with eggs in microwaves.



A little nine-year-old girl tried to warm up a boiled egg. While she was carrying it afterwards, it exploded and hit her in the face and eye. It tore open her cornea and left her eye clouded over and only able to see hand movements. Several months later, her vision was restored, but only after two operations in which her cornea was stitched and her damaged lens replaced with a plastic one.

So do please be careful.

Now for the science bit:

Microwaved eggs can reach temperatures much higher than if they were simply boiled in water at 100° Celsius. At these elevated temperatures, water inside the egg, mostly in the white albumen, vaporises - even as the albumen solidifies. If the pressure inside the egg exceeds the breaking strength of the shell, the egg will explode.

Ok, most of these answers, perhaps all of them, assume you didn't shell or beat your eggs.  I'm assuming you did because you say it "shot up like a souffle."  Eggs do this because of the fluids they contains, when they are sufficiently heated they evaporate and expand, causing the "souffle effect."  When you opened the oven the "souffle" collapsed.  If you have ever made a souffle and opened the oven at the wrong time you would see the same thing.  This is because of the drop in air-pressure in the oven when the door opens.

<answer>



Ans: D

Let P = relativistic momentum and 
E = relativistic energy

Then
P = mv/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ------------------(1)
E = mc^2/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) ------------------(2)

It is given that E = 3mc^2.
Therefore, from (2)
3mc^2 = mc^2/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)
Dividing both sides by mc^2,
3 = 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)
Or sqrt(1-v^2/c^2) = 1/3
Taking square on both sides,
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1/9
Or v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/9
Or v^2/c^2 = 8/9------------------------------(3)
Taking square root on both sides,
v/c = sqrt(8/9)
Or v = c * sqrt(8/9)------------------------(4)
Using (3) and (4) in (1),
P = m*c*sqrt(8/9)/sqrt(1 - 8/9)
Or P = mc*sqrt(8/9)/sqrt(1/9)
Or P = mc*sqrt(8)
Or P =  sqrt(8) mc

_____________________
gp4rts, you have written that relativistic energy is γ*m0*c²+ m0*c²
But that is wrong. Relativistic energy is simply γ*m0*c²
and rest mass energy is m0*c^2
Kinetic energy = γ*m0*c² - m0*c^2
Thus total energy = kinetic energy + rest mass energy

Relativistic energy is γ*m0*c²+ m0*c²;  this = 3*m0*c²

γ*m0*c²+ m0*c² = 3*m0*c²

γ + 1 = 3,  γ = 2

Find v:

γ = 1/√[1 - v²/c²] = 2

√[1 - v²/c²] = 1/2

[1 - v²/c²] = 1/4

v²/c² = 3/4

v = √[3/4]*c

Relativistic momentum is

p = γ*m0*v = 2*m0*√[3/4]*c = √3*m0*c

<answer>



Generally, where E is energy, p is relativistic momentum, m is the rest mass and c the speed of light,



E = √(p^2 c^2 + (mc^2)^2)

So, rearranging,

p = √((E^2 - (mc^2)^2)) / c^2)

Thus, based on what you've been given,

p = √((3mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2)) / c^2)

= √(9(mc^2)^2 - (mc^2)^2)/c^2)

= √(8(mc^2)^2/c^2)

= √(8m^2c^2)

= √8mc

So I reckon (D) is the answer.

Check my working.

Record the magnitude and direction of the vector required to balance the force table. With the force table balanced, estimate the uncertainty in your resultant by adding small amounts of weight until the equilibrium is lost. Re-balance the table and find the uncertainty in the angle by making small changes to the angle until equilibrium is lost. Record your results and uncertainties below.

(a) A=(130 gm) @ Θ=47 degrees, B=(115 gm) @ Θ=296 degrees
│R│=│A+B│= 140g ± 2
Equilibrant Θ= 176 degrees ± 1 degree (measure from the x axis)
Resultant Θ= _______ ± _________

(b) A=(83 gm) @ Θ=138 degrees, B=(156 gm) @ Θ=212 degrees
│R│=│A+B│= 210g ± 2
Equilibrant Θ= 7degrees ± 1 degree (measure from the x axis)
Resultant Θ= _______ ± _________

How do I find the resultant?

2) Using two sheets of graph paper, use the graphical method described in the lab manual to determine the sum of the same two vectors. Be sure to choose a scale to represent grams on your graph paper, which fits the page well. Use a ruler and protractor to be as precise as possible. Estimate an uncertainty from your results.

So what I did was I graphed them and got these answers. Since 
(a) A=(130 gm) @ Θ=47 degrees, B=(115 gm) @ Θ=296 degrees
│R│=│A+B│= 140g ± 2
Resultant Θ= 39 degress ± 0.5 (measured from the x axis)

(b) A=(83 gm) @ Θ=138 degrees, B=(156 gm) @ Θ=212 degrees
│R│=│A+B│= 200g ± 2
Resultant Θ= 30 degress ± 0.5 (measured from the x axis)

For those of you who tried drawing the vectors, is my answer correct? │R│=│A+B│ in number 1a) and 2a) have same answers but in 1b) and 2b) have different │R│=│A+B│. Can they be little different since #2 was drawn? Or should they be same? I tried doing the resultant but im not sure if they are correct. Correct me if im wrong.



Resultant Θ= _______ ± _________

3) Use the component method of vector addition to once again add these two vectors. Show all of your work! Since this is an analytic result there is will be no uncertainty in your results (except for the rounding of significant figures)&gt; Observe how this solution compares to your other results. Be careful when finding the angle of the resultant vector; remember that your calculator may lie to you when using the tan^-1 function.

So what I did was solve them using the numbers in #2.

Rx= Ax+Bx+Cx Ry= Ay+By+Cy
130cos47˚+115cos296˚ 130sin47˚+115sin296˚
88.6˚+50.4˚ =139˚ 95.0˚-103.3˚=-8.3˚

Rx=Ax+Bx+Cx Ry= Ay+By+Cy
83cos138˚+156cos212˚ 83sin138˚+156sin212˚ 
-61.68-132.29˚=-193.97˚ 55.5˚ -82.6=-27.1˚



Is this how I do number #3? 
Also after solving #3, there is another section of...
(a) A=(130 gm) @ Θ=47 degrees, B=(115 gm) @ Θ=296 degrees
│R│=│A+B│= _______
Resultant Θ= _________ (measured from the x axis)

(b) A=(83 gm) @ Θ=138 degrees, B=(156 gm) @ Θ=212 degrees
│R│=│A+B│= _______
Resultant Θ= ________ (measured from the x axis)

Hmm im not sure why they are giving me this again..Now they have only one space to write answer unlike #1 and #2. Does anyone know why?

Lastly...Questions

4) From your estimated uncertainties in part 1 of the lab, do you think if the force table had been designed with finer degree markings along the rim it would improve the accuracy of your results? Consider that reading angles to the nearest degree gives you precision of better than half of a degree. Do changes of one half degree noticeably affect the equilibrium?

5) Assume that the weights were accurate to 1% of their marked values. Does this uncertainty in the weight account for a substantial amount of the uncertainty you found for │R│ in part 1?

6) Assume that the weights were accurate to 1% of their marked values. To improve accuracy of this experiment which improvement would you make first: get more precisely marked weights, get a finer degree scale, or install pulleys having less friction? Explain your answer.



7a) Suppose that in part 1 the pulleys remained fixed but the total weight on each string was doubled. If the system were balanced before, would it remain in equilibrium after the weights are doubled?

7b) What if instead of doubling the weights, 100grams was added to each strong? Be sure to explain your answers clearly.

Hm..for the questions I wish i knew how to answer them..English isn't my native language so Im not really getting the question. For those of you who did this lab or know what this lab is about, can you help me answer them?



I know I'm asking a lot from you guys, but this hw is really important to me and I really want to do well. I did most of the work so I was wondering if you can check them and correct my answers i

If you want to understand the potential benefits for mankind that this experiment can deliver, then watch these: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw0iRW2ho...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X02WMNoHS...

In short:
If we can discover exactly what indivisable units make up the universe, then this would give an explanation for everything. This understanding would then certainly lead to great technological advances for all mankind.
Scientists hope to discover what has been named the 'Higgs boson'  and the first video features the man himself (Peter Higgs) who explains what it would mean to  find out if this boson exists or not.
The second video explains how likely it is that time travel could occur through 'worm holes' and  'black holes' which the L.H.C experiment hopes to produce artificially.
Now let your imagination run riot and think of the many benefits that time travel could bring. It is true that there are also dangers associated with every scientific discovery, but mankind has always and always will evolve through advances in technology which is what scientific experiments endeavour to encourage.
Time travel is just one example, but other benefits could be that we would be able to discover how to travel to the stars and explore our universe safely and efficiently.
Or how to control the coming together of mass particles which form every object that we can see.
Us human beings have always been naturally inquisitive and curious about the reasons for our existance, and that is why our technology has evolved from making simple flint tools to space rockets which can travel to other planets within out solar system.

I think the best answer is simply to satisfy our curiosity about how Nature works.  There is no ulterior motive.

You ask a very interesting question here.  What really is "important" in the grand scheme of things?  Maybe nothing at all is important in the end, but I think exploring questions simply because they are interesting is a wise thing to do.

Curiosity is a great motivator, but deeper knowledge of how things work often pays off in other ways.

In this case, the scientists are looking for information which might extend quantum theory into those regions of REALLY BIG and (really tiny) where quantum theory currently fails.  By gaining further understanding, we may be able to develop faster, smaller computers or more efficient generators or more secure communications or maybe even artificial gravity.

I'm sure that there are many more possibilities that are too numerous to list here, and too incredible to wrap my mind around, but the quest to know how things work goes far beyond mere curiosity.

No, I don't believe that the physicists had an ulterior motive. However, the LHC will NOT tell them how the Universe started; it will only tell them what could possibly have been occurring a tiny fraction of a second after the Universe began.

They want to answer questions such as "does the Higgs boson exist" in addition to that.

What is the point of knowing how the Universe was created? It not too different from the point of knowing whether or not there really is an omnipotent being up there who cares about you. To me, that's an important question.

it is not to find out why/how the big bang came about. the LHC will display what happened less than seconds after the big bang. scientists are trying to prove Peter Higgs theory. at the minute we only know what  around 5% of matter is made from. the LHC will mean we can discover much more about mass and matter.

My sentiments entirely.  Why don't they put those resources into finding an alternative for the hundreds of moving parts internal combustion engine?  It really is about time that that thing became a museum piece.  How many people will benefit from knowing how the universe was created?  How will it benefit us and our planet?  And how reliable will the findings be anyway?  And who cares?  It's nothing more than a waste of time and money.

Knowing how the Universe was created falls into the category of "pure" research.  "Practical" research would be something like "How do we create a rechargable battery that holds it charge longer. Practical research normally pays off, and does so in measurable ways.

All "pure" research, (at least in the physical sciences) always pays off, and pays off big. It just doesn't pay off immediately or in the ways people expect it to.

Take for example Einstein's original work on relativity.  You would think that relativity is irrelevant at first glance. It only really comes into play when objects start moving about at about 2/3 the speed of light, not something that happens a whole lot in ordinary life. When it comes to predicting how things move in our daily lives, Newton's laws of motion work just fine.

But relativity led to a better understanding of the universe...which in turn led to understanding of atomic power, atomic fission, atomic fusion, radiation, and how atoms decay..which lead to hyper accurate atomic clocks...and when you couple that knowledge with what Einstein taught us about how time slows down for signals moving at near light speed, American Engineers were able to create the GPS system.



(According to the theory of relativity, due to their constant movement and height relative to the Earth-centered inertial reference frame, the clocks on the satellites are affected by their speed (special relativity) as well as their gravitational potential (general relativity). For the GPS satellites, general relativity predicts that the atomic clocks at GPS orbital altitudes will tick more rapidly, by about 45.9 microseconds (μs) per day, because they are in a weaker gravitational field than atomic clocks on Earth's surface. Special relativity predicts that atomic clocks moving at GPS orbital speeds will tick more slowly than stationary ground clocks by about 7.2 μs per day. When combined, the discrepancy is about 38 microseconds per day; a difference of 4.465 parts in 1010. To account for this, the frequency standard onboard each satellite is given a rate offset prior to launch, making it run slightly slower than the desired frequency on Earth; specifically, at 10.22999999543 MHz instead of 10.23 MHz.[43] Since the atomic clocks on board the GPS satellites are precisely tuned, it makes the system a practical engineering application of the scientific theory of relativity in a real-world environment.)

Bottom line, GPS is only possible because Einstien and others like him were doing "pure research" into how the universe worked.  They weren't intending to build a system that will keep you from geting lost as you drive home from a pub you've never been to before, they weren't trying to create a system that will help you find the place your best mate is getting married after you forgot the invite, or an atomic power reactor, or the Hiroshima bomb, or anything else....but that is what eventually came of it.



So we research these things because knowing things is good, and we know that the research will pay off some day...we don't know when and we don't know how, but we do know iit eventually will.

Since man said "Ugg" they have tried to discern the world around them. Early experiments resulted in the creation of fire and the invention of the wheel.

The oldest question in civilisation is "Where did we come from?" Surely you are curious as to our origins? As for the LHC, there are numerous reasons it was built, and it benefits mankind in more ways than many people realise.

It's not so much about learning how the universe was created (although that would be a massive scientific breakthrough), but more so in learning about the very surroundings we inhabit. Understanding subatomic particles, how they work and how we can manipulate them will vastly increase our knowledge of the world around us, enabling for new technologies in just about everything you can think of: computers, engineering, space travel, even the medical field.



Most noteworthy is that the LHC will be heavily influential in the research and treatment of diseases, cancer in particular. At present particle accelerators are used all the time for X-rays, radiotherapy and radiosurgery. The LHC will bring new research to existing technology and could potentially, in years to come, save many lives.

Professor Brian Cox at CERN (who can explain much better than I can) gives an insight into the possibilities of the LHC and why it was built:

I am stuck on this problem and need assistance solving it

At a NASA research center free-fall research is performed by dropping experiment packages from the top of an evacuated shaft 151 m high. Free-fall imitates the so-called microgravity environment of a satellite in orbit

(a) What is the maximum time interval for free fall if an experiment package were to fall the entire 151 m?
Answer in s

(b) Actual NASA specifications allow for a 5.25 s drop time interval. How far do the packages drop in 5.25 s?
Answer in m

(c) What is their speed at 5.25 s?
Answer in m/s

(d) What constant acceleration would be required to stop an experiment package in the distance remaining in the shaft after its 5.25 s fall?
Answer in m/s^2^ and whether it is upward or downward

-answers-
a) 5.55 seconds
b) 135 meters
c) 51.44 m/s
d) -82.6898 m/s/s

-work-
This is an easy kinematic's solution. To get (a), first identify your knowns and unknowns
Distance (d) = 151 m
acceleration (a) = 9.8 m/s/s (gravity)
Velocity Initial (Vi) = 0 (since he just dropped it instead of throwing it)
Time (t) = s (our unknown)

So the only kinematics equation that has all 4 of these variables is 
d = (Vi)*(t) + .5*a*t^2
Plug and solve
151 = 0*t +.5*9.8*t^2
30.81632653 = t^2
t = 5.55 seconds



b) well..... just the same equation as before but this time we DO know t but not d. So...
d = 0*5.25 + .5*9.8*5.25^2
d = 135 meters



c) okay, now we know what distance is, so let's identify our variables again
Vi = 0
t = 5.25
d = 135
Vf = x (our unknown)

The kinematics equation that has all 4 of these variables is 
Vf^2 = Vi^2 +2*a*d
Plug and chug
Vf^2 = 0^2 + 2*9.8*135
Vf^2 = 2646
Vf = 51.44 m/s



d) This isn't too hard let's identify our variables again
Vi = 51.44 m/s (Yup, that's our new Vi because now our dropping point is in respect to after that 5.25s fall)
Vf = 0 ( we want a complete stop)
a = x (our unknown)
d = 151 - 135 = 16 m (that's cuz we already traveled 135m out of 151 total)

We use the same equation as part c

Vf^2 = Vi^2 + 2*a*d
0^2 = 51.44^2 + 2*x*16
-2646.0736 = 32x
x = -82.6898 m/s/s
That acceleration is UPward because we're trying to stop a falling object. That's also why the answer is negative. It's against the direction that the object is falling in

there is gravity on the moon...it is far less than the gravity on earth, so the astronauts 'weigh' less and can jump higher, float like MJ, etc.
the heavy boots help keep them on the ground

objects of different size will be subject to the moon's gravity, based on size...heavier objects harder to lift

in space [beyond the pull of earth or any other objects, including sun?], where objects are 'weightless', a car 'should' float as easily as a cup

If there is no gravity then there is no weight.  Weight is the force exerted on something by gravity.  However, everything has the same mass whether or not there is gravity.

In zero gravity nothing has weight they do however have mass. Thiss means that altough they will stay in whatever place you put them moving (and then stopping) them will take differing amounts of energy to overcome the inertia caused by their mass.

I believe if there is no gravity weight does not exist in any object be it a car or a cup, however say a cup was on the ground it would not float or move unless something  collides with it then it will float in the appropriate direction

If there's no gravity, as in space, everything would float around. As the gravity on the Moon is roughly 1/6 of that on  Earth,  Moon boots would therefore be relatively light....

What is the velocity of this ball?



A rolling ball has an initial velocity of -1.5 m/s. 
A) If the ball has a constant acceleration of -0.23 m/s, what is its velocity after 2.2 s?



B) What was its average velocity during that time interval?
C) How far did it travel in this time interval?

I'm not looking for direct answers, just a little help on how to set up the equations to get my own answer. Thanks for any help!

The guys above me are WRONG!!!!
BOTH forgot that BOTH initial velocity AND acceleration are NEGATIVE. Both thought that Acceleration is negative and initial velocity is positive. Trust me, I have the right answers

-answers-
A) -2.006 m/s
B) -1.594 m/s
C) -3.8566 meters



-work-
A) 
first Identify variables we do know
Initial Velocity (Vi) = -1.5
Acceleration (a) = -0.23
time (t) = 2.2 s
Final Velocity (Vf) = x (our unknown)

The only kinematic equation to have all four of these variables is



Vf = Vi + a*t
Plug and chug
Vf = -1.5 +(-0.23)*2.2
Vf = -2.006 m/s (SEE!! NOT ZERO!)

B)
Average velocity? Haha I would just do (Vf + Vi)/t so
(-2.006 + - 1.5)/2.2 = -1.594 m/s

C)
Now remember our variables again:
Initial Velocity (Vi) = -1.5
Final Velocity = - 2.006 m/s/s
time (t) = 2.2 s
Distance = x (our unknown)

now the only kinematics equations that has all four variables is 
D = [(Vf + Vi)/2]*t
so  plug and chug
D = [(-2.006 + - 1.5)/2]*2.2 = -3.8566 meters



Please remember to choose a best answer ^_^

if the friction coefisient is zero then :
A. Vt = Vo + a*t --&gt; V(2.2) = 1.5 + (-0.23)*2.2 = 0.994 m/s
B. average velocity = [1.5 + 0.944]/2 = 1.274 m/s
C. Vt^2 = Vo^2 - 2*a*s then s = [Vo^2 - Vt^2]/2a
s = [1.5^2 - 0.994^2]/[2*0.23] ~ 1.67 meter

a) final velocity = initial velocity + (acceleration x time)



final velocity = 1.5 m/s + (0.23 x 2.2) = 1.5+ 0.506 = 2.006 m/s



I am not clear on what is meant  by the - associated with the initial speed or acceleration but as they appear to be in the same direction it does not matter.



b) the average velocity is initial velocity + change in velocity/2



1.5 + .253 = 1.753 m/s

c) 1.753 x2.2 = 3.8566 meters

If energy cannot be destroyed, is that an argument for life after death?



In my Philosophy class at the moment a common argument for the afterlife is "energy cannot be destroyed" and this is used to jump to the conclusion that we must continue on in some form after death. This feels pretty pseudo-scientific and wrong to me, but can anyone refute the idea? It seems like it's a physics fact being misused.

energy can not be destroyed but it can become useless. ie movement good. loss due to friction bad. friction turns movement energy (kinetic) into sound and heat energy. in this case useless energies. 
you might say that some of your fellow philosophers contain a lot of useless energy that will disappear into the ether when they die.

You would have to assume that life is energy.
Therefore when life is created energy is created which would thus violate another law of physics.
As a result, if they were going to try and use the laws of physics, they would be contradicting themselves.

And technically energy can be converted to mass and mass to energy (E = mc^2).

energy cannot be destroyed it is converted from one form to another

light is absorbed by an object and becomes heat, one object hits another and causes that object to move

life occurs because of biochemical processes in the body burning 'stored energy' into 'usable energy' - that is the conversion (in ultra simplistic terms) that occurs whilst you are alive, when you are dead that process stops, but the 'stored energy' decomposes and is again converted into something else - for example the body is eaten by worms and then becomes part of it's body mass, so the rule of energy cannot be destroyed and is only converted still holds true.

of course if you are religiously inclined, you may still argue that the soul cannot be destroyed - which does not necessarily have anything to do with chemical energy.

If energy transfers from one form to another that does mean all our energy from our body goes up to heaven as our soul. This is my christian belief. This is why people, and animals look lifeless after death. Ps if you don't believe in jesus Christ your soul (energy) will go to hell.

in a perfectly elastic collision.
Conservation of energy and linear momentum is observed.
let ----&gt; be positive

(m)--3--&gt;  &lt;--5--(m)
&lt;--u--(m) (m)--v--&gt;
Initial momentum = 3m+-5m = -2m
Final momentum = -um+vm

-um+vm=-2
v-u=-2

Relative speed of approach = relative speed of separation
3+5 = v+u
v+u = 8

2v = 6
v = 3
u = 5
~~~
due to the elastic collision and the same mass, the velocities have "swapped"
now they are moving away from each other, the 3m/s initial ball is now moving at 5m/s and viceversa

How to find electric charge (Q) and electric field potential (E) ?



A simple electrolysis type apparatus, with electrode spacing of 9cm.
The appratus is supplied by 6V 2A DC power supply.

I measured the voltage horizontally from the positive anode (0cm) to the negative cathode (9cm). My results as below. The solution is distilled water, if that helps.



0cm 5.92V
1cm 3.82V
2cm 3.7V
3cm 3.27V
4cm 2.8V
5cm 2.45V
6cm 2.36V
7cm 1.81V
8cm 1.6V
9cm 0V

So from all this data, how can i calculate electric charge,Q and electric field potential, E ? Thanks guys...
