If you are relying on eBay to support yourself, you need to go see a financial planner now.

Is a Costco Membership worth the money?



I have Aldi's in my area and it seems like the prices are comperable on grocery items.  Do you think the annual cost of the Costco Membership is worth the money?  Will I save money there if I'm not a BIG item purchaser?

I haven't had a costco membership but i have had a sam's club one. (they are basically the same thing)  I personally didn't really save enough money to make it worthwhile but I wasn't a big item purchaser either.  You really have to watch these places, they make you think buying in bulk saves money but frequently the per item cost is the same and sometimes more.  If you get one, go armed with a calculator and write down the cost of items you usually buy at the store and compare.  I would see if you can get a day pass  to try it out before you buy one or go with someone that already has a membership to check into it.

i'm not an expert, but they have good savings on name brand and a lot of "higher end" products. for example, high quality meats like fresh salmon and restaurant quality cuts of meat are much cheaper than in most grocery stores. if you dont buy much of this stuff, it may not be worth it.



you can also get good deals on big ticket items like tvs, but again, it's usually a good discount on high end brands.

When O.B wins will he be fighting for the American people or the American Corporations/Banking systems?



I have spent my life fighting for equality and believe that the best thing in this election is for the best man to win,
the state of the worlds economy's is the direct result of corporate greed and the way they have been abusing not only weaker countries but their own people, how many times do we here of the millions & multimillion pay bonuses bankers/traders/execs get and yet they refuse to pay little to those who hold the country together.
I am rooting for Obama and hope that through the ashes of the Bush administration there comes the phoenix for a new beginning where equality and fairness prevails and where the citizens & not just the corporations who benefit!



My main concern is that when one decides to run for President that there is some hidden rule that states that they must serve the banking/corporate interests first and if that is the case why don’t we just keep Bush/Mickey Mouse or even the Dalai Lama because it will make no difference,
Time will tell in who really runs America!

The state of the world's economy is the direct result of personal stupidity and materialistic greed.



Big corporations don't take our money, we give it to them.  Blaming them for our own obsession with conspicuous consumption, is just denial.  Until people take responsibility for the choices they make in their own lives, nothing will change.  Dream on.
Politicians pay attention to the needs of businesses and the rich, because that's where the tax revenue comes from.  An overwhelming percentage of the total tax revenue comes from corporations and the filthy rich.  By comparison, the money we put in is chump change. The average guy is just along for the ride. That's not partisan politics, that's in the census data.
Government doesn't make money, they just take it.  It is important to them, that profits are made.  If no one is making money, no one is taxed.



I also think your reference to "...the ashes of the Bush administration...", is an unfortunate choice of words, and will ultimately pale by comparison, both figuratively and literally, with the 'ashes' of an Obama administration.

Time has already told who runs America - and it's not the people.



Global corporations, big business, multinational companies... call them what you will, but the interests of such institutions have been the shaping force of Western "democracies" and their more openly imperial predecessor states pretty much since the beginning.



Perhaps this financial slump will conflate with peak oil, Chinese hegemony and the growing consequences of environmental degradation to whip up a "perfect storm" to blow these powers from their pedestals.  But Obama... he may be the lesser of two evils, but ultimately he has to dance to the tune of his paymasters or they will break him.

The corporations are a necessary evil.  Without corporations there would be no economy.  Economic development  is the most important part of running the country.  There needs to be a balance between the interests of the corporations and the interests of the people.



The ironic thing is that the salaries that top executives make are most times justified.  I am not saying that they should get huge golden parachutes but most execs worked long and hard to get to where they are and they deserve to to get paid.  The workers also need to be compensated.



I too have worked my entire life to help people.  The answer is not to limit the level of success that a person can have or the amount of money that a person can make but to maximize the amount of opportunity that every person has.



I lived in a welfare hotel and there are people who live in environments like that who don't even know that it is possible to get a college degree or that they can get student aid.



The challenge for our next president is to balance the needs of the people with the needs of corporations.  This has to happen without putting the tax burden on the people.  I don't care who wins this election, it is obvious that the best candidate is not even running, however, realistically it is not the president nor the corporations that run the country.

One day I'd like to be in the leader group at one of the best corporations, but where to start?



I have a bachelor degree in intl' business and HRM, and I'm doing a Master degree at a very famous university in Australia. The title described my dream, but I don't know where to start. My application for a retail role in a department store was even rejected. It is very disappointing to me. Considering my target, I don't know whether I can reach there?

a good education will open doors but is not an entitlement to success. Great leaders and top execs possess the following traits, as well as many others:



1. leadership ability
2. recognize and nurture talent in others-great leaders build great teams
3. they are great communcators
4. they make sacrifices-long hours, relocation, devote a lot of time to career
5. good decision makers
6 take risks
7. don't work from a personal agenda
8. they have vision-are innovators



there are thousands of books on leadership and business, but i think the best is Good to Great by Jim Collins-it describes factually the building of great corporations and the many factors that contribute.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



I'm sorry to hear you too are experiencing the hurtful and disgusting human behaviors in the work place. I put up with it for years but finally I went into a business for myself. It was scary at times because no company health coverage, no regular salary to expect, and it was all up to me to earn my own living. But dispite my fear, I quit and started my own business because I reached a point where I could not work with these people anymore.
I, however, heard that not all work places is like the ones I worked at. In smaller companies where the top boss can see what's going on directly, some of the back-stabbings could be alleviated.
Hang on and find enjoyment outside of work. If you can, try not to think about the ugly people and do somethings you enjoy doiong after you get home. If back-stabbing becomes too much, don't suffer alone. Discuss it with someone you trust or go to counselor in company's personnel dept. if available, and finally talk to your boss.
Take care.

What do I need to work at a Retail Store?



I'm in NSW, Australia, and I would really love to work at a big store like Roger David, David Jones, Myer, etc.



The problem is that I don't have many qualifications as I'm only in high school, and I don't have previous retail experience so I'm not founded in that aspect. I also think my lack of confidence holds me back and puts me at a disadvantage, and I'm not sure what store managers would think of my personality. I'm a relatively shy person as well... I know that doesn't sound too great, but the idea of working in retail really excites me.



Plus.. I think I have good work ethics and I hope that can give me some merit. Peple tell me I'm insightful. I like to think creatively. I can commit and can put in full effort, and I'm always willing to learn.



Do you think I'm aiming too high? I was knocked back once, and that was simply because the job required qualifications I didn't have.



Tell me what you think. If you have worked in retail before, please let me know, as I'm especially interested in what you have to say.

How much stake does Yahoo! own in Google?



It sounds a bit weird, but I know that Yahoo! owns at least a certain amount of stake in Google. This was after Google decided to issue Yahoo! some of its stock as a settlement for the patent infringement dispute over Google AdWords. Yahoo! had bought Overture Services Inc, and Google's AdWords program infringed on Overture's patents. In return for Google stock, Yahoo! issued Google permission to continue using AdWords. So my question is this - how much of Google does Yahoo! own currently?

I have purchased an item on the web and found it to be faulty- I have no option than to feel embarrassed why?



I have been given the option of seeking a replacement item by ringinging their helpline at a cost of £1.50 a minute- this to me is extotion in a very devious way- I would like to completely defame their websit as I used 'pay-pal' yet find nothing trustworthy in their set-up -at all. I find that this is a deplorable business but have no option than to inform other potential prey i.e. fools like myself.



Please help me as the truth cannot be slanderous and people should have warning of such gangsterish tactics and vendors of rubbish-



will you give me ways of help? PLEASE?

I don't know if you guys have laws protecting consumers, but here in New Zealand we have the consumer guarantees act, which legally obliges any retailers to refund or exchange faulty goods. This extends to transactions made over the web too. I use PayPal regularly and I have found their customer service and discrepancy tracking to be quite efficient. Perhaps you should contact them for advice.

Both partners share the profit in the same proportion as they would share any losses as "2" has obviously invested (risked) more (to be able to justify the higher profit proportion)

With better fonts and sizing, it could be made to look very nice... you know, really BIG A.B.C. and the other letters really small.



I recommend finding a font that actually looks like beads or, even better, use actual beads with letters to spell out the name.



Using A.B.C. to stand for Abbie's Beading Company means that it will be listed near the front of the phone book and/or other listings alphabetically.  Which is a big advantage, since most people start calling from the top of any list.

1. Always check availability by contact the city/county registrar’s office or your State Controller’s Office to make sure that the name is not already registered. Get it registered as soon as you complete this list of to do’s.



2. Check on trademarks with the US Patent and Trademarks Office at http://www.uspto.gov. Consider trademarking your name to prevent someone trying to grab it in the future.



3. Check the availability of the corresponding web site or domain name. Make sure that it isn’t in use and doesn’t point to a site whose business you would not want to be associated with (e.g. porn).



4. If you will be involved in international business make sure that your name when translated does not hold any negative connotations in the foreign language.



5. Avoid names with mutiple meanings; “Natalie’s Body Shop” can mean “Automobile Repair”, “Body Oils” or “A Singles Meeting Place”.



6. Avoid restrictive names that can prevent you from expanding or changing the direction of your business in the future. Example “Pacific Computer Hardware” would have difficulty transforming to selling just software in the future.



7. Avoid words like: “cheap” and “used”. Use instead: “low cost or inexpensive” and “recycled or previously-owned”.



8. Show some creativity. Use something other than your name as all or part of the company.



9. Avoid “AAAA Office Supplies” Very few people use the Yellow Pages these days. They tend to use the search engines on the web (Google) and use the search terms that people use in order to rank businesses in search results pages. Try to use these term in your company name.



10. Try to include any benefits that your customer derives from your product or service. “Painless Dentistry” sounds very reassuring to me.

As far as I know (and I'm downtown all of the time), there is no Bank of America branch in Pittsburgh.  The big bank here is PNC Bank.  I like them, had accounts there for a long time.  They have a great online banking section on their web site, where you can pay bills, check account balances, etc. online.  They also have a billion (okay maybe not a billion) ATM's around.



Maybe once you get settled in Pittsburgh you can transfer your money to an account at PNC.  They have free checking (although I do think there is a minimum balance) and like I said all of those ATM machines.



For info about them just call them at 800-PNC-BANK or pncbank.com

However, in this case, the newly formed entity is called "Thomson Rueters, now that gives it a picture of Merger.

Why is Current Ratio a better measure of a firms liquidity than Working Capital?



I've put :

Current ratio is a better measure of a firm’s liquidity than working capital because it shows exactly how much money a business has to pay bills for every pound of assets.



But I need more detail.
Can anyone help?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The Current Ratio is a popular measure for a firm's liquidity. It is measured via dividing the Assets of a company by its Liquidity. This ratio shows us how much the firm has to pay its debts for every pound of assets. Conversely, the Working Capital is useful for investors because it shows how efficient a firm is. It is calculated via the following calculation, Current Assets - Current Liabilities. Positive Working Capital means the company can pay off its short-terms debt. Negative Working Capital means the company is currently unable to meet its short-term liabilities with its current assets.



There are however flaws with some of the calculations. Not necessarily flaws but that the ratio does not give the whole story. The Current Ratio is rather naive in calculation as it assumes that it will take every asset stored to meet its liabilities. This is not the case in many cases. Fuel is only added to the fire seeing that liabilities for different firms are paid off at different times. To offset these minor errors, many investors will use other Liquidity measures such as the CCC (Cash Conversion Cycle) and/or the Quick Ratio which excludes inventories from the Current Assets and then divides that sum by its liabilities. 
Working Capital also does not generally show how a firm is efficient. It does not take into account its Return on Equities (ROE for short). However, it is generally regarded as a good, quick indicator.

was the item originally 2 items? or did you choose to put two. because if the item consisted of only 1 ticket then the amount you bid probably goes for one of the tickets. you can ask the seller if you're not sure. hope i helped

If the seller has more than one ticket available and the listing is for a single ticket then yes, but if the listing is times two then you will only have to pay what you have bid.

You have to ask the seller, you should be able to find the email the seller section, if you had a quantity option to select 2 then i think you might have to pay double. :D however, if you have to *bid* rather than *buy it now *then that means that you pay whatever you have bidded for. at least i think so anyway.

Royal Mail recorded delivery question?



Hi

I bought an item from ebay on the 2nd of august it has been posted on the 4th, when i used the Royal mail tracking service it says the item was delivered on the 12th of august, but no one was at home, but i cant find any note, ad i was at home anyway, i have to hphone a number and arrange a redelivery, i was wondering if the product would be at my local post office, because its just 2 minutes walk from my home, or do i have to call that number as i havent got the "sorry you were not in" card.

Get in contact with the tracking people again and they will tell you who signed for it as they will have the record of the signature (perhaps a neighbour signed for it). They will be able to tell you where the parcel is if no-one has signed for it or they will have to pay you for the item.



Although after reading through you question again, I would imagine that the parcel is at the main sorting office if you have to phone to arrange a re-delivery.

Good luck.

If there is then your postie may have given it to a neighbour.  If not then I would pop into your local sorting office as soon as possible and see if they can track and trace it - they will have more access to information than you can on the website.  Or call 08457 740 740 - which is the national customers service number.

I've been taking a medicinal mushroom blend of Beta Glucan for 4 years, made by perhaps the foremost expert in the field. They are seeking a company with whom to partner in the US for distribution of the product line. The formulation is in top 2% of its product type in the world and 'super-charges' your immune system naturally. Bio-tech is desperate to own the formulation, offering millions. No MLM please.

Start off in a CPA firm. The training is better than any private company can give you and you get to audit and learn lots about various industries. From there, you'll find your calling or niche, and then you can move out to private accounting if you want. Some people stay in audit all their lives. In addition, people in CPA firms are more updated on the latest accounting standards. Accountants with private companies don't bother with new accounting standards which don't affect them, e.g. IFRIC 13.

SSP is the Government sick pay = you only get it if the Company does not pay you any sick pay ...

For Company Sick Pay, your Contact Of Employment will detail your sick leave entitlement (it's usually something like 1 week during your first 13 weeks of employment raising to 4 weeks after a year or so)

The first 3 days you are sick are always paid by the Company (if you are entitled) - SSP only starts on day 4 ...

On day 4 + , if you are entitled to Company sick pay they pay you your normal wages (which will be higher than SSP) .. if you have no entitlement from the Company (or have gone over your total entitlement in that year) the Company pays SSP (which I believe is a flat rate)

Your company may have a contractual scheme for sick pay that will be detailed in your contract of employment. your contract will stipulate when (if ever) and for how long you are paid once you are sick

SSP is a government scheme and operates ALONG SIDE any statutory sick pay, SSP is not replaced due to their being any contractual scheme in place.



There is no set time at an employer before you become entitled to SSP. You can not be paid for the first 3 days sick. If you have had 28 weeks of SSP within the last 6 months you do not qualify again.



If your employer is not paying SSP they should give you an SSP1 form which will detail their reasions, you should give this to Jobcentre Plus who will pay you Incapacity benefit instead

What is the UK business address for directly contacting Boots No 7?



I want to ask them a detailed question about one of their products but am having trouble finding the address.



NB: Please don't give me the general Boots customer care address, as I already know that one and am of the opinion that just writing to that department will only delay things because they will probably just tell me to write to No 7. Possibly even without giving the address if they really can't be bothered.

An e-mail address and number would be good too but it's the address that will get the top points.

It's most likely you'll be keeping your job. Employees are included with the company, so you will still be working there. The only way you could lose your job as part of the transaction is is the new owner is planning on making cuts.

There's something called the 'Transfer of Undertakings' which should put your mind at rest.

It defines all the legal protection you are entitled to - as an employee -during  and after the takeover.

www.sharecrazy.com



you can get 50% discount off car rentals at avis europe but there are no details on how many share syou need to buy, how long you need to hold them for etc. Is it actually possible to get this discount and how far do you have to go to get it?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Very interesting question...which made me searched with high interested.

Unfortunately, the discount is no longer available (at a time the share is at an all time low)

Here the Avis Plc website:
http://ir.avis-europe.com/avisplc/servic...

With effect from 1st January 2005, discounted rentals will not be available to new shareholders.

Rental discounts for existing shareholders and Founders Club members will still be honoured.

Home could be a number of things.  I know Home Hardware is commonly referred to Home (I know because my dad works at Home's head office).  They are a common hareware and housewares store.  Home Hardware also has a Home Furnishings store which is a separate outlet that sells furniture and appliances.  Lastly there is Homesense (not affiliated with the others).  They are like a Winners store for your house.  Brand names at discount prices.

Hope it helped

Banks error? advice - urgent!?



Ok, so its my 30th birthday this weekend. I have gone back to college to study, therefore funds are low...I asked my bank to change my repayment date for my direct debits and bank loan to 22nd August....they emailed me to say its all done. They even clarified and confirmed the dates!! THEN today, I check my account...theres no money in there.
Im so upset! Its my b.day celebrations tomorrow! I cant even afford to go!
I spoke to a manager at my bank tonight who was helpful but couldnt refund the mistake! he did try to refund a charge from May to soften the blow. He said hes 99% sure the reversed charge should come back to my account tomorrow..but theres a chance it wont as its a saturday! does anyone know if it can still go in tomorrow? My bank is HSBC.
Im not sure how these things work and I am so upset! They have left me with nothing! its going to ruin my celebrations! help! xx



</question>



<additional details>



the bank have admitted its their error. My main concern is if the reversed charges the man gave me will definitley go back in tomorrow? normally its 24 hours to process. But its a sat?



I dont have rainy day money! I have used it for another situation!

HSBC is the worst. I have paid them massive fees in the past. I would go and sit down with a manager and try and explain your situation.

this answer may not be popular or the one you want to hear, but i suggest you look at this from a different angle. if you cant get the bank to refund your money in time to spend it on your b-day, i say change your plans to something that costs less (or even better - free). Always assuming of course that you cant "freeload" (such a stigmatized word:) the money from say an older brother or parent (you are pretty old so i dont know if they will find it cute, lol). Be thankful that you dont have the money to spend on some frivolity and when the bank finally does get around to reimbursing you, do something more well thought-out with it that will last you longer than just say one day of hardcore celebrating. 
if that doesnt satisfy you and you still want to party, you could do a payday loan, lol. but i wouldnt advise that unless its an emergency, as in non-retractable plans.

Does anyone know how long you have to work in BHS before they will put you in for management training?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It's never 'automatic' .. if you show promise you could be 'recognised' almost from 'day 1'

I expect BHS actually recruits new graduates direct into their "management training scheme". If you failed to get in on this, but have got an 'ordinary' workers job with them, you may be able to get onto a future 'fast track' management course by applying with your existing Managers recommendations ....

You could also 'work your way up' = this typically takes 10-15 years ... on the other hand, you could still be on the tills after 30 years ..

I suggest you discuss this with your Manager .. until you have him/her 'on-side' there's no chance ..

Committee question about Treasurer



I am a member of a Working Mans Club who are in dire straits. They haven't had a treasurer for the longest time and have suffered greatly. There is a general apathy about the place, and nobody seems to want to do anything. The Secretary asked me to be Treasurer and I have agreed. Some members have complained that a Treasurer needs to be elected on. Is there anything we can do? Like acting Treasurer until the AGM etc?

It all depends on your constitution, but usually there is provision for members to be co-opted on to the committee to fill a vacancy. That person would then stand formally at the AGM and have his position ratified then.

Where I live, Blockbuster has done away with late fees and replaced it with a new system.  You have a week from the due date to return the  movie.  If you return it in this timeframe, there is no late fee.  After that additional week is over the rental converts to a sale, and your credit card will be charged for the retail price of the movie.  You now have 30 days to return the movie.  If you return it within 30 days, you will receive a refund, minus $1.25 handling fee.  After 30 days, you cannot return the movie because you now own it.

For example, if your movie were due today, you would have 7 days from today to return it before the rental converted to a purchase.

</answer from>



<answer>



It would be helpful to know what country you're in. There aren't too many Islamic banks in my part of the USA.



I read a newspaper article years ago about an Islamic bank opening in my city. All I remember is that they weren't going to charge interest on loans, and I thought that was a great thing. I wondered how they would stay in business, though.

As a non-Muslim woman, I wonder how welcome I would be in an Islamic bank. Would they expect women to cover their hair to come into the bank? Would the men there treat us as equals, and would they treat the women there as equals? And would they hire non-Muslims?

I hope it's not in England otherwise you are buggered it you talk and spell and have bad grammar like your question!

Public relations it to "relate" with the public - sometimes it's like customer services, other times it's like releasing press releases or talking to your customers and sweet talking them at conferences, or over the phone, or face to face etc basicly making the company look good to their customers. "selling" the company any way you can really.

Credit cards and statements



hi

if my credit card 'rolls over' on the 2nd working day of the month (ie the statements printed on the 2nd working day), if I buy something at 12.30am on said day, will it go onto the next months statement? Obviously stuff I buy later in that day go on the next statement, I'm just wondering if its a case of 'as soon as the bank's 1st working day trade hours are closed it gets classed as next day'

thanks

hey i work for ltsb 
for example if your statement date is the 21st ok if buy anything that day regardless of what time it is or if its a weekend the system recognises it as the 21st so it wld be on the statement.

if you buy something on the 22nd IT goes on nxt month.

see close of business on cards and bank accounts are not 5pm they dont cut off till midnight.

and usually any charges are from previous months
i hope that helped

Profit is NOT a liability.  It flows into the equity part of the balance sheet.  It does NOT have to be paid out to the owners; it can be reinvested into the business.

I've never read where a loss is an asset.  A loss shows up as a DEBIT on the balance sheet, but this is also in the EQUITY part of the balance sheet.  Debits in the equity section represent a reduction of equity.

You are right to look at it from the organisations point of view. With a sole trader, for example, the accumulated profits less losses represents the owners equity. If for arguments sake, the business was sold at the date of the Balance Sheet for the exact values shown recorded therein, then the net figure realised would equal the owners equity.

In the case of a Limited Company, the owners equity (shareholders) is represented by accumulated reserves, which includes accumulated profits less losses. Again, all things being equal, this is the shareholders stake in the business.

The above is a very much simplified, because a business is dynamic and changes from day to day and includes many estimates in determining balance sheet valuations. There are other complications such as non distributable capital profits, share premium a/cs etc, unissued share capital etc.

With a Limited Company, shareholders own a part of the Company according to the number of shares held, and can be transferred following sale of the shares. Unlike trade liabilities, the shareholders equity would not normally be repaid unless the Company was wound up. So, try to think of it as the 'net worth' of the Company rather than as a liability.

You either own something; car, computer, cash etc.. (Asset) or you owe money; overdraft, loan etc... (Liability).

When you increase an asset you debit it and credit it to decrease it.

When you increase a liability you credit it and debit it to decrease it.

What confuses people is that they operate a bank account and when they pay money in, you think of crediting your account. This is from the bank's point of view because you gave/loaned the bank the money and a loan is a liability. The bank increases the liability by crediting your account because you're a creditor.

I do not know who is teaching you, but they have it backwards. Unless they are talking from a religious poverty point of view.
Companies are in business to make a profit. Profit is the goal of every business (except for a non-profit business). A loss is not an asset it is a loss, it is also not a liability. A loss is not a good thing. An Asset is a good thing. 
Ask whomever is teaching you to explain what they are telling you. You want to ask them WHY they are saying that.

What would happen if we the people only purchased items made in United States?



OK, I'm not a hateful person, or racist and I understand the need to work to survive, so for any non-Americans who may read this; please don't be offended for I am a person who loves all unconditionally.
As we all know, the US economy is hurting.  I'm sure there are many ways to fix this issue, but my question is about those companies who outsource to other countries.  If these companies were to bring back the work to Americans, wouldn't that create more jobs thus stimulating the economy, as more jobs create more people with money who will in turn purchase items from stores AND it would generate money for the US in terms of exporting goods.  Would that make things worse, or better in the long run?  Would that force the outsourcing companies to bring employment back to the U.S. or has this already begun? (don't keep up with current events)



I know not everything can be made in the United States, but come on, fake American money (play money) that wasn't made in the U.S.?

For most of its history, the U.S. has been the top innovator of technology.  From agriculture, to industry, to steam technology, to cars, to today's high-tech, we have always been at the forefront.  Other countries eventually take over our older industries and produce things cheaper.  Always has been this way.



What's been going on lately is we have become compacent.  It seems we don't worry as much about creating the best - we just get what we need from others for cheap.  We don't invest in research and development (R&D) like we use to.  The Japanese use to make cheaply made toys and electronics, then cheap cars.  Now, they OWN the electronic and auto industry.  Why didn't the US come up with a hybrid car?  And better milage cars? Because we focus on the now - not the later.

We have to refocus on investing in our technology.  Maybe "Green Technology" (windmills, solar panels, biofuels, etc) to solve energy problems could be it.  But, we will never make jeans and TVs here in the US ever again.

There are several problems.

1)  We have legally binding trade agreements with other countries so if we cut back on our imports we still have to give them money but we get no product in return for it.

2)  There are jobs that most "proud" Americans simply refuse to do that people in other countries will do out of necessity or a difference in their views of what "proud" work is.

3)  More manufacturing here means more pollution here.

4)  MANY of the materials used in the manufacture of our products are more widely available in other countries and it's FAR less expensive to process them and use them there than it is to ship them here for use in manufacturing.

A wonderful idea but sadly not possible anymore. We have outsourced too many manufacturing jobs and no longer have the ability to be wholly self sufficient. It would take a herculean effort to re-tool and bring all those jobs home so we could actually have goods available that are entirely made here from the ground up.

I'm pretty sure that a small percentage of the money spent goes to the company as well.
Otherwise, bands wouldnt really need a record company.
But then, that could be the reason why so many bands make their own labels.
Remember that people do still buy Cds.
Its actually having the Cd thats a part makes it a bit different from download.
And, you can lend it to people, spreading the music.

I dont know Asda, but Morrisons starts on £5.22 per hour if i remember correctly. Its the same for any time of day, apart from night shifts, which start at 10pm and finish at 6am, they get paid a bit more.
On sundays you get paid time and a half (About £7.60 per hour)

Sorry, its not asda, but it'll be about the same and at least now you can compare!

Shares and stock help please



I looked at Google Finance UK. I searched for Microsoft. It says shares - 9,151.00M. Is this how many shares are in the company? And is one share £25.44?
If I wanted to buy all of its shares do I have to multiply, 9,151.00M by 25.44? Also How do I know how many shares are in a company?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Try http://uk.finance.yahoo.com and search for a specific company, go to company's profile and it says 'Number of Shares'. They provide information on share price (current and historical), day's volume (how many shares changed hands that day), and of course they say how many outstanding share the company has (that's what you're looking for).
Another way to get a number of outstanding share is take company capitalisation value and divide it by share price, you'll roughly get the desired number.

they're just looking for somebody who is cheerful, confident and committed to providing great customer service. Just relax and be yourself. Listen carefully to the questions and don't worry about taking a few seconds to think about them. The other big thing is honesty and loyalty, i.e. you're not going to steal or commit fraud...?

I knew an Amway dealer personally years ago. If all things are the same as then-here is what I thought. They used the excuse for their overpricing to be that it is concentrated and delivered to your house. I have to go to the store anyway and it isnt that hard to pickup cleaning supplies while im there, I even enjoy shopping to get out of the house. I dont think Amway is worth the extra price, just my opinion.

What is the organisational structure of any large company?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



This will depend upon the company's philosophy. Some companies go for a tall structure. Level 1 with the managing director Level 2  the Assistant Director who reports to Level 1, Level 3  the Group Manager, reports to Level 2 and so on. This structure could have eight or more levels before the botttom level which is the factory floor workers.
Other companies prefer a flatter structure with on Level 1 the Managing Dorector. Level 2 could have four or five Heads of Divisions, all reporting to Level 1. Below these Heads of Divisions on Level 3 would be the assistant Heads of Divisions, each reporting to their respective bosses, and so on to the level where you have the factory floor workers. Usually there would be only three to four levels in this flatter structure.

Lloyds may offer to pay cash or its shares to existing Hbos shareholders. The amount of cash or lloyds shares to be given to Hbos shareholders will be determined after due diligence calculations of Hbos financial. Normally, the awards will be higher than the price of Hbos shares quoted at the stock market.

id Lovering (born 1961) is an American musician and magician. He is best known as the drummer for the alternative rock band Pixies, which he joined in 1985. After the band's breakup in 1993, Lovering drummed with several other acts, including The Martinis, Cracker, Nitzer Ebb and Tanya Donelly. He also pursued a magic career, performing scientific and physics-based experiments on stage. When the Pixies reunited in 2004, Lovering returned as the band's drummer. As a drummer Lovering was inspired by bands from a variety of genres, including Rush and Steely Dan. His musical style while in the Pixies was highly acclaimed by critics. Author Ben Sisario described him as the "great unacknowledged anchor" of the band, and stated that his unique influences gave "a precision and versatility essential to following Black Francis's songwriting quirks". However, since the band's breakup, Lovering has received fewer critical accolades for his musical output. (more...)

It depends on what information you already have as their rates are normally based per hour plus expenses.  I would subscribe first to a site such as ancestry.com that will aid you in finding last known location and in some states parents, birth date, etc.  All this information will make it easier for the detective to locate the person and cheaper for you.

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



If you are looking at financial assistance then you will have to submit a detailed business plan.
If the bank thinks the business is viable then they will give you loans at an initially preferential rate.
If they think the business is not viable then you will get no help.

At the moment, with the credit crunch etc, the likelihood is that you will get no help at all.

I am offered employment contract but this I would sign with dutch location of the company, although this company is also present in UK. I would be living and working in UK so:
1) Is this legal ? (do I have to be employed by UK site rather then dutch site?)
2) Is this suspicious from HMRC perspective ?

Yes it is legal.
From an HMRC perspective, you would pay tax and national insurance as normal in the UK as that is where you are resident.

As the majority of employment law is (supposed to be) the same across Europe then there should be no issues there. To be honest, if you are on a Dutch contract you are probably better off as they do have better employee protection.

I know it.  CEO's are getting multi million dollar golden parachutes while everyone else just gets screwed.  It will never die as long as greed prevails.  And what about all the people who have lost their homes to the mortgage crisis that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae helped create?  I think the CEO's of those companies should have to let those people stay in their humongous mansions.

The first place to look is the company's own web site.  Do a search for "Annual Report".  If you can find one on the web site it will have the financial statements of the corporation.

The next place to look is the web site of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Every public corporation in the US must file a detailed annual report with the SEC and the SEC puts them on their web site.

Hope this helps

Its easy! You just need to follow your heart and do what you know is right in your heart. Greedy people are people with no real talent of their own, they need to use others in order to get teh rewards of such talents. If you do your own thing, for the RIGHT reasons - you will be gaurenteed success. This is even noted in the bible. I mean, who REALLY wants to work in the corporate world? Its a limbo place for people who are to afraid to follow their own talents

That is a good question.  I wish I knew a good answer.  Even if there was a good answer to your question, not everyone would be on the same page.  In a Bruce Springsteen song from the 70's, it says, "Poor man wanna be rich, rich man wanna be king, and a king aint satisfied till he rules everything."  And that's the truth.

Since we are quoting Bruce Springsteen



Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.

Or .....Remember this one......



But be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them.

From Kansas
Columbus sailed the ocean blue 
To see what he would fine 
With visions of another world 
They said he'd lost his mind



But when he told them of the land he'd found 
A land so rich with gold 
To get the treasures on the other side 
They left the lad of old to



(Chorus) 
Get rich now 
Get rich now 
Get rich now 
Get rich now



Napoleon thought that he could be 
The ruler of it all 
The things he wanted were so very big 
But he was very small



They spread the word throughout the land 
That he would soon be king 
But his greed and pride got in the way 
And he lost everything to



(Chorus)



Oh the president and the generals 
Are getting ready for a war 
The only thing that they don't know 
Is what they're fighting for



They shine their suits of armor 
And they tell us to prepare 
While they take wealth and freedom 
And just leave us standing there



Get rich now

Test one two test.....Right,  that's a wrap....

You redefine the meaning so that it suits your circumstance.

You are rich if .... (fill in the gaps with what describes you)
You are powerful if ... (fill in the gaps with what describes you)

Manipulation and deception is not evil if it for good purposes.  Greed itself is relative.  We all have to feel some greed, otherwise we would starve ourselves to death.

Simple.



Be who you are, that is how you become yourself.

Apparently they are in good shape and worth buying shares in.They are into oil exploration.The shares seem very cheap @ 5c each.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



They do look cheap but equally they have come down by c50% in the last month and have been in the 5c-10c per share price range since 2004.  Looks like a quick way to make or lose money.  You could strike it rich if they do something spectacular (they were at 50c briefly in 2000 on the back of some good news) but unless you want to play an intraday arb play based on views on oil prices I'd stay clear.

Is eBay's ownership of Paypal unfair to sellers?



eBay owns Paypal. That means that sellers might find the total selling fees of an item amounting to close to 10% of the final value. Sellers can offer alternative forms of payment but are obliged to offer Paypal (convenient for eBay). Is this fair?

<asker's comment>



Very true. However, they don't include postage in calculating final value fees in eBay. But they do claw some of that back when using Paypal. Think I'll just be an eBay buyer from now on and find another channel for selling, e.g. Gumtree?

</answer from>



<answer>



The owners of these companies are the shareholders. They have no further responsibility once they have paid for their shares. The directors of the company have responsibilities for the prudent management of the affairs of the company. They are responsible to the shareholders.

Shareholders do have a responsibility to themselves and as such ought to attend annual general meetings of the company. This should be to ensure the directors are doing their jobs and if not to replace them.

The key word here  is analyse. This means that you need to carefully look at the individual parts and make sense of them by your explanation. It does not necessarily require you to draw conclusions, or extrapolate.

The following is an extract from the link below:

Flexible working arrangements
The standard work day is 7 hours and 35 minutes

The Federal Magistrates Court of Australia provides a range of flexible working arrangements to encourage a work/life balance. These include:

the availability of flextime provisions for most staff (up to 40 hours can be accumulated), and time-in-lieu provisions for executive staff (up to 12 days per year where excess work hours are significant)



up to 4 weeks additional leave can be purchased by receiving a lower salary throughout the year



part-time work arrangements are available as either a permanent working arrangement or to meet a particular short term need



home based work where circumstances permit



##################################
The implications of the above are that this gives employees the opportunity to take extended leave if they have a need to travel overseas for instance. A husband could use this facility when his wife had a child so that he could help out during the first few weeks prior to or after the child's birth.



The second link below will take you to a site which outlines the terms and conditions of employment with that organisation.

i don't think Lloyds TSB staff have anything to worry about. Something similar happened when the dreaded Halifax took over the old Leeds Building society. All Halifax were safe, however, a lot of the old Leeds staff were constantly moved around; offered voluntary redundancy etc etc, they were treated pretty bad I can tell you.

I wouldn't worry at all if I were you...... unless you are an HBOS employee!!!!

Inflation figures are the results of price index of commodities during a relative period of time, in case the prices of commodities is increasing then inflation figures will go up and vice versa,



As far as the financial and Business  sector are concerned the over all economy is affected by the price index, of commodities, in case prices will go up demand for commodities will decrease and central bank will tighten the monetary policiy again increasing the interest rates to control the price rise, if demand for commodities will increase then sale of commodities will decrease , un employement will increase, poverty will increase, savings will decrease, purchasing power will decrease all this will put bad effect over the over all business and financial sector.

<answer>



Inflation increases the Price of commodities, these commodities include Raw Materials too.



Thus Business Org involved in Manufacturing get affected by rising Raw Materials Prices as their Cost of Production Increases.



Inflation also puts a burden on Financial Regulators and Banks, in controlling the Circulation of Money in the Economy.
RBI 's increase in CRR and SLR rates, pressurizes the Commerical Banks on their lending capabilities.
When business org are in financial pressure, it impacts their share value, which inturn brings down the Portfolio Indicators like Sensex and Nifty.

Partnership business is were you form a joint corporation as a limited partnership. This can be with two brothers, three like minded people or an investor and the company. Partnerships are for dividing the profits on an agreed percentage. Or losses on an agreed percent. Partnership is for growing the company and is a protection to the owners. The more partners the more input,balances, checks,and better management.
Partnership is a legal and binding contract and to break this contract you would lose profit sharing with company and all legal options within the company. There are clauses that can be written in the Partnership contract about peanalties and monatary loss with breaking the partnership agreement.



One down side to breaking a partnership is how the profits will be distrubited and paid out. If a partner dies then there has to a clause in the contract that says where that person share in company will go and who would be his, or her, replacement. This is a lawyers dream contract because you must protect the company and the partnership from every angle. If you lose profit income then partnership holdings will be sold to raise money. There are salery caps on new partners. There are hours worked vs profits sharing.A partnership is to protect a fast growing company and lets more people have management departments  which will have more employees wanting to become limited partners. You see this large legal teams, Trucking companies and doctors clinics who are profit oriented.I am a partner in an Electrical Engineering firm and I really enjoy the teamwork. Each department carries so many projects and all profits from each contract is shared on a percentage. If John's Federal contract makes 800 thousand dollars then that money is clear profit and goes into the partnership gross income and devided by the number of partners. It also goes the other way. Johns next job lost 800 thousand dollars and that money is pulled from the partners debit account and John is put on notice with that loss. In a partnership you want to have partners that are conpetitivee and want to make a certain percent profit on everything they touch. Our partnership has a twenty-five percent profit built into each contract and you want to try and double that profit by being very efficient at what contracts you design and build.
I recommend partnerships for fast growing companies.

When you socialize with someone face to face- there is an important connection that is made.  We are able to make first impressions and pick up factors about that person that we could not distinguish from through a computer.  For example, we can see the persons body language (are they stand off ish? friendly?) and make interpretations through the way they speak, tone of their voice, and how they present themselves.

i was actually talking about this with my mom earlier, she told me it all starts with the real estate industry. how banks owned a bunch of houses that people couldn't pay the mortgages on, so the people went bankrupt. then the banks had a BUNCH of houses sitting around that people couldn't afford, and about a hundred thousand dollars of the banks money was attached to each house. since no one could pay for the houses, the banks had to keep borrowing money from other banks to keep their operation going. well eventually there was no more money to borrow, and they went bankrupt and sold out. I'm sure that's not the only reason, but I'm pretty sure its a big one, i remember watching a segment on 60 minutes about how horrible the real estate industry was getting a while back.
