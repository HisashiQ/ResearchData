Whatever happened to 84%?



</question>



<additional details>



The 9/11 deniers' NYC ballot initiative has failed. Their objective was to get the 30,000 signatures required to put on New York ballots a measure to create a new, in-state 9/11 Commission. They got a mere 27,000 - in a city of eight million. This puts the number of people who agree with the 9/11 deniers at roughly 0.375% of the city's population, and an abysmally tiny fraction if we count the entire metropolitan area's population of 40,000,000.

This sample is large enough to extrapolate trends to the larger population (n=8,000,000 in this case, far above the *thirty* you generally need for a solid n).

9/11 cultists - your thoughts? Whatever happened to 84%?



What say you?



Bang- I am smart enough to know the lies being spready by you morons.

Bang- That was revealed to be a goofup by the BBC or whoever reported that the hijackers to be alive.  Alot of people in the middle east have VERY similar names.



BANG- I have looke at Your fabricated evidence, and the REAL Evidence and came to my own conclusion.



Bang- They did not look just like them.  Stop listening to Alex Jones, and look at real evidence for the truth.

Your conspiracy theories have more holes than swiss cheese.



Bang- Pull it does not mean what you think it means.  Under the demolition industry it means to literally pull a building down by cables, NOT blow it up.  WTC 7 was definitely not pulled down by cables, and so it was obvious that he was talking about the firefighters.  Besides, Larry Silverstein does not have that kind of authority. Once the fire department have control of the building they dont have to get permission from the owner.

EDIT NUMBER 2: Do they have twins with the same name as well, that look just like them?



EDIT NUMBER 3- PULL IT? WHAT DID YOUR BOY LARRY MEAN? HE LATER TRYED TO COVER IT UP BY SAYING HE MEANT THE FIRFIGHTERS BUT THE FIREFIGHTERS WERE OUT OF THE BUILDING AT 11 OCLOCK. AND THAT WAS FROM FEMA

Americans can inquire in regard to any issue whenever they feel like it; whether or not they are deemed a conspiracy nut lies within the beholder of that opinion. (addition; if that effort costs them their life, liberty or pursuit of happiness--then they are living in an authoritarian regime). In fact, the founding fathers of this nation stated very clearly that responsibility of the citizenship.

If even one American begins to inquire, their right to do so is covered under the Constitution.

Great question!!



If I were you just ignore the people who want to believe the 911 conspiracy theorists.



They are stupid enough to fall for that BS then they also must believe that the hijackers are still alive and that Israel and the US were in on the whole scam as well.



If you believe that, you truly need professional help.



Just stay away from the quackadoodle shrinks they are only in it for the money only and to drug you up and goose you up the you know what!

Way to go, put those ignorant people down who hate America anyway, let them lie in their own bed since they made it themselves.



Obama will lose anyway so I can't wait to hear them scream racism after the election LOL.

I think America had a knee jerk reaction that we are paying for with our freedoms.  In the initial couple months after TWC2 congress had a vote on the "Patriot Act."  Only one person had the balls to stand up and say this was totally against what we as a nation stood for.  To that senator I congratulate you.  However, at the same time I must apologize because I'm sure it cost you your seat.



No it wasn't necessary, and no it wasn't "allowed" by our government or the Israelis.  However, I would rather sacrifice a couple thousand than lay down the freedoms that several hundred thousand have earned for us.

It was necessary from the perspective of the criminals involved.

Some of the reasons are covered in Mike Ruppert's 9/11 film about peak oil, geopolitics, criminality in government, evidence for government foreknowledge in 9/11, and the exploitation of 9/11 to induce us to accept the war plans.

The Truth & Lies Of 9/11

http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...

Watch carefully at the end. Ruppert only briefly discusses global government before the film ends. If you miss that, you might mistake the message to mean the wars are about peak oil and not global government.

No 'necessity'. for it at all though it was, perhaps, inevitable. As long as we have religion and people thinking they are 'special' because they believe in, say, 'the great green banana in the sky' we will have 'religious' wars. Religions only  succeed because they indoctrinate young and sometimes feeble minded people with the belief that they are 'chosen' or 'elite' in some way.

We would not be in the situation where World governments, especially the UK and Yankee ones, are reducing the average citizens civil rights and freedoms.

Seems to me that any foreign national, even those from the yanks friends in the UK, are treated like criminals when they merely want to holidays in the States.

This is especially annoying since our government was fooled into an illegal war by Bush and we also have to pay for it.

They're also anti gay and lesbian and they don't even care to which party that particular group of people belongs. They're also anti anything not christian, as in Muslims. I do agree with your statement and sometimes I even think it's not so much about being 'conservative' as it is anti democrat. The venom that drips from some of the questions and answers is amazing.

Being a conservative is about the "American Dream". Conservatives only want everyone to have a chance to realize their potential. That means fewer restrictions and keeping your own money. That unfortunately is very anti-liberal. Liberal tend to want to tax people and redistribute the money as they think is right. They also don't want people to excel at things so that they become dependent on the liberal government for their daily needs. The people on the far sides of the political spectrum are 180 degrees apart on their thinking. As I started my adulthood, I was very much on the left side. As I have gotten older and more experienced, I see that conservative ideas work towards a society that has more personal freedom to do what you choose in life as long as it contributes to society's betterment. Conservatives tend to do more charity work either by volunteering or donating. Conservative groups were some of the first to go to the hurricane Katrina area and volunteer. Groups like Moveon.org just sat back and complained the government did not do enough. Conservatives just want to you have a chance to be the best you can be at something constructive. Conservatives believe we are living in the greatest country in the world and are very tired of hearing it constantly being belittled. What made this country great is the entrepuniarial spirit that allowed people to lift themselves up economically, socially, and spiritually. That is what conservatives want for you and everyone else. I could go on quite awhile but I tried to put that in a nutshell for you and I hope it helps you understand. One more example. Minumum wage raises were stopped during the Reagan years. At the time I was very dependent on those increases to achieve a better economic situation. However, I came to realize the raises were hurting the very people they were supposed to be helping. Grocery stores had to raise their prices because of federally mandated raise in the cost of doing business. Other stores that had minumum wage workers also had to raise their prices such as department stores. In the end, I was slowly losing my earning power. By freezing the raises and letting the market decide what was fair pay for services, I actually started getting ahead with real raises instead of artificial ones.

Fascism is very good for those able to be in charge.  They can completely control every aspect of their people such as number of children per family, pollution controls, monetary value, gymnast age, access to the Internet, etc.

There is a downside for the masses, of course, but such is outside the bounds of the question at hand.

You can control and restrain the people better and keep them less politically active and so you can succeed the minority agenda. I think that is why Republicans love doing business with them., both fallow a minority agenda with the people.

Totalitarian capitalism is a formidable concept. Anyone who has been following China's capitalist explosion of the past 20 years can see the advantage.

Plus, their political system provides excellent cover for the fact that they have abandoned communism. That distracts ideologues, and keeps them from noticing China's capitalist explosion.

Good question. The queen is the biggest muppet has she has no true authority as she is only a figurehead.

The fundamental root of ALL wars is scarcity of natural resources (either perceived or actual).  Every major war can be boiled down to this.

Interestingly enough, this principle extends outside the human race and explains war in the animal kingdom.

Edit: For those after me that have or will name religion, religion is not a cause of war.  Religion is used by leaders to mobilize their populations to war, but once again the root cause is the desire to control natural resources.  (E.g. the crusades where not started by religion.  They were started over control of Constantinople, an extremely valuable trade port.)

The Olympics have opened up great avenues of dialog with hostile countries. The US ping pong team was first to go to China.

How would Michael Phelps have stopped the Russia invasion of Georgia? Do you really think if the USA won the swimming over Russia the Russians would have left Georgia?

War is about the aggressive use of force when diplomacy fails.

And neo-cons do not take over the world, they liberate people from dictators, while liberals protest and spit on the troops. When is the last time the USA took over a country?

Bleeding heart liberals fight the liberation, and side with dictators, and terrorists, fighting to keep their people oppressed.

It definitely is.  It is politicians who start wars.

Every time we go to war, our politicians should be in the front lines.  You lead from the FRONT.

By the way Incarcerated Bert, Religion does not start wars, or kill people.  It is politicians disguised as religious leaders who do these things.  It is really all about power.

"War is the continuation of politics by other means." - von Clausewitz.

War is a political act.  And the Olympics have been used to further international politics: Hitler wanted to show Aryan superiority in 1936, Munich massacre in 1972, American boycott of the 1980 Moscow games and Soviet boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles games.

It"s not the politicians, but the people behind the politicians.
Think who benefit from "the war on terror" and wars in general.

The bankers. who finance both sides, and the armament industries who sell arms to both sides.

That and only that is the reason there will always be wars in our World.
99% of the people want to "live in peace".

Yes I did. One time I answered a Q of someone who was undecided about 9/11 conspiracies and starred it. One of my contacts, 'who's a truther unfortunately, came starred it too and then it started. In ten minutes I had ten thumbs down for pointing out the errors of the truth movement and how wrong they are. That's just one example of many where these "seekers of truth" attempted to silence the competition (five nett thumbs down and the answer is hidden due to low rating). I never call them names, not even mention tinfoil hats ever, or make dumb jokes but confront them with logic, show the other side and they try to silence me instead of answering and refuting my claims. I even got some hatemail after that episode calling me names and so on.

Another example seven thumbsdown while they don't do the same to the people who just call them tinfoilers. Really makes you think

I have found that on sites such as Topix, the so called truthers do not ask questions, they tell us that common sense is wrong, & that some elaborate conspiracy theory, such as the government blew up the twin towers & that the planes did not exist is the real way things happened! Sometimes, I think, the truth is harder for some people to accept, so it's far better to believe in something completely opposite. Look at the way Princess Diana's death caused such a debate, & how some people believe that Elvis is still alive!

"We will not hand this banner to the masters of falsification", If our generation has proven to be too weak to establish socialism on this earth, we will give its unstained banner to our children. The struggle which looms ahead by far supersedes the significance of individual people, factions and parties. It is a struggle for the future of all humanity. It will be severe. It will be long. Whoever seeks physical repose and spiritual comfort - let him step aside. During times of reaction it is easier to lean on the bureaucracy than on the truth. But for all those for whom socialism is not an empty phrase but the content of their moral life - forward! Neither threats, nor persecution, nor violence will stop us. Perhaps it will be on our bones, but the truth will triumph. We are paving the way for it, and the truth will be victorious. Under the terrible blows of fate I will feel as happy as during the best days of my youth if I can join you in facilitating its victory. For, my friends, the highest human happiness lies not in the exploitation of the present, but in the preparation of the future."

Poor Americans take the bus. This is hitting people higher & it needs to hit the republicans who make more money so they will wake up casue they don't care unless it hits them. I have a friend who is a millionaire & it has hit him. Before all he cared about was his taxes. He never looked at the big picture. If McCain gets in office the pattern will just continue so we might at well adjust to it now. It is summer time but when winter gets her & the poor people who are biking to work & will have to take a bus or walk or bike in the winter will quit their jobs. I see it where I live the min. wage workers now are just not working. It isn't worth it. Republican McCain/Bush/etc. are out to get the working people they want us all begging for a job the way it has always been for the lowest level so they are raising the bar. I don't know what Salazar said I just gave you my answer. If my rich friends pay $10 now they are not insane. Insanity is doing the same thing & expecting different results so they won't vote for McSame.

the patriot take the arm of the blind man, and guides him past the dogshit and lies, to the truth and safety.

I guess Patriotism is being proud of what your country is, holds and represents. A way of saying look... here is my country... I am proud to be a citizen.

Blind Patriotism is, I would think, being patriotic for the sake of being patriotic. I love England, not because of our history, culture or our amazing ability to produce a world class football team who can't play as a team, but simply because of the fact we are "EEEENNGLISH!!" (Followed by many deep shouts and jibes. The odd burp and clink of mug, with a racist comment thrown in here or there.)

Why would I be ashamed to be British??

My country has an history dating back thousands, not hundreds of years. My ancestors arrived here in the 10th century, not the 17th.

My Grandfather fought in WW1, my Father in WW2, me in Northern Ireland & the Falklands, my son serves now with 5 tours in Iraq & Afghan under his belt.

The only thing I'm ashamed of is what this country has been turned into over the last 11 years of New Labour rule - a total sh!thole.

I think what America has said is "Get out of Georgia". This seems appropriate to me given the situation. I agree, there must be a much stronger response if they ignore us.

Strategically, it is very important to resolve this without giving an inch.

Uninformed liberals will ask why, so here are a couple to chew on:
- Georgia is one of many former soviet states that they seek to reconquer, who's next?
- The oil pipeline in Georgia is only one going to Western Europe that is not controlled by Russia. Can you say blackmail?

By all means lets stop talking to our enemies and countries and leaders we don't like. Maybe we can make the world or US safer that way. Maybe the government can build a great big wall around the US and not see or talk to anyone we disagree with. Personally I want to hear and see everything that goes on. I want to hear everything the enemy has to say.

I'm going to guess the 'average' American doesn't know what's going on.  The average American is more concerned with paying their mortgage, staying healthy, raising kids, etc.  Most Americans probably have NO IDEA what we are doing globally beyond what they occasionally glimpse on CNN.

I voted once in my life in 1987  for  ahem, " Maggie Thatcher" (I was young and naive) when I was 19 because I could. I have never voted since that day in ANY general election.

No I did not vote Labour EVER!

Beastie, my not voting is never going to change any fact about taxes since we are run by an unelected EU parliament.
I don't vote because there is nothing to vote for. Might as well be in a 2 party dictatorship.
Now Brown is "listening" I will be more ignored than ever. Get real, the right to vote just keeps you tranquilised into thinking you have a say in anything. This "right" you talk about and defend is the laughing ice breaker at No. 10 dinner parties.
I will vote for the government that is fit to vote for. I will not settle for voting on the dross we get on election ballots.
My non vote is a vote!

I've only ever, according to older relatives, wasted my vote.

Of course, now that the SNP runs Scotland, my vote is for the governing party and is no longer 'wasted.'

Funnily enough, I can't find anyone who'll admit to having voted for Labour now. I have found one or two who'll happily state they've voted BNP though. 
How the country has changed, when Labour supporters hide and the hateful BNP are proud to show their colours.

If I had a choice of who to vote for, and it had to be Labour or the BNP... or anyone and the BNP, frankly... I'd vote for anyone.



Thumbsup... not voting in any general election is hardly something to boast about. I bet you still moan about taxes though, as if you've got the right.
You don't vote, you don't have ANY right to moan when the government does stuff you don't like.

I freely admit it was me.

We had to get rid of the vile, treacherous corruption that was in power at the time .. The Tory Party. You were too young at the time to perhaps appreciate this.

There are some good archive films of thousands upon thousands of relieved and hope-full people thronging the streets when New Labour got in.

The problem is that that same corruption is just under the surface still .. called Thatcherism.

So, historically we had to rid the country of that stink; unfortunately corruption spreads especially when there is an ineffectual leader.

New Labour are now corrupt, the Tory Party still is not clean, so where do we go from here.

Thatcher gives advice to both parties, and they listen.

Rather than posing a smug question that has just occurred to you, why not tell us who in your estimation is the next best bet?.

England became The United Kingdom of Great Britain in 1701 with the signing of the Articles of Union that formally joined England and Scotland....the result was Britain as exemplified by the Union Jack (flag), which combines the Cross of St. George (patron saint of England who slew the dragon)
and the cross of St. Andrew, patron of Scotland, to create the double crossed flag we know as the Union Jack.

I didn't know they did lol. Unless they are Americans, in which case we are all English!! 
Seriously, when I was at school (long time ago) we were taught all about the differing nations that made up this country, no one nation was given preference, in fact the emphasis was placed on being British and how each nation constituted the whole. 
Today we are encouraged to think of our "own" nations, to disrespect those from the others, and to question ourselves as to what being "British" means.
This is a shame in my view, because we finally overcame our differences to form the Union which gave us strength, and now we are divided once more we are more interested in arguing amongst ourselves than defending our country. Divide and conquer, divide and rule, your very good Q highlights this.

It is really a case of ignorance, even among our own population.

The British Isles consist of two largish islands - Great Britain and Ireland, together with many smaller islands such as Shetland, Orkney, Inner and Outer Hebrides, Anglesey, Isle of Wight, etc.
Therefore, technically, all the natives of those islands are British and this does include the Southern Irish Republic.

The islands are separated into two major independent countries - "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" and "The Republic of Ireland".



The Isle of Man also has some independence.

Great Britain is essentially composed of two Kingdoms - England and Scotland. Wales is only a Principality and is part of the Kingdom of England.
Northern Ireland is classed as a Province of the United Kingdom.

I suspect that such niceties would be lost on foreigners, particularly the introspective Americans, who seem to think that theirs is God's own country, but that is another can of worms entirely.



Their confusion could be caused by the fact that the seat of Government of the United Kingdom is actually situated in England.

England created the union (rightly or wrongly) 55 million live in England,5 million in Scotland,3.5 million in Wales,and 1.5 million in NI.
So when people think of Britain they think sometimes England Ist,then maybe Scotland than Wales than NI.Not maliciously,but absentmindedly.
When someone asks you to name a state in the USA,you don't mention Maryland Ist do you,instead it would probably be the most populous states ie NY or California or Florida

An EXCELLENT  question, I think many British believe it is "fair play" to hand the UK over to waves of immigrants. They think it is "fair play" to give up real British ethnicity and national identity. We are the laughing stock of the world as a result. The BBC think it is "fair play" to be obsessive with multiculturism and to have a disproportionate number of Asian , African and other  foreign ethnic groups working as on-camera staff including programmes for toddlers, this is a deliberate attempt to mind control  the real British  and is NOT fair play to the real British

USA. Georgia. Russia & Obama.?



Did the US give the "green light" to Georgia to invade the self proclaimed autonomous republic of South Ossetia in the knowledge that it would cause a Russian intervention which would be highly unlikely to escalate, but which would wrong-foot Obama by making the American people think about the dangers of electing an inexperienced Democrat as President. Does anyone think that we shall see similar "dirty tricks" over the next few months?



</question>



<additional details>



Iceman. South Ossetia is in the same position as the US secessionist States at the time of the civil war.
No weed!!  Remember there is evidence that the US deliberately misled Saddam into thinking that the US would not intervene if Iraq invaded Kuwait.



Stephen S. So far as I know both the oil and gas pipe-lines have re-opened. According to BP there was little operational disturbance.



ladyshon. You fundamentally misunderstand the situation and need to do some reading. So far as I am aware California does not want independence from the US (although it might be better off ) South Ossetia is an autonomous part of Georgia protected by Russia. I don't think there can be any doubt that a Russian defence of S. Ossetia was justified. The problem is the atrocities which have subsequently been carried out.

I think Georgia made a big mistake and gave Russia the chance to start to claim back the USSR and start to hang a new iron curtain.  Russia would also like to control the oil pipline in Georgia.
It is nothing to do with US giving Georgia a green light.  I am however very concerned about who will become president in the US as I don't think either of the candidates have what it takes to become a world leader.

so once again, America stinks and everyone else is right. tiresome. or do you think this was actually done so that it would make obama look bad.  insane. russia had this in the plans for a long time now.

here it is in a nutshell.

what Putin has done out of mostly revenge and muscle flexing is the equivalent of him saying that California should be free and separate from the USA. all people of mexican dissent will be issues Mexican passports and then will declare that they are under his protection. they declared their independence from the USA. then he sends in 10,000 'peacekeepers' to protect their rights. he kills or jails anyone who opposes him.

when some of the people in California do not want their 'peacekeepers; and trouble starts over this fact, he sends in his overpowering troops, weapons, and bombs everything in site and the people with it. then he goes on to nevada and arizona and occupies them too.

this is the basic scenario. if you lived in CA, would you think it a good thing.

No.  Distributing passports to people in another country, which in no way makes them citizens of that country, just so you can invade a country based on 'protecting Russians' is one of the most transparent and immature ploys I've ever seen on the world stage.  It's pathetic that there are people who actually fell for it.

So you captured the U-505, no ones disputing that fact, even if some get confused, usually due to lack of research.
just so long as you americans dont claim to be the ones claiming credit for capturing the first enigma machine thats all
May 9, 1941: British destroyers capture German U-Boat U-110. The British take a naval version of the secret cipher machine known as Enigma, and let the boat sink to keep the fact of their boarding secret. The Enigma machine, used by the Kriegsmarine to encode and decode messages, was taken to Bletchley Park, where cryptographers succeeded in breaking the naval code. Several versions of the Enigma machine existed, but the working principle - a rotor system activated using a keyboard - was the same. The Enigma used by the German army was decrypted in 1932 by Polish cryptographers.

I think it maybe confusion about the capture of the enigma machine,the British retrieved one from a sub much earlier and were already cracking the German codes,but the film implied the Americans got one first.

If you are asking  if  the moderators are a bit  harsh



then, Yes, I asked for opinions on an article written  by Thomas Sowell. Got a violation notice.. reason .. "not a question  or  an answer"..



The title of  my inquiry was , "This  is scary  but true.. Whats your opinion?"
 Is  that  not a question ? I thought asking people  for different opinions  WAS  a question..
 I wanted to hear different opinions  on the piece.
 What  was wrong  with  that as



to qualify  it as  not  a question ?

I think the most important positions are mothers AND fathers. Raising the next generation and instilling values has got to be the most important, most difficult and most unrewarding job in the entire world. If you're lucky, it'll take about 18 years of working non-stop 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to see if you were successful. Often it takes a lot longer.

If an Iraqi could do it, why not Obama?



Short article worth reading...

A top Iraqi official visited wounded American troops at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., Tuesday to thank them for their part in ending Saddam Hussein’s rule in his country.
“We have come … to express our gratitude and appreciation for the sacrifices made by these great warriors, soldiers, in freeing the Iraqi people and in helping us in Iraq recover from tyranny and dictatorship,” Jawad Karim al-Bolani, Iraq’s minister of the interior, said through a translator to a handful of journalists in the lobby of the medical center.
“We also want to express our gratitude to the families of all these great men and women and express how important their sacrifices are for our nation,” he added.

Bolani’s visit with troops comes on the heels of Sen. Barack Obama’s (D-Ill.) recent trip to the Middle East, where the Democratic presidential candidate caused a stir when he canceled a planned visit to wounded American soldiers.

Funny, I have seen a question asking why conservatives give thumbs down for facts.  That is EXACTLY what liberals are doing on this answer.

The Earth...get yourself a little education.  Google the death rate in Iraq (FROM ALL CAUSES) in the years 2000 and 2005 and 2006.  Considering that there is war going on, and your "more reliable sources" say that the war has killed almost 4% of them, tell me why the death rate from all causes is lower NOW than it was in 2000.  Considering that the death rate from all causes is less than the 4% you blame this war for causing, I would say that you are WAY OFF BASE.  Consider that the rate went from 6.25 per 1000 per year in 2000 to 5.5 deaths per 1000 per year in 2005 and 2006, and in order for 1 million to die over a 5 year stretch it would take over 7 deaths per 1000 per year from ALL causes.  Now tell me that this war has killed over 1 million.

Obama has been to walter reid several times its one of the reason s they are in trouble for the poor conditions and he does much to h elp get the troops benefits, unlike greedy McCain who reicieves his and wants to keep the poor military over there and wants them to stay 12yrs before getting school paid for, thats sick, thats llike going from K-12 th grade and then be 40 when they can get college!  Somwone needs to check there facts.  McBlame has plenty to criticise ,becuz he has nothing to offer and does  not want people to know what a low life he is.  He wants wvery nickel and breath of life from anyone he can get it from for free.  www.barackobama.com  check out his veteran plan.  He was told by the pentagon not to go, besides criticising I just wonder how many people have actually sent goods to our troops or just expect someone to lead this  nation to worry about it, since our  president does not even make sure they have adaquiate food and wants them to pay for thier  own medical insurance when they are injured, maybe that is relly something more to talk about

It's funny - I don't remember reading any articles about "top" American officials going to visit the thousands of wounded Iraqi civilians and military personnel (those that are assisting the American troops).

This question puts even YA elections on a new low. Please take it down. I am embarrassed for you.



The worst part is the tyranny and dictatorship part. You are delusional if you think anybody except the new dicatators we appointed did not prefer the relative peace and prosperity of Saddam Hussein to the minimum 600,000 people killed since we occupied. More reliable estimate have us passing a million 8 months ago. That is 1 in 28 people that lived in Iraq. Over 3 million are wounded. We hung Saddam for killing 2000 Kurds that were at war with him. It was deserved because it is against the Geneva convention to do it with chemicals. But it is also against the law to kill one civilian if they have not attacked your country. Oh forget it You would never consider the truth.

/ The Media has turned on Obama.  He called them LIARS.

Cameras weren't allowed where the wounded troops were staying.  This was reported by the Media covering Obama.

At his press conference, Obama said the media was there, and knew cameras were allowed in.  He used them at his press conference to call them Liars.  Big mistake!

No big deal, the troops didn't get to see him in person, but there was plenty of coverage of his 3-pointer at the gym (with his arms raised in the air afterwords, "Look at me! Look at me!).

All of which Maggie Thatcher would have loved to have done; it was called Thatcherism.  If Candid Cameron gets into power, there's every chance that his policies will be called Cameronism.  So, working on the basis that anyone called Thatcher must be embarrassed  to have to state their name, my first act as PM would be to allow everyone called Cameron to change their name to save embarrassment.

No war is okay, all wars are hell. Wars are never justifiable. It's just the super greed of some super rich bastards who think it's ok to make money out of war, and they manage to dumb people down into believing wars are ok, and the poor must go fight to "protect" their country, or the "evil terrorist" will kill them, or force them convert to islamism, wear a bhurka, take away their freedom and democracy.
It's so sad you fall for this propaganda, that wars are okay.

i think they are both justified. our goal is to eliminate radical muslim terrorists and the threat they pose to our way of life. we chased them out of afghanistan, and found them in iraq, so why not fight them there too?

if you dont like that reason, there is always the fact that Hussien was committing genocide, killing off a group of people living within his borders because they didn't cling to his same set of beleifs. to hear the history books tell it, this is a very noble reason to go to war. it has been our justification for fighting Hitler in WW2.

and if you really want to be far-sighted, Pres. Bush never really mentioned iraq as part of his axis of evil that he talked about so often at the beginning of the war. iran was mentioned often tho. if we can gain support of the iraqis, and have established bases in the region, it sets us up beautifully to invade iran. we have a great springboard for the operation, and an american-trained ally.



so dont let the media tell you what is right and wrong, look at the facts and decide for yourself.

My answer is;
Basicly yes, in what we are "supost" to be trying to do there. We are "suspost" to be "Hunting Terrorists hahahahaahaha!" But seem to have walked into something else. 
Or was the whole thing just a smoke screen?
Where is Bin Laden?
We have been in Afganistan longer then Iraq looking for him right? (of course we did anounce to the world thats what we were going there for so why would he hang around?)
So really I'd have to say your question is at this point, a "philosophical" one. And it truly depends on the future as answer more intelleggently.

I hope I've helped ya understand.

I agree war should be avoided at all cost.  i just have to comment on one of the posts here.
what makes it ok to invade a country and set up military installations in any country?
it is a fact that the American people were lied to by the leaders but that was many years and many innocent lives ago.  there is no way to justify what is going on anymore.
as far as the media goes; only news that is approved by the government is told and then it's unreliable.
i would like to see how an American would react to having any other country set up a military installation in the US.
if you want to understand what is going on then do your own research.
when the US is attacked, then yes she should be defended but when our leaders lie and corruption is used against the citizens of this great nation then it is the right of the people to do something about it.

Young men will kill each other without knowing each others names. Son will kill brother, uncle will kill father, all in the name of the Government who pretends to represent the nation.



Every single war there has ever been, every man who has ever died because others had quarrels, has been a tragedy. Men in the Wermacht were still men. The soldiers who died defending Saddam's Iraq had families.

I presume the people who are pro-war are also pro brain death, what are they thinking? You and others make it sound like some kind of badge of honor instead of the human horror it actually is. I guess it's real easy to be pro-war when it's not your butt on the line.

I'm pro America and war to me is something used as a last resort in defense of our homeland, not in some foreign country fighting terrorists, as we did the communists in Vietnam for ten years and fifty eight thousand American lives and we walked away with what? Support any war your wish but if America is not being invaded, don't invite my son or daughter to participate in your wars.

only for self defense as our Constitution dictates...by an act of Congress.

Problem is, that our Congress has been de-balled and the Democrats are BS artists. They approve of wars when convenient (like the 9/12/2001 mentality) and then blast Bush when its politically expedient for them, even though they continue to sign the checks for more money for the war.

History will only tell if the Iraq war was right, but the media won't even mention Clinton's proxy wars via the United Nations...ala Kosovo.

The Democrats and Republicans of today are the same mouth talking on different sides....that's why Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich were the only ones on both sides who made any sense.

Democrats want war but use the U.N. Neocon Republicans want war but just go unilaterally, so choose your poison.

I hate wars, any kind of wars. Lots of people get killed but in the end nothing really has been accomplished. However, we will always have wars. It's human nature to compete and excel in order to survive. Ever since history began we had wars, little ones and big ones. Right this moment there are several going on at the same time. Two things which may help reduce global conflicts are: Have females as heads of states and the second, eliminate religion. Females tend to discuss problems, males tend to argue about problems. Regarding religion, anyone can believe in any god he/she chooses but no organized religion. More wars are started because of religion than any other causes.

Is it possible for a cruise missile to knock down 5 lamp posts and to knock a generator off its foundation, and is it possible for 136 eyewitnesses to mistake a cruise missile for a plane?

Also, the plane left a hole that is 75 feet wide.



Pre collapse



But only if it had a large wing span.  Either way it can not knock a huge generator off its foundation.



a 75 foot wide hole is big enough for a 757.

When viewed at ground level of course it may look like a missile- the knocked down poles seem to illustrate that it was either a cruise missile with super sized wings, unlike any ever seen before or a plane.

NO of course its not possible  it would have to zig zag across the ground all over the place to knock over lamposts like the 757 that hit the Pentagon did.  Which is impossible at the speed it would have to be travelling.  Ignoring of course the fact that it was clearly a PLANE lol which as you say 136 eyewitnesses have clearly said.  And why the hell would the US launch a cruise missile at themselves, never mind the Pentagon lol.  So I guess your point is arent these conspiracy theorists crazy ? And yes youre right, they are.

The Russians have always been talking on this issue. It just that they nor any other country has to answer to the US if only the US could understand this.



There are international bodies in place like the EU who the Russians have been working with on this issue and their talks have been successful with them.



From the start of this conflict to the end its taken only 10 days for all concerned to reach a cease fire and withdrawl. Yet the US & UK have been in Iraq for years and still no sign of a withdrawl, so who are we to talk on such matters :)

There was a time when we minded our own business. Then the World Wars came along. Ever since we've been involved in world affairs. I dare say that without America the world would be a lot worse off.



By the way, Russia shot itself in the foot this time. It now faces a serious backlash from the Western world. They attack Georgia, we put up missile defence system in Eastern Europe. Yeah, we're "listening" to what Russia says, and based on what I'm hearing, we have to do something about it before they attack other former SSRs.

"I have nothing to hide" has nothing to do with anything.  Those that say it know it.  However they would rather insert that shallow sound bite.

It is about protecting the Constitution.  And as you say, politics change.  Wait until a Democrat is elected President.  Republicans will be screaming for the repeal of the Patriot Act because it puts to much power in the hands of the executive office.

It already is me and all of us. The amount of information "held" about us is already staggering. Go to a store to buy something, they will ask for the first line of your address then key it into their system and hey presto up pops all your details. What I find even more staggering is that we are being brainwashed into accepting this situation in the name of personal and national security. Security?? From a government that doesn't know how many people have entered this country illegally, from a government that has opened our borders to not only the good but the dross of Europe, from a government that has no power to boot out convicted foreign nationals? Yet knowing everything about me from where I am in the country, what kind of rubbish I produce, what kind of food I buy (loyalty cards) etc ad infinitum, the nation can sleep safe in their beds? Give me a break!! 
There is only one reason behind this increasing invasion of our privacy and that is the pursuit of social control.

WASHINGTON — President Bush's agenda in Asia this week is front-loaded with trouble on the continent: nuclear worries, political repression, recovery from natural disaster.

Then comes plenty of sports.

Bush embarked Monday on his last venture as president to the Far East, a trip built around the Olympic Games in Beijing. The president stops en route at an Alaskan Air Force base to speak to military personnel and get his plane refueled, then flies through the night to South Korea.

It is a feature of modern two-term presidents that they spend their second term focusing more on foreign policy. While Bush did not fit this mould in the traditional sense, it's understandable he's going away, for a few reasons. At the end of their second term, Presidents often do a bit of globetrot so say their goodbyes. Plus, as Bush is the Head of State, it's also expected that he represent the US at the Olympics.



There's nothing unusual about his trip at all.

</answer from>



<answer>



Basically, you need a manifesto. That means policies on security, education, health and so on. Manifesto's can be long and drawn out, so have a look at say the Tories and Labour's policies first and see what format they are written in. 
Once you have that done, you can begin advertising for your party. That can be through Internet, word of mouth or posters (written advertisement costs). If your policies are popular you'll gain membership and set about running in an election. I don't know the ins and outs, but you'll have to get in touch with your local authority about that. It'd probably be best first to run for county council or local authority first before running for parliament.
Best of luck with your new party.

PS, what sort of party are you planning on?

All i will say too you is the english language has been eroding the welsh language for decades now the Welsh language has gained status the trend has reversed and the Language is growing substantially amongs the young.



Also You are only making England look worse (Is that possible haha)

In general us Welsh we don't like the English and we have a reason, The English dislike us just because we dislike them which is rather pathetic, You ask an Englishman what's his reason and they'll say they speak a different langauge or shag sheep, Yes we speak a different language we speak our language, English isn't the native language of Wales it isn't even the native language of the Uk

WELSH IS

Something the English resent, They haven't really got a homeland they bang on about foreigners when they're the Foreigners in Britain also.

yes the british culture as you know it was an imported by the british when rome left and they needed someone to protect them from the scotts raiding them.  They hired the saxons as mercenaries to protect them.  After they failed to pay the what they owed the saxons the saxons drove them to the welsh area of your country and the people you know as welsh (saxon word for stranger) are the origional britions. The scotts had a clan culture before england got involed with them as well.

Is the comparison between Obama vs Hitler fair? Or they don't compare?



I'm a big fan of Pres. Bill Clinton & wanted Hillary to win. I'm voting for McCain now; someone who I think would do okay. People at work are saying that Obama has that ability to put people in the same hypnotic trance as Hitler. The crowd's faces and getting off on "yes we can" nonsense; it's pretty scary. Plus, both are socialists. Am I the only one getting nervous like this?

As mentioned below, Hitler was a member of the NAZI party...the national socialist party of germany at the time. he was very much a socialist. Both Hussein Obama & Hitler wanted gov’t to outlaw gun ownership; nationalize industry; universal health care; raise taxes; expanded social programs; etc... Except for throwing millions of victims  into gas chambers, their policies are a lot alike. Also, any economics student will tell u that fascism, socialism, marxism, communism, and other structures where the gov’t owns more than private industry are all basically the same. This site shows how Hitler’s policies closely resemble today’s liberal Democrats: - http://constitutionalistnc.tripod.com/hi...

To say that Hillary is more of a socialist than Obama is admitting that you don't know what Obama's policy goals are. It's Obama who wants to use American tax dollars to "cure" third world poverty.
Hitler was definitely socialist,,,,,under his leadership the government dictated the use of the country's resources, pure socialism, and BHO says the same kinds of things every day. He will demand electric cars within 6 years (the battery technology hasn't evolved that far yet) he thinks Americans consume too much of the world's food, on and on.

alana, hitler was a member nazi party...the national socialist party of germany at the time. he was very much a socialist.

however, the big difference between sen.obama and hitler is that obama is trying to globalize american politics, and hitler was a nationalist...opposite ends of that spectrum.

obama scares me because he is inexperienced and has short-sighted policies, but americans have been caught up in this hype that he will somehow revolutionize america.

the president alone doesnt make decisions, and congress cant get a dang thing done these days. so unless obama wants to pull a hitler/julius caesar and use his charm to gain emergency dictatorship powers...he wont be changing much.

i think what scares me the most is the shallow mindset of too many eligible voters who think that voting for an unqualified candidate is progressive just because he is black.

Obama is a socialist?  Hitler was a "national socialist" - that's not the same thing, as any halfway educated person could tell you.  Hilter's "national socialism" was not socialist if you look at the actual way he structured the economy - you have to look beyond the words he used and examine the substance.  And speaking of which...

If you are basing your decisions on the candidates' speech delivery, or on your disapproval of genuine exciting expressed for a candidate, then I'm afraid you're not paying close enough attention to vote.  This is supposed to be about POLICY - form over substance!  If you were a Clinton supporter and you are now going to vote McCain, you are betraying everything Clinton stands for.  Obama and Clinton agree about almost everything.  McCain and Clinton agree about almost nothing.  You are voting against your own supposed beliefs, and for what?  Because you don't like Obama's campaign slogan?  That's sickening.

My answer is;
What??? Hitler hated himself so much he Destroyed the town he was born in. Destroying any record (including the cemetery) of his Jewish family. Yes, he was 1/2 Jewish.
You do know that Adolf was a good Business partner of Prescott Bush (GW's G.Father) don't you? So good in fact that ol Prescott was Tried and Convicted of Aiding and Abetting the Enemy namely Hitler, Right? God I bet you believe that photo from Hollister Ca. in the late 50's of the biker drinking 2 beers don't you? (It was Staged by Life mag.) 
Pretty scary is that you would want a man who has a Violent Temper and suffers form the years he spent as a POW with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, the poor old guy.

So No it isn't fair and No they don't compare. Hitler wasn't a Socialist, Stalin his enemy was. And that was in name only. 
and no you are not the only one. Just read some of your answers and see for yourself the phobia you all share

Hitler was not socialist. Even though it is the nationalist socialist party most scholars would classify hitler as a fascist. Hitler was opposed economic liberalism and political liberalism. So no a comparison between Obama and Hitler would be unfair. Their have been a lot of leaders over the centuries besides hitler who's speaking ability could hypnotise people its all a matter what they do with that ability.Some use it to for the great good of society some do not like hitler for example.Obama is not socialist but even if he was its not a bad thing. Socialism in its purest form is not a bad thing it just doesn't work the way it is suppose to.Obama would be classified somewhere below welfare liberal.

Hitler wanted to be a painter but failed to get into the art academy.

Obama was was the editor of the Harvard Law Review. His field is Constitution Law.  His professor says he is the most all around amazing person he has taught in the over 30,000 people he has taught at Harvard.



Hitler wanted to destroy all non impure races no blacks, Jews, gypsies etc.  Jews especially.  Invaded Poland

Obama did not support the invasion of Iraq. He stress unity not superiority of one race. black white or pink

Hitler preached hate, Obama hope

Hilter was a decorated soldier in WW I



Obama has not served in the military



Hitler had no family 
Obama has a wife and two children



Hitler was short



Obama tall. 
Heil Hitler  and yes we can are totally different messages.
Hitler was stuck on wearing badged.  Obama has been criticised for not choosing to wear a flag pin at all times.



Guess what, there is no comparison except they are both males.



I live in Arizona and have for over 30 years.  I am not voting for McCain.



Nope nothing in common  I am not a big fan of Bill Clinton or HIllary Clinton and I think the biggest danger to democracy is that had she won,  for the first time in history the White House would be in the hands of two families for over 20 years . That does scare me.

Either way, I think Obama is finished. Do u remember Obama’s last debate with Hillary? Left-leaning ABC News clobbered Obama with his ties to terrorists, hate-mongers, and convicted swindlers. Then Obama went on record for being for every tax hike imaginable. Obama refused any more debates with Hillary after that. Then Obama cancelled all his Town Hall meetings he agreed to do with McCain. Based on these facts, Obama will get destroyed in a debate with McCain. Obama’s stancce for for affirmative action, quotas, reparations, higher taxes, and driving up our alreay sky-high deficits; along with his stance against gun owners isn’t going to sell very well with middle America.

Just ignore the conspiracy theorists.  They cannot be squelched (freedom of speech guarantees them that right) and they refuse to be swayed.  Therefore the ONLY thing that you can do is ignore them.

People base their opinions on issues such as gay marriage and illegal immigrants, when those issues don't really effect them economically or socially.  whether my family has enough to eat or a place to live is not reflected by people who want to get married or having abortions.  However labor issues concerning work rules and pay does.

And you will notice that the politicans never do anything about these issues, they are much better off pontificating about them; solutions would take away their talking points.  I think people are not really paying attentiont to the difference between political talk and political action, that's why they get fooled so much of the time.

Actually India is the world's largest democracy.



President Bush has an approval rating of about 28% right now. Congress has an approval rating of 9%. So I would say that the vast majority of Americans aren't satisfied with the direction we are headed right now. I certainly do support my government on some issues (i.e. the war in Iraq.) I guess it's hard for me to elaborate much more than that because this is kind of a vague question.



When we get a new president and have congressional elections this fall, things will start to change. Of course, that's what they said in 2006, and next to nothing has been accomplished since then.

I can only guess but a guy did do what you suggest not too long ago. He burst in to the office of a Rep. in Tenn. and shot the poor guy to death ...because this crazy had lost his job and basically blamed it on the politicians. Perhaps he was right.

It's an insane thing to do but a few more of those kinds of events with the politicos and things might start to change. (More guards to protect our public servants. Ha!

Americans of the "new" generation have been carefully schooled in the 'Hate America" classes established by their ex-hippy draft dodging teachers. 
Prior to that they were schooled in the principles of the 
Constitution and then soon after, they were told our Founders were immoral slave owners and we should hate the basic foundation of our nation. We deserve to be Punished!
If inundated with those conflicting messages, wouldn't you be confused?
Actually our founders were brilliant, but flawed, like all humans, but somehow they miraculously gave us the best Constitution evert created. 
Please keep in mind, our Founders though not perfect, had a strong understanding of what Tyranny was all about. They knew that power corrupts, and total power - - - Total corruption!
They gave us a constitution that assured us we would have a small (weak) federal government. They gave a little more power to the states. (The states are closer to the people they represent). And with the Bill of Rights, they gave the most power to the citizen. 
Why? They spread the power far and wide to prevent any one group or individual from becomming so strong that they would become corrupt tyrants. 
So why have we Never followed the Constitution?

I think that more people care. It's just that for our government to be a democracy it doesn't actually reflect the views of it's people. Seriously. Lately people have just gotten used to anything from the government. Bush could get wasted tomorrow and crash his car into this Whitehouse and people wouldn't be the least bit surprised.

If anybody is apathetic, it's because they're tired from constantly arguing against those that use no kind of logic/reasoning/common sense.

Joeanimal- The barometric altitude would have given how high the plane was above sealevel, not how high the plane is above ground.  Remember that the hijackers turned off the transponders so it would have been impossible to know the exact altitude.

Facts have no value to the truthers.

Truth is an emotional perspective, if facts contradict emotion then the facts are wrong according to their mind set.

While I appreciate the fact your trying to set people straight (Hell I have been trying for years), the fact is your fighting a very insane river with a spoon.

People like you and I, and those who prefer logic and reason over "truth" will never be able to change the truthers.  they are broken and beyond saving.  The best thing to do is focus on the young, get them to understand and rely on facts, proof and logic, don't let them become "truthers".

one link that i checked out had an interesting point,: the barometric pressure gauge that recorded the barmetric air pressure that changes pressure when the altitude of the plane changes did not sync with the planes real altitude~!

and barometric pressure is a definite measurement of altitude, when your at a 100 ft. the pressure gauge is gonna read the same pressure on every single gauge matter where you are at~!

the pressure recorded did not sync with what the planes altitude that it was supposed to be at~!

i ain't saying that this is evidence is a conclusion to the investigation, but their are several other peaces of evidence that are coming out that have been proven that the Official version would not be  possible according to the Official Report, so most people think it is worth investigating~!

Is seems to me that pro choice sounds like a property issue. Do liberals really think choosing what to do with a fetus is the same as choosing what to do with a basketball or something.



I also don't understand when people that support abortions say women before babies, they are more important.  If anything, wouldn't the baby be more important because it has more of a life to live in the future.



I'm bringing up a very deep point here, IS IT REALLY FAIR THAT WOMEN, WHO HAVE ALREADY LIVED AT LEAST A COUPLE DECADES ON THIS EARTH, ARE VALUED ABOVE BABIES, WHO HAVE YET TO EXPERIENCE A SINGLE BREATH ON EARTH?

I'm not going to address your simplistic view of a very complex debate, but I will address your question.  THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS PRO-ABORTION.  People who are pro-choice do not "like" abortions, nor do they "encourage" them.  They simply think the procedure shouldn't be illegal.  Are people who don't agree with prohibition "pro-drinkers"?  Are 2nd amendment proponents "pro-gun violence"?

Pro abortion isn't the same as pro choice. Pro abortion would mean you are for aborting babies. Pro Choice means your for woman to have the choice whether they abort or not. Understand the difference? On the issue of abortion being ok to have or being right or wrong. We have a pro choice system for a reason. Woman want the ability to chose if there going to give birth to a baby. That's why its in place now. The minority against it shouldn't ruin what the majority of people want. Remember, this is a democracy and its majority rules.

Because abortion is such an ugly word.  Pro Choice conjours up such a nice positive image of freedom as they get rid of the "fetus" (another ugly word-don't want one of them) or "the products of conception".
I don't really buy your argument, but I have one of my own.
I believe a woman has the rights over her own body BUT, it's somebody ELSE  that she is killing.  And with contraceptives handed out like candy in all the schools, drug stores on every corner, sterilization so easy, why does anyone have to get pregnant in the first place?
And if she has the right over her own body, why the ***** is she not looking after it and having sex without thinking of the consequences?

"Why is pro abortion also called pro choice?"

It's not.  Not everyone who labels themself pro choice, is pro abortion.  This is a common misconception.  As a matter of fact, there are many people who find abortion an abhorrent practice, yet still support a woman's right to choose what to do with her own body.  They believe the government has no place legislating morality.

"Do liberals really think choosing what to do with a fetus is the same as choosing what to do with a basketball or something."

I am not a liberal, but for many it is exactly the same as choosing what to do with a basketball or something.  Until a certain point, a fetus is just a lumpy mass of cells that has absolutely no resemblence to a human being.



"I also don't understand when people that support abortions say women before babies, they are more important. If anything, wouldn't the baby be more important because it has more of a life to live in the future."

I have never heard anyone saying this.  Even if it were true, who are you to tell someone that their life is less important than someone else's?  That is arrogant and it goes against human instinct.  The strongest instinct that humans posses is that of survival.

"I'm bringing up a very deep point here, IS IT REALLY FAIR THAT WOMEN, WHO HAVE ALREADY LIVED AT LEAST A COUPLE DECADES ON THIS EARTH, ARE VALUED ABOVE BABIES, WHO HAVE YET TO EXPERIENCE A SINGLE BREATH ON EARTH?"

It is the woman's life and her choice to make.  If abortion is wrong for you, then don't do it.  However don't assume that you posses the moral authority to make that decision for other people, because you don't.

Liberals support abortions because they have no respect for life and don't think they should have to deal with the responsibilities of having a child.

For the same reason, pro-life isn't called anti-choice.

It's a marketing thing for starters.



Secondly, we have been losing our ability to speak plainly and openly for years. I find it amusing to look back the word usage for things that make people uncomfortable,,, Let's use handicaps as an example.

The terms Idiot, and Moron were once clinical terms. Then those words become demeaning so we changed it to Mentally Retarded. Retarded entered common use and became an insult, so it was changed to Developmentally Disabled.

It is important to realize that all these name changes did not change the actual condition those people had. However, it did make the people using those words somehow feel more enlightened.



As for the rest of what you wrote. Just post question like this: "Which would you rather have.. a new baby or a new car?" on the survey section of Ask and watch the results.



and remember the people who answer aren't materialistic and shallow, they are image driven consumers...

I will not engage in an debate with you about the fact of what is being killed...  because it is a life and that life is terminated when an abortion takes place... absolutely no point saying otherwise....



BUT ..... pro-abortion is a term that I have only heard Chinese Government officials state that they are... you know the ONE CHILD POLICY and forced abortions after that.......

Abortion is JUST one of the options that Pro-choice people support.



I'll explain it like this....

If a woman falls pregnant .. and she wants to continue with the pregnancy...BUT her partner wants her to abort .. .PRO-CHOICE people will support the woman's decision to continue her pregnancy.

If a woman falls pregnant and wants to carry the pregnancy to term .. and then adopt the baby out ... PRO-CHOICE people WILL support the woman's decision to do so.

If a woman falls pregnant and wants to carry the pregnancy to term .. and then KEEP the baby ... PRO-CHOICE people will support the woman to do so.

If a woman falls pregnany and DOESN'T want to carry the pregnancy to term.. PRO-CHOICE people will support the decision the woman makes...

And in anycase... even if abortion WAS made totally illegal .. they would still take place... THE MAIN thing Pro-choice people support is control of legalized abortion ... with health requirements and other regulations.. keeps the butchers with their rusty coat hangers and filthy knitting needles at bay.

Although on moral grounds, i feel abortion is distasteful, I think it a very bad idea to start the precedent of moral legislation on that level. The situation is infinitely more complicated than that.



The main problem with the Republican Party's view point is that they protect the fetus, but not the baby after birth. They fail to take into account the various situations and then take responsibility for wanting legislation making abortion illegal.

Imagine having a child from being raped. If you really want to outlaw abortion, you also have to consider how to fix that situation either by setting up a program where the child will be well taken care of in a loving home or somehow protected.

That's my take on the situation.

I have recently signed a petition in order to determine the presidents of the other states not to attend to the ceremony that will mark the beginning of the olympic games as a sign of protest.

well its a drama, and a bad one at that. I watched the episode and thought it a bit grizzly but part of the plot. I have not watched another because any programme that purports to be about archaeology and has such bad scripts should not even be on air. 
Though is some double standard here don;t you think, as real beheadings by Muslims on westerners have been shown, people can download them, though why you would want to is anyones  guess.

This is typical of the BBC and it's pro-muslim anti-western political agenda. Only those reading the Guardian or Independent would even consider such non-sense.
In the name of not offending the masses of Bradford and Beesford we cannot suggest that Muslims would behead people of other faiths because of their religion - even though it has happened all over the world.
A licence fee refund is a good idea. Let the Guardian readers pay for their own TV.

I haven't hear this theory and can't find any reference to it on-line.

As for the two candidates performances last night?



It was an interview format. I saw Obama giving thoughtful answers to the actual questions posed.



I saw McCain side-stepping answers (as in "what defines rich") and then reciting stump speeches geared at his conservative audience.

Far from being embarrassed, I am extremely proud of Obama's performance. I am happy to have him speak for me and support my ideal of this country.  He does it very well.

Not very. The UK is closer to socialism in some ways, but it has that outdated House of Lords, too. They have fewer tv and radio stations than the US, and they have socialized medicine, or a form of it.

People some times make the mistake of comparing apples to bananas.

This is a very hard comparison to make.  In many ways the UK can be called liberal, and Conservative.  For example the UK is a Kingdom after all (Conservative), and we are a revolutionary state (liberal).  The UK has more social services (liberal) then the US, and the US is more free market (Conservative).  Traditionally speaking the UK may be more traditional, as many European states are (Conservative).  Where as America is quite progressive and often throws tradition to the wind (liberal).

There is no right or wrong answer to this question.  It is an interesting question though.



Maybe the best way to weight this is by examining their international policies, which are very much inline with each other.  So perhaps from this prospective they are about the same!

More liberal in every sense.

The UK is more socially liberal - some swearing is acceptable on TV and in the media; this would never happen in the US. The UK is significantly less religious. The UK allows gay matrimony (although it's a civil union). The UK allows abortion - although not completely on demand - with few protests. The UK allows stem cell research. There are stricter and fairer union laws.

The UK is also much more economically liberal. The UK has a state run health service. The UK has a much higher minimum wage than all but a very few states. The UK has a more expansive benefits system. The UK spends significantly more on education than the US does - not even per capita. The UK has higher taxes, and much higher and tiered income tax. Museums in the UK are largely free; certainly all the major ones, funded by the state. Arts and sport receive much more funding (though not as much as elsewhere in Europe)

Whilst there are remnants of a less liberal past (an unelected head of state for instance) but this in reality makes little difference. The Queen has no real power in politics or in the military.

If you want to see what is coming down the pike, look at the UK. They are up to their necks in liberalism and loosing their rights almost daily. They cannot even so much display the British flag in the cars because it might offend the minorities. And the British people put up with this nonsense.

Good question this.We in Britain always have a false pride in these matters.In fact the UK is one of the west's most centralised societies.We are the most legislated in all Europe as we can't behave.Are prison pop is the largest in Europe and full up.British women commit more crimes than any other woman folk in the west.freedom of information only arrived 10 years ago as a result of America having it for many years.Liberalism in conversation has become more restricted in recent years.Liberalism in literature also has been narrowed.America is more liberal than the UK,but there are many more things that are more worthy in the UK than the US,but are outside of the scope of your question.British people can have a too higher opinion of themselves and their society.l am British myself and l will probably be asked to leave after this reply

American Girl on Fox News: “I was running from Georgian troops, I want to thank the Russian troops”

Check out the 12 year old kid and her mother ( American-Ossetians) getting the nasty comment from the host. It's on youtube.  They were very brave because Fox News is brutally rude to people they don't agree with. At least they toned it down and didn't savage the kid.

He did, and Obama has attempted to use that information to his advantage.  The current CEO's of Fannie and Freddie prepped Obama and would not talk to McCain about what was the upcoming announcement of their failure.



Obama's top economic advisors have ties to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, AND Lehman Brothers -- all asked for help from the Feds this weekend.  They also have ties to Countrywide, who was in the news this past spring for the same reason!



Jim Johnson, who is currently Barack Obama's economic advisor, was not only CEO and Vice Chairman of Fannie Me, he was also a managing director at Lehman Brothers.

On May 22, 2008, Democratic Party officials confidentially divulged that Obama had asked Johnson "to lead the process" for selecting Obama's running mate. However, Johnson soon became a source of controversy when it was reported that he had received below market rates loans directly from Angelo Mozilo, the CEO of Countrywide .  Property records show Mr. Johnson has received more than $7 million in loans from Countrywide since 1998, the first coming in the waning days of his Fannie Mae tenure.  [ http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12127997... ]



Franklin Raines was CEO of Fannie Mae 1999 to 2004.  Mr. Raines also is currently Barack Obama's economic advisor and has not yet been forced to resign.  He is accused by The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the regulating body of Fannie Mae, of abetting widespread accounting errors, which included the shifting of losses so senior executives, such as himself, could earn large bonuses.  Raines was sued for wrongdoing but was able to settle.  An editorial in The Wall Street Journal called it a "paltry settlement" which allowed Raines and the other two executives to "keep the bulk of their riches."  In 2003 alone, Raines's compensation was over $20 million. [ http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10977075... ].



Raines *also* has ties with Countrywide.  In June 2008 Wall Street Journal reported that Franklin Raines was one of several politicians who received below market rates loans at Countrywide Financial because the corporation considered the officeholders "FOA's"--"Friends of Angelo" (Countrywide Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo). He received loans for over $3 million while CEO of Fannie Mae. [ http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12127997... ]



BTW --In 2005 JOHN McCAIN cosponsored a bill to regulate Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae because of the financial dangers they presented to the American public.  Guess who blocked  that bill!  The Dems!

If you know so much about this guy, then you know that he quit Fannie Mae ten years ago. Any inside information he had would have been very, very stale.

He also resigned from Obama's VP selection committee after just 5 days when it was discovered that he had obtained a loan from Countrywide at an interest rate that was lower than market.

The unsettling news from Wall Street that greeted Americans on Monday morning, and the financial hit to the markets that followed, brought the economy roaring back to the center of the presidential campaign and presented another embarrassment for Senator John McCain.

Added to that is the collapse of financial giants. First there was the bailout of Bear Stearns. A week ago there was the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Now it's a decision not to bail out Lehman Brothers but to let it go into bankruptcy, plus the obvious shaky status of other financial institutions.

These financial market meltdowns have both symbolic and real effects on average Americans, even if they cannot understand exactly what has happened or why. President Bush, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are on the front lines of this crisis now.

McCain does not understand the economy. In fact, he has stated repeatedly that the American economy is FINE. The economy and domestic issues are not his natural terrain. Beyond that, he must answer for what happened on Bush's watch and offer a plausible explanation for why his presidency would be genuinely different. Furthermore, a McCain administration would certainly be tied to a lobbyist-dominated Washington culture since many of his financial supporters are lobbyists.

Once again the American people are witnessing yet another reason why we need to elect Senator Obama as our new president. Senator McCain has been a strong supporter of the Bush administration’s economic blunder of the past 8 years.



Can we really afford another four more years of the same failed judgment? How many more devastations must the American people endure before we wake up and do the right thing!

They believe that God puts a soul into a fetus at conception and from conception to birth it is an innocent, human life because it has done nothing.

No, it's not a contradiction.  It's a liberal talking point that's asked on here about a thousand times a day.  This is exactly why we don't need liberals leaders running this country with this mentality -- they don't want to fight our enemies because it's killing people.  Sounds just like the United Nations.  Comparing enemy combatants to unborn babies is ignorant.  And then they always use stereotyping as a reason as why the other side is so "wrong," religion -- the biggest reason why they hate white American Republicans -- Christianity.  I'm an Atheist and I am anti-abortion.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with war.

But let's look at it from a Christian point of view, the bible clearly states "thou shalt not kill" it doesn't say "thou shalt not kill except in cases of a pre-emptive strike, terrorism, national pride etc". So if that's the be applied to the yet to be born then it ought to be applied to everyone, regardless of nationality.
So I'd like to hear not from a Republican on this but rather a Republican who considers themselves a good Christian and who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ.

What gives kids? Help me understand.

EDIT - Oh COME ON! Surely someone can address this? Of all the Christians crawling all over this place, no one will even attempt to explain this to me? Why am I not surprised.......

I think republicans care about who's paying the bills.  It's all about money to them.  The only  reason they're against "choice" is they don't want to pay for someone abortion.  Women with means will always have abortions if they need one or two.

Is this how to fix our economy?



Obama says his is going to give 95% of Americans a tax break in the amount of $1000.00 paid for by the remaining 5% of Americans.  This means that he is going to give out $289,922,701,000.00 and have 15,259,090 people pay for it.  That means that for those 5%, their taxes are going to increase by $9.14 per working hour or approximately $19,000.00 per year.  Their pay is going to be cut by $9.14 per hour.  Is this the change that is good for America?

Sources - Senator Obama and the Census Bureau.

Sunshine - It is going to take a gradual tax increase on everyone (with an entitlement cut for the 40% who do not pay taxes) to balance the budget and pay off the debt.

I think that this idea is about the worst idea for America, all it will do is encourage those 5% to leave the country and move to another country that has more favorable tax laws taking their companies and jobs with them and then nobody will have a job because those 5% create about 90% of the middle class jobs in America.  By the way I am not a republican or a democrat because I live in Canada but I believe that lower taxes to corporations is the way to go to stop them from moving all the jobs to China, Mexico, etc.  the same thing is happening here in Canada.

Tax cuts for the middle and working classes will just be spent back into the economy! Yes, that would help the U.S. economy because consumer spending is 2/3rds of the economy. Yes, that would help America prosper, BUT that would take money out of the pockets of people like John McCain and myself, people of financial worth, people who MATTER. Our GOP has spent DECADES on our War on the Middle Class. With our Bush economy hammering the domestic terrorists liberal middle and working class liberals here at home we must stay the Bush course with our John McCain even at the expense of the overall American economic security.

For those claiming only a percentage of Americans pay taxes, that is a lie.

All working Americans pay payroll taxes such as social security. In fact, the middle class pays a HIGHER RATE than the top 5%. Our John McCain will keep it that way.

Newflash -- he's only raising taxes on the top 1%.  You will pay slightly more taxes with Obama than McCain on the top 5%, but it is still less than Bush did.  And you will pay less taxes with Obama than McCain or Bush if you make under $250,000.



And the percent he's taxing them is still less than it was pre-1980 --- it's still less in the top bracket than from the founding of our nation until 1980 when Ronald Reagan completely screwed the working class (the only exception being the 4years before The Great Depression).

Think about it.

That "change" is not sustainable.  After a short time, the very richest of those will see the unfavorable tax situation in this country and offshore their investments.  That means much less money will be in the American economy to be taxed.  And it will keep getting worse as time goes on.

The people who are going to be taxed for this will pass it on to the consumer who is the 95% that Obama isn't going to tax.  So once again, working folks will be the losers.  During one of the Democrat debates, Obama proposed paying for his programs this way:  1.  Fed. Govt.  2. State Govt.  3.  Corp and 4 the people.  My question was:  where does the Fed/State Govts get their money?



Who do Corp bill for their part? You got it, that leaves #4 paying for it all.

This is a good example that divides the mainstream ideologies of modern Republicans and Democrats.  Republicans believe in a flat tax applied to everyone, regardless of earnings.  Democrats believe that the wealthy should be taxed at a greater rate than others.

I really comes down to personal beliefs.  I think that is is unfair to tax anyone unproportionally, regardless of how much money they make. I also think that the reasons may give for supporting such a tax system -- that it is the social obligation of the wealthy to help others -- is a lie.  I think the reason people support these types of systems is because they are envious and spiteful at the wealthy for their success.

I do not think this is good change for America. I think that these types of proposals discourage the valued American entreprenuerial spirit, and instead encourage complaceny and satisfaction with mediocrity.

I've always heard life isn't fair.  Well that couldn't be more true for the middle class these days.  I don't know how much that 5% you are referring too makes, but I'm think of how many super rich people there are out there that make like uuummm I don't know, let's just say 1 million per year to 20 million.  Know take the lower of that and say 1 million per year is basically $19,230 per week.  Is it really a huge deduction if they take another $365.00 per week for that person.  Even less of a change for the ones making 2 million, 3 million, and so on.  Now take $365.00 a week from the person making $60,000 per year and they might just hang themselves.

Saint:  One reason we have a graduated income tax is that the more money you have.....the more government services you get.  Better police protection, fire protection, and access to political power.  If Bill Gate, or someone living in a ghetto complains about a pothole in front of his home - which one gets fixed first?  Also, the wealthy have accountants to figure out ways of sheltering their incomes from taxes.

And who suffers more?  The guy who makes $25,000 per year and has to pay $5,000 in taxes (leaving him $20,000 to live on) or the guy who makes $2,000,000 and has to pay $500,000 (leaving him $1,500,000 to live on)?  Raise the rich guys tax rate from 25% to 30% and he pays $600,000 still leaving him with $1,400,000.

It's a form of censorship.  It's happened to me as well.

It's time to look once again at the 45 Declared Goals Of The Communist Takeover Of America

As you read the "45 Declared Goals Of The Communist Takeover Of America", you will see that many of these goals have been accomplished with utmost effectiveness. We as Americans need to take this serious. Like so many other agendas being pushed upon us, this too is a part of the Global Government movement.
Communist Goals (1963) Congressional Record--Appendix, pp. A34-A35 January 10, 1963

1. U.S. acceptance of coexistence as the only alternative to atomic war.
2. U.S. willingness to capitulate in preference to engaging in atomic war.
3. Develop the illusion that total disarmament [by] the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength.
4. Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war.
5. Extension of long-term loans to Russia and Soviet satellites.
6. Provide American aid to all nations regardless of Communist domination.
7. Grant recognition of Red China. Admission of Red China to the U.N.
8. Set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev's promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections under supervision of the U.N.
9. Prolong the conferences to ban atomic tests because the United States has agreed to suspend tests as long as negotiations are in progress.
10. Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N.
11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces.
12. Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.
13. Do away with all loyalty oaths.
14. Continue giving Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office.
15. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.
16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights.
17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.
18. Gain control of all student newspapers.
19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.
20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policy-making positions.
21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.
22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to "eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms."
23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. "Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art."
24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them "censorship" and a violation of free speech and free press.
25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.
26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as "normal, natural, healthy."
27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with "social" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a "religious crutch."
28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of "separation of church and state."
29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.
30. Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the "common man."
31. Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the "big picture." Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.
32. Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture--education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.
33. Eliminate all laws or procedures which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus.
34. Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities.
35. Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI.
36. Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.
37. Infiltrate and gain control of big business.
38. Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand [or treat].
39. Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over tho

Who is the right man to fix our economy, Obama or McCain?



Please read this before answering;

Democrats are all over this housing scandal mess.  But they have one talent (the ability to demonize their opponents) and one asset (a complicit liberal media).  John McCain proposed legislation that would have reformed Fannie and Freddie back in 2005 - but lockstep Democratic opposition killed it.  Now the system is broken, and the guy who took the 2nd most money from the scoundrels who caused this mess is trying to blame the guy who tried to fix the problem before it became a disaster.

Obama received $126,349 from Freddie and Fannie.  Current members of Congress have received a total of $4.8 million from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with Democrats collecting 57 percent of that.  Now our tax dollars are bailing these two companies out.  Based on this, who is the right man to fix our economy?

John McCain: "The economy is strong" "I don't really know much about the economy" "I am divorced from the day  to day concerns of the American people"



McCain's own campaign staffers are those special interests, a fact that casts doubt on both McCain's hiring judgment and his ability to pursue tough reforms of Fannie and Freddie.

Aquiles Suarez, listed as an economic adviser to the McCain campaign in a July 2007 McCain press release, was formerly the director of government and industry relations for Fannie Mae. The Senate Lobbying Database says Suarez oversaw the lending giant's $47,510,000 lobbying campaign from 2003 to 2006.

And other current McCain campaign staffers were the lobbyists receiving shares of that money. According to the Senate Lobbying Database, the lobbying firm of Charlie Black, one of McCain's top aides, made at least $820,000 working for Freddie Mac from 1999 to 2004. The McCain campaign's vice-chair Wayne Berman and its congressional liaison John Green made $1.14 million working on behalf of Fannie Mae for lobbying firm Ogilvy Government Relations. Green made an additional $180,000 from Freddie Mac. Arther B. Culvahouse Jr., the VP vetter who helped John McCain select Sarah Palin, earned $80,000 from Fannie Mae in 2003 and 2004, while working for lobbying and law firm O'Melveny & Myers LLP. In addition, Politico reports that at least 20 McCain fundraisers have lobbied for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, pocketing at least $12.3 million over the last nine years.

McCain is the right man for the job.  Pay attention to the upcoming debates, McCain is going to display his leadership qualities while Obama flounders.  McCain has experience with fighting to change Washington.  When McCain's elected he will make the names of those crooked politicians who would put themselves before their country famous.  We the American people will know the names of those in Washington who sell us out.  McCain will restore the power in the United States to the people.  Government is there to support the people, Americans are not here to support the government.

The Subprime mortgage meltdown is due to, the Community Reinvestment Act, yet another democrat idiotic idea to make mortgages"fair".  You have Carter and Clinton to thank.  Believe it or not, Bush tried to fix it in 2005, but it was shot down by democrats.  Democrats will gladly point out that all of this economic crap happened on Bush's watch, never mind that he tried to prevent it and they stopped him.



Then again the price of oil has played a major roll too.  Which party was it again that won't allow drilling?

Yes, Obama is a talented speaker, but listen to what he actually says and compare it to your economics 101 book.  You're eyes will be opened and you'll notice that he doesn't know anything about basic economics.

Whom received money has nothing to do with why they have failed. Deregulating banks is bad because all they want to do is make money and drive stock prices up. If you don't put checks on loans then this is what will happen every time.

Obama getting money is not the problem. If he was the only one it would be the problem. We need to see who was pushing deregulation of the mortgage bankers cause that's who the villain is.

Once you find the villian then you will find the hero..

In 2005 JOHN McCAIN cosponsored a bill to regulate Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae because of the financial dangers they presented to the American public.  Guess who blocked  that bill!  The Dems!



Proof here:  http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.x...



McCain saw it coming.  He said, "I join as a cosponsor of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, S. 190, to underscore my support for quick passage of GSE regulatory reform legislation. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole.

I urge my colleagues to support swift action on this GSE reform legislation."

McCain was also right about the surge in Iraq.  Even I was against it, but I have to admit that it worked!

McCain has been right and no one has been listening to him!

The Dems picked who they picked. 
But Hillary's loss was HILLARY's fault, not the party voters.



They didn't make a mistake, she did. She ran the wrong campaign. While she was out courting votes, Obama was aiming for delegate count, which was all that ever mattered. Hillary and her campaign staff ran the wrong race and the result was that Obama won the race that counted.

Also, this is an impossible question to validate in any way.



If the Dems HAD picked Hillary, McCain might have tapped a minority, like a Jindal, and maybe we'd be right here anyway only with people saying "Should the Dems have picked a black man instead?" 
Since the conditions of the election are so inter-related, if the Dems had done differently, so would the Republicans. If you're asking if the Dems should have picked Hillary because of Palin, then there's no evidence the McCain camp would have picked Palin if Hillary won, OR that Palin wouldn't actually play better against Hillary than Obama and generate an even larger McCain bounce.

Tee hee... I won't say it is because he is a "flip flopper"...

That would be just a tad too poetic at this point...

I think he has no other choice than to make Obama's case for him... the only alternative is to keep saying "everything is just fine" and get ousted from his seat in the Senate by people with torches and pitchforks...

Mistakes are sometimes ok if the person actually learns from their previous position.  However, during an election year if this happens it has more to do with votes than truth sadly enough.  And i do believe that in his case it was for votes.  He could not honestly get back on television and say the same thing he said a few days before, he would have lost votes then.  And also the democrats would have proved even more that he does not understand the economy.  However, he is screwed either way because he switched his position after looking at the current state of things.  I guess he just does not understand after all.

McCain obviously holds no permanent convictions about anything...he will say or do anything to get to be Commander in Chief.

If McCain had any balls at all, he would have said no to his father when he was forced to attend Annapolis, instead of studying literature like he wanted.

He has never accepted the fact that he doesn't have to beat his dad at his dad's game. Sounds like Bush...huh?

Are we going to put ourselves through THAT again.

I don't think its outrageous that he didn't know the rate for a single pensioner is over £90. I think it is outrageous he just had a guess (and such a bad guess, too!) If he is asked something he doesn't know, he should say he doesn't know. I don't expect every politician to memorise the rates of every state benefit and every statistic. It is just nice to hear them admit they don't know, if they don't know.

Fascism is a very misunderstood doctrine, it has become associated with the movements of the 1930s and 40s but the origin of fascism is ancient, the Romans carried a 'Fasces' which was a bundle of sticks - the bundle represented that you could break an individual stick but you could never break the whole bundle, this was seen of being symbolic of society - individuals are not importnat but society is. Still sounds like a load of old pony to me.

Creo que aunque hay muchas hipótesis no andas mal encaminado. Podría ser el narco, pero lo veo difícil porque una de las maneras en que ellos consiguen moverse impunemente es porque no tocan a la población civil (mucho menos a familias enteras que disfrutan de un acto patrótico que se ha desarrollado sin incidentes en toda la Historia). Esto parece obra de algún grupo secreto terrorista que busca desestabilizar el país. ¿Y quién lleva más de dos años tratando de desestabilizar el país sólo porque no sabe perder? ¿No sería precisamente en Michoacán para castigar a la tierra de la familia Cárdenas por las críticas de Cuauhtémoc? ¿Por qué fue, precisamente, en la tierra natal del Presidente?

Alguien tan demagogo, de perfil psicópata y sin escrúpulos como ya sabes quién, sería perfectamente capaz de coordinar una guerrilla para que cometa estas atrocidades contra el pueblo.

Y asi pondríamos hacer una lista interminable de atropellos que a cometido el señor AMLO y sus compinches.

Mexico esta atatravesando una epoca muy difícil en la que una delgada linea separa a la paz y la tranquilidad de una revolución. Me gustaría que si el señor AMLO ama a su pueblo realmente,hiciera consciencia y que realmente trabajara para el pueblo, que el hecho de que no tenga una banda precidencial no le quita la sangre Mexicana que corre por sus venas, que el como cualquier otro ciudadano Mexicano tiene voz y voto, y que con la popularidad que a logrado en ves de hacer mítines que lo único que están provocando en las calles es inestabilidad además de basura, uniera a esa gran multitud para bienes comunes tales como el caso PEMEX. Habla de que el pueblo Mexicano deve movilisarce para evitar la privatizacion de PEMEX, pero yo le pregunto cual es su propuesta para este caso..... Hasta el momento creo que ninguna. Pongase a trabajar señor AMLO y si realmente ama al pueblo Mexicano, coopere, no estorbe.

Pakistan strategy = Vietnam : obvious isn't it?



... just like Vietnam, taking the fight over the Pakistan border now opens up an official extra front in 'the war on terror' and conservatives are just stupid enough to buy it as political sense and sound military practice.

This is not 'winning hearts and minds' though - it's a strategy of expansion, so it's absolutely not about putting out a fire by depriving it of political oxygen.  It's what US farces usually do, alienate the neutrals, grow the enemy, make just about everyone the enemy, isn't it?



If the trend continues we'll have continued expansion, more bombing raids, more missile strikes, more commando operations... and an effective declaration of war against Pakistan... and consequently a huge growth of the 'Taliban'.

Must be profitable, they're playing the same war growing games they did in Vietnam, when according to officially released US files, the CIA kept the war going in collusion with US arms manufacturers.

A reading of this document partially answers your question.

It documents recent events and the public statements of Pakistani and US officials, but it reverses the words "Pakistan" and "United States" throughout.

Pakistan invades America "Without Permission"
http://www.informationclearinghouse.info...

I read it and took pause. It casts a whole different light on the situation when you view the situation with the shoe on the other foot.  The scary part .... the public statements quoted are REAL.

I take exception with "conservatives" being stupid enough to buy it. True conservatives do not support the war agenda.  Neo-cons may be convinced though.

The hypocrisy of the Bush administration is the most blatant I have ever witnessed.  They completely ignore the Pakistani governments order not to cross into their sovereign territory - which is tantamount to invading a sovereign state.



Then when Russian troops cross into Georgia AFTER having their UN sanctioned PEACE KEEPING forces attacked and killed by the  Georgian military, the Bush administration has the gall to label them the bad guys.



Whats going to happen when the US sends troops into Pakistan and the Pakistani military responds with force?  The US can't afford a conflict with Pakistan, who up til now have been a key ally.  Keep in mind that Pakistan is a Nuclear power with a well trained and well equipped military.

I am sorry to be so blunt, but I cannot help it.

Your assertion, that our incursions into Pakistan are similar to those into Cambodia and Laos, is correct. Yet, having grandly figured out the obvious and crowed about it for attention (Good Boy!), you can't make the critical leap to good analysis. Instead you trot out the same tired crap your leftist handlers fed you. You seem easily over-excited by buzzwords. I wouldn't want you in my squad because I'd have to keep an eye on you. Stay a civilian.

The rest of us will notice that the decisions, then and now, to do so are not just smart, but are the only practical responses to the situation - then and now. Stick to delivering pizzas, and let men run the  mil-ops.

Yes, that is exactly what he did, and it is why the economy is in the mess it is today. Throw in Sen McCain's economic adviser Phil Graham, who successfully did away with banking regulations that had been in place since the 30s, and the Reagan style mantra of less government oversight and regulations, and what you have is nothing less than the perfect storm. I pray that the American people are smart enough to vote every republican out of office, for the sake of this country's future.

Here's a history lesson for you all knowing republican czars of economy. Trickle down economics invented during the Hover term. This policy, in part created the worst recession in the history of this country. The Republican party all but abandoned this method of thinking for over 50 years. Well until the puppet of the wealthy (who was best know for staring with an ape) headed the mantle of the Neo conservative and scared the people with threats of terror attacks and welfare abuses into suckering the american people into electing him.



Upon election immense inflationary policy and tax cuts to the wealthy were his sticking point ( no the USSR collapsed under its own economic struggles the ape man did not end the cold war) So, after deregulating all forms of government and giving some of the most wide spread tax breaks to the wealthy of all time. 8 years later his failure of a pupil inherits one of the worst recessions of all time. (seeing a trend yet?) Onward, now today Bush who is also of the mind of trickle down economics(feudalism) creates the worst recession since the inventor of this blue blood policy.



In summary no, trickle down economics is a failure of a policy. I think, you all knowing republicans should read John Maynard Keynes or perhaps John Locke's " Social Contract". Perhaps that will teach you how democracy works and if you are still  of the mindset that trickle down economics works and that the estate tax should be called the "death tax" (don't get me started on that), well than you should stop lieing to yourselves and read "The Prince" that's more your style.....

Do you realize that the rich in this country pay most of the taxes.  Everyone wants to talk about those mean rich people that get a tax break, most, close to all, large companies give to charity, walmart, Johnson and Johnson, GE, Coke, Microsoft ETC.

Warren Buffett, he is one of those mean rich people, plans to give away 85 percent of his fortune, or about $37.4 billion, all in Berkshire stock. Of that amount, he will channel the greatest share, about $31 billion, into the Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation, dedicated to improving health and education, especially in poor nations, is already the United States' largest grant-making foundation, with current assets of almost $30 billion. Mr. Buffett's huge contribution may permanently solidify that philanthropy's standing as the biggest and most influential organization of its kind. Mr. Buffett will join Mr. and Mrs. Gates as a trustee of their foundation.

Rich do a lot more then just give our government more money, in the form of taxes, to waste as the government sees fit, instead the rich pay less in tax and donate more money in 1 year then most people will make in a life time. They start foundations to help people in America and the world, when you start to bash the rich about the amount of tax they pay at least take the time to learn what they really do with their money.



How much have you Donated to charity this year?

Your question was about the richest people in the country, I point out the richest people in the country and you say they don't count because they are Democrats.  Those 2 democrats benefited by the bush tax cuts.

Charity's Political Divide
Republicans give a bigger share of their incomes to charity, says a prominent economist Arthur C. Brooks. He finds that religious conservatives are far more charitable than secular liberals, and that those who support the idea that government should redistribute income are among the least likely to dig into their own wallets to help others.

You asked a question about "the richest"  the fact is that the richest people in the country donate the most, Republican and Democrat both benefit from the bush tax cuts and the rich from both parties donate.



Your question was about the rich, you got you answer.

Lawrence Ellison, republican, 100 million to charity
Kirk Kerkorian, republican, 180 million to charity
Michael Dell, republican, 273 million to charity
McDonald's Corporation, republican corporation donates huge money to charity.

I can go on and on, the rich people of this country make up in charity donations for what they don't pay in taxes.  This is just the way it is, stop believing what Obama tells you and think for yourself.

UKIP - I do not want to live in a country where 75% of our laws are made by the dictators in Europe who cannot be removed. The comissioners who make the laws are not elected and the parliament is just a front.
Nigel Farage is a charismatic truthful leader - the only one leader with eyes fully open. They also have common sense solid policies on other things which can be viewed on their website (eg flat rate of tax taken millions of minimum wage workers out of tax altogether and benefiting the vast majority of workers), harsher conditions in prisons, No smoking ban – they will require owners to provide no smoking areas or smoking areas adequately ventilated, or clearly mark the pub a smoking or non smoking one
 5 year freeze on all immigration, getting rid of all bureaucracy and political correctness. They will scrap the human rights act and have sentences that men what they say. They will look after our troops better and bring back military hospitals. They will restore a sense of pride to this country. The party is not racist in any way - it loves the people of the EU and the culture of each of its countries, but hates the EU political monster which robs each of these European cultures of their individual identity. The racism comes from the people who support the EU and want to destroy all these old cultures through mass immigration and make us all the same in a socially engineered, PC. faceless bland bureaucracy.
The BNP has some solid policies but tend to attract thugs, though the leadership is sound.

the three main parties will always be scathing and disdainful of the public if they aren't given a jolt by some fresh parties taking the seats

I had an Iranian guy teach me geometry in high school.



Then in college, I had 1 math professor who was also Iranian. I never seen them face any type of discrimination per se. Iranian people are completely different from their governments they fled. I actually found out that my high school teacher was at my school getting his masters. We chatted a little and I found him to be still the same funny Iranian guy I remembered

My ex's dad is an immigrant from Iran.



I think for the most part he has been ok, spare a few incidents.



I know my dad didn't like me dating the son of an Iranian, until he met his dad.  His dad was managing a restaurant at the time, and gave my parents the star treatment.  I think it did them good to actually get to know someone from there, instead of just listening to stereotypes on TV.



I have another friend from Lebanon.  After 9-11 some redneck grabbed his mom's arm in Wal-Mart and threw her to the ground without letting go of her arm.  He squeezed it so hard he left bruises, and he leaned down and said "why don't you go back to your own F--ing country."  Needless to say my friend and his brother came to the defense of their mom.  Real classy, attacking a woman - and we're supposed to be the greatest nation on earth who "treat our women better" than the Islamic countries.

Because, at every step in his life he has struggled and worked his butt off to do more, push harder, make things happen, help people in need, etc. It isn't about what he says or even his policies in the end...it is about his word....and you will have to take him at face value on that one. He has consistently proven his judgement and his desire to help people who need a hand up in this nation. He has proven that he is fully capable of understanding and inacting policies that benefit US and our allies. He has proven to know more than the Bush Admin on Iraq and Afghanistan policies, and obviously McCain as well, and Iraq and Petraeus are using his exact stances currently in the draw down. He has shown strenght and clarity, leadership and common sense with the economy and has behaved rationally while McCain and Bush are erratic and have no plan. Obama's plan has far more support with economists, with nonpartisan economic sites such as www.taxpolicycenter.com. McCain's plan is not only more costly, but is also less specific and less helpful to the middle class.

Only blind fools believe any American politician is sincere and honest.  Every one of the uses the mass manipulation techniques of Edward Bernays, on that there is no room for debate.  So how do you trust those who have to manipulate you or try to to get your support?  They are as trust worthy as a car salesman.



Why is it that the leader of the free world isn't vetted the same way an FBI agent is?  People can vote for whomever they want but if they are scumbags they shouldn't be allowed to have knowledge of sensitive information.  And Obama has the personal history of a scumbag.



I know all I need to know about the guy.  By the way George Bush wouldn't have made the cut either.

If there is to be a Cabinet re-shuffle ?



do you feel that perhaps Gordon Brown would be best advised to shuffle himself off to oblivion.  It's no good blaming everyone else for the stupidity of the Government's decisions he must take overall blame for them himself.  His answer seems to be so far if the Government needs more money just add another tax to the population, they won't mind - but WHERE does he think we are going to keep finding this extra money to cover the tax hikes?

Sarah Palin is a joke.  Your question is a joke.  Since any answer to it should be ludicrous as well, I thought I'd include a link to a ludicrous crime happening in Alaska as we speak.  It's been illegal to shoot animals from airplanes since 1972's Airborne Hunting Act.

How can a 21 year old go to war, but can't run for president?



so basically they're saying: You can go to war and kill with this gun and try not to get killed in the process, but you are forbidden to run for president.



Does that seem right? What life experience do I have to go to war and avoid being killed?

I fell asleep during the presidential candidates debate.  This one is just as dull...I have nothing against any of the candidates and I still don't know who to vote for.



To me it seems like Palin is talking down to people.  I don't know if she is aware of the way she is perceived or if it is just me that sees it that way.  I don't think it is on purpose, maybe it is just because she has children and she is used to talking that way.

Well, being a registered Republican and an actual voter, I will tell you this: Palin isn't a big deal to us. What she lacks in intelligence she compensates with good looks and charm. That's all we need to be energized to tell you the truth. All the rest of that fluff, debating with her lips squeezing in every phrase she can possibly think of - ha, what a joke. As long as she fools the public by making them think twice about Biden, who's a liar as a we know then the votes are fine. She will not lose this election despite her intelligence

Now this is what amazes me about America, that a large chunk of you can watch that and think that Palin won. It makes me cringe. With that kind of ineptitude it's not a wonder that other countries see the end of the US as a superpower. I'm not American so I'm impartial ;-) but very interested in the election. In interviews in the run up to the election Palin already demonstrated her inability to be able to intelligently talk about subjects she should be well versed in if she wants to be VP.



In the debate itself probably more than half the time she would completely ignore the question and go off at a completely different tangent. The whole time she looked like she was struggling to remember what she had been told to say. And that small town lingo may work for the simple audience who no doubt 'connect' but in my mind the VP should be a person who is able to stand up to the other leaders of this world. Is she going to sit there with Ahmadinejad saying, 'oh well gee Mahmoud say it ain't so, darn it you didn't just go and get a nuke there didja'. If you want to be taken seriously the first thing you've got to do is learn to speak confidently and properly.



If you were looking at the debate impartially there is no doubt she was completely outmatched. But like I say time and time again, there's a large swathe of red covering the US map, these are the same people that voted the intellectually challenged Bush in TWICE and no doubt there are a whole bunch of people who identify with her incomprehensible blabber.



Summing up her debating skills, she opens her mouth and words seem to randomly fall out up until she remembers the sentences she's been coached to chant over and over.



She got the name of the US General in Afghanistan wrong for gods sake.



What did Biden lie about, please list all of the lies and show your source that illustrates it's a lie.

Why will the govt not give us the bailout money instead of the banks?



As T says... The govt is asking every person in the US to go into tax debt of about $200K each to bail out the banks. Why not just give $200K to every American and let us bail them all out. We would buy up all the real estate, buy cars, buy health insurance and put money in the bank. Trust us to get it done and stop lining the pockets of everyone else. It would be cheaper.

There may be some problems with the details, but I think this shows that you have a good overall grasp of the problem.



The BIG problem, is that this discrepancy shows who the government really works for, and apparently it isn't us, its the banks.



How does that make you feel about doing your civic duty by voting?

mainly because the credit market is grinding to a halt. without that credit market most of the daily business interactions in this country and even the world would seize up. there would be no car  loans...so who would buy the cars we make? there would be no home loans...housing prices would collapse. there would be no loans for businesses to do the things they do such as place orders with each other, pay their employees, and expand their business. imagine if you work at a factory. if the people who order thousands of your products can no longer receive a loan to buy your products what exactly would you do?



$5000 a person isn't enough money to do anything with aside from waste, pay bills, or save. considering how foolish most of us are with our money it would most likely end up going to the first two options.



the bailout isn't ideal. it isn't pretty, but it is a targeted effort to save our economy. personally i don't care. i am prepared for the economy to fall. it is time we stopped living on borrowed dimes and starting living in a way we can afford and sustain...however most americans are not willing or do not know how to do that.

Because the job pays very little money, and over time they can make a fortune in private industry.

One man's pork is another man's important civic projects. McCain would sign a bill even if it contained stuff he considered pork if it represented a compramise that passed a law he agreed with, which is usually how the pork ends up in there anyway, it's a way of getting individual senators and representatives to agree to vote for a bill they may otherwise vote against. McCain votes for such laws all the time and would not hesitate to sign one.



That's one of his arguments in favor of the line item veto, but that would be unconstitutional because it would give the president far too broad power to completely rewrite the law, and it would also kill compramise in congress and seriously hinder what they can get passed.

Some one has already tried to assassinate him once already.So I'm pretty sure it will be a race war,being that if he won that he would be the first black president.So that's one reason i will not vote this year,cause i don't want any part of this election.The other reason is McCain is just going to be another Bush.It's going to be a messed up 4 years.Bush has already screwed us up for 8 years now we have McCain running if he gets it,well look what Bush has already done McCain will probably push us onto depression or some other kind of BS.Obama is a Muslim Many people say he isn't but he really is.A Muslim will shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time.Obama Did turn his back on the American flag when saying the Pledge of Allegiance his stupid wife said she is finally proud to be an American and of America.This might offend some people on here but I'm speaking the truth.Like i said if either one gets elected it's going to be a long 4 year ride to a bunch of BS.

do you understand what is going to happen if they're isn't some sort of rescue package? obviously not. the situation never should have gotten here in the first place. you activist idiots should have been out campaigning BEFORE investing in banks whos board supported heavy investing in derivitives  and in 1 to 30 asset ratios. its regrettable but this thing has to pass or you'll be growing your own food and making your own clothes. moron.

Both of my senators voted against it. My progressive Democratic Congressman voted against it, as did my former Congressman in the southernmost district of my state. I left phone messages for both senators (GOP) and my congressman, because I didn't have time to send a letter by post, which gets more attention even today.



I do have letters in the post to the three of them explaining why this is bad, just to be sure. I'm calling my congressman's local office again tomorrow. This bill keeps getting worse. Only Bush asking for a blank check was the bottom.



Already, the Hill is trying to repackage it as a "rescue plan" instead of a bailout. Talk about lipstick on a pig.

You are right.  I am disgusted by this bill.  It is an abomination to our country, and what we are supposed to stand for.  I cannot side with anyone who would vote for this surrender to socialism.  This money does not exist, until they print it.  Then watch the dollar fall into irrelevance.  I am a lifelong time republican, but tomorrow afternoon I will re-register as an Independent.

I find it funny that the proposed $700 billion turned into over $800 billion that includes a huge tax cut to "ONE" canning business in California. But since the balance over $700 billion is not in any way related to the "bailout", it does not count towards the $700 billion maximum.



If anyone is interested, I am ready to take up arms. I have been pushed to my limit.

I agree that the Dems are scared to death of Palin.



They went down the tired road of calling her stupid (seen it all before), the hav attacked he looks although she is very attractive, they have made up rumors and attacked her family.



Now you have this idiotic Barbie comparison. I guess it is a compliment though; Barbie has been the number ONE doll since its inception, the rest are battling for a pathetic second place.



But I know how you meant it and it just shows how hysterical you have become.



Another example of a woman or minority that stepped off of the liberal thought plantation, they are always crucified.



Maybe her and Thomas can start a company together after they retire from office.

there is a thing called bad taste disease, I think you have a severe case of this, go to your doctor and he will recommend the needed medication, which I believe may be jumping off a bridge, not sure if they added new types though, check it out. you're welcome.

The British government supports Israel, as we have some very powerful Jewish politicians and business high rollers. If you ask the average British person what they think of Israel, they probably would parrot what they'd read in the paper about them being up against the Arab hordes, massed to attack at any minute and help the murderous Palestinians eat the first born son of every Israeli...before going back to their celebrity obsessed, reality tv-dictated, fast food addicted, binge drinking lives. The fact is that most Brits don't have the first clue about Israel, how it was formed, the conditions that Palestinians are forced to live in , and the billions of dollars in arms that Israel receives from Uncle Sam.
I know a lot of Brits come in YA and take the piss out of Americans for their ignorance & stupidity, but most Brits are no better.



Personally, I think Israel is a fascist state. And if that isn't the ultimate irony I don't know what is.

What do you think about "The United States Pledge of Allegiance"? (Open to all readers)?



I have six questions below after The United States Pledge of Allegiance.  Please answer all six questions in your response.



It reads:



"I pledge allegiance



To the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands: One nation, under God, indivisible, With liberty and justice for all."



Questions:



1.  What Country are you from?



2.  What is your religion?



3.  Do you think it should be required that students in our schools be required to recite it?



4.  Do you think it should be changed back to what it was before 1954 or to an earlier version?



5.  If it was changed back to an earlier version, without the words "under God", would you support requiring all students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance?



6.  If someone refused to recite it, do you believe they should be punished or forced to leave The United States of America?



Please feel free to leave any other comments you may have after your six answers.



Thanks!

you must have been watching southpark.  outside of the liberal zealots polled, most people thought it was a draw.  biden was caught on SEVERAL innacuracies and few people had their perceptions changed.  you sound eeriely similar to the people that thought it was all over for obama before he won against hillary.  perhaps you might learn from history and wait till the ACTUAL ELECTION.



your question has no answer as your facts are false and your assumption is CERTAINLY IN ERROR.

Fill up my car with gas and extra gas in spare containers. Get a new prepaid phone, out of town, without my name attached to it. Withdraw all my money and close my bank accounts.

The government created policy that allowed people to be greedy. However people had a choice not to borrow more money than they could afford to pay back.



So both sides need to take the blame for the poor economic situation we are in.



Throwing more money at the situation with the bailout isn't the magic cure in a free market economy, things are about to get really bad in America!

It was a combination of government, corporations, and us that caused the financial crises. It was the government's fault for ignoring simple safety regulation (notice I said simple,and not complete regulation), it was the corporation's fault for misleading the folks who trusted them to give them a deal they could actually afford in the longterm, and it was our fault for not doing EXTREME research of the deals that lenders were shoving in our faces.



So basically in order to avoid this situation in the future the government needs to watch over the market more closely, but not apply the constraints of over regulation. Simply safety regulation should only be applied in order to prevent another crises. But trust me, this sort of situation won't happen again anytime soon. The government will be closely watching the market to keep it in check and more importantly, the banks will be scrutinizing every detail on on credit resumes when we apply for a loan, just like they were doing not that long before going crazy, and give people a loan that they can actually afford.



I'd say the most important role belongs to us as we are a last resort to when the lenders become reckless and the government looks the other way. You, I and everyone need to make sure we can really afford the loan we are getting in the longterm and always live within your means and maybe even a bit less than your means in order to give yourself breathing room.



When you here politicians arguing about more regulation and less regulation they are just mirroring the philosophies of their respective parties. Really what our country need is to focus on having the the right regulation without applying too many constraints that stifle our  economy's growth but enough to make sure the market can't make extremely risky moves that could place our the entire market infastructure in danger.

It's not really a stock market crisis... the stock market works fine.  It's a credit crisis (nobody trusts anyone else enough to lend them money).  This is due to nobody knowing how much securities backed by bad mortgages are worth.  Usually they're worth however much people are willing to pay for them, but since nobody wants to buy them, nobody can accurately assign them a value.  This is causing companies to not know how healthy other companies (or themselves) are, so everybody's holding onto their cash and not lending to anyone.  The problem is caused by three main factors imo:



1. Goverment corruption.  The policymakers who set the rules are beholden to the players of the game.  It's not an impartial system when companies pay to get officials in key positions for the specific purpose of increasing their net profits by getting favorable legislation passed.



2. Poor oversight.  Individuals will screw others in the name of profits, especially if there is no consequense to them.  The same goes for companies.  The rules need to be enforced; in this case, the rules that say firms are required to act in good faith when you give out a loan to someone, and not put them into a position they can't recover from.  They should check to make sure people's applications are accurate instead of passing the buck because they're going to sell the income stream from the mortgage anyway.



3. Personal fiscal irresponsibility.  Regardless of whether a bad loan is available or not, the ultimate decision of what to do with the money you earn rests with the individual.  You can't legislate good fiscal common sense.  When a majority of americans can't balance a checkbook, bad things are bound to happen.  Learning about money is essential for survival in today's world, but it's not a required class like math, history, or PE.  It should be.

The Presidency of Bill Clinton loosened the rein's of Regulation's on buying homes in 1992, they wanted every American to be able to buy a home so they deregulated the rules in purchasing a home. Then companies like Freddie Mac and Sally-May who were supposed to be handing the home purchases lied about how good the Program was doing, so the CEO's of both companies could get there Yearly bonus. The Republicans problems began when they took the  deregulation of housing hugh step further and started deregulating everything they could to make MONEY! They knew that the housing market would be in trouble because people were buying house's that could not afford them. In 2004 the Republicans went to Congress and told anyone who would listen that the housing market was in trouble, but the Democrats lied and said everything was just GREAT, and here we are now with this problem. By the way the meeting about the the Problems with Sally/Freddie Mac are on tape and can be seen! Both Parties the Democrats and Republicans are to blame for the Wall Street Bail-out!  Now, the average American must PAY for it!

If your trying to hint that you think obama is going to be assassinated like jfk then id watch your back. Its one thing to wish death upon someone else but its quite another to compare it to someone who made it in the history books. Be careful what you wish for. You might just get it

Does anyone remember what Mr. Biden said about the actual position of Vice President?



I had walked out of the room to do something and only caught the tail end of it.  I was going to look through the transcript but it would take too long to read through all of that stuff.  I can recall him saying something about the vice president and how their power is just the power to vote...or something like that.  Anyway, just wondering.  If you are tired of talking about the debate or hearing about it, that's understandable, just wondering if anyone would mind giving me a quick little recap about that particular part and what it was said in response to.  Thank you!

He was responding to Palin's idea that the role of the VP can somehow be "expanded" - that this is allowed under the Constitution.



He said that the role of VP is clearly defined in the Constitution - it is to vote when there is a tie and that's all.



So obviously, Palin isn't JUST deficient in foreign policy - Constitutional matters are also news to her as well.

Did it bother anyone else that Palin avoided the questions?



When the question was concerning foreign policy, Palin deviated and discussed alternative energy.  She seemed comfortable only when the moderator selected an issue that she had rehearsed and memorized at McCain's Arizona retreat.  Sticking to talking points made her knowledge seem artificial, and she claimed that McCain would reform Washington without doing much to substantiate her points.



</question>



<additional details>



Truth - Her performance was cleverly scripted and highly rehearsed.  It wasn't sincere.



Leopard - If you think Biden was scripted and Palin was not, you are a partisan right-winger who would've declared Palin the winner if she stood there and sang Jail House Rock.

Yes, she got away with answering tough questions wrong by not answering them at all. She obviously memorized her talking points, especially since she kept smiling no matter what the topic of discussion was. I found that very unprofessional. She didn't really answer any questions even though she sounded good saying it. Also, the shout outs and winking were very juvenile.

Clintonese is the tactic of saying anything you want to and later saying that isn't what you meant or that what you said was taken out of context.



Joe Biden, Hillary and most of the Dems voted for the war in Iraq.

I think that if Obama had chosen Clinton he would have received more votes on balance.



But I don't blame him for not picking her.  She, and her husband, would have totally overshadowed his presidency.

Because Hilary Clinton was his main opponent during them primaries and if he put her on the ticket the McCain campaigners would have used their disagreements to their advantage. Biden can get away with mirroring all his ideas without looking like a hypocrite. These days you can't have a president who surrounds him/herself with people that don't like him/her like Honest Abe did. You would get killed in the polls these days by the ideological disparaties.

He and Hillary don't play well together - personality clashes.



But I believe he has her in mind to initiate his new health care plan, since that's where her interest lies.



That could ultimately be great for her - in Canada, the founder of Medicare, Tommy Douglas, is a national hero, even though he was with an extreme left-wing party that nobody would put into power on a bet.

Joe Biden/Bob Dole question?



During the debate did anyone else notice Biden holding his pen and moving his hand like Dole did when he was campaigning?



odd and funny isn't it?



</question>



<additional details>



I know Dole has a physical disability with his hand..



I fell asleep during the presidential candidates debate.  This one is just as dull...I have nothing against any of the candidates and I still don't know who to vote for.



To me it seems like Palin is talking down to people.  I don't know if she is aware of the way she is perceived or if it is just me that sees it that way.  I don't think it is on purpose, maybe it is just because she has children and she is used to talking that way.

McCain did the same thing.



The reason Dole does it, though, is because he has no use of that hand.  He does it to mask his disability.  I'm not being flip; it's true.  He's very self-conscious about it.

By the way, I fell asleep during the first debate.  But I do know that John McCain has been through a lot, and although I don't agree with everything, I still think he has some more experince then some others.  And Sarah can learn!

She even has a lot of experience in foreign policy , she can see Russia from Alaska!!! What more could we ask?

I have never voted for a president because of the vice president they choose. What bothers me is that Obama has the same amount of experience as Palin and his is at the top of the ticket. His inexperience and indecision on important matters in the past is what scares me. I am voting for McCain as a vote against Obama whom I think has nothing to bring to the table but talk. Actions speak louder than words to me, and I think Obama has no qualifications that would make a good president. The crazy thing is so many people are buying his crap.

I heard that too, glad everyone can flub a word occasionally. I know I do.  Did you also hear Palin call Biden "O'Biden"?



Yes, we can still pick on Bushisms because Bush does it regularly making it pathetic not amusing.

Is tory a derogatory term for Conservative?



I don't see the word Tory as derogatory, it's just the old name of the party. However, watching the Conservative conference this week very few delegates referred to the party as Tories, but at the Labour conference they rarely said Conservative, instead saying Tory.



The BBC often uses Tory as an abbreviation, but should they if it's seen as insulting?

For right-wingers peddling the claim that Obama is the most liberal?



The National Journal rated him the 16th most liberal in his first year in the Senate.  As for Biden, his foreign policy standing was rated 71% liberal and 25% conservative by the Almanac of American Policies.



It rated his votes "most liberal" in 2007, when he missed one-third of the votes due to campaigning that determined the over-all ranking.  The more respected ranking by the USCD had Obama as the 21st most liberal Senator in 2006, while Biden was the 29th.  In 2007, John McCain voted 90% with George Bush.

He's the Prime Minister of Britain.  Took over after Tony Blair resigned.



He's also Scottish, which seems to enrage some of the bigots over there, so they're ultra-critical of anything he does.



Seems like a decent chap.  Don't know why they don't like him.

Well, not having a TV, I'm not exactly certain.  I do think that the mass media are giving him a very hard time over a lot of very small issues though.  Though Stag chili had gone up 16p the last time I bought some: which I found annoying.  The oil crisis is due to america stealing oil countries from their populations.  Gas could be given away virtually free if they wanted, it's simply a by product of the oil industry!  I genuinely don't know what he's done, but it's nowhere near as bad as it was while Thatcher was in power, and the mass media did nothing but praise her.  This is a strange society that we live in.

He is the Prime Minister of the UK. Most of his infamy is due to his single handed destruction of the UK economy whilst acting like he knew how to be Chancellor. Although the current economic crisis is a global one, his past antics mean that the UK is not well equipped to deal with it and the country has no money.

It is socialist if every American does not become a stakeholder in the profits.  We need to know how the individual American will see a benefit from this buy out.  Actually, the Republicans gave us the means of profit by lowering taxes; now we are being asked to give the money back.



Something tells me that the only economic system that was straight forward and made sense was the feudal system of the middle ages.  The Lord owned everything and the commoners got to use it.  We have replaced appointed lords with elected officials and CEOs, the captains of industry, our modern gods and golden calves.  They see themselves as above the rest of us.  Any money or goods that we have actually is theirs, we just get to use it through their largesse.

If this was such a good idea why don't the Democrats pass it so that can take all the credit? I mean the Democrats do controll Congress and with a little arm twisting they could pass it with out the Republicans!



Since this whole problem is because of ill conceived government regulations and poor oversight the government needs to get out of the mortgage business. First Fannie and Freddie should declare bankruptcy and then either sold  or closed. Sarbanes Oxly also needs to be repealed which would mean that several banks that are in trouble would then be ok.

Good question, and it would really take some digging as it has been hidden very well.  I suspect that Soros and others filtered it through areas like the Chinese who donated to the Hillary campaign.  We learned quickly where that came from.

Why does Britain copy America yet trash the American people?



Regardless of whichever language you speak, you are being consumed by a thing called AMERICANISM.  A Mcdonalds on every block, a massive shopping mall in every city, ASDA (a subsidiary of Walmart) all over the country...and not to mention Britain's obesity rate, the second highest in the world



You spend so much trying to be American. You have lost your identity of being British and you try and talk, look, and act all American. Unfortunately, you are being consumed by a cancerous thing called Americanism.



Your British armed forces no longer fight for Queen and country, more like the President and our country, and unfortunately whether you like it or not, you are America's 51st state.



Why do you copy America? Is it because of our television which portrays America as a place full of glitz and glamor? I thought Britain would be a unique place to visit. Clearly it wasn't.



</question>



<additional details>



Westernization and Americanization are different things.  France is Westernized, but it's not Americanized.



I saw a few wiggers in England.  Who do they think they are?  American gangsters?  Don't they know how pathetic they sound?  They shouldn't speak American slang with a British accent.  It doesn't mix well.



I know I'll get a lot of hate comments for this, but there is no such thing as 'British culture.'  British culture was destroyed when America took over as superpower.

Then they are willing to allow another one just like him to do the same for another 4 years.

Why does America copy the UK in all their TV shows, every single successful TV show in recent years is a British one. America did not invent the shopping mall and the biggest shopping mall is not in America.
We're not copying you, otherwise we'd be aiming for across the board illiteracy and morbid obesity. We'd have no free healthcare and we'd all be paranoid brainwashed fools.



Why did you vote a redneck into office?, we'd never do that.
Why do American tourists poke their faces through the gates of Buckingham palace with glee by the thousand (an unattainable aspiration for you eh?).
We're helping you fight a war, why are you so ungrateful?.
Why did you fund the IRA and help them to terrorise our country?.
Why did America request aid for its Katrina victims when it boasts about its economy, what a fu*king disgrace?.
Why are so many Americans on the poverty line hoping to God they don't get sick because they can't pay?.
Why would Britain which has existed for Centuries longer than America copy it?, you're whole country is built by and based on Great Britain and Europe but you lack the humility and frankly the brains to sustain your profile throughout the world without being thoroughly detested.
Why are you all illiterate?.
Why are you so deluded?.
Why is your currency worthless?.
Why are you bastardising another man's language every time you open your mouth?.
Why does your government NOT want you to have a passport, only 20% of Americans have passports?.
Why can't you even point to your own country on a map you thick bastards?.
The whole world is laughing at you and yet you think it wants to be like you.
If a homeless person needs a kidney in the UK they don't have to sell the other one to pay for it.



Keep your obesity, keep your guns, keep your brainwashing, keep your racism, keep your homophobia, keep your illiteracy, keep your deluded notions of self-importance, keep Madonna, keep miss teen Carolina, keep Bush and FU!K OFF back to fatty lala land where you belong.

I do not engage with anything American ever.  Their soft drinks and fast foods are poison to the human body.  The US culture is that of the town clock: it has many faces, all pointing in completely different directions.  Asda, Walmart, is a legalized form of re-introducing slavery.  Why can't people see these things?  The TV is now so one-sided that anybody who believes anything that it says is simply being lied to.  I am absolutely amazed that people simply cannot see these facts.



And, America isn't the super-power that you think it is.  Thirty or forty years time and you'll be in fourth place.  Then, without the crippling debt that the US is inflicting upon Africa, they'll pass America as well!



Things are changing.  We'll just have to hope that the US population wakes up to the fact that their electoral system is a charade, before the US military destroys the planet.

I couldn't argue with some of your observations, but you must realize there are some generalizations within your comments. I for one certainly do not want to be Americanized and want as little as possible to do with your country, both politically, financially and military.



In my opinion, if you took a national poll in the UK of whether the public would like a closer relationship with the US, or to distance ourselves from you, I think the latter would be the majority.



It's just unfortunate that we have had governments who seem to want to foster this "special relationship", which is at odds with what the general



public actually thinks of the US and it's government.



As for being the "51st state", well yes I can see that, but bare in mind, the majority in the UK don't want to be involved with Iraq, or the US military. Also, this issue was one of the main factors in Tony Blair's downfall.



To sum up, I personally, metaphorically speaking want as little to do with you as possible(no offence meant, it's just how it is), and I feel that the majority of people in the UK feel the same.

There is and always has been a dominant culture that dominates the world.  It was once the middle east, and has been the countries around the Mediterranean for centuries - for example - Greece (well Athens) and Rome and then later Venice and Genoa in the early days of trading. IN northern europe, Saxons was dominant which explains why in England we speak English -a germanic language. Spain and Portugal then became more dominant as we explored the Atlantic.  The centre of the world culturally shifts.  It is fashionable to emulate this dominant culture. The legacy of Rome lasted for years and influenced language, architecture, business, family life, living styles, Greece influeced philosophy, language, poltiticic, food, etc, as did all the above cultures mentioned and now north American culture influeces every aspect of life in the west and increasingly accross the globe.  American businesses thrive ac cross the world, and the world turns to American culture. Films, television, clothing food are exported which all dilute or compliment and definitely influence our own national identities.  It is also natural to resent this dominant culture; to disapprove of it's brashness and it's dominance, to favour our own people and unique cultures, to worry that the stuatus quo will change, but also to be influenced by it. it will not last forever, another culture will rise and the world will turn to face that and be influenced by that in the future.

You mean the one thing that Palin agrees with Biden is that gays should have protected rights?

All four of them think marriage is defined as between 1 man and 1 woman.



All four of them think you cannot discriminate against someone because of the personal choices you make as far as being straight or gay.  That a partner shouldn't be denied their civil rights in legal and governmental matters.



No one wants to endorse a law saying that all religious institutions have to sanction gay marriage either, so it's a relatively safe political position with the majority of Americans.

I wouldn't really state it in that manner.  Not "protected rights," but civil rights.  I heard them say they were in agreement against gay marriage.

Yes as far as being able to have rights when one is hospitalized etc. Those rights would also include heterosexuals if they aren't married. Now if family doesn't want you by a loved one if they're dying or seriously ill you can't be. Those rights do need to be given.

I think that he has sold out to Bush and the United States. His ambition to make India a nuclear state under Bush's auspices is a total sellout of sovereignty. I support the CPI and the CPM, for leaving the coalition because of this issue, and would be happy if they became the government. Unfortunately this is not very likely. Addendum money was passed around in Parliament, to get MP's to vote for this deal, so the agreement is based on fraud and corruption.Oh Krishna Menon, where are you that we need you know! Probably turning over in his grave.

Your source does not say if Obama was the one who taught the tactics. It just says Obama trained them that could mean anything. The reason why the media is not covering it is because Acorn was using a act that gave them the right to do this. It's funny how they say this is the cause of the financial crisis but don't offer any stats on how much money they got the banks to loan.

What president did you "grow up" with?



Although I was born with Nixon in the White House, and I just barely remember Carter, I really grew up (ages 7-15) with Reagan.  Now it seems like ancient history.



Ever look at your life this way?  I am certainly not old (35) but when I think about it, I grew up when the Soviets were parading missiles around, people were shot at the Berlin wall, the IRA was bombing the Brits, and Duran Duran was top of the charts.  Computers were huge clunky boxes that made little blipping sounds and people just threw whatever garbage in their car straight out the window on the highway.



Some things are still the same though - Ted Kennedy for instance.



We always look back at "the way things were" through the lens of technology and such, but ever politically?  How far have we come?  Looking back, can you even really see how we got here?

I was born in '62, and I remember Nixon the best from my childhood.  Watergate was such a huge thing.  I remember my mom watching hearings on TV for hours and hours.  I didn't fully understand what was going on, but I knew it was important.  I also knew that when he resigned that it was a big and sad moment in American history.



Reagan was the first I ever voted for, and he has been my favorite president during my lifetime.  I still refer to myself as a "Reagan Republican" to distinguish myself from the neocons who are currently in control, and who I don't like (although I like them better than Democrats).

I was 7-15 for for HW Bush and Clinton's first term.



I remember the Berlin Wall falling and my dad being forced into retirement due to defense cutbacks.



Politically we've not come far, I feel we've regressed.  Look at Bush 41 compared to his son or Clinton compared to Obama.  Both Bush 41 and Clinton were actual compromisers and who had to work with the other party by virtue of its control of Congress.  And they were centrists compared to Bush 43 and the candidates today.  Centrists being what most Americans are.

How can you say this is not more of the same?



McCain has promised that he will balance the budget by 2013. That's unlikely. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center says that without serious spending cuts, McCain's tax proposals will actually increase the size of the debt between $5.1 trillion and $7.4 trillion over the next 10 years. So balancing the budget would require cutting federal spending by 25 percent. McCain, however, has proposed very few specific

Civil unions and marriages have the same privileges, but are 2 different things. Biden specifically said last night that he did not support gay marriage, but rather civil unions. If you have the time to play the debate from last night back before you post a silly question you will see that Sarah Palin agreed with him



btw, what difference does it make to you who wants to get married as long as you have your own life going on and it isnt being interfered with?

It's a clever rationale- whilst unions will be recognisable by laws and homosexuals will have the same legal rights as married heterosexuals- they are leaving it to the churches to decide what marriage is- the churches are almost totally unanimous that it is between a man and a woman.



Basically the idea is that people with law and business degrees shouldn't be deciding on issues like the 'sanctity' of marriage- that's for the people and the religious institutions that marry them.



In a country that separates church and state that seems like a  sensible position to me.

From what I've heard so far, the majority of polls projected Biden as the clear winner.  Palin's only objective was to save herself from the horrific interviews that preceded the debate, and her script worked well enough to do it.  The stench of fear is thick:  we're thinking about how our country will decline if the anti-progressive Republicans win.

There was nothing "victorious" about her not quivering and talking incoherently for a change.



However, she didn't say or do anything that was a "wow factor".



The fact that people "relate to her" because she is "common" and can talk to the "common folk" with words like  "you betcha", and "dontcha" and "nucular" doesn't quite cut it.



These are the same people that argue they don't like the "intellectual types" running for presidency.



Uh huh.



And by the way she completely sidestepped THREE questions and didn't answer them and was almost RUDE in saying I'm not going to answer this the way either of you want me to (okay) and frankly, she had to project CONFIDENCE or McCain was dead in the water.



That's about all she accomplished and that was the high point that you will ever see in the McCain campaign.



Same people who supported her before support her now but the "intellectuals" of which there are many, will choose the Obama/Biden ticket.

I am a liberal, and I know that the idea of a government job where I don't have to work very hard, can call in sick a lot, and get yearly pay raises appeals to me. The Republicans are always talking about hard work and a drug free workplace and that scares me.

I appreciate your effort to get to understand us, but your little rant indicates you're probably too far sunk into the conservative mind-set to get it.
But I'll try.
We do believe in fairness...that everyone have the same opportunities for success.  We believe the system is rigged to favor the wealthy and we believe in leveling the field.  Not a "hand out", but a "hand up".
We do believe in fairness...under the law.  That our Country was founded on the Rule of Law and that no one, INCLUDING the President, it above it.
We do believe in women's rights, including Palin.  She has just as much a right to make an idiot of herself as anyone else.
Not all of us believe in abortion (I don't, except in cases of rape, incest or life of the mother).
We do believe that 2 consenting adults who love each other and want to have a legally-recognized relationship should be able to; regardless of their gender.
We do not believe in a one-world government.  We love this country.
Here's a shocker for you...we do believe in protecting our Nation!  We believe that war is evil, but sometimes necessary, and if necessary, we should win as quickly and decisively as possible.  But the necessary war must also be morally justifiable; which the war against terrorism is, and the war in Iraq is not.



It's funny you mention the "silent majority"; because most people agree with at least some of the statements I made above, including, I would venture to guess, you.

It was obviously not something she thought of during the debate. She asked at the start of the debate if she could call him Joe, just so that she could use this line later. She didn't think of it so its not clever on her part, but one of her advisors did and it was slightly clever on their part.

Not clever.
That's probably why Palin asked Biden if she could call him Joe.



I couldn't believe that was the first thing Palin said as she shook Biden's hand. I feel she was attempting to "jab" him because Obama addressed McCain by his first name, John. She also addressed Obama by his first name. It was meaningless on her part.

Canada and England both have "free" healthcare. You'll wait forever for substandard doctors to treat your problems as minimally as possible because they're not making the bucks the great drs here in america make. They are also taxed out the butt to pay for this "free" healthcare.

They do, but for most of their critical surgery Canadians come to the US. I live within 50 miles of the Canadian border and our hospital caters to Canadians looking for QUALITY health care. The socialized medicine in Canada had lowered doctors pay resulting in many Canadian doctors coming to the US.

Because Canadians were stupid enough to elect people that decided to tax the hell out of them to pay for a system that doesn't work.  And what do they get for their money???  Lotteries to determine who in the village gets to see a doctor every month, and trips to the United States to get decent medical care.

The Canadian health care sucks. In fact, up there if you are really sick, they come to the US for treatment. It takes upwards of 3 months to get an appt. to see a Dr. and even then you have to wait all day.

She just proved another point that she has no idea what is going on.  This eludes to the fact that McCain picked a VP that has no foreign policy experience. He could have picked someone that compliments him but he didn't.  She isn't ready and even though she saved the campaign from looking worse tonight, again, she lacks substance and she isn't paying attention like she needs to be.  So this is a classic case of not being prepared and knowing the facts before you state them.  I was impressed with Biden because not only did he assert his answers but he backed them up with true facts.  You can't deny the facts.  When your right your right.  And when you are wrong, then like Palin was, you are wrong.
