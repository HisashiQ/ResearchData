The modern history of Viet Nam includes the French Colonial government.  The UN was not involved until after the war for independence was won.

Depending on what other traffic is transiting the locks, it can take most of a day. 20 hours. All ships must stop in the clear water lake in the center so traffic can clear for the rest of the transit.

The Panama Canal took  the U. S., over 10 years to build. It includes six double sets of locks (floating elevators to take ships from one level of water to another) and several man-made lakes. The United States controlled the Canal until 1999. Since then, Panama has operated the canal.



The French originally started building the canal in 1881 and abandoned it in 1889. The US then re-started the building in 1903.



According to the Panama Canal Authority, it takes from 8-10 hours for a port-to-port transit,  per ship,depending on the size of the vessel

Russia's way of dealing with Europe (in this regard) is fair enough. Brown is a US poodle and had been ordered to try to rope in the EU to condemn Russia anyway. What Russia does in its own backyard is 1000 times more above board than what the US does ON ANOTHER CONTINENT ENTIRELY. If Russia was on the American Continent doing stuff the US would have something to say about it, wouldn't they? Like f*** off or ELSE? Unbelievable.

Can't say I agree entirely with Hideous sun demon ( he looks a bit scary) but I see his point, the Russians are arrogant bastards and always have been, and now they are tapping their new resources and are wealthy again, they are in turn flexing their muscles once more and will try to dominate Europe in the coming decades for sure, they can't stand the fact that the US in many ways was responsible for covertly bringing down their stinking empire and dominance over the Soviet block countries, so now they are back and we are seeing the wimpy EU groveling at their feet for fear of losing out on energy deals.

England or should I say Britain has always shown more guts than its European partners, it stood alone fighting for the free world for nearly two years while the rest of Europe capitulated against the krauts, so why the hell should we bow to these ugly Russian mugs, we all seem to be pointing at the US for our problems, I think it would serve us right if they decided to pull out of NATO as some Americans want to do and leave Europe to the mercy and eventual dominance of the Russians.
