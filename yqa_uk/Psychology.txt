If you feel nothing in this world , what would you do?



I don't know what 's going on with me. Suddenly I felt no interest on everything surrounding me in my life. No purpose and no future goal.
I try to ask myself what do I want? But I can't ask until now. I don't know what I really wanted. Can give me some suggestion and tellin me what 's wrong with me?

What should i do.....? what is the most likely outcome do u think?



i have some work-type information that another person wants. i need information from them too. they have given me some info in the past, but i need more for it to be effective. HOWEVER, if i give them the info they ask, it could help them enable them to leave their job early and not give me any more info at all.



of course it may make them take me more seriously and stay to help me with the info i need as they are grateful.
they could also just choose to leave their job early if they are determined, anyway despite it being more difficult/risky if i dont tell them what they want to know.



which is the most likely outcome? should i tell them or not?



</question>



<additional details>



if i tell them this info, it may also gain me credibility for my "expertise" and my arguments for them to delay leaving, and with our other discussions of info i need, of course it assists in opening the door they need to go tho, WHAT TO DO?

Do people who were sexualy abused as a child have little respect for their lives?



Clearly a generalization, but I know a few people who have experienced this and they drink and sleep around - with very little care for what they should do with their lives.  they can't maintain relationships and hang around with some very loose moral people.  What are your thoughts on this?

I think sexual abuse affects each individual differently.  While some may drink and sleep around others become a victim, and remain a victim throughout their entire life, never really taking any responsibility for their actions because they were harmed as a child.  They see it as a "get out of jail free" card.  Some are able to rise above the abuse and have a normal and happy life.  I wish it were that way for all the victims.

i agree with beautybl.



but when that happens it makes your world topsy turvry.



an adult is to protect and show love and show how you are meant to act. when they abuse you, you are taught that this is how people show you affection, even though you dont like it.



this is all you know unless you have shared it with someone who has taken time to make you understand that this is not true.
you also numb your feelings anyway you can to cope. then the wall you build around yourself becomes so strong that you never allow anyone to truly love you as you were meant to be love. and even if you atart taking bricks out of the wall the pain starts to come back. imagine how vulnerable you would be again with no wall at all!!
people tend to carry on sleeping around because that is how they feel they are loved even if it does make them feel even crappier. its inbuilt.
i wouldn't say they use it as a get out of jail free card, it may seem that way but it isn't that easy.

Hi, Derek.  I almost wonder if the person you should ask about this is your doctor or other mental health worker.  They deal with people in your situation all the time, and they probably have tips for dealing with something like going back to school and having people ask.



If, for some reason, you can't ask your doctor (or other professional), I suppose what I'd say would be something like, "It turns out I have some kind of chemical imbalance, and I was too tired to be able to come to school."  (or, if you feel more comfortable and are with closer friends), you could say, "...and I had to wait until my prescription started to work".



I think the way I'd aim to handle it would be to tell a few of my closer friends whatever I wanted to tell them (don't tell people all your business; they don't need to know that - just tell the basics, such as above).  If you have to, you could say that it turns out you have a chemical imbalance that made you depressed.  Anyway, just tell a couple of closer friends and tell them you won't mind if they answer anyone who asks about you.



Also, make sure you tell your parents (if you haven't) and a counselor at school that people are making fun of you.  Tell the counselor (or have your parent tell him/her) that you're struggling with an issue right now, and you need some ideas on how to stay out of the situations where  you're made fun of.  Maybe someone can suggest something you can to do to help at school (like work in the library or something) that could get you away from some of the kids for a while.  In any case, talk to your parent(s) and the school counselor.



You're at a very, very, hard age; so try to keep in mind that you will grow past this difficult age.  It's not an easy age for anyone.

My mom did the same thing to me growing up and as i became an adult she realized what she did and wanted to help me.  The thing was is she wasn't helping me she was trying to do everything for me and it got really annoying.  So just last week I decided to distance myslef form her and take time away from her for myself.  This is the best thing I have ever done I feel so much better without that weight of my mother on me.  You just need to find yourself and live for yourself.  You can't let anyone else make your choices for you, or let her negative impact affect the rest of your life.  Live your life for yourself and make yoruself happy!!!!

There's probably hundreds of ways to commit suicide, and I highly think you're wasting your time trying to look at methods.



The method is irrelevant, anyways. Shouldn't the fact that they're actually trying to take their lives be alarming enough?



You should be focusing on symptoms that are far more obvious instead.



It's like trying to tell if your car's brakes are worn by glancing at your tires as you get out of your car, as opposed to listening out for sounds, or them "crying out to you", giving you an obvious hint something is wrong.

How can you help someone become a responsible person?



From my experience there are some people who run from responsibility at the first sign of it.  Become depressed and upset when they have to be in the real world.  Is there any way to help this kind of person?



The kind of person who, when starting a new job or relationship, gets lost in the moment of it - and once the novelty wears off gets depressed and moves on.  Keeps drifting through their whole life, but never really drifts anywhere worthwhile, typically being the same lifestyle their whole life.

it comes from fear, not being good enough, being able to live up to expectations, never finding contentment and cant deal with their emotions.



a lot of this comes from rejection by others, self rejection which also harbours rebellion. they feel disappointed a lot.
they need to realise where it started what first brought that feeling into their life. it is like having a tiny hole and a wasp gets in there and starts building a nest. you can get rid of a wasp at a time but you need to find where it is getting in. you need to heal the hole.



some people are so used to living with these things they just see it as normal and not a problem.
i'm afraid until they see the problem and want rid of it, it will be very difficult. stay patient and understanding with them.

I think there are a couple of things here.  Firstly are you living a responsible lifestyle?  In order to reach anybody you have to demonstrate in your life that you have something that they want.  When your life becomes desirable people will then just naturally start asking you for advice.  Lead by example.



Secondly setting goals and have a defined outcome with help with this problem.  If you don't have goals then you operate on feelings.  As soon as something stops feeling good you move on.  I have a website you might find useful that deals with this more.

Okie dokie. I feel like ranting.



I hate, hate, hate, HATE the wanna-be attention seeking 'emos' at our school. They all used to be momma's girls, wearing unicorn shirts and shirts with kittens on them, but now there is a group of kids who think they are emo just because they wear the clothes.



I'm not emo whatsoever, but it still really annoys me when they go on bragging about cutting and suicide attempts and such, and the are total LIES. They are just looking for pity and attention. Sure enough, today a girl in the group decided she would go on and on about how she tried to kill herself, and everyone was buying her stuff, and sitting with her and doing all this garbage for her.



I just thought it was really sick how she used something as horrible as suicide to get attention. And it's not like she's a loner who wants any kind of attention, she was just milking it for all it was worth.



Maybe the reason why this is so touchy for me is because I do have a problem with depression and cutting and suicidal thoughts, but you would never know it, because I don't go using it as a way to get attention. No one would ever guess that I would be that type of person, I'm the girl who wears pink, all bright and bubbly and I'm practically a total opposite of emoness.



For me, my depression actually comes from growing up in an abusive environment. My dad is a crazy jerk, who yells at my siblings and I, calling us 'Lazy *** s***heads' and that he wishes he never had us, and calls us 'fat asses' and 'stupid little sonofabitches' and he's passed his abusive personality to my older sister, who uses me as her personal punching bag.



The thing about growing up in an abusive family is that you don't think twice about being hit, yelled at, shoved, pushed or anything like that. It was when I was 13, and read a book for school about an abusive dad that I realized that I had an abusive family. Before that I always thought it was normal and that all families were like that.



My mom isn't as bad as my dad at all, it's just that she's always at work and isn't around all the time to see what our dad does. She knows what he does, but she always says 'I've had a long day at work, I've done ____ and ____ and I don't want to hear about what's yesterday's news'



It's really confusing, because my parents and sister aren't always abusive. Sometimes they can be the best people in the world, and you think that you would never trade them for anyone, it's just that when they ARE abusive, it get's REALLY bad.



My sister is the worst bully out there. Two years ago, I had to wear long sleeves every day to cover up all the scars she gave me on my arms from clawing and scratching at them. I would constantly have to retan my body to cover the scars, but she always replaced them once they disappeared.



We used to share a room for all our lives, except for the past summer when she moved into the office room. It was HELL living with her. She would make me do my homework in the bathroom when it would be only 8 at night insisting that she was 'tired' she would steal my stuff and if I ever tried to get something back, she would rip it, break it, stain it, or do whatever to it so that it was unusuable.



She's knocked me out before, like when I was sitting at my computer and she told me that our dad had taken away her internet for screaming at him, and she told me to let her on mine. I told her no and she kept insisting that I let her on, and then finally, she grabbed my hair and slammed my head against the wall next to me. I was knocked out for about two minutes.



Another time she and I were in a screaming fight, and she slapped me, so I tried to kick her, and she grabbed my foot and pulled my other one out from under me so my head hit the tile. Only knocked out for a few moments.



She's taken the small plastic rod that you use to turn curtains with and whipped me with it until I was bleeding, and I was screaming, but when I went to show my mother, she scolded me for being so loud because my aunt was at the house.



She's learned all of this from my dad. When I was six or so, I remember sitting on my bed crying and looking at a hand print shaped welt on my thigh where my dad had smacked me. He hit me so hard that there was literally a popped up, swollen ring around the area he smacked me.



He's punched a hole through the bathroom door after I had thrown a plastic fork at him once, and he had hit it so hard that the doorknob smashed into the wall, even though there was one of those protector thingys, and it made a huge hole.



But it's REALLY confusing. My dad, like today, was the absolute best dad to be around. It's 85% of the time that he is the world's best dad, but the other 15% percent are the worst kind of times to be around him.



So it really upsets me when people fake trying to commit suicide because it is something that I have seriously considered before, but I would never be dumb enough to do. I do have a problem with cutting but, like I said you would never know. I only do it on my thighs and just tell everyone the cat was too wild.



It's really a touchy subject for me, because I don't think that depression should be worn as a style when it is actually a real problem.

I know how you feel. I kinda feel like that right now. Im a felon, yet still young, so the future holds little for me for a long time. I have luke warm relation ships with family and females. IDK what the **** to do. But all I do know is that I dont want to be dead. I will at least give myself the chance to find something better. Like some of the people said on here maybe some counseling. IDK. But I hope you feel better. Just think about whats important to you. I know this is cliched, but have you tried religion? They can give you meaningfulness and satisfaction and direction. If not, Id join a support group for depression of something. Start journaling. If not, youre gonna eventually say "FU.CK IT" and kill yourself...

Could she be one of them too?



My mother died when i was 9 and since then i have felt ignore and abandoned by my relatives and my dad. My relatives would blame my father for my mother;s death (which is totally not true). This hurt me and i stopped maintaining contacts with those people as they would say nasty stuff to me also.



I know they don't like me, but i didn't do nothing wrong. They are most probably jealous of me because even though i have a dysfunctional family, i have always been very bright in studies as compared to my cousins, they probably hate me cause we are much better off than them in financial terms and i have a nice big house.



One of this cousins of mine, who claims to be my 'well wisher' always calls me and tells me what all bad things these godmothersabout me during there get togethers. Stuff like 'omg how did she even manage to get admission there' , 'she thinks she is a queen and wears all that gold', ''how can she wear those clothes she looks like a sluy;' and much worse things. All these things are baseless but come out of their crappy mouths.Not having a mother or someone i could confide in doesnt help either, to say the leasy IT HURTS a lot. I have never had someone to love me and comments like these make me feel like i am worthless and that is what i felt all through my childhood.



Sometimes i wonder, why would this 'well wisher cousin' of mine need to even tell me such hurtful things, when everyone on this earth knows those talk are baseless and out of jealousy. I wonder 'Is she one of them too?'



What do you guys think? should i be ignoring this girl?

Yes you should be ignoring her too. She is secretly delighting in the fact that these comments are hurting you. Thats why she ring you to tell you. Someone who rings somebody else only to tell them negative stuff is a sh!t-stirrer and nothing else. Don't bother taking her calls anymore. Shes also ringing to see if you have anything to say about the rest of the family. Shes letting you believe shes on your side, and that shes only telling you all these bad things for your own benefit, but shes also looking for stories from you to carry back to the family. You don't need someone like this in your life. Get rid.

let her know exactly how she is making you feel by what she is saying to you.
if she persists then it is time to move on.



the comments are not constructive in any way to you, therefore are unnecessary.



you need to surround yourself with people you feel love and care for you.



stop worrying about how others feel about you.
live your life to the best of your ability.
find a role model. someone older you respect and can confide in, even if it has to be a counsellor.
god bless you sweet girl.

It doesn't come naturally, and you can fake it. It's a behaviour that is learn through socialization and development. Many women look confident on runways and in magazines but suffer from horrible eating disorders and self esteem and confidence issues. It's one human trait that can be faked, just like being nice, mean, angry, happy, upset, and many more.

If you are calm within yourself, comfortable with who you are and willing to freely discuss opposing ideas without being judgmental, congratulations. You are a confident individual.
Confidence is something that is earned, not faked.



Confidence, for most, comes from a drive. Something that cannot go wrong, something we have to prove, and we are so determined, that we cannot fail. Confidence is often what really makes us tick, whether said subject be positive or negative. Some find determination through something they must overcome, something negative, or it can come through something we want so bad, we will stop at nothing to get it

You can't fake it for long.. you may be able to pretend for a couple of hours and try to present a different person but you can't do it for long,..  you are who you are, and after a while your true character will come through.. actors fake anything.. and slip into another role.. we can do that.. but we can only do it for so long.. then we have to be ''ourselves'' again.. self confidence to a lot of people comes naturally and to those to whom it doesn't.. self confidence is something that cannot be faked for any lenght of time but I believe definitely it is something that can be learned....over time and by setting oneself goals and pursueing them and persevering that will boost a persons self esteem and then it's natural and doesn't need to be faked anymore...

I don't think it comes naturally.  First of all, think about your family and how they raised you.  If they were empathetic and led by example, punished by explaining what you did wrong, and encouraged you when you did right, your self confidence was created healthily.  If your parents neglected you as a child, how can you embrace the world with comfortability as yourself, when your parents don't seem to love you?  If your parents were just plain mean, your confidence towards yourself and your view of the world will start out skewed.  This is just the START, however.  As you progress through life, different events and situations mold you into who you are and how high your esteem/confidence is.  It's hard to switch from low cnfidence to high... sorry for the crappy answer.  bye

the bible says your young men and daughters will dream and have visions. find a church that does an alpha course. in acts in the bible it tells you lots about all the gifts god gives us. they are great you just need to learn how to use them. don't worry.
if you know jesus then ask god to show you what they mean and ask him how he can help you. submit them to god. but don't forget to listen for an answer!



i sometimes find that once i relay them to someone else, that i feel safe talking to, they make more sense, even if it is a long time after,
it's great.
do not go to a spiritualist church!

Thats how this therapist thought he'd help me???  NO we never hugged?? And I think thats very unprofessional . Hugging should not be taking place with your therapist??? That it just WRONG!!!

What is the best way to change thinking habits?



I realized that I think most of my problems are from negative thinking. However, every advice book I get tells me to repeat some religious phrase. Is there a non-religious phrase that has worked for anyone? It's really all about if I'm repeating a good message to myself.



Or is God really the only way out of this thinking pattern?

visit the university of which you are planning to attend. and visit their book store and search for psychology books. every psychology teacher assign the book to his students. it's better to read the books that is in the college of which you are planning to attend.

Dating a BIPOLAR person? Best friend one day, stranger the next?



Please tell me your experience dating (or being friedns with) someone who is bipolar?



My friend is 16 and is on medication (Seroquel) for Bipolar/Schizo.



Even though he's on medication I'm having "communciation" problems. It's like he's my best friend one week then a total stranger the next month.



Is this the normal way bipolar people act?



His behavior was making me paranoid because I felt like he hated me when he wouldnt return my emails or messages when he use t ocall me every day.



My friends saying hes likely acting this way because hes bipolar. But then how do you know if he really likes/hates you or if its the "bipolar?"



I hate waking up each day not knowing if I'm a "friend" or if I'm on his s*** list for reasons I have no control over.



Please tell me your experiences with bipolar people and if you feel it's worth hanging in there?



I love him but even friendship has to be a two way street.

We don't mean to be the way we are, there is an imbalance in us that causes extreme mood swings, manic depression, racing thoughts, voices in our head, sometimes it's like living with other people knocking around in our head.  I have so many roles to fill in my life, I think I was bi-polar years before my diagnosis.  Medication helps, but is not a cure all.  We need compassion, understanding, sometimes a reminder that we need to stop and take a deep breath, several, then begin again.  We need someone to talk to, someone that cares enough to work through the bad times with us and not judge us in the process.  You must be thick skinned to run with us, it may be bumpy, but never a dull ride.  Consistently taking the medications and keeping yourself leveled out is the only help for this disease, but we don't like being level, so we must be encouraged to take the medication.  Check on your friend, pat him on the back during a manic stage and lift him up when he gets depressed.  Friendship is a two way street, but in the end, we are our brother's keeper.

bio-polar People have a lot of things going on in there heads. I don't think that he's not your friend.Sometimes they can talk about things and some times they stay to themselves just to think things throw. His medication may not be the right one. It takes trial and error to get the medications right. Just be open with him and tell him how you feel.
he may not know he is doing this and that it bothers you.He does have highs and lows even on the medication.On the high days its like nothings wrong, but 0n the low days sometimes its hard to talk to anyone. Just give him a chance.

My ex was bipolar and taking Seroquel. He had to go off because he had no insurance and couldn't afford it (it was like $700/month) and I won't lie; things got pretty bad. He ended up getting involved with street drugs and we broke things off on really bad terms.



That was just my experience. Not everyone who has bipolar will end up like he did, especially if they stay on their medication.



Stick with it a little longer if this relationship means a lot to you. Your friend's behavior might just be part of their personality, because I've known a lot of normal people that are just fickle that way. If it drives you nuts after a while, gradually decrease the time you're spending with this person and don't stress out about it.

This is exactly why I get to know someone really well before telling them I'm Bipolar. Your friend is taking medication for a reason, he has an imbalance in his mind he cannot help. I'm not alluding that this gives him a "pass" to treat you like dirt that's just wrong. But he must have shared that sensitive information with you for a reason. Being Bipolar myself I can tell you there is a stigma in society on us it's sad, so he trusts you to tell you that.There will be times yes this illness will make him more sensitive or more irritable, but if you know (or get to know him well as a person not just an illness) you will be able to tell that apart from times he is "not himself". Like everyone else we have our "normal" good and bad days, when he is not well you will clearly see that as a pattern. It's something I wouldn't wish on anybody.

Psych 101 is just the foundations of Psychology.  I found it to be boring and alot of studying.  However, you get past it and through it~the other courses are much better and much more interesting.  Psychology is a wide open field and major, stick it out you will find alot of opportunities in it.  Good Luck!

There could be two reasons..  either your sister is nice because she wants something from you.. a favour.. or this could be severe.. if she acts totally out of character and is not her usual self and this goes on for any lenght of time.. she may be suffering from depression.. if a person changes their usual behaviour drastically .. that is a red alert.. unless she wants a favour as I say..  but if she is now becoming a loner,. that indicates she may be depressed.. tell your parents about this.. she may need help.. she may be depressed.. it's an alarm sign if a person changes a lot in the way they usually act...just mention it to your parents and let them decide what to do... it's not your responsibility but you are definitely right that you want to understand and you seem a responsible person and you love your sister even if you don't get along often.. so do the right thing..  mention this to your parents if this continues with her acting against her true nature...xx

Whenever I ask people questions about their 'deeper self'. You'll find out that they don't really know what their deeper motivations are, they don't understand themselves and don't know what the core of their person looks like. They fall into circular logic immediately.

Why do i feel down and how to feel better?



an american ex-pat, i spent all last night at a cr*ppy election party, with wierd nightclub atmosphere. i'm very relieved that obama won. but after election, maybe some letdown. also, the evening before, i met with a guy i went out with a month ago, to talk, as we run into one and other alot amongst friends and there's some tension.  i felt like i processed it pretty well at first, but now i'm feeling some kind of aftershock or something. and some friends may be distancing since i told them i went out with him. one because i think she likes him another because i think he liked me and he feels hurt. and so on. life seems heavy.

What is the best way to change thinking habits?



I realized that I think most of my problems are from negative thinking. However, every advice book I get tells me to repeat some religious phrase. Is there a non-religious phrase that has worked for anyone? It's really all about if I'm repeating a good message to myself.



Or is God really the only way out of this thinking pattern?

The greatest salesman in the world.  by Og Mandingo



this book has a very suddle hint about God but does not use the word and yes it has scrolls you have to repeat but they are not about God, very helpful stuff, here I attached one of the ten so you get a clue.  good luck.



I will persist until I succeed.



In the Orient young bulls are tested for the fight arena in a certain manner.  Each is brought to the ring and allowed to attack a picador who pricks them with a lance.  The  bravery of each bull is then rated with care according to the number of times he demonstrates his willingness to charge in spite of the sting of the blade.  Henceforth will I recognize that each day I am tested by life in like manner.  If I persist, if I continue to try, if I continue to charge forward, I will succeed.



I will persist until I succeed.



I was not delivered unto this world in defeat, nor does failure course in my veins.  I am not a sheep waiting to be prodded by my shepherd.  I am a lion and I refuse to talk, to walk, to sleep with the sheep.  I will hear  not those who weep and complain, for their disease is contagious.  Let them join the sheep.  The slaughterhouse of failure is not my destiny.



I will persist until I succeed.



The prizes of life are at the end of each journey, not near the beginning; and it is not given to me to know how many steps are necessary in order to reach my goal.  Failure I may still encounter at the  thousandth step, yet success hides behind the next bend in the road.  Never will I know how close it lies unless I turn the corner.



Always will I take another step.  If that is of no avail I will take another, and yet another.  In truth, one step at a time is not too difficult.



I will persist until I succeed.



Henceforth, I will consider each day’s effort as but one blow of my blade against a mighty oak.  The first blow may cause not a tremor in the wood, nor the second, nor the third.  Each blow, of it self, may be trifling, and seem of no consequence.  Yet from childish swipes the oak will eventually tumble.  So it will be with my efforts of today.



I will be liken to the rain drop which washes away the mountain; the ant who devours a tiger; the star which brightens the earth; the slave who builds a pyramid.  I will build my castle one brick at a time for I know that small attempts, repeated, will complete any undertaking.



I will persist until I succeed.



I will never consider defeat and I will remove from my vocabulary such words and phrases as quit, unable, impossible, out of the question, improbable, failure, unworkable, hopeless, and retreat; for they are the words of fools.  I will avoid despair but if this disease of the  mind should infect me then I will ignore the obstacles at my feet and keep mine eyes on the goals above my head, for I know that where dry desert ends, green grass grows.



I will persist until I succeed.



I will remember the ancient law of averages and I will bend it to my good.  I will persist with knowledge that each failure to sell will increase my chance for success at the next attempt.  Each nay I hear will bring me closer to the sound of yea.  Each frown I meet only prepares me for the smile to come.  Each misfortune I encounter will carry in it the seed of tomorrow’s good luck.  I must have the night to appreciate the day.  I must fail often to succeed only once.



I will persist until I succeed.



I will try, and try, and try again.  Each obstacle I will consider as a mere detour to my goal and a challenge to my profession.  I will persist and develop my skills as the mariner develops his, by learning to ride out the wrath of each storm.



I will persist until I succeed.



Henceforth, I will learn and apply another secret of those who excel in my work.  When each day is ended, not regarding whether it has been a success or a failure, I will attempt to achieve one more sale.  When my thoughts beckon my tired body homeward I will resist the temptation to depart.  I will try again.  I will make one more attempt to close with victory, and if that fails I will make another.  Never will I allow any day to end with a failure.  Thus will I plant the seed of tomorrow’s success and gain an insurmountable advantage over those who cease their labor at a prescribed time.  When others cease their struggle, then mine will begin, and my harvest will be full.



I will persist until I succeed.



Nor will I allow yesterday’s success to lull me into today’s complacency, for this is the great foundation of failure.  I will forget the happenings of the day that is gone, whether they were good or bad, and greet the new sun with confidence that this will be the best day of my life.



So long as there is breath in me, that long will I persist.  For now I know one of the greatest principles of success; if I persist long enough I will win.



I will persist.



I will win.

There are various techniques and processes one can use....  Meditation, keeping a thought journal, using a religious phrase, even forms of hypnosis, etc.



I even had a coach have us use a rubber band on our wrist.  (Every time we had a negative thought like "I can't do" something, we were to snap the band on the inside of our wrist using a form of negative reinforcement to alter the behavior.)



The point is to reorient your thinking in a way that avoids the negative thoughts and promotes positive thinking.  But to make such an attitude permanent, you're really gonna have to examine some of your core beliefs about yourself.  Expose the negative thoughts you have about yourself deep in your psyche.



Good luck.

What would you do in this situation?



This question is meant for the mental health section:



If you were a teacher. And there was a freshman girl that you were sure that she would pass out and die any second. She struggled with anorexia. She had to have an escort back to class after lunch. She took every chance she could get to purge.
She looked so emaciated that you wanted to be careful with her. So you let her sleep in the back of the classroom bc she was so weak and tired.
So you see this girl staring death in the face



Then this girl eventually goes in to treatment. And when you saw her-after a year of residential treatment. You saw her when she visited. And she looked healthy



How would you feel? Would you get choked up? Bc this student and you (the teacher) were pretty close.



Tell me what your reaction would be

Yes, definitely. I love being single. It's one of the best things that has happened so far. Even though I've had interest in a couple guys, it never goes beyond a crush and I'm completely happy about that because I eventually find they're all a bunch of jerks.



I'm happy with my friends at the moment too. Ironically, I have many friends, but can't confide truly into any one of them. That doesn't bother me too much because I know that generally you will make the truest friends later in life.



I'm in high school at the moment, enjoy every moment of it, enjoy my teachers, enjoy my extracurriculars, and enjoy working my a** off because I know it will be worth every moment of it.

Tell yourself that you will feel a lot better after getting it out of the way. Believe me, I've been there, done that and procrastinating doesn't do a crap for you. Just have goals and if they are important enough to you, you will pursue them. I know it's hard but success will never come without hardship. Best!

You need to hang on in there......coz especially in your nature of business......HARD WORK PAYS OFF.......i can imagine how hard it is to get through the daily grind with all your money being spent on bills,
i can only suggest opening up your life to share with friends or a lover & taking pleasure from other aspects & interests in your life to balance out the ruff & the smooth.........take MOTIVATION from other people that are going through lifes journey with disabilities that they cannot change,but they still keep on PERSEVERING..........your ultimate goal would be to have a career doing something you love & pays well........graphic design will be that career......GOOD LUCK.x.

The way to keep your motivation going strong is to make sure that you are centered and that you keep your positive spirits going. Every time that you hear something that is negative, you have to turn it into a positive. That includes the negativity that you may encounter by not reaching your aim. However, if you learn to find the strength to keep trying you will find the motivation to keep your aim high.



You need to respect who you are and also accept yourself for who you are. You may be able to talk your feelings out with someone who is close to you and they will help guide you, but if you only knew just how great it feels to motivate yourself. If you would like to find a way to help with the way that you feel about yourself you may want to think about seeking counseling. It's not a bad thing to see someone about your feelings, in fact, it can be a good and solid way to go about your lack of motivation. Once you are able to work on yourself, you will be able to unblock all your channels and find true motivation to go for something.

Why do people refer to Obama as?



African American. i mean, why can't he just be Obama, and also, he is 50/50, so why African? when we see a white person we don't say s/he is white, we don't say anything (at least here in Europe), so why do we have to say someone is African American or this or that, i just feel that shouldn't even matter; people should refer to everyone as an individual person and respect them for that. thanx



ps) by the way, congrats to Obama, i love the guy.

Most Americans -obvious from the election- see him for his proposals not for his race.  It's the Democrat Party who pushed the race issue when no one else was referring to his race.  Jesse Jackson has made $MILLIONS pushing the race issue where it doesn't exist for most Americans.  Once Jesse and other race merchants pass, blacks won't be talked into believing they are second class.  It'll be the Dem Party that cries racism if you don't agree with Obama's political policies, when based solely on ideology, not race.

People shouldn't deny what they are. Some people are white, some people are black, some people are mixed, etc. That shouldn't be embarasing or something like that. It's what we are. We're different, and that's what's making each one of us special. Now, human is a weird animal. It does not think in a logical manner. Humans are racists. When they see a different type of people (like when white guys see black guys), they say : "That's weird! They're not normal! They not like us, they gotta be like us to be normal". Okay, not quite like that, but that's kinda the way their mind works (thinks, if you can call it thinking).
Indeed, there are small diffs between races, certain glandes and enzymes, but basically we're all the same species.
We have to say someone is white, black, asian, etc. because that's a fact and we can't deny it. But we don't have to say it ostentatiously.

How can I help my child, with Asperger's, deal with bullies?



My daughter is 11 years old.  She has AS. (Asperger's Syndrome) She is bullied daily.  I don't know what to tell her.  I had the answer for why I think bullies bully people. (Control issues)  What I don't have the answer for is, "What do I do?", "How do I handle it?".  She says that she trys to avoid them, but they seek her out.  I believe her, because they did that with me, too, when I was in school.  Does anyone have any advice?



(I also have Asperger's, so there is a lot I cannot help her with in this situation... I can help her figure out the whys, but not the hows...  I feel really horrible.)

I don't want to look myself in the mirror when I can get myself to NOT care about people. I go for something closer to a reality check: Just how much power do I have to make someone I love less difficult?



Accepting them as they are and giving them room to be who they are gives me room to take the focus off them and pay attention to my own needs. From there it starts becoming much easier to know what I, myself, am going through and to see and act on the early signs. I don't love them less. I love myself more.

You can't control other  people, only yourself.  So if you learn how to handle your own feelings towards the situation you're halfway there.

Easy - you just need to remember that the problem is typically that they are insecure or upset about something else.  Any time someone is particularly nasty, it just means that someone has hurt them - sometimes a long, long time ago, but it was bad for them and it left an emotional hurt they cannot resolve - so they try to take it out on other people, which will not work because it only increases their feelings of self-loathing.



So when someone is being nasty - just wonder who hurt them and try to be sympathetic.  I had one guy being just mindlessly wicked to people, including me, until I looked him in the eye and said "Look, I can tell that someone hurt you, really bad, when you were small. But no one here has done anything to you, so I am not willing to let you take things out on us."  I will never know what happened to him and I probably would not want to know, but he shut his mouth that second and did not rip anyone involved with the group again.  Now some people might not be ready to realize their own demons - I was direct with him because he was so vicious he needed to be corrected fast, but you can safely assume that people who are emotionally cruel have learned cruelty somewhere else.  Don't bother telling irate people that you pity them or anything like that - just know in your own mind that they are suffering on some level.  Also know that a verbal assault is pretty much like a physical one, the person is trying to leave a mark - but whether it does or not is entirely your choice.  Just tilt your head at them as if you are curious and say "hmmm - that was an interesting comment" and walk away.



The other thing is that on some level, the person has framed the situation in their mind so that what they are thinking and saying seems reasonable and correct to them - so perhaps they are afraid of you or feel threatened emotionally by your social or intellectual status - sometimes just imagining what strange thoughts could be going through someone's head that would make their point of view seem reasonable is enough to let them off the hook.  You do not need to agree with how they see the situation, just try to figure out that this looks like from their mind's angle that makes their point seem to be correct to them - it can be enlightening about a host of motives they operate with on a day-to-day basis.  Show a little understanding for someone and it usually takes the wind out of their sails in terms of trying to fight with you about something.

I'm a confident person and I have to say there are down days but most of the time I will have to disagree with you. Loving yourself is not bigheaded. It's necessary. "Loving" yourself is just another word for having common inner respect and self esteem. You can't sell what you don't believe in - and that all comes down to knowing that you're an awesome person inside out.

If you are not on good terms with yourself, then you already are in a bad state. To love oneself is something that normal people do but they constrain it so as not to exaggerate and become narcissi.



There seem to be two sides to human nature which are in a state of discussion if not argument but when both of them can't get on and become frustrated there is no chance for love to show. The opposite means that well-balanced have managed to mix these relationships to a satisfactory degree where most of the time that result of self-love is expressed by love of humanity.

Each of us needs the time to learn our own ways and means. It is what growth is. The teacher needs considerable non-judgmental patience to help them. Don't be discouraged when the "immature warped thinkers" are unable to absorb and apply all of your considerable wisdom in a single day. Don't be discouraged when they don't immediately declare you the owner of all truth and clarity.

Your question is odd in the sense that I cant tell who your talking about; the hateful, bitter, amazingly prejudiced and openly bigoted right wingers who cant stand people of color or democrats? Or the people who voted for Barack without even knowing why, just because he was eloquent and able to stir emotions? Good question. But I think that decision making skills for individuals is just that- individual. You can only try so many ways to explain rational thoughts to a person. Eventually they will wisen up and learn to do it (form independent, clearly logical thoughts), or they wont.

LOL....  First step, make sure YOU aren't the "non-logical, emotional person".



Sorry, but when you use words like "immature" and "warped thinkers", you are being judgemental... not logical.  And when you come from a somewhat condecending position to think you are superior enough to change others, you are coming from an emotional thought process at best.  At worst, you're coming from a logically flawed thought process.



Second step, accept that ppl think how they think.  You may be able to persuade them to a particular point of view (salesmen do it everyday), but you cannot "change" someone who's personality and thought processes lean to a more emotional process than "logical" one.



However, if you are trying to learn how ppl think and how to persuade them effectively....  Check out this book:

Being too serious about life makes you depressed/go crazy?



i watched dangerous knowledge,its about physicists and mathematicians who tried to understand the universe and infinity.
and the interesting thing is,its not cause they were geniuses,its cause they CHOSE to see the world differently and pursue that one goal of understanding. and well in the they all became depressed and committed suicide and the other went crazy.



so ive realized people who takes life seriously and tries to understand the meaning of existence become depressed and total introverts. a drunk is happier than a sober.i mean would you like to live in a sad world without answers or a world where everything is abstract and your goal is to populate,go to parties and enjoy life? if you are happy then life is a joke to you,witch isnt a bad thing



so ive come to a conclusion that thinking too much or too seriously is bad for your mental health,go out and get drunk!or am i wrong here?

Why is everything in my life getting worse?



Well,



I know everyone says things can always be worse. And i know that.But just lately, everything just keeps getting worse and worse. Not one good thing has came out of all this. I have lost all my close  friends, recently i got a bf... but he is very depressing but i really like him and care for him.But he also is known for cheating. I feel like he is different then what everyone else says. And i have to be out of my house in 30 days, and my grades are slipping very quick. And lately i cant keep my mind where it needs to be, b.c of all the stress. I really need help!

It is inevitable that in certain parts of your life that you will be facing problems and having trouble. But there is a very important thing that you must know. How you react to the problems will show you what kinds of results that you will get.



What goes in your mind when you are facing problem? Is the trouble that I am facing a permanent problems or it will go away with times? The best question that you can actually ask yourself is: “So what if I have this trouble, I will be able to find ways to solve it.” This is a simple method that works whenever I face problems.



Instead of getting worried over the problems, I will start to ask question and tell myself so what if I have this problem. When you start to use this simple method, you will realize that you have stop wasting time getting worried over the problem. You will instead be using the time to look for solutions to solve that problem. When you are able to solve it, you will start to adopt a positive attitude. You will soon realize that you are able to overcome all obstacles in life.



A problem is never permanent. If you are willing to have a positive attitude and never give up, you will soon realize that problems will seem to go away and you seem to have a much smoother journey in your life. So start to ask yourself this effective question and you will be able to overcome all your future obstacles.

Ok, Im no medical expert, but, let me tell you what helped me when I was going through something that sounds similar.  I reached a point in my life about 8 years ago (I was 19), where I felt that I could not deal with any of my issues, mainly because I had so many and I didnt know where to start.  I was depressed, big time, and had no idea how to make it better.  I couldnt make my life better until I FELT good enough to actually do something about it...BUT, I couldnt do anything because I just felt like a complete failure.  So, without giving too many details, I ended up hospitalized and talked to a great therapist during my recovery.  With a little "mental health" guidance and a prescription for antidepressants, I was able to take my life one step at a time and deal with my issues.  I was able to wean myself off the medication about a year later and have felt great ever since.  Hope this can give you some direction.  Good luck!

The reason is difficult to explain because it is partly due to ones genes and partly due to ones background and up-bringing. As people mature their view on life changes and as in your case, it goes through a difficult stage. Don't worry about the cause but do try to help yourself to improve.



It appears that your situation is getting to be critical. Don't start on drugs as a solution. Instead. go and discuss this problem with a psychiatrist or social worker/youth counciler. Parents are not much help and you may need to reduce stress by taking suitable medicine as well as doing yoga exercises etc. In emergencies try calling a "hot line" for stressed out youth.

Okay, PandaBear....  This is not as complicated as you may think.



First of all, you have accepted a flawed premise.  That being that "everything in your life" is "getting worse".  That thought alone can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because you believe it to be so.



Second, I'm going to go with an assumption (a dangerous practice, but my intuition is leading me that way).  The introduction of the bf happened just before you started "losing close friends".  Either that or you latched onto him after you started losing friends.  But your statement that you "feel he is different than what everyone else says" leads me to think it's the former.



Could it be that YOU have begun to change how you treated your friends because of the bf?  I hate to be one who dumps water on the fire of passion, but sometimes we choose relationships that are more harmful than healthy to us.  And in doing so, we can do harm to all facets of our lives.



You may want to take a good hard look at how much the boyfriend is benefitting your life.  Because if you stated exactly the same question and description in your question as you did, but instead of "boyfriend" you said "recently I started drinking" or "recently I started taking drugs" or "recently I started gambling"....  Then, I'd say you have an addiction that is harming your life and suggest you get help.



Could the bf be a harmful addiction that you need help with?



Just a thought.  Be well and good luck.

This question is very open to different kinds of answers because of the lack of more information.



If your shyness is due to lack of confidence, then the answer is to make a serious effort to get about more and to mix socially in groups and societies that are not of real interest to you, but can provide you with the need to converse and join in.

That depends. Do you want to ? It sounds like you feel that you have an "affliction" of some sort - shyness is not necessarily a bad thing perse unless it is preventing you from furthering an ambition or is because of a fear of rejection.  As you develop your skills over time, confidence will come and you will grow in strength and be able to communicate what you feel. I was very very shy as a kid and life experiences brought me out of that shell - but don't rush it ! Write down a list of 5 things that shyness is preventing you from doing and then map out a plan for each of those.

What would you do in this situation?



This question is meant for the mental health section:



If you were a teacher. And there was a freshman girl that you were sure that she would pass out and die any second. She struggled with anorexia. She had to have an escort back to class after lunch. She took every chance she could get to purge.
She looked so emaciated that you wanted to be careful with her. So you let her sleep in the back of the classroom bc she was so weak and tired.
So you see this girl staring death in the face



Then this girl eventually goes in to treatment. And when you saw her-after a year of residential treatment. You saw her when she visited. And she looked healthy



How would you feel? Would you get choked up? Bc this student and you (the teacher) were pretty close.



Tell me what your reaction would be

The act of allowing her to rest or to sleep in class is justified in the circumstances that you describe. In any case, even it it were not, I would be happy to see that she is now on the way to a full recovery. Chocked up emotion is not difficult to explain in these circumstances, it depends on the individual, but I would be a bit cooler and simply share my pleasure at her improved health.

If I were you and felt that much compassion for someone and had a fairly close relationship with them I would be choked up.



I mean, you are talking to a person who gets choked up watching a movie I can relate with. My husband thinks it's funny. :-))



If I had a close relationship with her and had something to discuss that would break the ice after not being in contact for a year or more, I would go visit. Keep in mind her mental state (not saying she is crazy, just saying be careful) and make sure you do not lead her to believe your visit is anything more than a simple visit to check on a friend. :-))



The fact that she is healthy now is awesome and I hope she continues to STAY healthy! :-))

How can I help my child, with Asperger's, deal with bullies?



My daughter is 11 years old.  She has AS. (Asperger's Syndrome) She is bullied daily.  I don't know what to tell her.  I had the answer for why I think bullies bully people. (Control issues)  What I don't have the answer for is, "What do I do?", "How do I handle it?".  She says that she trys to avoid them, but they seek her out.  I believe her, because they did that with me, too, when I was in school.  Does anyone have any advice?



(I also have Asperger's, so there is a lot I cannot help her with in this situation... I can help her figure out the whys, but not the hows...  I feel really horrible.)

Bullying is a terrible plague in our school system.  Get the staff involved.  It's never a popular solution, but if things get out of hand, she'll at least have responsible adults to turn to at school.



Running and hiding is never a good answer, but sometimes confrontation can escalate things.  Seems to me that you survived, facing similar difficulties, and maybe this is just her time to stand on her own and find her own way to deal with this.

The world is so mean sometimes...why don't you talk to the teachers about it? They need to know this kind of stuff and someone at the school needs to step in and take control of this problem. Is she on any medication to help with this? Not always the best solution in some cases but it may help? I'm so sorry, I fear everyday that my kids will be bullied when I have children. (I was too)



Good luck,

Does she have a counsellor that works with her? I am asking because we have programs in our community for DD children and they often have information done by researchers and behavioral psychologists that is tailored specifically for these types of scenarios. Ask other parents in your community. Great start for a support group!

I need help changing myself (if that's at all possible)?



I'm a very introvert person and I'm sick of always analyzing myself. It's hard for me to relax in public because I'm constantly wondering what others are thinking about me. I can't socialize very well, even with my best friend. There probably is no way to fix this but it can't hurt to ask...

I've been the same way. I have found it is possible to change. Try to make a list or find positive things about you, and try to put less power to the negative. Try to take the negative things you think about yourself and find a reasonable solution to take little steps at a time to change them instead of looking at them as something that can't be dealt with.



I also found if I quit analyzing everything, or most things, my stress level has gone down and I'm more relax and able to do things like you have described such as socialize. I have found that constantly analyzing myself is not always the most healthy thing even though it is useful in life.



My advice is to try and relax, try to just let things go and slowly but surely quit analyzing a little bit at a time. Just be yourself and give it your all without worrying about what other people think. When you feel confident about yourself because of who you see in the mirror not what other people see, then you will be more confident and have a much better chance of changing. Although what others think of you, the altimit choice is yours.

Well, people who over-analyze are usually over critical of themselves, too. You should just step back, look yourself in the mirror, and say, okay, this is what I don't like about myself and what I want to change. However, you should also list out things you *do* like about yourself. You won't be able to change over night, believe me, but over a period of time, you can change things about yourself you are uncomfortable with. But most of all, you should learn that you are who you want to me, this is your decision, and if you want to change, it's all you.

I think that you have a very good reason for not getting on with the improvements that you want to make to your life. We are complex minds and there are two sides to everything, the second of which we may not even admit to ourselves. Self-discipline requires complete self-understanding so in practice the level to which we are in control is somewhat vague, and not quite as straight as your words imply.

Lack of self-confidence is the state you describe, which leads to stress and anxiety. It can be due to a number of reasons and it may become so bad that you need help. To get help on this not very new symptom please see a psychiatrist or possibly get some advise about this from social councilers. There are stress reducing medicines but they are not for use without a prescription.



Self confidence will return when you are willing to mix more in society and eventually talk to people about yourself and about the rest of the community. This requires self-dicipline, applicable only after the stress has been reduced.

Hypnosis is the process whereby a person who is semi-conscious is able to accept instructions from somebody else who is more awake. These instructions are likely to make an impression on the mind of the semi-sleeper so that he feels compelled to act on them in the specified circumstances and in the specified way.



You cannot be hypnotised to do something that in full awareness you would find to be harmful to yourself. Nor is it likely that any goal can be achieved, because many of them are impossible to reach in every case. People simply do not respond to hypnotic instructions to murder, for example.

Do not listen to Magnun....  Hypnosis is not anything like what he described.



Hypnosis is a state in which and a process by which a suggestion is accepted by the subconscious which can influence our thinking and behavior.  However, it is a completely voluntary acceptance by the subject.  You cannot be "hypnotized" into a trance without your consent.  You cannot be "dominated" into doing something against your character.



My new favorite book on the subject is entitled, "Monsters and Magical Sticks:  Or, There's No Such Thing As Hypnosis?" by Steven Heller.  Check it out if you're really interested in the topic.

It was surprisingly good.  Not for any reasons i can fathom but the whole day just felt good to me.  Some good things happened but i didn't think they'd make today as good as it felt (no i am not on drugs).  Let's walk through my day:
Got up
Went to school
had a couple classes
had lunch with some good friends
another class
come home
go to work
work
come home again
homework
now



and thats it
no the good things arent listed, some of them are kinda personal and i dont want people i dont know reading anymore about my day than i already said
it just, was a good day

Being too serious about life makes you depressed/go crazy?



i watched dangerous knowledge,its about physicists and mathematicians who tried to understand the universe and infinity.
and the interesting thing is,its not cause they were geniuses,its cause they CHOSE to see the world differently and pursue that one goal of understanding. and well in the they all became depressed and committed suicide and the other went crazy.



so ive realized people who takes life seriously and tries to understand the meaning of existence become depressed and total introverts. a drunk is happier than a sober.i mean would you like to live in a sad world without answers or a world where everything is abstract and your goal is to populate,go to parties and enjoy life? if you are happy then life is a joke to you,witch isnt a bad thing



so ive come to a conclusion that thinking too much or too seriously is bad for your mental health,go out and get drunk!or am i wrong here?

I really need help, seriously, please.?



i've been dating this guy for about a year, and everything is usually perfect. we are deeply in love, we do cute little things, and always know how to make each other smile. we want to spend our lives together. oh, we live together, if that is needed to help you all help me.



anyways, i need some help with a few things. i'm constantly asking him questions about what he is doing all the time and just any little thing i can think of. it really needs to stop, because he gets really upset with me. i know a lot of the things i ask are really ridiculous, and he thinks it's because of my insecurity. i am insecure. i do have low self-esteem. i am self-conscious. i am also very controlling and possesive. i seem to get jealous whenever he is hanging out with someone, whether it be one of his three closest guy friends, or even his mom sometimes. i was at work last week, and he called and was hanging out with his friend he has known longer than me, and i don't know why but i was kind of 'mad?' i also get upset if he's not texting me constantly or calling a lot while we're away from each other. and it's like i'd rather just stay at home with him all weekend, than associate with other people.



this is hard, i am realizing i have a problem, and i really really need to fix it.

You're obsessed with him & you need to break that habbit before it breaks you guys up. Lilttle by little hes going to move further & further away from you until it's too late. Try going out, find a hobby .. Do you have  a job? .. Friends? You shouldn't depend on him so much because it's not healthy for you or him.

It might be easier if you start out by planning things you guys do separately, but at the same time. Even if you think you'd rather be with him 24/7, you'll have fun doing something else and it will give you something to talk about.

You're afraid that you will loose him. You know he is a good guy and why is he with you ,But he is and he chose you. If you think he loves you , cool it before you wreck the relation ship. Maybe spend time with him and one of his friends. Get into his life, not try to remove him from his. You may need his family and friends one day if this is serious. Get to know his mom.  Don't be selfish. Don't be childish and say he's all mine. Good luck !

Here's the secret....  Are you ready?



Stop being greedy.



Greed for security, for control, will cause you to lose that which you desire.  His love.



See him as a blessing that has come into your life and be thankful for the gift of his love and friendship.  Stop looking at him as a possession that you must constantly hold onto so you don't lose it or a pet that you must train to behave in a manner that suits you.



When you can embrace this point of view, you will find greater satisfaction and less worry in the relationship.



Be well.

Instead of trying to control him, control yourself.  Ask yourself the same questions.



You're reading a book, you're at a critical point in the story, would you want to stop and explain to him what you're doing.
You're having a true personal private girl heart to heart with one of YOUR friends, you're on the edge of a breakthrough,  do you want to stop and explain just because he wants to know.



You are two different people with two different lives.  As live your life and he lives his, SHARE your lives with one another to the extent that you may choose.  He doesn't owe you an detailed explination of the events in his life and you don't owe him one.

The basis of memory is chemical change associated with electronic movement and charge. To burn in a memory is far too strong an expression for it. A well established memory is one that has been removed from the mind-store, reviewed and then put back intact in the store again. This process is in no way a burn-in.

Sleeping all the time! And everyones hating me for it! help?



Basically I go to bed same time as my boyfriend, so probably about 12-2am
but then i sleep through alarms in the morning and his phone calls and the earliest i usually wake up would be about 3pm and the latest... well sometimes he's come in from work in the evening and had to wake me up!
and he gets really annoyed, he just thinks im being lazy and i know what it looks like i just can't help it.
and then when im awake im so drowsy and i can't concentrate that well and my vision gets blurry sometimes it's like im constantly about to fall asleep . and headaches. i get headaches a lot. and i have like NO energy so i ask him like 'could you feed the rabbit' and stuff and it just helps him feel im just being lazy if you get me? so i make an effort to try and do stuff and it makes me feel even more tired.
i dont know maybe im not explaining myself properly
but i just want it to stop because this has happened before and it lasts a few months and then i can go like a year or so sleeping normally and then this will happen again
and this time it's worse than ever, and that maybe because i'm living with someone who has to put up with it. or maybe its because im pregnant. I dunno i just know its worse and i need to do something about it, but what the hell do i do? Other than 'go GP' because my doctor hasn't really helped when i asked about it before

It is prob due to your pregancy. If your doc has done tests and not found anything I shouldn't worry too much. Try going to bed earlier and when you get up make sure you keep yourself busy. If you do nothing you'll feel tired

you need to get to bed earlier.  try each night to go to bed 30 mins earlier each night, don't just wait on your boyfriend to go to bed.  You said your pregnant, you may need to take a nap during the day. Ideally you should be going to bed at 10pm, getting up around 8am and taking a nap for about an hour when you can.  You body is all over the place from bad sleep patterns.  Try tonight to go to be earlier and set yourself the goal to improve each day.

well, you know it is not normal so i would go to the doctor again and make him listen, explain to him how it is and i hope he doesn't just blow you off again. you need to have blood tests done and find out what is wrong. nobody needs that much sleep,and the fact that you are still sleepy and tired when you get up says something isn't right. just go to the doctor and see what they can do for you, good luck, hopefully you can get something to help you.

I think you need to go to bed at 9pm.  I think you need to get everything to wear ready the night before.  He needs to get you up and out of bed the same time as himself.  You need some structure to your day and things to do and NOT alone.  I do not think you are being lazy and I believe you just can't help it.  It is a cycle, but you need help to get out of it.  You need to eat really really healthily and get out in the fresh air, that saying you need warm clothes and good comfortable socks and shoes.  I recon a dog will get you out of this cycle.  Being pregnant will make you tired.  You can always ask for a second opinion and ask for tests on diabetes and anaemia. As for the emotions you are obviously having to battle, you will get better honestly, but not if you give in too easily.  It is still your life.
Bless you.

I've done that too..... personally I just stick a toothbrush down my throat. I know it's hard to make yourself vomit that way at first, but the more you do it, the easier it will become. I used to purge, but found it much easier just to not eat. More satisfying, too. But to each their own. There, now go ahead and thumbs-down me. :p

It depends what part of your daily life they are in.  If they are at work, change hours or departments.  take their number out of your phone.  Date someone else.  If they are in ur classes, take different classes next time.  The best thing i've alway done when i'm addicted to someone or somthing is to stop.. then fill the time u would spend doing it with somthin else.  Get your independence back. if you still want them in your life, make plans with them once a week, or every other thursday, or somthing like that.

A strange girl who was in my class at college. She was completely ruthless and self-centred and very, very cold. She did not seem to have any empathy for anyone. She was racist and homophobic, but she would also bully people for no reason. I once saw her just go up to this random girl in the corridor and she put her hands around her neck and started squeezing. What was disturbing was that she had this horrible smile on her face whilst she was doing it. She would do odd things like that all the time, she really seemed to enjoy seeing people suffer. People were really frightened of her.



The annoying that was she was very beautiful, blonde and had the perfect figure. She was never without a boyfriend which just goes to show that you can be a complete psycho, but as long as you are hot men will still ask you out!

What do these dreams mean?



Ok so my ex and i broke up like a month ago, and i have basically gotten over it. I dont think about her much at all and when i do its usually random and lasts a very short amount of time. The wierd thing is a dream about her almost every night. And the dreams are really random, sometimes will talk about getting back together, sometimes were still together, and like last nights sometimes we get in huge fights in which i will feel good about myself at the end. It is very frustrating waking up every morning with her on my mind, especially because i feel i have moved on and want to move on. Do these dreams mean anything, and if possible is there anyway to stop myself from having them?

<answer>



Sorry to say this but you can't stop your dreams. They are what they are. Dream interpretation is not a science. You dream about your Ex because you have a history together. Your subconscious is bringing up good and bad feelings about the relationship. This is perfectly normal. Perhaps you've been dwelling on the breakup or maybe you're a bit obsessed with your Ex. Even though you say you're over your Ex, you may still harbor some feelings over the breakup. Perhaps you are still in love with your Ex. Perhaps you're angry at your Ex because of the break-up. Perhaps you're not sure how you feel about your Ex so you ponder about it quite often. It's hard to say why we dream. Sigmund Freud believed that our dreams are showing us in our subconscious world what we don't confront in our conscious world. Take a good look within yourself and be honest about your feelings.

Ideas on differences between Pessimism vs. Realism?

I'm never really happy anymore..why?



I just got out of a 2 year relationship a couple of months ago..but i feel kind of relieved to be out of it. plus, the single life ain't so bad. i've started making friends and socializing more for the past 2 months. i wont lie its kinda fun to be able to have all this time on my hands. but i feel like i'm still never happy. i don't know how i couldn't be. i'm making friends, partying just enough, and doing decent in school. its not that i don;t ever laugh..or never have fun but for some reason, i never feel sincerely happy. i always feel drained and ive started feeling so paranoid and i just keep criticizing everything i do and i cant help it. this feeling has been going on for maybe a couple of years. ill get past it but this always comes back. and it stays for about 6 or 7 months..then itll go away because i stop thinking about it. but i don;t know if its normal or not. i'm not necessarily sad, but i'm just never truly happy anymore. i don't know it feels like to feel genuinely content with myself. is this normal?..

What does my dream mean?



I was flying in a small airplane sitting on the left side.  My ex husband (Scott) who looks a lot like my current boyfriend was piloting the plane and sitting on the right side.  There was no cover on the cockpit.  Other planes were coming past us very close which was scary but in a fun way.  I was sitting uncomfortably with my legs hanging over the side but then sat back in the seat and felt more secure.  I noticed Scott sitting on the edge and then things not looking right and it became obvious we were going down.  We ended up landing softly in grass without getting hurt and I woke up.

To see an airplane in your dream, indicates that you will overcome your obstacles and rise above to a new level of prominence and status. You may experience a higher consciousness, new-found freedom and greater awareness.



Your dream falls under the category of "flying dreams", in which however you are not flying under your own power. Such dreams are associated with a major change in your life, a rise in status or a transitional phase.

I feel low self esteem was drilled into my head by my parents, I was never good enough.  I overcame it with the help of a fantastic physocologist because when you are in that deep, your friends can't get you out.  ONLY with this Doctor's help have I finally been able to say, "I will never be good enough in my parents eyes, no matter how successful I am in my life.  I know I am good in all that I do."  Sounds simple, but it took me many years to get here...I hope your journey is much faster.

You should never compare yourself to others.  No matter how good you think somebody else has it, you are probably wrong.  The pretty of good looking people are usually so obsessed with their looks and are never happy with themselves.  People who have lots of money can never have enough.  The only way to true happiness and feeling good about yourself is being content with yourself just the way you are.  It is so wonderful to not care what anybody else thinks.  I'm sure there are some really good qualities about you, focus on them.

You've answered part of the question.  You try to compare yourself to others and you aren't "others".  You are a unique individual and you are not inferior and you have to start telling yourself that.  There are excellent books on self-esteem and perhaps you should read them.



Something or someone has made you feel this way and now it's up to you to change your thinking.  No one can do it for you.  You can do it.



You are NOT inferior.

first start off by staying away from those situations.. if you feel inferior when you look at your really interesting/good looking classmates myspace, then stop looking...



if you feel like you need to accomplish more then get out there and work! make money, help people, volunteer, help take care of our earth, visit family members!  get busy!



if you had more things to do, then you wouldn't have any time left to feel inferior.. thats how it worked for me...

You don't have to feel alone with this problem it is shared by many. I think it starts when we are small and we don't have the success we see others having at, for instance, baseball or subjects in school. We might have something that we don't like about our looks. My ears are too big or I hate having freckles. We all know how cruel kids can be to each other. When we are wounded psychologically  it takes time to heal. We may not get the positive support that we need from our family or teachers. We start to believe the negative things that we or others are  imprinting on our mind. Sometimes we carry the feelings of inferiority into our adult years. Some people never get over them. The best thing to do is to find someone you trust and talk these feelings out. Usually by doing this we can get to the root of the problem see how unreasonable we are being to ourselves and move on with our lives. We need to realize that no one is perfect. We all have strengths and weaknesses. Try to focus on your strengths. Forgive others for the wrongs they did to you. Forgive yourself.
Enjoy your life!

good question i think i laugh at things because they are creative ideas but some people laugh for other reasons i think everyone laughs at different things because if you notice some people laugh harder at certain things and other dont laugh as hard but on a different joke it will be switch you should keep your eyes open for stuff like this lol see what you think is funny. sorry for not putting any punctuation in my being lazy right now and i hope i made sence because i have asperger disorder and it makes it hard to socialize lol so i dont get much practice good luck and its a very good question

You define what is funny and sometimes you get persuaded into thinking what is funny and what is not. It all depends on your personality!!! There might be a funny side to everything and there might not.

Sometimes we laugh because it is funny, but most times we laugh because we are enjoying ourselves. That feeling of well being just wells up inside a person and they let it go, like we're trying to share the happiness with a laugh. Laughs are infectious after all.

We define what is funny by what we hear and listen to and by what we see. Some things can be funny to one person and other things are not funny. Everyone has an individual sense of humour, yes? For example, my 5 year-old son has a toilet sense of humour at the moment and thinks that farting in his class is really funny. He even has burping contests with his class-mates!
On the other hand, my 16-year old can´t see the funny side of anything except when he´s with his mates. Mum just can´t understand him! So he says!



And me? Yeah, sometimes I laugh. But it takes a lot to make me laugh these days.

Most laughter is not about something being funny.  Laughter is something we humans do as part of bonding with other people, (relatives, friends, etc.)  It's a way of communicating.  For example, when you ask a friend how he did on a test and he responds with a laugh, or you ask someone you know how they've been and they laugh - that's not a joke.  We tend to use it as a form of verbal puncuation.



Curious thing is, apes do it too, except their "laughter" is a type of panting.  They have the same laugh reaction when playing and interacting with each other as we humans do. Other animals have their own sounds of laughter too, and for the same reason.



Another reason we laugh is because we hear other people laugh.  Laughing is contagious and involves multiple parts of our body.



We do most of our laughing when we are around other people vs by ourselves.  And laughter is definately triggered by our brain.  Genuine, hardy har-har, and ha-ha-ha-feel it in the gut laughter is not something you can force or control.  You can try to stop laughing, but you cannot control when genuine laughter starts.



And - you do laugh when your brain reacts to something as being funny.  What is funny to some isn't funny to all.

How can i get over the Wimbledon final this year?



ive been devastated by it ever since it happened. sometimes i cant sleep because of it. i had so much emotionally invested in Federer breaking the record for consecutive titles. ever since 2005 when he got his 3rd straight i was thinking about 6 in a row. the worst part is that he was so maddeningly close to it. he pushed it to a 5th set and had a break point to go to 5-3. then at 7-7 he was broken by a bad line call. which he didn't challenge.  it could have been the quintessential fairytale comeback. but stopped heart breakingly close. and now even when i try to be optimistic and think about him getting revenge next year, im going to think how this could have been his 7th straight if he'd just played 1 point differently i 2008. i know it's really unhealthy and i want to get over it, its been months, what's wrong with me?

Imagine yourself sitting in a chair, in an imaginary plastic bubble, place a stick of dynomite in your hand and push it thru the plastic bubble.  Invision the match and stuff it into the stick of dynomite, light the stick throw it into the air and watch it explode.  Sounds crazy but to rid yourself of a thought that won't go away...you have to blow it up!



Good luck!

You could try purchasing a similar video game if you are into gaming. You might be able to role play and achieve that record you are interested in. It is common for many sports enthusiasts to think about their favorite stars, but at least there isn't any true tragedy in losing the tournament as far as biological well-being goes. If you are feeling unwell on a consistent basis due to the results of the tournament then you might want to talk to your physician about solutions.

It does seem extreme a little, but why do you fear bumping into someone you might know? Did you have a bad experience once when you did and that is maybe making you fear having that happen again? It can affect your school attendance and work, so I'd talk to a guidance counselor for starters or a school psychologist to resolve this if able.

Depends on the source for one. If you source is the internet, judging its validity may be difficult. If your source is a book or print of some sort, there are laws and references. If your source is human there are several paths to take, references, history, education, etc. etc.

Shy and escaping boredom?



One of your friends is very shy and quiet young woman in her late 20's.  She usually keeps to herself but is a diligent and hard worker.  You don't know much about her though.  You were at a boring meeting and you glanced over and saw her doodling.  Then she started to play games like tick-tack-toe and hangman.  She then started to draw dots and apparently it became a game where you had to make boxes.  Only one other person around you decided to play along with her.



What would you think about this shy woman's methods of escaping boredom?  What would you conclude about her?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Very interesting question. This is one that will make you think ...



My point of view ... because this is a psychology question and I am against psychology in all means as one can not understand the human mind as if we could, Im sure some mad scientist would find a way to control us all. Thank God for that. Although psychology does have some pinpointers to the simple minds ;)



My views of this lady would be ...



1) She is a free spirit. Likes to express herself in certain ways such to keep her mind occupied. Its more of a ways to nurture herself.
2) She may not take her job seriously. This is the obvious but if she was hired in the first place then she had to have some resume to convince the employer. So you can not discredit her.
3) she likes playing hang man and competes in tournaments world wide so she is spending this time at work to train herself =)



... personally I think she is introvert. Opposed to communicating with the rest of the group she prefers keeping herself solitude. This is not a bad thing by all means. Communication, learning and understanding the present material at work is required by the job but if she feels happy doing what she is doing then let her be. As long as she can complete the work assignment then that is all that is needed to be understood. If this work assignment is NOT completed to a certain standard THEN she can be discredited by her workplace as to paying more attention to herself rather than the work she was employed to do.



... the point is do not pre judge an individual. Let her be. If she does not complete her work assignments then you have proof to judge her behavior. This proof in return however, can have a logical excuse. Which is why you shouldnt pre judge.



... it would be best to focus on yourself and your work at hand rather than somebody else, as they will be judged by the employer who will have a better understanding. Basically, dont matter much about them unless its a real problem, like disturbing your own work HABITS, etc.

Has to be active, seeks the external, could just be a one time thing though. Perhaps she was tired that day and needed to keep herself moving/doing in order to be good at work that day. In any case, I'd still assume she wanted to be more active than she was, coz she is moving, stuff is going on around her, she is not part of it, so she creates her own stuff.

<answer>



According to Freud, we are born with our Id.  The id is an important part of our personality because as newborns, it allows us to get our basic needs met.  Freud believed that the id is based on our pleasure principle.  In other words, the id wants whatever feels good at the time, with no consideration for the reality of the situation.  When a child is hungry, the id wants food, and therefore the child cries.  When the child needs to be changed, the id cries.  When the child is uncomfortable, in pain, too hot, too cold, or just wants attention, the id speaks up until his or her needs are met.



The id doesn't care about reality, about the needs of anyone else, only its own satisfaction.



Within the next three years, as the child interacts more and more with the world, the second part of the personality begins to develop.  Freud called this part the Ego.  The ego is based on the reality principle.  The ego understands that other people have needs and desires and that sometimes being impulsive or selfish can hurt us in the long run.  Its the ego's job to meet the needs of the id, while taking into consideration the reality of the situation.



By the age of five, or the end of the phallic stage of development, the Superego develops.  The Superego is the moral part of us and develops due to the moral and ethical restraints placed on us by our caregivers.  Many equate the superego with the conscience as it dictates our belief of right and wrong.

Am I gifted or that!!! Or a little bit!!!?



I've been wondering that I can personally recall my childhood days but some of it were just episodes or like that!! If I was not misinformed or something... I can see myself standing as I recall my past.. I see myself that I was doing something like that.. Another case or impression that I see is that I just see it with my own two eyes!! I can remember a certain picture of my life which is not eventful to me.. only a yellow wall with stairs and I met a kid who I knew years later would be my cousin.. I think I was three years old at that time since the next year I remembered that I asked his age that he was 3 and he asked me too, I was four.. we were one year gapped!! There are really things I remembered when I was a kid starting at 3 but not clearly and until the rest of those childhood days!!



What do you think of me, coz my teacher said. if one child can recall a n event in the past, he/she is a gifted one... Am I one of those??? I also vary in different interests... I've been planning to take all courses that interests me!! But I know its impossible!! Sometimes I would like to daydream and addicted to scrabble and a little bit of chess!! A silent type of person who wants to be on his own!!!

Is it possible to soul connect with someone you have never physically met?



Say you really like someone and you think about them all the time, and this has been going on for years do you think it is possible that other person can pick up on that energy? Even if you have never met each other and you live opposite sides of the world do you think it's possible you have made some soul connection on a higher plane?
If not, why not? Is anything really impossible?

I live in America and for a year I was in a relationship with a young man from South Africa. We had been introduced by a friend and fell for each other within days. in many ways, I still consider him my soul mate. Of course it's possible - as long as you don't base your relationship around physical things and center it around conversation, beliefs, ect. Sure, I would have certainly liked to hug and kiss him. And to look into his eyes would have been worth years of my life. But I would never want to give up all of our deep conversations or packages in the mail. It's very, very possible, if you're the right two people.

I think each of us has a "template" if you will, that reveals to us who we want as a partner. Most of these templates evolve over time, but the core feeling and identity of these "souls" are best pursued in our dreams and other unconscious states. I believe these people exist, but it is tenacity that leads us to them, and them to us, but it is will that keeps them together should they actually meet.

hahaha i know what you are talking about , i think that if you have develop a crush on someone and they dont know yet but you keep on thinking and wanting to be with him , if he is awaken and by that i mean that hes aware of the energetically changes around him , then he may experience some symptoms as well such as dreaming with you or having an unwanted random thought about you...



why? because you guys would be sharing the same wavelength of energy which could make synchronizations happen , like for example you could find himat a coffee shop , or the laundry place but many times it is just becuase you have focused so much on this thought that you are making it happen, but that doesnt necessarily means  he/she is the one , just think of it like magick

No distance is to far away for the heart to travel.  Know yourselff first.  Ask yourself can a person really have a soul connection with someone they never met.  All the feelings of the heart are not soul connections because some are just emotions.  Take the time to know and love yourself.

I think I majored in the wrong thing for my life goals, and it's too late to change now. What are my options?



I'm a college student majoring in Fisheries and Wildlife Science, and even though the subject matter is perfect for me, the potential job locations aren't. I have this feeling I can't ignore, that I want to move to Minneapolis, MN after college. I love that city, always have, and I don't feel like my life is complete living anywhere else, not to sound cheesy, but honestly. Have I completely effed up my chances? I'm far too late along in my college career to change now. Please tell me there's something in a metro area for a major like mine... could I be an agriculture teacher, work in the DNR office there, anything? Please give me some ideas, or tell me if I've completely blown my dreams. Thanks.



P.S. Would going back to school (grad school) in a different area be possible? I was thinking of going to get a M.S. in geography to work in scientific mapmaking... or would I also need the undergraduate in geo.

Why is it that some people don't pick up on nonverbals, and even verbal cues, that you don't want to talk?



Sometimes there are diagnoses such as Asperger's which might prevent someone from not recognizing appropriate communication boundaries. However, I'm talking about people who supposedly have no limitations. They either don't know, or choose not to acknowledge, when a conversation is over or that one never started in the first place.



When you turn away from them to show that you don't have time or that your aren't interested in talking, they still keep having a one-sided conversation. When you actually ask them to please stop talking, they STILL keep talking.



It's that a personality disorder of some type? Narcissism? Deep insecurity that drives them to keep talking?



If someone tells me that they don't want to talk, I stop talking to them. I wonder why so many people don't understand that.

My son says he never knows what he is goign to say till it pops out of his mouth -



I find that refreshing.and liberating. It such an effort trying to box off part of yourself.  i'd rather have a friend who is a geek who is real than someone popular who is not - It is so confusing. YOu never know who they are.

Everyone can fall in love, but getting married is one thing. You need to think it through. Marriage is a great thing and its more than just signing a piece of paper. You make a Vow between you, your husband and God. Ask yourself this question, are you willing to be faithful, love, respect, honor and willing to live with your Husband forever?

No!  Marriage is what you make it.  Loving one another is just part of it.  Commitment, money, sex and emotions all play an great part in marriage.  Be sure this is the person you want to spend a life time with and they feel the same.  Know yourself and partner first.

To just have the lonely feeling is a sign of depression.  Do things to make you feel happy.  Go to the movies, eat a cookie or what ever you enjoy.  Laugh, dance, sing, be around positive people and things.  Be you and do you.

I cry when things get confrontational, please help?



Hi there,
Please take this question seriously, as I need help. Every time something gets confrontational, I cry. Its becoming a real problem, and I'd like to know ways to stop. I've tried thinking about other things to calm myself down, but when I'm talking to someone about anything confrontational, I start to cry. I even know that it's stupid when I cry, but I can't stop. Does anyone know of something I could do?



Thank you,

Try this: when someone says something that offends or upsets you and you feel yourself beginning to cry, instead put your hands over your ears and shut your eyes and focus on breathing deeply until you feel the moment pass.

Crying is a beautiful thing. The reason why you cry is because of your emotions. You get overwhelm with emotions and that makes you cry. I do the same thing too and its okay, not unless you cry at the most tiniest thing. I cry when I'm sad, mad/angry or even happy.

First off, it is completely natural!  Don't ignore your emotions because they are what guide us and tell us how we feel.  I cry when something gets really confrontational and I feel threatened or angry.



Now, in order to help:  You have to focus on prevailing when you are in a situation like this.  Focus on what you want and don't let anybody step all over you.  You probably are simply getting frustrated with whatever the other person is saying.  Just stay strong and do your best to be yourself!



Also, if you're at an age when your hormones are all out of whack, this could be to blame.  Hormones have a huge effect on our emotions.  So, if this is the case, it will all pass.

Could she be one of them too?



My mother died when i was 9 and since then i have felt ignore and abandoned by my relatives and my dad. My relatives would blame my father for my mother;s death (which is totally not true). This hurt me and i stopped maintaining contacts with those people as they would say nasty stuff to me also.



I know they don't like me, but i didn't do nothing wrong. They are most probably jealous of me because even though i have a dysfunctional family, i have always been very bright in studies as compared to my cousins, they probably hate me cause we are much better off than them in financial terms and i have a nice big house.



One of this cousins of mine, who claims to be my 'well wisher' always calls me and tells me what all bad things these godmothersabout me during there get togethers. Stuff like 'omg how did she even manage to get admission there' , 'she thinks she is a queen and wears all that gold', ''how can she wear those clothes she looks like a sluy;' and much worse things. All these things are baseless but come out of their crappy mouths.Not having a mother or someone i could confide in doesnt help either, to say the leasy IT HURTS a lot. I have never had someone to love me and comments like these make me feel like i am worthless and that is what i felt all through my childhood.



Sometimes i wonder, why would this 'well wisher cousin' of mine need to even tell me such hurtful things, when everyone on this earth knows those talk are baseless and out of jealousy. I wonder 'Is she one of them too?'



What do you guys think? should i be ignoring this girl?

I think I majored in the wrong thing for my life goals, and it's too late to change now. What are my options?



I'm a college student majoring in Fisheries and Wildlife Science, and even though the subject matter is perfect for me, the potential job locations aren't. I have this feeling I can't ignore, that I want to move to Minneapolis, MN after college. I love that city, always have, and I don't feel like my life is complete living anywhere else, not to sound cheesy, but honestly. Have I completely effed up my chances? I'm far too late along in my college career to change now. Please tell me there's something in a metro area for a major like mine... could I be an agriculture teacher, work in the DNR office there, anything? Please give me some ideas, or tell me if I've completely blown my dreams. Thanks.



P.S. Would going back to school (grad school) in a different area be possible? I was thinking of going to get a M.S. in geography to work in scientific mapmaking... or would I also need the undergraduate in geo.

I see no reason why you could not seek a masters degree in something other than your college bachelors degree. People do it all the time. The questions are whether you can find the school and program you like, whether you can get accepted, whether you can afford it...and assuming that, have enough background in the subject to start the degree. Regarding the last, you may have to take one or two undergraduate classes in the subject, which you could "short-circuit" a it by taking such classes now.



And yes, Minneapolis is a nice town. I have several relatives who live or lived there, I think the Walker Art Institute is GREAT, Minnehaha Falls is pretty, and of course the U of Minn. is a terrific school. I lived a few years (as a young child) in Thief River Falls ('way up north, and cold!), moved to a small town for a year in Wisconsin (Baron), then moved (4th grade) to another small town in North Dakota (Valley City), where I lived until I came to Boston for grad school.



So I know the cold winters (30 below!), the snow, the HOT summers, the lakes (makes relatives in Pelican Rapids, fergus Falls, etc.). And I miss it all, even after having lived in New England for 50 years.



Best wishes...I hope you get what you want ! ! ! !

I would think, in the beginning, feelings of inadequacy, self hatred, delusions of belonging to a group, desire for self destruction while pursuing fame (by taking someone with them) and whatever reward is promised. I think these are people who hate themselves first and foremost and hear their specific propaganda.  Easily led, they are sheep and cowards.  They would be pitiful individuals, if not for the destruction they cause.

Depends on the type of terrorist. They obviously don't think of themselves as bad people. And they probably think of themselves as soilders. They probably have the same mindset as any fanatic prepared to die for a cause. And from some terrorists points of view, they might feel justified (look at it from their understanding, which may well be flawed. They see our army in their country killing their people (and no, that is not the objective facts of the case, but it's what they see) and they want retribution. That's one example.) So basically, you have to look at their motivation to understand their behavoiur.



And it's important not to let bias cloud your understanding. Just because you find the act heinous or terrible, does not mean it stems from unpleasant charictoristics like cowardice. Terrorists are not cowardly. Cowardly terrorists would be much easier to deal with, in fact. This is like the myth that bullies are cowards or weak or that they hate themselves - it's a nice story, but not necessarily true.



There are various theories, as outlined in the source below:
frustration-agression model (lack of movement or satisfaction in political or social spheres causes people to act out against their perceived oppressors)
Narcissistic rage (which takes the viewpoint terrorists are mentally ill, not a viewpoint held by all. It's probably wrong to assume every extreme behavoir stems from psychological disturbance.



Source(s):



The below is a reliable source and overview, and the psychological discussion of terrorism appears to start on page 27, you can probably jump right there without bothering with the earlier bits if you wanted. It gives sources if you want to follow things up.

Dad, Bob G. Jordan molested me, now my mom is injured, what do I owe her?



when I was young I told my mom about getting physically and sexually abused by my father, but she never listened to me or did anything to keep me safe.  (Once my mom had caught him molesting me with a knife, and he lied about what was happening. It was the only way he could defend his behavior -she believed him!!!!)



As an adult I have been shunned by my family because they made me out as the scapegoat, which is painful, but OK. It is better for me to avoid them then getting all of their hate and blame heaped upon me. I don't see or talk to anyone in my family, my mom emails me a few times a year, and I inform her every time that the reason why we aren't close is because she has blamed me for "tearing the family apart" and though she demands forgiveness from me, she has never apologized or tried to give me restitution. She is still married to my dad, and pretends like everything was OK, except for me.



I never took illegal drugs and alcohol like many survivors do, and I have not gotten the help from my parents that my brothers and sisters got because I didn't go along with the abuse and accept that it was my fault. And I have turned out to be a pretty decent person as well, despite my parents and family.



Then my mom broke her leg and hip, she's in her 70's I feel so sad for her, and wrote her immediately to show her my support.  In the past, I have been sick many times and told my mom about  my intense stomach problems, she hasn't even offered to bring over soup. Although one time she did take me to the ER, and I am grateful for that.



There is a big part of me that wants to mother my mom. I think I am obligated to do something, send her a box of chocolates or something. How do I separate between my feeling of obligation, or if this is something I want to do?



I do wonder what do I owe her?



If you feel inclined to just blame me for not 'forgiving' her and my father then know that she and my father have never asked me to forgive them, in fact they dismiss that I was abused. Don't bother writing me if you want to blame the victim and tell me I need to forgive and forget.

I am not psycho-analyst.  I believe you owe her only the respect that she is your mother.  My family is estranged from the rest of my extended family and it was not our fault.  I respect my grandmother because she is my grandmother and don't really care about her since she took our home away, years ago.  I know it pales in comparison to your sad story and I'm sorry this happened to you - like it happens to so many people.



In this case, I believe you have the right to ignore her totaly if you want.  Otherwise I'd simply give her a get well card if you feel inclined and then ignore it.  If you feel you shouldn't HAVE to, then dont!  You'll end up hating that you did that.  And it seems the whole coals of fire idea in being a nice to those whom are asses to you won't work here.  Since she claims still that nothing was wrong.



Follow what you need.  Need to ignore her and move on with your life?  Do it.  If you need to let her know that you still love her dispite? Do it.  Just know you are obligated to NOTHING.

Forgiveness?
Jean Rosenfeld, LCSW



“I’m having a really hard time forgiving my father, she proclaimed in her first session.  “I know I should forgive him.  I heard it on Oprah and I read it in a magazine - forgiving is something you do for yourself.  I don’t know why I can’t forgive him!”



I’ve been hearing this more and more in my office.  Why should she forgive him when he hurt her and the harm continues in her depression, anxiety and poor relationships?  He has no empathy or understanding of how he hurt her; he feels no remorse; he’s never apologized; he’s never tried to make amends.  And, added to her pain and confusion is now the guilt that she cannot seem to find it in herself to forgive him.



I wonder, what this “forgiveness” might mean for her – perhaps an enormous act of suppression that may give her a brief respite of relief?  Or perhaps it would become twisted into self-blame, to which so many victims of abuse readily turn.



Forgiveness can be psychologically dangerous, further enshrining a passive stance that may take away the empowerment that comes with understanding that others shouldn’t take advantage of her. Forgiveness may leave the victim unprotected from the next person who may hurt her in the same way.  Too quick “forgiveness” is a defense against doing the therapeutic work.



So, this client and I begin a multi-faceted therapeutic journey.  She tells her story, starts to shed her secrets and shame, learns to have empathy for herself, undergoes a difficult period of mourning significant losses, begins to own and tolerate a vast array of feelings, and comes to understand that now is not then and that she has more choices and power.  She becomes skilled in self-soothing and reframing negative self-talk, she practices handling relationships differently – and she even begins to understand how her father’s family history could have influenced his behavior.  As therapy moves along her rage at him greatly lessens; she no longer obsesses about what happened; and she moves on in her life, focusing more on the present and future.  But she hasn’t forgiven.



Of course, true forgiveness can occur, but it comes out of an interaction between two people:  The one who harms expresses genuine remorse, sadness and guilt that s/he has caused the other pain.  S/he accepts the other’s pace and boundaries of addressing the issue. Without making excuses or blaming others s/he listens with empathy to the negative effects that s/he has caused. S/he may offer to correct the situation, make restitution, or aid in a reasonable way to ameliorate the situation.  And s/he promises to make a strong, genuine effort to behave differently in the future.  Then, perhaps, the one who is hurt may truly feel forgiveness.  In couples and family therapy we frequently help our clients engage in this process.  Programs that re-unite sex offenders with their children, 12-Step Groups, and the Restorative Justice Program that helps convicted criminals and their victims encounter each other, are examples of formalized programs that incorporate these concepts.
But what shall we call that other experience that our clients want – that sense of  relief from being exhausted and trapped by rage and obsession with the other person?  What is the word to use that expresses the feeling that comes with going through the process in which one person (without necessitating the input of the other) finds resolution and feels more freedom to positively engage in life?  Terms like “letting go” and “moving on” do not convey the depth and healing embodied in this experience. And it has little to do with “forgiveness.”

Have you ever had this problem?  Is it a mental disorder?



So, I'm 17 and I have trouble thinking, and feel like there is a coagulation of thought process in  my head.  Doing work in school and talking to people are EXTREMELY painful, somehow, to me.  It's just so hard to function.  eye contact is hard for me to be comfortable with, and it feels like the things I see aren't connected fully with my brain, like the transition is very slow, which slows my reactions.  Is this a disorder?  Have any of you ever felt this way?

<question>



Does being good looking really help you gain success? Is there research on this?



I am blonde, thin and busty naturally. Recently a friend of mine (who is always complaining she is ugly) claimed that if she looked like me she'd be a lot more successful. She is always making comments like "Oh yeah, that's easy when you look the way YOU do!" and stuff like that. It's almost like she tries to downplay everything I do and chalk it upto me being good looking!



We are about equal as far as financial status goes and the comment kind of pissed me off, honestly. It was almost as if she was implying that I don't have to work as hard or that I am not trying hard enough and 'using' my looks to my advantage! She says things like this a lot.



She is always commenting that I am 'lucky' in the looks department and seems to put a lot of emphasis on this. Truly, I have my good points genetically but A LOT of my appearance is maintanance. I work hard to go to the gym, take care of my skin, get my hair done regularly, wear cute clothes, eat healthy etc. She could look as good as me if she made the effort but she doesn't! We make the same amount of money and yet she seems to think I have some huge advantage.



I also work hard on the job. I have worked very hard to be the person I am and I really resent her suggesting that I somehow got a 'free ride' because I happen to be born with genes people find pleasing and I do a lot to highlight this. I personally can't see how it gives me so many advantages. I still have to work hard like everyone else.



Do good looking people really make more money? Get better jobs? Are they really happier people in life? Is there any research to support this? If so is it really a major advantage in life? Or is my friend just suffering from 'Grass is greener' syndome?

Well, I work in a pretty technical field so you have to have a certain level of adaptability and "fitness" to work in my field.



That said, I read ALOT, mostly I avoid fiction, and stick to history, anthropology and lately economics and geopolitical stuff, but its largely a function of what is going on in my life.



Otherwise, I find I'm doing alot of remedial stuff to keep fit.



That means while I had advanced forms of calculus, linear algebra and such I have forgotten much of it, and have had to start over again with very simple stuff. In this way it's definitely a use it or loose it proposition.



Physical exersize is also wonderful for keeping sharp, it tends to get the blood flowing and get thing unclogged and uncluttered.

Is America turning into the land of the lost and hopeless? Fear, loathing and cyncism in America?



This country is just turning bad.  People are fearful, distrustful of one another, secretly and some outwardly loathe one another, are cynical about life, about themselves, about EVERYTHING, and so many people are just lost and hopeless.



Our land is turning into some....has-been, post-apocalyptic, weird place where people aren't even acting human anymore, but like they're some hurting war veterans, hurting mentally and spiritually for the most part.



I know this is a totally cynical take on it but, that's because I read between the lines, I see things for how they REALLY are.



Most of you just continue to lead your lives without even looking/disecting society at all and putting it under a microscope. That's fine I guess if you want to lead your lives in total ignorance but,



the America I see through my microscope is not a good one, and it paints a very black picture of how humans really are.



Selfish, greedy, want power/control, all sorts of things.



I know America hasn't always been like this, but nowadays I can't even go out and drive a nice car and feel good about my life because there are always others out there who want to ruin that.



It's disguisting.

Just so you know I am a nice person and wish you well, as I do of all mankind.  Surround yourself with people you like, don't get caught up in Yahoo answers as well.  I read them to humor myself and thats about it.  Mean people suck, thats the bottom line.  I work in a customer focused job and for the 10 great "regulars" that come in, there is always 1 mean jerk-off, but for some reason it is easier to focus on that one person becuase of the intense emotions of disgust that that person brings up, but then I remember, "Hey, I just made ten people smile, and they returned the favor."  So carry on, and chin up. If that doesn't help, there is always Prozac.  I am kidding.  Take care.

You may be right about all the negative things you see. What you are wrong in is assuming they are in any way new or original... even to the degree you see them today. America, along with most other major countries, has always been like this. And worse, in fact. However cynical you find them now, they are not officially allowed to keep slaves anymore, for example. The class systems are rapidly decreasing. No, it's not perfect, but neither was the past, dispite how nostalgics like to describe it. People forget the negative things much easier than the positive.

Certain people will always remain ignorant, fearful and loathing. These are people who cannot rise above their lesser instincts, but I don't think that all people are like this. What you are seeing is a self-fulfilling prophecy: you're looking for the lesser and (wow) you're finding it. There is a mixture of qualities in all of us. All of us have the ability to hate, it's how we choose to act upon this that defines us as people.

What would cause such a loathing. A fear for the economy, and losing the things which bring us comfort. Hoarding is a concern for people even though in our American society we do have a sound supply of resources. People are concerned about the future. I can only consider that people are concerned because they know how capitalists think, and know how they behave when they do have an overflow of resources. Imagine a society of capitalists where the supplies were scarce. If that isn't an issue of concern then I don't know what is. On the bright side, the policies and legal system of America does permit people to freely associate with who they choose, and that can afford us some security.

Well, you have the experience of that depressive episode to catch the signs that you're prone to them again in the future. There is situational depression, and there is chronic depression - age and life circumstances are huge contributing factors to this...for example, people in their twenties often report the highest cases of depression. It's often a bi-product of age. In answer to your question - how do you stop yourself from becoming like that again -- increase your physical activity, eat well, get proper sleep, write in a journal, increase social activities, etc.

What do you live for?



I don't know what I live for. I'm a student, I'm taking a course in college which I'm not even sure I like. I have lots of friends but none that are so close. Overall, I have an uneventful life. I feel empty. Which makes me feel so depressed. Not that I don't want to live. I'm so not contemplating suicide, but this is not a good feeling either.



I'm wondering what other people live for. What makes you happy? How can you not feel empty? (and don't tell me to go find a bf. I don't believe that you need other people to make you feel complete).

I feel the exact same way.  i'm very introverted and am shy in personal situations.  Therefore I don't have "lots of friends but none that are so close" i have like 5 or 6 that i consider family and the rest are acquaintances.  DUE TO THE FACT, I feel this way.  I live to make the people i care about feel better about their situations.  Mine is pretty messed up and i don't think anyone can help me, but when i make someone i care about smile and forget their problems for a while i feel like i have purpose, like i did something right.

To put it simply, I live for the hope of tomorrow -- that tomorrow might have something extraordinary in store that I could never have foreseen.



To put it more specifically:



1. I live that I might one day graduate college and be able to start doing what I love: practicing archaeology and studying ancient Egypt.



2. I live so that I can someday travel and see all the wonders this world has to offer.



3. I live because my friends and family want me to live. They've done so much for me; the least I can do for them is stay alive.



4. I live for love. It may be fleeting sometimes, and it may always be painful; but it's still worth it, every time.



5. I live for knowledge. I love learning. Who knows if I'll learn something tomorrow that changes my outlook on life? It's happened before.



There are plenty more reasons to live, and if you sit down and plot them out, you'll realize it for yourself too. Try taking a trip somewhere; change your scenery a bit, stir things up. It always helps me feel refreshed and eager to face whatever comes next!

I was feeling the same way for years. What I did was find the good and beauty in all the little things. I also started listening to upbeat, uplifting music more often. I didn't let small problems get to me and as I learned I started handling bigger and bigger problems with more and more ease. That makes you feel pretty good, makes you worry a lot less. If you're open to all of the positive that life has to offer I'm sure great things, and people will come into your life.



And about school.. maybe you should take a roadtrip and let loose. As you explore other places as well as yourself while you're alone, you'll find things that you really love and enjoy, which can help you find a better, more fulfilling subject to get into.

omg!! this is EXACTLY how I feel!! and I've always been wondering what makes people go on? what's their reason for living? but this usually ends up with me being depressed as hell.. recently I decided that every day life is the reason I'm living for! I know it sounds lame but it's keeping me going on for now :s I too believe that I don't need other people to me make me feel whole! that'll only lead to me being so dependant and needy.. I guess what we're going through is normal! there's a void in everyone's life but some people are just too busy to realize it!!



we feel that because we can't find that something that satisfies us, that something that while doing fills the void within our souls, that something that makes us feel worthy and different.. maybe I should find me a hobby or something lol

For you, other people do make a difference other wise you should be happy living on earth completely alone which you know would not be true. People...family, friends they all matter embrace the ones you have and if you don't have anyone make an effort to bond with some new people...we are all we have in this life..seek positive people and a BF would be a huge help as long as he isn't the type to drag you down...get one that supports you as an individual.

Each day your life starts with a blank slate.



What happened yesterday is over and everything you are faced with is new and unknown.



Who is in charge of the future before you? You and only you.



How will you CHOOSE to create this new day?



How will you CHOOSE to react to the circumstances that come your way?



Will you CHOOSE peace or drama, happiness or anger, success or failure, love or hate? All the choices are yours to make.



How often do you react to a situation unconsciously or by allowing your ego to dictate the appropriate reaction as a result of someone else controlling your feelings and emotions. What would happen if you and only you control your feelings and emotions and you can determine yourself how you want to feel and how you want to react to any situation. Would your life be lighter, happier, more peaceful.



You can in fact consciously decide in any minute how you CHOOSE to think, react, feel about anything happening in your life. When you feel yourself beginning to react, stop yourself and breathe, then take a moment and determine how you CHOOSE to react for your own better good.



Maybe you decide not to take something personally. Maybe you decide to come down a notch and communicate at a more controlled level. Maybe you just choose peace and let it go.



So don't be short sighted with yourself or others.



Try to open your mind to new possibilities.



Relax, breathe and allow your imagination to move outside your conditioned self.



Each day is a new day in your life, live the life you CHOOSE

you are right about not needing another person. For years, I beat myself up about not being able to keep a happy relationship, and never being able to find the "right" one. Well now I know I am happier to live alone, and work on my own projects, without someone whining about everything, and putting the blame on me for them not being happy. Now i live for Working on my house, and making the yard nice, and playing my music and trying to be more creative.



I am learning new things about gardening and relearning and reviving old methods of living, like canning, and making my own soap, and brewing beer, etc. I just want to be able to take care of myself, without relying on other people, because there always seems to be a high price for accepting help from someone. I have brains enough to invent someway to do it myself, rather than ask someone to help me. Being a little lonely is a lot better than living with someone going out of their way to make me miserable. So, I guess I live for learning to be self-reliant.

Hi,
I've thought about what you're talking about for about a year, and I couldn't find any good reason for living, but I couldn't find one for dying as well, so I've decided to live in the best way I can, and enjoy every moment of my life, the most important thing for you to do is to find out what you like. Don't care about what people think about you. Your only choice is to live, so try to live in the way you want :)

It depends on your motivation for speaking of yourself, I guess, and praising others at the same time would doesn't really make a difference, especially if you don't mean it.



If you still brag about yourself to get praise from others it still means you have narcisstic tendancies if you praise others or not.

If you feel like crying (even if you cannot) over something which is in the past, it means you have not dealt with it.
It will keep coming up and hurting you until you deal with it.
You may not even realize what it is that lies in your past.
I would strongly suggest you speak to a therapist.  By speaking about your childhood and your life in a private and secure environment, you will be opening up the wound and then it can be treated.
Please don't hesitate.  It works.

as an acting major, this is something I pay 6,000 dollars a year to correct lol.



this is really common for me during performance. physically, my body is holding somewhere (i.e muscle tension) and it subconsciously protects myself from being vulnerable.



what I always do is go to a safe place for you where you can be by yourself or with someone you trust completely, and watch a sad movie. take notice to how your body responds during emotional stress and the muscles that tense. for me I always lock up in my shoulders and my abdominal muscles, and when this happens, I actively think about keeping them relaxed and released. and, the most important thing is to keep breathing. have you ever noticed that when you feel you are about to cry youhold your breath? the breath lets the emotion evolve. a buddhist belief is that the holding of breath is the unwilling to budge, and the act of digging your heels in and refusing to evolve with the universe is a great detriment to the mind and spirit. if you can't let an emotion evolve after 16 breaths, that feeling will stay with you forever.



I know how you feel, and sometimes it's hard, even terrifying, to allow yourself to be so exposed. I promise you'll feel a million times better if you try any of these techniques.



I send positive energy to you and your health.

you need some emotional release, try doing something scary (but safe) like bungee jumping, or riding one of those big roller coasters. that will help create an opening for your emotions to flow out of. you may have to do it a few times, Just allow yourself to feel it and release it, dont hold anything in, just allow yourself to feel. Make some plans to do these kinds of things. You need to feel the raw, so you can release the raw. You have to break through the crust of your coccoon that you have built up over the years, It sometimes takes trauma to do this. Dont wait for Human drama to supply it, use safe methods of putting yourself in a situation where you arent the one in control.

I would speak to your health care provider and tell her/him exactly what you've said here.  Your doctor will be able to follow up with questions and hopefully put it in perspective for you, or act accordingly.  Make an appointment, try your best not to stress or panic; it's normal to worry about ourselves when we don't feel right. Take that step for yourself!

I hear what your saying, Eye contact can be a hard thing if you have a low self esteem, or trust problems too, Not so sure about the connecting problem if you want to know if you have a disorder, seeking some professional help might benifit you.  You might be dissocating...but again I'm no professional, seeking help just to get peace of mind is NEVER a poor idea.



I hope you feel more connected soon, dont' worry to much about the eye contact....look at George Clooney he never makes eye contact and chicks find him hot!



Good luck and keep me posted....if you want to.

Sounds like a social anxiety.
If you are being serious, have you seen your physician?
Because if you really feel this way,
a doctor can determine through a blood test



whether there is a physical cause.
Or if it's just emotions, he can also direct you from there.



I pray you find wisdom.

Sounds like ADD or ADHD...maybe even generalized social anxiety disorder...it's all treatable so don't panic!!!!  Make an appt with your family doctor and discuss your feelings.  You may need meds but therapy is very beneficial as well.  Be patient, you might need to try several different variations of meds but once you find the right one you will be amazed!!!  Good luck!

To be absolutely certain, you will need to visit your doctor to be referred to a psychologist.  It sounds to me as if you could be suffering from ADD which is Attention Deficit Disorder.
It is very common in today's society and can affect both children and adults.
This web site includes Frequently Asked Questions, how to find help, articles and more: http://add.org
Take a look at it and you may recognize your symptoms.
ADD is treatable.

In my opinion, deja vu is more probable in more mature people because more mature minds have a larger attention span, and an attention span is required for anticipation. A person might anticipate a number of scenarios and when they finally do occur(if they do) then the sense of deja vu is similar to a preparation for the likely occurence of the event. Your attention span is increasing.

Deja vu or to see again means that you believe that you have seen or heard something before which you actually never have. It is because your neurons fire twice in response to a certain stimuli. Since your neurons fire twice, your brain reads it twice. So you think you saw something before but you really hadn't, it was just a tiny malfunction with your neurons and your brain. It could also be because you have been in a situation which is similar to the one that you experienced "deja vu" in. Your mind remembers the past experience subconsciously and you experience hind sight bias or when you think you experienced something you had not.

<answer>



There are three explanations for deja vu:



1. Parapsychology



Déjà vu is associated with precognition, clairvoyance or extra-sensory perceptions, and it is frequently cited as evidence for "psychic" abilities in the general population. Non-scientific explanations attribute the experience to prophecy, visions (such as received in dreams) or past-life memories.



2. Dreams



Some believe déjà vu is the memory of dreams. Though the majority of dreams are never remembered, a dreaming person can display activity in the areas of the brain that process long-term memory. It has been speculated that dreams read directly into long-term memory, bypassing short-term memory entirely. In this case, déjà vu might be a memory of a forgotten dream with elements in common with the current waking experience. This may be similar to another phenomenon known as déjà rêvé, or "already dreamed." However, later studies on mice indicate that long-term memories must be first established as short-term memories.



Kevin Heady suggested that a feeling of remembering occurs in a sense that he might realize that what he had dreamed is now a relevant present action that is taking place right here right now.



"I was once sitting down in the kitchen noticing that my plate seemed well too familiar, it seemed as if my head motions were foreseen, and that every move would trigger a continuation to happen or so, I had many déjà vus as a child but this was extraordinary, I knew from the bottom of my heart that I had dreamed this situation years ago, as a little boy, that amazingly an entire piece of memory was regained and I finally understood when and where I was dreaming and how long this dream was, and most importantly how many years ago did I dream." -John Lennon



3. Reincarnation



Those believing in reincarnation theorize that déjà vu is caused by fragments of past-life memories being jarred to the surface of the mind by familiar surroundings or people. Others theorize that the phenomenon is caused by astral projection, or out-of-body experiences (OBEs), where it is possible that individuals have visited places while in their astral bodies during sleep. The sensation may also be interpreted as connected to the fulfillment of a condition as seen or felt in a premonition. For further cases of remembering information from past lives, see Ian Stevenson.

<answer>



Deja Vu is the experience of feeling sure that one has witnessed or experienced a new situation previously (an individual feels as though an event has already happened or has happened in the near past). The term was coined by a French psychic researcher, Émile Boirac (1851–1917) in his book "L'Avenir des sciences psychiques" ("The Future of Psychic Sciences"), which expanded upon an essay he wrote while an undergraduate. The experience of déjà vu is usually accompanied by a compelling sense of familiarity, and also a sense of "eeriness," "strangeness," or "weirdness," The "previous" experience is most frequently attributed to a dream, although in some cases there is a firm sense that the experience "genuinely happened" in the past.

But, if your still can be Intimate with someone your deeply in love with because you want that person to feel the same intimacy that you feel.

The relationship rules influence how you and your partner relate to one another: how emotions are expressed, the way in which needs are communicated, how family and friends are dealt with and how intimacy is expressed.



Ideally, you and your partner will openly communicate and negotiate the different rules that are important to each of you. But this isn't always the case: Couples are often guided by powerful rules that remain unspoken. Because you learned many of these rules as a child, you may not even be aware of the impact of your relationship rules.



There may be times when your relationship proceeds smoothly under the influence of the unspoken rules that guide you and your partner--this is usually the case when your rules do not conflict with your partner's rules. But when these rules remain unspoken, your relationship or marriage becomes a game of chance. Becoming mindful of these hidden, powerful rules will increase the control you and your partner have in strengthening your relationship.

I'm really scared of the paranormal?



and I would like some advice on overcoming, or at least alleviating my fear. I'm terrified of the dark. Every night I have to sleep with two lights and my TV on. I'll sleep on my back with my head turned to the side so one ear is covered by a pillow, then I cover the other ear with a blanket. If I'm having a bad night sometimes I'll even sleep with my main light on. I turn almost all the lights on in my house if I'm moving around at night, and I'm constantly looking around for things behind me or near me. I'm scared to be home alone because I think every noise is something that's going to come attack me. I've never had any paranormal experiences, and I hope I never do, but I'm still scared of what might be there.



After I finish my undergraduate studies, I'm moving away from my family to go to another school, and my partner won't be able to come with me for year after that. I don't know how I'm going to manage alone, or with a roommate who probably won't want me to cling to them all the time. The only time I feel safe at night is when I'm in my boyfriend's arms.



Please, I don't want to hear any paranormal stories. It gives me the creeps just to hear them. I just want to find a way to get over my fear and not be a bother to other people.

If your problem with sleeping persists then you should speak with a doctor about medication for relaxing at night. Another solution is to evaluate who you are spending time with during your day-light hours. If you don't feel that you are supported in your days then that could be contributing to your disturbing nights.

I over came my fear by realizing that the dark won't hurt you. Only if you stumble over something. Nothing wrong with having a night light on. Just realize there's not everything lurking in every corner to get you. Do things that help when your in the dark. Play music, pray, sit up and hold a stuffed bear whatever you need to feel better. Tell your self " nothing is going to hurt me, it's just dark that's all. Darkness is a natural occurrence just like daytime. also using breathing techniques breathing deeply and slowly helps. If you feel the fear let it flow and pass.

The mind can be a wasteland of thoughts, memories, and fantasies.  Sometimes the fears we have actually stem from some type of memory of a past experience.  What type of TV shows do you watch, books do you read, video games you play, or conversations do you have with your close friends?  Something on the outside of you is feeding that fear and your mind is having a field day with it.  Ever hear of the saying "Mind over Matter?"  Well in your case it might take a few mind exercises to retrain your brain to accept your reality over those fantastic thoughts you have of the paranormal.  You say that you have never had a paranormal experience but somehow you haven't really accepted that as pure truth for you.  If you purely accept that you have never seen or experienced anything paranormal, then you will be able to fortify your real state of mind on a premise of "No paranormal experience = no basis for paranormal fear."  You could tell yourself that your fear of the paranormal doesn't have a leg to stand on, not even in theory.  Every night take a look around your room with the lights on and say to yourself what you see.  Then turn the lights of and repeat what you saw.  Then turn the lights back on to affirm what you said.  Then turn the lights off and try to lie in your bed affirming that truth over and over.  Do this every night until you are able to lie in the bed with the lights off until you go to sleep.  It will take some time because you have to accept the truth (no paranormal experience = no basis for paranormal fear) and believe it without doubt.  Once you are able to do that you should be able to turn the lights off, knowing what and where everything is in the room, know that none of it is paranormal, and finally sleep with the lights off.

How has Y!A affected your thoughts?



For me, I've realized more and more that there are plenty of people out there that are FAR more crazy than I am.  I feel at least I have an open mind about certain things....and it really irks me when people try to push their beliefs (particularly about religion) on others.
So tell me...having read so many questions and answers, has it made your outlook on people change at all?  Please elaborate, thanks!

Do dreams come true? or do have dreams to let us know what is going to happen on the future?



Has anyone experienced a dream come to reality? if so can you tell it to me?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



dreams are just our subconscious working things out for the day. Even our experiences from the past can be triggered by what we see during the day. If we can't handle it, then we dram about it, so we can deal with it somehow. dreams don't necessarily mean it will come true. It's our own problems, desires, plans, ambitions being worked out so we can deal with the next day.

Would this be close to lucid dreaming?



Well last night in my dream I was on the school bus with my friend. I turned to her and said "Hey you know, this is a really boring dream, I'm going to wake up now" and then I did. I've had dreams like this before.
So its like I knew I was dreaming, but I wasn't aware enough to control it, you know? What would you call that sort of thing?

It is natural to have this urge since you are nineteen.  If you really like to control this urge, do Yoga morning and evening.  Eat lots of Satvic foods and vegetables.  Avoid  Rajasic foods like meat, chicken etc and reduce the intake of spices.

I think it is natural to want a child. I would try to look at why you want a child at this point in your life where it seems you are not in the position to have one; is there something missing from your life? Do feel loved by the people in your life? The reason I ask this is because, I knew a girl who wanted a baby to have some one that loved her without reserve.

It's natural - just as men have the urge for sex, women have the urge for babies (that's how we come together, after all!) It's peaking now because you're in your prime reproductive years, and it will peak again in your thirties, because your time is running out. It's your biological clock you can hear ticking. Why not make a plan to have a baby in your twenties and work towards getting your life in such a shape that it can happen? I find that helps. It's an odd taboo these days for a woman to say her body is crying out for a baby, but rest assured, it's natural and you're normal. Good luck!

Have you ever been really depressed?



Today, I feel really depressed and pathetic. I'm 19, and I feel like I'm going nowhere in life. Everything that I do seems to fall short of other peoples expectations, mainly to the ones that I love. When I'm feeling good, there's always someone or something that makes me feel worthless. Has anyone ever experienced this?

And yes, people have told me before "Just do what makes you happy, it doesn't matter what others think", but in reality, it does matter what other people think. What others think determines your life, basically. If someone doesn't like me (For any number of reasons) they could not hire me for a job, attempt to make my life harder, etc.

Yes, it is very true that it matters what other people think, but only certain people matter. You're probably just going through a random phase or if a recent change has occurred you could be suffering from that. My recommendation would be to wait it out for a little while or talk to someone about it (ie family, professional, etc). Don't give up, you can achieve anything.

Actually, what you're feeling is very normal.  According to Erikson's theory, people in their late teens to early twenties are trying to figure out who they are and what they are doing.



You'll probably spend some time in introspection and use that time to work out what you want in life and how you can make it match up with who you are.  Don't get worked up over missed marks and keep your eye on the long term goal.



No one can make you feel worthless unless you let them.  Their problems are about them, not about you.



I hope this helps.  Good luck!

It's because you're surrounded by a certain look all the time that you want to become like them too. You should be happy that you don't look like everyone else. You have your own unique beauty and you should be happy with what you have. It's definitely a race issue. I'm not white and I have different features as the average person. I think I have a big nose and I'm really petite etc. but I try not to compare myself. Comparing yourself will only make you feel worse about yourself.

The reason any of us feel jealousy is due to our being insecure with ourselves. Comparing yourself to other people whom you deem to be "better" than yourself, certainly doesn't help. I suggest seeking examples of beauty in the Chinese culture. Learn to appreciate your uniqueness, and limit your exposure to the Western ideals of beauty. Ideals that very few women of any color or nationality can live up to. And please: throw away those beauty magazines. They are nothing but self-hatred inducing-adverstisers want you to feel unhappy with yourself so that you will buy their products.

How do I stop freaking out and worrying about Bed Bugs ?



We had a flea infestation and I have been fighting it for a few weeks and now I suspect we have Bed Bugs too.



My in laws live in NY city and although I have not found one i suspect that we have them  I remember a bug that my husband killed that was bloody and bug blood is green or clear.  Only blood sucker have red blood and I found some weird spots on my PJ's that are very small and this is what the online site s say the bug spots look like. Now I feel like I am crawling with bugs all the time and cannot sleep at night even though I covered my entire box spring and mattress with a cover and taped the zipper and pulled it from wall. Trashed my headboard and washed and bagged everything sprayed like crazy.



i just cannot stand the thought of something sucking my blood while i sleep so i have a flashlight in my bed and keep waking up and checking for them.  Haven't gotten a good night sleep in weeks and feel dirty all the time. Advise???

Bed bugs are a pest and really hard to handle..



I once had a bed bug problem too.. So I called the professional to come out and get rid of my bed bug problems. They had stated that bed bugs do not go away in just one treatment it usually takes 3-4 different treatments so they had recommend several different products that i could purchase online and use to treat the bed bugs.



One of the products I found that was very useful is call Steri- Fab you spray it almost anywhere mattress, clothes and even carpets. Also using natural products such as rest easy is a good idea too, taking these types of product when your traveling so that you don't bring them back with you. Also getting box spring and mattress encasements is a good idea it not only helps eliminate but help prevent them. If you try to cover your mattress and box spring with plastic the bed bugs will just chew right through it. Spraying the mattress and putting dust into the holes in the sides of the mattress before covering the infested mattress is a good idea.



I was able to find a lot of products and info at this site they have a reasonable price to why don't you check it out...

Get a new mattress. It sounds like you have tried to make yourself feel better by cleaning and making it so anything in your mattress can't get you...but if it isn't working, you may have to get a new mattress to get over it completely. Mattresses can be expensive, but if you are not picky, you may be able to find a nice one in your price range.



If you continue to have issues and you don't have the means to replace the mattress, I would talk with a therapist or psychologist. They could help you to overcome your problem. A psychiatrist on the other hand, will try to prescribe you medicine, so I would not go there unless you have tried counseling. Good luck!

In respect to the issue of homosexuality and choice, given the existence of ex-homosexuals and given the existence of human cultures where homosexuality has apparently not existed, the position that homosexuality is ultimately a choice in individuals or at the very least can be a choice in individuals has strong evidential support. In addition, given that the homosexual population has significantly higher rates of many diseases and the homosexual population also has significantly lower rates of various measures of mental health it can be strongly argued that engaging in homosexual acts is a bad choice for individuals. Another other factor that makes engaging in homosexual acts a bad choice for individuals is the significantly higher rates of domestic violence in homosexual couples. In addition, according to experts homosexual murders are relatively or quite common and often homosexual murders are very brutal. Also, the homosexual population has a greater propensity to engage in illegal drug use.



In addition, a distinction is made between choosing to have homosexual desires and choosing to engage in homosexual sex acts. And there are other aspects of choice to homosexuality. One can decide the following aspects: whether or not to believe that homosexual acts are detrimental to one's immortal soul, emotional well-being or physical health and one can also obviously choose whether to enter into a homosexual relationship or not. Obviously one must use wisdom and also do diligence in regards to these matters. For example, the Bible condemns homosexuality and sound Bible exegesis reveals this matter.

Its when you know right off the bat  when you know you are a homosexual..



Its the other percentage that flip flop to other genders and really don't know what they want. Then they "choose" what gender they want to be with.

These events that took place have so much meaning you added to them with story that you live by.  The events were real.  But whatever meaning you put to them have owned your whole life...your past has set your future up to be limited.  The best way to overcome this is to go back to when you first were being stopped in your life.  You could get complete with it by facing the people involved and really talking about where it left you in life. This route may not work, so you cannot do that, then there is another way let go/forgive. You would be giving yourself service by this.  It means that you are letting go of all story of those events, giving up the resentment/sadness...whatever feelings, and giving it all up so that your whole being can be rid of it.  You will feel lighter, and you will be free, and most of all you will have complete personal power.  After you can accomplish this part, then you create for yourself who you truly want to be in life.  Don't focus on what you want to "do"...but who you want to see yourself being.  This is called "possibility"  An example would be "the possibility of "freedom and full exrpession".  For myself it's "presense and self acceptance".



You will constantly be tested with this, and your patterns of old behavior will want to come back.  But if you stay focused on who you truly want to be in your life, and not hang on to past, then your future will always be limitless of possibilities.



I had a heck of a traumatic childhood that included molestation, to name a few.  I took courses that helped me to really give up all the stories of the past that I was allowing to own me and claim me victim.  It's no longer owning me.  You'd never think I endured these things.  Life is life, and we will continue to be living it every moment.  It does not ever have to own us unless we allow it.  You choose how your future will go as long as you let go of the past.  You will then be more present in your life, thus being fully alive like you deserve.

What do you honestly think of my email that i want to send to my friend telling him how i feel?



hey tim,



i know ive been sending you a lot of voicemails/emails lately & im sorry if said anything to make you feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed.  lately i feel like i dont know where your head is at half the time and that it's affecting our friendship because i dont know when you're up or down.  I feel like you're pissed at me half the time.



ive worked so hard to make things right between us... i even drove 2 hours on my day off  just to cash your check because i care about you so much.  i think you know in your heart that i do love you and would do anything for you.



i KNOW youve been going through a lot in your life recently, but when you ignore all of my messages while responding to other people it makes me feel worthless and like i dont even exist to you.  obviously i wish you would let me know whats up since we cant talk on the phone anymore.



when you say you're "grounded and cant talk"  on AIM,  but "are" online anyway and at the holiday inn  it makes me feel like you hate me.  its a horrible feeling.



im not mad at you or anything like that, its just frustrating not talking to you for several weeks like its no big deal when we use to enjoy talking almost every single day.  im guess im just having a difficult time coping with the lack of communication.



i want to be the best friend i possibly can be to you, but i need to know in my heart that everything is cool between us...



when are you getting your cell phone back? lol

Would this be close to lucid dreaming?



Well last night in my dream I was on the school bus with my friend. I turned to her and said "Hey you know, this is a really boring dream, I'm going to wake up now" and then I did. I've had dreams like this before.
So its like I knew I was dreaming, but I wasn't aware enough to control it, you know? What would you call that sort of thing?

ah but you were aware enough to control it  - just not aware enough to know that you were aware - Dreams and consciousness can be very tricky - Yes lucid dreaming definitely.
The more it happens the more you will be able to control.



I faced down a growling lion back into its cave in a dream when I had a lucid opportunity and I will never forget it - Keep a dream diary if you dont already - It helps you progress but its great to look back upon as over time one forgets.

Im sure the thought comes across everybody's mins at some time or another,but it is satan putting thise thoughts,you got to get a grip on your thought life.Satan came to kill still and destroy,God came to give life more abundantly,It would give satan such pleasure to see anyone committ suicide,but he only plants the thought.Think of all the reasons you have to live.I know you are not crying for help but you should change you thoughts,and you can do that.Every morning when you wake up say this is the day that the Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad in it.Think about the beauty of Gods creation and He made you special.There is nothing worth taking your life over.

You people really are screwed up if you think thoughts of suicide are NORMAL. It is NOT NORMAL or healthy.



If you're not happy with LIFE, then make a CHANGE. Don't sit there & wallow in self-pity!!  Be STRONGER



There is NEVER a reason to give in to negativity.  If you want to see the good, you will. It is a CHOICE. Whether you're religious or not, our human instinct is SURVIVAL, so if go against that instinct you're going against what is right.

Life after college:  I'm very unhappy?



I'm 22 and back home living with my parents (I recieved a BS in business this past May).  The job market is brutal right now, and after 2 months of searching, I'm finally nearing a job offer with this one company.  So what's the problem?



1.) I don't like this job.  I'm faking my interest just because I'm desperate and it offers a decent salary, but I know I'll inevitably be unhappy with it.



2.) I want to move out of my parents house.  This job is local, and I know if I get it I'll be living home and won't have a very good social life.  Most of my friends aren't even in my hometown anymore.



3.) I want love.  I want to be in more social settings where I am around the pretty, friendly girls (I admit I'm awfully picky) so that I can find a new love.  To make it harder, no prospects live in my hometown; just some old buddies.



I feel like I'll only be happy if I have a good social life, a girlfriend and a job I enjoy.  This is something I've been picturing in my head since high school.  Ultimately I'm scared I'm setting myself up for disappointment, and all I want is to find happiness.



What should I do?

First of all, i just want to say that i think it's great you've spent so much time determining what will make you happy, and came out with some pretty reasonable ideas.  This is more than most people ever manage.  Good for you.



Moving on, i think you need to just chill out.  A rash or rushed decision has much more potential to be a bad decision.  It is quite possible that you'll have to make some sort of compromise.  You have a series of goals her, and personally i think you should try and take on one at a time.  Trying to juggle too much at once will make you stress and even more likely to make a bad decision in the midst of being rash, imo.  Not that you necessarily make bad decisions, of course, but i think you get where i'm coming from.



I cannot say for sure which goal is best for YOU to complete first.  Only you can do that, and from what i can tell,  you likely already know which is the smartest / most important for you to go with first.  So do it.  Don't rush other aspects, you DO still have a lifetime ahead of you.  Happiness is not just something you can walk into in any event, it usually requires some level of hardship first.  If you can take your time and keep your focus on what will/can be rather than only what is... i have no doubt in my mind that you will reach your goals.



Good luck!

thats ok dude. Try this position and if its not for you move on. Give it a try though. Getting a taste of experience is always good and at the same time you can still be sending out stuff or inquiring. Its a long hard battle that never seems to end until you find the position you really want or one you can put up with. Seriously, it does not come easy!! I know, Ive been there. Actually, I may be there again if I get laid off and I am much older than you. Just take one thing at a time and dont put yourself through so much stress. One thing good about it, your not being complacent. Its ok to be picky about chicks but remember, dont judge a book by its cover.
Give chicks a chance and you may find something by accident. Your looks and youth do not last forever. You have a lot of time to look around and your future is the most important thing right now. Keep an open mind.

1. Maybe the job is not your dream job, but as you say, it offers decent pay and it seems nobody else was interested in taking you on. Sorry for being so straightforwards, but that's how it is. Accept that. Apart form that, think positive. Maybe you'll meet the nicest colleagues in the world and you won't even mind the less-than-perfect job after a month.



2. Be glad you have the chance to save money by not having to pay rent. Be grateful for the support you get from your parents. If you get the job, maybe you'll be able to afford a flat after a promotion/payrise - for the time being, accept what you have. Why would you not have a good social life just because you still live with your parents? What did you do when you were in high school and still living at home? If your friends moved (too far) away, get to know new people; do not break off contact, but don't expect to be friends with the same group of five people for the rest of your life.



3. The girl situation is the same as your job situation. You haven't even started the job, you have no idea what kind of people will be around you every day - keep your eyes open during lunchbreaks. If you want "more social settings", get out there and set them up! If you think only pretty girls are worth getting to know, you'll miss out on a bunch of great friendships and maybe even relationships - your choice. You are currently not coming over as picky, but as superficial and impossible to satisfy with anything.



Sorry for appearing so negative towards you, but you need to wake up and stop moaning. You have a degree, you will start your first job, you will have a decent salary, you'll meet new people.... Hate to break it to you, but elsewhere in the world, babies are starving to death. Sorry again, but sometimes it helps to put things into perspective.



You are looking backwards rather than forwards, you desperately cling on to your "old" life. You are, as you noticed yourself, indeed setting yourself up for disappointments, but the only reason for that is your attitude - not the circumstances. Think positive - easy to say, but at least give it a try and start your new job with a smile. :)

The electrical signals that allow us to store memories in our brains can take a number of different routes to arrive at their final destination. If a 'memory' in the form of an electrical signal takes a couple of different routes at the same time, it is possible that if one route is longer than the other, it arrives in the memory part of your brain only to find that the same memory has already arrived by a shorter route. This would make you think that you had already experienced the event on a previous occasion. A bit like hearing an echo when a sound wave has been reflected via different paths.
Thats my theory, and I'm happy with it.

I have to say that is actually a good answer, except I wouldn't call it a "memory",but rather things we are currently experiencing en route to the memory storage area via two paths.  Overall - this answer does make sense if you really think about it.  Kudos to Philbomoog and the Editorial Team.

I don't buy that theory interesting as it is.  If your brain were to short-circuit in such a fashion you would certainly experience deja vu a lot more frequently than you do.



I still believe it's kind of like experiencing the same exact thing again...a feeling or emotion...nothing more.

I think that at some point in our dreams we have dreamt about a face,place or situation and at some point when we are awake we could be doing something similar to our dream that triggers the brain into thinking that we have done this before.

I feel for some people this is a special gift especially if you dream or have a preminition of something that is happening or going to happen in the near future it is not always as clear as day but at times when I get significant dreams, i get an intense burning sensation in my legs or arms, it has happened on many occasions now for me to know that it not just an ordinary dream and i remember all of it...  I had a dream the other night  where my mother took to see an old lady dressed in white and she told my mother that me and another sister have more in common that she thinks as they have the gift of sight, maybe this is something that may develop in the future, she also gave me a message which i do not know now what it means but maybe in the future..

all of our expieriences are thoughts materialized, mind in motion. energy as matter.



There are only two kinds of thoughts, memories and imagination, therefore when you experience a so called "deja vu" is just a thought previously had in your unconscius materialized. In other words you create it, but mind is so powerful that it created it the same way you imagined it.

Good question!
I have no theory on why we experience deja vu, but it has happened to me many times. It is a really strong feeling and it lasts only a second. For me it is very different from having seen something in my dreams and then it really happening. Didn't occur to me before but the theory, that someone above has, about our eyes and the delay of the message sent to the brain seems very reasonable.

For many years,it has been known that the two hemispheres of the brain are slightly out of step,althought they work in unison,there are sufficient differences in chemical changes to allow one half to percieve things before the other half is fully aware,the result of this is that the "slow" and "fast " halves of the brain percieve it differently,one as an immediate experience and one as a memory.I dont understand why people keep harping on about deja vu when this has been know for so long

I believe that it's possible you HAVE been there before - maybe in another life-time! If you feel connected to someone and you've only just met them, it's also possible that you knew them from a previous life. This is sometimes called Soul Groups!
I have heard several scientific explanations about deja vu but none of them have satisfied me as much as the idea that we are reincarnated into new life experiences and something from our "mind" and by this I don't mean brain, is carried with us into the new carnation (body). I believe that it's also possible that talents are also 'transported' in the mind/soul of the person and that is why some people have a natural flair for singing, acting, art etc... Some people feel that they are able to remember incidents from past lives in their 'now' life. Knowledge and skills can also be transferred in this way and all we are doing is REMEMBERING an experience. When we think we've seen and done something before.. maybe just maybe we have... but on another level within a different existence and snap shots of that experience are returning to us!

99.9999% thinks it is simply a matter of the mind seeing some simularities to somewhere one has been before, including in movies, books, seeing something positive/negative in the place that makes it "feel" familiar.



0.0001% of me thinks there is a supernatural aspect to it, especially if the person is female and I've have the feeling of a connecton. That small part is my romantic side.

It is a 6th sense.  Some people are psychic, they have full control of retaining information of what they see in the future, however most of us do not have such abilities.  At one point we catch a brief glimpse into the future, usually an insignificant event.  That glimpse is stored somewhere in the deep recesses of our mind.  When that event actually happens, déjà vu occurs, it triggers the memory of that momentary glimpse, however because of it's brevity and how deeply it is stored in our mind we do not remember having it in the first place.  It is familiar, but not recognizable.

Unexplainable really. I've had it happen to me often. There were times when something was happening and somehow I knew exactly what was going to happen next. Could be it's from another life, another time; or just coincidental. I remember one time I visited an old house and I knew where every room was and could describe the furnishings before going inside. It was impossible, since it was my very first time in that particular town.
Who knows, we could have undeveloped psychic abilities!

I believe that it is something that happens to let you know that your life is going the way it is meant to be going. When i experience deja vu i feel comforted because i know that im where im supposed to be, doing what im supposed to be doing. There is a book called The Celestine Prophecy which explains it. This book changed my life when i read it.

I can't remember for the life of me where I heard this but it was told to me a long time ago when I was a child.  Deja vu is the universe telling us that our lives are on track; that we're walking the correct path and doing what was intended for us.  It's the waking realization of our own destiny; that it's being fulfilled and that events are unfolding as they were intended to.

I believe that a deja vu occurs during a lapse of concentration when an observation is accidentally registered by the "memory" part of your brain, making you think that you've seen something before.



I think that's quite a good explaination, however I know absolutely nothing about the workings of the brain so please don't think there is any scientific evidence behind this theory! :)

The feeling of dejavu is in a sense, a memory.  Everything happens on the astral plane first.  The astral is a level of existence above the earthly plane we live on.  And when we get the dejavu feeling, we have for a moment remembered the experience or person from the astral.  Normally we don't remember, for if we did, we'd be having constant dejavu, which would make life quite confusing.



I don't feel there is any deep meaning behind dejavu, though it does feel special at the time.

I don't believe in past lives, but I do believe in an earlier childhood life that is largely forgotten. Sometimes there is something in our current experience that tickles, or is in harmony with, one of these earlier forgotten memories so that we feel like the new experience is one that we can almost remember when it is the earlier one that we can almost remember.



There are of course other theories, but you asked for mine. I have seen the trailers for your movie, and it is definitely one that I plan to "vu".

deja vu occurs when the electrical impulses in our brains "jump" from one side of the brain to the other, at the synapse...sometimes the impulse rate of speed slows down and...while we are looking at something or doing something our eyes see what we are doing and our ears hear what's going on around us but, the brain takes a moment to register it.  That's when we think...hey, I've done this before.

When I was about 16 I decided I would go to London and seek my fortune. I traveled overnight on the bus from Edinburgh and arrived in Victoria at 6.30am I bought a paper to look for a job and went to the cafe for a coffee and look at the jobs, unfortunately there were no adverts for jobs I felt emberrassed sitting too long in the cafe on my own and I was too shy to ask anyone what paper was best to find a job so I thought i'd go to Downing street and visit the London Paladium then Buckingham Palace. Having never been any further south than Edinburgh I walked straight to The London Palladium, I then made my way to Downing St and along to Buckingham Palace, I never asked anyone directions, I did not get lost I seemed to know how to get to each place by instinct. I ended up getting the 4.30 bus back to Scotland as London was just too scary for me.
Over the years I have passed people or met people in company
and when I have looked them in the eye and for a second I felt a connection.One woman in particular she was about 10 feet away from me in other company our eyes locked for a second and I felt her pain,sorrow and hopelessness I was sure I knew her but I knew that I had never met her, I heard she was found dead 3 days later her name Betty Blue Lips.
I was regressed by a Scottish Newspaper over a few weeks and lo and behold under regression my name was Nanelle Rodgers and I lived in London had a florist my father was missing in India he was in the Army.
Two weeks later I looked up whos who and there was a Captain Rogers who had dissapeared in India.
Was that the reason I knew London so well? is there life after death? I don't know, my Mother before she died said she had a funny feeling she was going to die and if she did she would come back and let me know what it was like then she said maybe we cant because most people would eventually commit suicide. My Mother was killed in an acciden shortly after this conversation,that was 28 years ago so far she hasn't come back not even in a dream.
Some people say it is one part of your brain working quicker than the rest but this does not apply to my experiences.
Maybe dejavou is just that we are useing the part of the brain which is surpressed.Have you never met someone and knew instinctively that they were allright or all wrong.
Best regards.

You know what I am quiet and reserved expect when it comes to writing.  I do not worry about what other people anymore because it simply does not matter.



The only ones opinion outside of family and friends that matters to me is GOD.



GOD gives you a sound mind and peace to know his ways.  (1 Tim 1:7).  The point is that you are the one that has to feel comfortable in her own skin.



Be yourself and seek GOD for the rest.  Be yourself and love yourself!

megan, are you actually considering confiding your deepest thoughts and problems to an absolute stranger on the internet? You are setting yourself up for an experience that can go in dozens of directions, and none of them - in my opinion - are good. You've emphasized ...for free. When it comes to mental health there are no freebees. That is excepting when an individual really makes up their mind to to take control, and by themself do something to create a more acceptable life style. Chat with an unknown psychiatrist.  Well megan I wish you luck if you make the kind of contact you are  asking about. Just be careful.  Internet communication can be harsh and unforgiving. Post something you may regret, and it hardly ever goes away. Mike

You seem like a cool guy, Mike. The psychiatrist isn't really for me, it's more for my boyfriend. My relationship is being affected by his past and I wanted to help him cope with a few things, just didn't know how to do it. Thanks for the advice, you're probably right.

depends what kind of fear you experience when seeing a physically appealing person... when you see a hot guy, do you get that butterfly-in-your-tummy kind of fear? if so, that's just you feeling a little bit of lust and you're physically attracted to them. when you see beautiful girls, do you get the kind of fear that's like you don't feel like you're good enough compared to them? if so, then that's just normal human feeling of some insecurity to another beauty.... i'm trying to pinpoint what this fear is, but i need a bit more details about the kind of fear you're experiencing when you see a pretty person and i'll be able to help you out ;)

Organise your day? Tips and motivation needed ?



I have had a problem with organisation all my life. It's really messed up a lot of opportunities for me. I'll get excited about something, start it, carry it mid way through but always fail to finish things completely. My confidence has gone because It's like I don't trust myself to complete what I set out to do. (I know this won't make sense to a lot of people, especially if you have no problems getting things done). I'm not afraid of working hard and I'm quite creative so I really don't know why this is such a problem? PLEASE HELP. If you could give me tips or lend ideas that would be great xxx Thanks

Your problem might simply be immaturity.  What helps me to be organized and accomplish everything I want to get done during the day is to make a list.  It doesn't have to be a long or detailed list, but make a list.  Then, don't go on to the next thing until you've completed what it is that you're working on.



What I have on my list for tomorrow is very simple:



lab
lunch with Sandy
car (take it to get serviced)
super market

Hmm, well im sort of the opposite, i cant stand leaving things unfinished! it just feels so... gah! Maybe you should try and set yourself to that, you might just be getting lazy? You should make more goals, try having a peice of paper on your table or fridge or something with a to-do list, and write on it something like.. 'I WILL finish this list by -/-/-' And that can be your main priority.. Make sure you start off with enjoyable things so you wont get sick of it straight away.. If you find yourself writing more and more things on the list then you are getting more confident and you should be fine! :)
Just an idea, hope it helps Goodluck!

Your teacher can lose his job for liking you more than just as a student. And I'm sure he doesn't want to lose his job, or even be labeled bad names because of it. Just leave those types of guys alone for now. Date people your own age. It's ok to have crushes, as long as you don't act on them, specially when it can hurt the other parties career.

She has no morals, apparently no self-esteem.. i don't know what to do to change her thinking?



i have a friend and she's GORGEOUS, but for some reason completely unknown to me, she has no self-esteem and not a whole lot of morals.. here's a few facts- she's on pills a lot of the time, almost daily (they're anxiety pills but she takes a little over the dosage to feel 'numb'), she's breathtakingly beautiful but she lets these guys have sex with her even when she doesn't like them, as if she needs validation that guys want her.. she rarely, if ever, says please or thank you, and doesn't really have any consideration for other people.. now immediately i just got the feeling that she's been sexually abused as a child, but i've just recently met her and i don't really know if she'd even tell me, but i just got that immediate feeling once i've been getting to know her.. i asked her about her relationship with her parents and she says that she gets along better with her dad now that her mom moved out, and she's fairly close with her mom.. i asked about her religion all she said was "jesus doesn't exist".... she's a beautiful girl and it breaks my heart to know that she's just throwing it all away.......what are your thoughts? is there anything i could do to change her and better herself? thanks

No, there's nothing you can do. People cope with thier problems in many different ways, all learned behavior. My parents always talked about psychiatrist this/psychologist that/therapist such and such and they finally sent us to a therapist and finally went themselves and I even tried to become a psychologist and I actually think I know a thing or two about psychology today, but other people drink, smoke, have sex with stangers and otherwise self destruct. Heck, I even think going to the psychiatrist is a form of self-destruction, changing yourself, exposing yourself... She probably did have something bad happen to her, but then again so did I and although I wish I were a sex addict because I think about it all the time, instead I stay home and hide all the time because I can't handle even one person not instantly falling in love with me, which I think they all should, you too.

to most of society, yes it's ''pedophilish'' for a 42 year old man to be with an 18 year old [barely a] woman... most people view it as an older man looking for a hot little chick to be with... but that may not be the case at all, age can be JUST a number, perhaps the 18 year old girl is very mature, and the 42 year old is young at heart, whatever the case, it's still an age gap.. and age gaps tend to be not as important once you reach late 20's and so on, because you're on the same path.. but 18-25 you're just experiencing being free and wanting to experiment and find out who you are, not likely to want to be tied down.. while a 42 year old typically is ready to settle down with someone... catch my point? but there can be exceptions to every rule, so brush off what society thinks, if a 42 yr old wants to be with an 18 yr old and vise versa then go for it ;)

My dad was 20 years older than my mother. I have never seen two people more in love.
The problems however did come as they grew older. They both became alcoholics. The relationship terminated when my father passed, he was 64.  She remarried and remained a alcoholic for the rest of her life.



So to answer your question, no it is not pedophilia, but is something I would not recommend.

"Pedophilia" is an attraction to pre-pubescent children, if she's post-pubescent but still underage you'd be an ephebophile.  An 18 year old, who's legally an adult in sexual matters, wouldn't fall into either category.  A lot of men prefer younger women, that's quite common, as is an attraction to older men in younger women, so I wouldn't worry about it unless there are other factors you haven't mentioned.

Do you know how it feels like to be a loner?



In the beginning of June.....I pulled the plug on my social life so I can excel on my academics. During the summer, I received a 4.0 GPA and for this current Fall semester, I'm taking 24 units which take up much of my time (luckily, i'm doing well).

truthfully ?
it only means that the "weird person" said or things something differently than the person who said it.  maybe that the second person likes  a different brand of clothes or different hobbies.

How can I be more loving, positive, compassionate and graceful to me and others?



Since attending college 3 years ago, I've noticed how different of a person I've become. I've done everything to losing weight (though I still need to lose more), change my outward appearance, rededicated my life to God/brought Christianity back into my life, get psychiatric help and so forth. Though I'm glad I've been proactive in getting my life on track, I'm starting to see how I've hurt and push people away and I know I can't get many of those people back.



I've also noticed I'm still not very loving, trusting, positive or accepting of others, myself and God. I've been accused of being too critical, serious, over analytical, a perfectionist, controlling and mean. I allow my emotions to get the best of me at times. I mix up being too guarded and too vulnerable at the wrong times with the wrong people. I easily beat myself up and sometimes others as a result. I don't have a community and don't feel I can go on.



I'm trying to change, but I just can't adjust quick enough for everyone and everything.



How do learn to achieve the above question? Thanks.



(I'm in group therapy, but it doesn't allow me to open up like I need it to. And, I don't qualify for any more individual therapy sessions at my school's health clinic.)

I am at constant battle with myself. I compete against myself and it's ruining my friendships and relationship.

Do you know how it feels like to be a loner?



In the beginning of June.....I pulled the plug on my social life so I can excel on my academics. During the summer, I received a 4.0 GPA and for this current Fall semester, I'm taking 24 units which take up much of my time (luckily, i'm doing well). There was a time when I was so focused on my work that I did not care how I dressed or looked physically. Ever since, I've been depressed for quite some time being a loner. I already know I have a extroverted temperament; however, I do not have many friends (it's even harder when you see all the other students having all the fun). All I have to look forward to everyday are my academics because I really do not have any friends to go out with or anything.

when you are a loner you are isolated lonely and people know when to pick on you.
if you don't hang out with your friends more often your life could be in misery and tragedy.
if you talk more often online you could be amazed by the way you make new friends.
If you play Rune scape.com you could make allot of friends with a friends list along with Funorb.com.

I have to say that my youngest brother is exactly like you. He has no social life and all he does is study.. he doesn't even talk to anybody except during lunch or dinner. He would just stay inside his room all day long and study.. he has no close friend. He doesn't go out at all.. he doesn't socialize with anyone. Eventhough he doesn't have depression, i always worried what if he becomes depressed one day..
well, for your case, if you become depressed, that means you are getting bored of your daily routine life which is just studying and not doing anything fun.. Making a small amount of time for other activities and socializing will be great. Otherwise, it can even effect your academic performances. So, take some time off, and go out with friends for a drink or spend some time with family, watching a movie or having family dinner... and do some sports like 30mins a day.. this will regulate ur blood flow and it will keep you back on track. Believe me, being extreme is not good even if it is for something good. You need to have some time for other things too. Balance your time. You can do it. You can still score 4.0. All the best.

yup, it sucks. i was very busy with my work then, and been always tired, instead i wanted to rest on the weekend, while i refuse my friends' invitations...til they're all gone coz they already have their own families...
i won't be hypocrite to tell ya that it would be easy to handle being alone, the least i can do is to talk to some close friends through phone or chat with them, and a series of visits to my psychiatrist. and sometimes i just fill myself up with material things, i buy stuffs that i like to treat myself.
hm, maybe try to recall who your close buddy is, then try to contact him/her, and maybe you two could go out and meet other new acquaintances...and hey, when you go to work, maybe you would be able to meet new ones as well...

Nobody is totally focussed all the time. There is too much going on and the brain is thinking all the time. Give yourself a break and it sounds like you just need to write stuff down to organize your thoughts and goals. I find I do much better with a list .. I just make one for the day and go out and accomplish it and that is a good feeling. And a spontaneous luncheon with friends is good for everyone!!

Trapped in a new job that I don't like! Help!!?



I was thinking a lot before moving from a company to a college. I just thought that it is mch better for my CV to teach because I have a Master in humanities, and the company job was to assist in administrative work using my languages.



I feel I was trapped, literally, to sign the contract, because I am continuously discovering negative things in my first week: everybody fears the lady boss hysterically, and she seems to have a superiority complex!! Imagine a tv cannot be moved without consulting her! They did not explain to me that we don t have rights to go to doctor, etc.



I resent signing the contract, though I like to teach.

I have a relative that attempted suicide unsuccessfully, not through a lack of effort mind you.



There would have to be no lower point you could reach. I can remember my relative feeling ashamed, embarrassed, worthless, and quite often people attempt suicide because they feel they are a burden to their family/loved ones, and the fact that they survived brings them to feel even more of a burden. All this is, of course, on top of all the depression.



A good family will always be supportive. My family still worry a lot, mostly that it will occur again.

Every person is different in how they would react.  However, it depends on the circumstances i.e. did the person really want to kill him/herself or was it an extreme cry for help, are they now glad they didn't kill themselves, do they wish they had killed themselves etc.
I would say that it would be a mixture of feelings.
Guilt on seeing their family and friends so upset at their attempted suicide and seeing how this act effects those around them. (whether they had really wanted to kill themselves or not.  when people try to kill themselves they are convinced the world will be better with out them so they don't want to see the way loved ones would be upset as they believe, or convince themselves, no one cares)
Regret at what they had done or not been successful in doing...intense regret!
They would be really detached and withdrawn.  and i think tears would be saved for when they are in private.
Absolute despair.
Probably thinking can't do anything right...not even kill themselves.
The family would also be in total shock.  They would feel guilty that they hadn't been there to support their loved one and hadn't realised how bad things were to be able to help and stop the suicidal thoughts.
hope this helps
good luck

Is this any reason to give a friend the silent treatment for a full month?



This happened back in September. I'm trying to make a very long story short:



1. My friend posted a myspace bulletin which said he got a new job at mcdonalds, and he posted the exact location.



2.  Naturally I was thinking he posted the bulletin , which gave the exact location of his employemnt to ALL his friends,  for a reason...because he wants his friends to visit him at mcdonalds.



3. I visited him at mcdonalds to surprise him and say hello.



4. He basically gives me the cold shoulder and ignores me



5. I write an email apologizing for the unnannounced visit



6. He accepts my apology with a two word email: "It's cool."



7. Ten days later when i dont hear from him i send an email saying " i miss you" and i ask "are you mad at me?"



8. He writes back "We cant talk anymore", then blocks me from his myspace , and removes me as a friend.



9. He ignores all my attempts to fix things (email, messages, text, voicemail, calls) for over a full month, a total of 35 days



10.  We're friends again.



11.  He claims the reason he gave me the "silent treatment" was because his new "boyfriend" was going to call the COPS on me for "stalking" him because I visited mcdonalds ( a public restaurant) just ONE time and for only 5 minutes.



11.  It's not stalking if you only see someone ONCE and never do it again. Plus I apologized for the misunderstanding and he accepted my apology.



12.  So it begs the question: Do you think he gave me the REAL reason why he gave me the "silent treatment" for 35 days?

Sounds like your friend is trying to cover for something else, something that more than likely relates to his boyfriend. I would honestly be insulted that a friend considered me a stalker just b/c I visited him at a workplace that he advertised on a public site. If you continue to be friends with him, do so CAREFULLY. If he's not going to say "hey, ______ is an ok guy & wouldn't do this", then obviously you are the only one who is the real friend in this situation. If he tries to bring more drama again, find a new friend.

Well if he has an overprotective boyfriend who gets jealous when you're around, it might explain what caused his reaction. However, he should have told you from day 1 what was going on. So my advice is to let go of him and find an honest friend who will always be honest with you no matter how jealous his boyfriend gets !!

DREAM INTERPRETATION - I was bitten by a large black dog?



In my dream, I was with my husband and we were in this unknown place who belonged to some extended family members(i think?). All of a sudden a large black dog came straight to me and bit my leg and held on to it. I remembered they can smell fear so I was calming myself down, because I believed that if I eliminate my fear he will let go and I didnt dare pull my leg and neither did my husband in case it will rip my flesh so i just lay there face down and my husband was next to me. Then further away was another dog with white and black colors and he was watching me also. After the black dog let go, the colored dog was nice and I dont remember but he either tried to nurse my wound or tried to attack the black dog in revenge.



I am interested to see what you think this dream means.



I think the black dog is some sort of a devil/evil force that is trying to attack my inner wellbeing.



Thank you

Tell someone if you honestly believe he is coming on to you and if you believe his remarks are inappropriate.



However, don't potentially get a good teacher in trouble if he is just trying to be concerned and caring...



Bottom line... if you feel uncomfortable with the way he has been acting toward you... you need to tell someone...



School is suppose to be a safe environment.

I know what you mean. You really want a reason for why it happened and you are saddened because you know that perhaps her life wasn't finished and she had great destiny. It must be so heart wrenching for her family as well. Your tears will soon dry up and you will forget about it altogether. You have an amazing heart and I hope that your compassion touches many lives around you. Just be there for your brother and anyone else in the situation. Maybe you would feel better if you talked to him about it?

How do we feel right before we die?



Everyone will die eventually. No can can run away from it and I see no point of running away from it. (Live your life fully). Anycase.. So, I'm asking you a question about how we feel in the moment just right before we being completely expired. You can go in order, like, suffocated, blackout, headache, dizzy, muscles stiffness, cold, cold from where, getting numbed, ... stuff like that. It's stupid to waste oneself's life. So don't waste your time trying out real experience or telling me to go try for myself neither, because that's a very stupid answer.



JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OR BELIEVE.



</question>



<additional details>



Thank you for the first answer!! And I'd like to hear more about the "physical feeling". Cuz I've thought if I have to suffocate until death in the "moment of truth"... or my mind just go "wooohhh I'm so sleepy now *yawn*" then..I am gone... is it that awesome? or terrible like the first case?

I believe it largely depends on how you lived your life.  I know of a case of someone who was not a very "good" man (to put it mildly), shuddering with panic as he was about to go.  I guess at the end he realized he could have done a lot better.

You cannot rely on anyone else for confidence. It has to come from you! You can make yourself confident, just by believing you are. Who gives a **** what anyone else thinks of you, or if they try to stand in your way. Why should you let them? Life is a lot worse for other people out there than it is for you so be strong and be confident!

They affect me on a day-today-day basis and I would like to be able to control them to some extent (without going to any therapists).



Does somebody have some suggestions or advice?



Note:
I am twenty-one-years-old.

TYPO: I meant *day-to-day not "day-today-day"



I have often worried that I may have bipolar disorder.
I have ADHD and I read that it can sometimes be misdiagnosed, and really be bipolar disorder instead.
Sigh..

Your rapid mood swings sound a bit like bi-polar disease... you should see a doctor... if you cannot afford to go see a doctor you should attend a free clinic or even go to the hospital.



They will asses you and decide what's the matter and why you're having these mood swings and then decide on treatment.



Obviously, I am not a doctor, I do not know your history and can only make a snap judgment.



There's nothing wrong with being bi-polar and many many people have this disorder, including Ben Stiller. They keep it all in check with meds.



Good luck.

Share your fondest memories of your exes.?



I'm talking more about minor details and experiences. For example, I've been broken up from my ex for about 9 months and I'm completely over him. We still talk, and he's moved in with his new girl. But for some reason tonight I started thinking about the time I bought him about 300$ worth of Christmas decorations, including a tree, and spent about 10 hours cleaning and decorating his apartment. When he got home from work, we ordered some Swiss Chalet and watched the Santa Clause Parade. Since he moved out, I got to thinking about the hundeds of memories we have in that tiny, bachelor's apartment and how I'll never step foot in there ever again. Ahh well.

Help - I feel to self-absorbed.?



I've been told that I sometimes focus on the things that aren't important. In other words, I don't see the big picture because I'm too self-absorbed.



I don't even realise I am doing this... because I get so paranoid or frett about work, or what ppl think about me.



What advice would you give me, to snap out of my self-absorption, and/or do, so that I realise I am in that mode?

The only way to overcome feeling lonely is to meet you people.  It sounds obvious but if you join some clubs you will achieve 2 things:



1.  You will be keeping busy so less time to reflect on feeling lonely and depressed.



2.  You will actually start to meet new people, it won't happen straight away but over time friendships/relationships will grow and your circle of friends will grow with it.



Chatting on line won't make you feel any less lonely - in fact it will probably make you feel even more lonely.



Be brave! get out there and join some clubs.

Why does my boyfriend have this fetish?



My boyfriend has a fetish and Im not sure its normal? He gets really turned on by my belly button. I think my belly button is icky, its an innie/outie, but he loves it. One time he wiggled his finger inside and then smelled the gunk on his finger. He also smears chocolate inside all the nooks and crannies and then licks it out. Could this develop into something worse? I think it's kind of gross but cute.
I have a good body, Im thin, and people tell me that Im pretty, so why does he like my belly button so much, I dont understand. Is this something I should worry about?

That is an extremely unusual fixation, I'll give you, although not necessarily bizarre. Try to appreciate his affection for what it is, crazy and sweet, and see if you can let yourself go - after all, what do you really expect it to develop into? It's not a gateway activity to...anything.



If he's not paying enough attention to the rest of you, though - tell him.

On the positive, he's making you aware of something he specifically likes and you have been willing to play along. One of the problems with a fetish like this is that it doesn't create a mutually enjoyable experience. If this is a true fetish, then he gets sexual gratification from this. It's likely the case given how much he is fixated on your belly button.



I really don't know how it could get worse. He doesn't sound like he's prepping you for something more bizarre. It's definitely different, but seems pretty harmless. If his fixation grows into something more bizarre, I think you need to communicate your reluctance and ask him to explain why he does it.

Dear JEN!



From your statement I understand that you do not have any objection for the act your boyfriend does to you. As far as the act he does is possible for the following reason:



1)  You are quite attractive and seductive.
2)  Your belly buton is exposed for muchof the time and therefore he finds the only place below your beautiful face, neck exposed.



It is normal on the part of the boy as he might be getting approval up to belly buttom.and if you allow him below, definetly he will grab the opportunity.



As far as these things are concern, all is ok till both have the mutual consent. I wont like to advice you, only be wise and careful.



Good day.

What is the difference of analytical and critical?



We usually associate these to words and think that they are one and the same, but they're not... Does anyone know the difference?



This was a question asked by our philosophy professor.

Analytical means searching, discerning, scanning, determining something about a subject. If I read your sentence and I am analyitcal about it, I am trying to figure out what you wrote. If I read it and I am critical about it, I am saying, "Hey! You spelled associate wrong!" ( you spelled it right though :P) So to analyze is to observe or look into something, criticizing means to critique, which means to tell how to correct something, to say how something could be better.

To criticise is to judge or discuss the merits and faults.

Is your main language Portuguese? Just a question to you :P You just have to realize that just like sometimes when you do not understand what someone says, you say What? They can do the same thing. Everyone makes mistakes talking, even in their own language. You will be fine your English seems great to me. Just be friendly and do not let anyone get you down. You are very brave and very smart for speaking more than one language! I speak 6 and sometimes I am embarrased to talk to someone in a language that is not english. Like portuguese, I speak it but my portuguese friends speak much faster and I feel like my portuguese is bad. But  I stlil talk, because I love to talk. And the more you talk the easier speaking will be :) Good luck :D &lt;3

Confidence comes with practice. You should go on speaking english with everybody. Read newspapers, novels, magazines to gather more words. Vocabulary is the key of any language. That's all. Try & try is the solution for every problem.

before going on the stage try to imagine that everyone is your friend or ask a friend to sit in the audience and while speaking you can look at your friend. while speaking to a stranger try not looking directly at him and tell your self that s/he is not your enemy and you can practice in front of a mirror.

I understand your question.  You know how to write English.
Your friends don't judge you for making a small mistake when you speak English.



Most native english speakers will notice a mistake as soon as you make it.  They usually won't call attention to it, though.



If you are able to communicate your ideas, most people won't ridicule you for a small mistake in language.



Consider this:  You can speak English, plus another language.  The person you are talking to can speak English, but cannot speak your native language.
If someone were learning your language, you would try to understand them when they spoke with mistakes, right?

Why does it feel like this election...?



Has cast a gray cloud in my life? Now I'm fearful more than ever with like, bad thoughts and having the urge to cry. Is this normal after people attack each other in every election?? It's been like that for a couple days now. Maybe it's this board lol...maybe it's my reverse sleeping schedule(stay up at night, sleep during the day) haha... :/



Please, be nice...has anybody had the same feelings? Thank you :)

I'd say it's because you have fear of the unknown or uncertain.  So many people have blindly put their faith in that a single man or party can save them during these uncertain times.  The fact is nothing will change tomorrow and not for a while after Obama takes office.  Who knows how that change will effect the average Joe or Jane?



This election was like a huge fight, there is definitely a lot of negativity in the air.  There is a hatred between Republicans and Democrats.  This hatred comes to light in every election.  Thanks to the media, you've been spoon fed that negatively for several months.  And now that we've witnessed this hatred, how can we expect our government to work together?  That's why every acceptance speech includes something like, "We have to set our differences aside and work together to make this country great again...blah blah blah."



Yeah, it's normal to feel that gray cloud.  You're just not being foolish to believe that everything's gonna be better over night.  The election is over.  Let's all think positive and continue to work hard.

aw don't worry, my auntie is the same way. you are just a very empathetic person, so other people's experiences touch you more than they might touch others, so you are able to relate more with others and hence end up crying cos you feel their pain or cos you know what theyre going through. It's a good thing if you think about it! But I know, it can be abit embarrassing. All I would suggest is maybe try not to get emotionally involved so much? I dunno, but it's kinda just who you are, and personally I think it shows that you know how to connect with people really well :)

Hehe I know someone else who cries for absolutely no reason, it's funny. (haha he'd kill me if I told)
Crying in the sad parts of a film is normal. Even though it is embarassing. I don't think there is a cure. Crying is a good thing anyway, because it shows that you are human and it releases your emotions to make you feel better inside when you feel sad.



If you feel you are depressed though, I'd suggest seeing your doctor; it could be something rooted from your childhood or a psychological problem. But I doubt you need to worry about that.

Try to compose and help yourself. If you are physically weak, then you may have to consult a professional doctor and take his help. I have seen many aged people than your age still crying for no reason. They get emotional on small pretext and start crying. It is all momentary.



In your case if you have any abnormality and feel that it affects your health, you can consult a qualified doctor. That is better.

Your Question: "Who makes you happy and why?"



ANSWER:



No one makes you happy.  The happiness that you feel is inside of you and it is entirely your choice as to whether you want to feel happy or not.



Yes, you can feel happy with others around you, family , friends and more, but to keep feeling happy, you need to have happiness inside your heart.  That happiness will sustain you when others are busy or not around.  Learn how to be happy under all circumstances.



Everyone, and I do mean everyone, has the ability to be happy under almost any circumstances. You can have the whole world falling apart in front of you and you still have the ability to be happy  because there is always something to be grateful for.  Remember the good things that you have, remember the best parts of life and think good and positive thoughts.  Any of those thoughts can bring happiness in your life.  You have the ability to do it.  But to do it, you need to choose it.



So, choose happiness. Wake up in the morning and decide to be happy --no matter what happens.



Yes, things happen, people die, people get hurt, stuff happens, people lose money, others lose fortunes, some get sick, and some wind up in the hospital, but the difference between those who suffer more and those have some joy in their lives is that those joyful people excercise their happiness muscle.  And that muscle is in your heart.



Think of others, do for others, get the concentration and focus off of yourself.



That is how you can find happiness if you are not happy right now.



Your question sounds as if you are looking for answers on how you can be happy.  Here is how:



Volunteer. Go help someone either officially as a registered volunteer or unofficially by just doing something nice for someone you know or by doing something nice even for a stranger.



See a parking meter expired? Put a quarter in the meter for some stranger.  Smile!



See someone needing help with packages? Help them , but ask first, do not just grab their packages.



Open doors for people.  And this will open doors for you!



Source(s):



My source is the joy inside my heart.  Share your joy. Share your information, your expertise, share your joy, and you too will overflow with happiness. Life is the best source of all experience, emotions, strength, and everything else in between.

How come I get lost in the moment?



Sometimes I get lost in the moment and find it hard to consider my actions, or what I am about to say.  I am 25, is this an age or maturity thing.  I'd like to be more thought-full in some situations.  For example, dealing with a girl I'm in a relationship with - and thinking of her feelings first.  Sometimes I get so lost in what's going on I forget to be happy about the now.  Complex, but what's your thoughts?  Anyone similar?

And you feel like beating your head against the wall because once again you are what you eat and think , you mind and heart is on this .



Many people don't have the power to think about only what is on their hearts .



If you notice someone like obama , He is able to think about what he want to think about , but few people are like that .



Most are like you and me , and we can only think about what ever our heart is consumed with .

You certainly have which really only leaves you with 3 choices 1] Stay that way and whinge about how it's not your fault you were made that way. 2] Get a grip and take control and responsibility of your own destiny 3] Do positive things and be addicted eg  sports, charity work or just plain old fashioned work.

you need to eat healthy, that is very important.

no smoking, drinking, eat veggies, fruits, plenty of water.

and after that you need to learn how to just take life easy. let come what may.

dont stress over things, etc.

try and find people to love, etc.

maybe the reason for your "Addictive" personality is you spend time worrying about losing things, instead of enjoying what you have at the moment and who you are with.

Some psychologist or psychiatrist (pseudo-sciences) made up the term. You really lack self control.

A very bright lady once told me, "You are where you are doing what you want to do. No matter how much you complain or whine about it. If you want to change things enough, you'll find a way to change them." She was absolutely right -- at least as far as I was concerned. Sometimes it might take a little courage to leave our comfort zone. But it can be done.

It's really difficult to quit an addiction, but it is possible and people do it every day.



The main things are that you really have to want to quit, and you have to believe you can.



It helps a lot if there are people in your life who can be supportive and can encourage you when you're tempted to give in and eat/smoke/drink/whatever.

It also helps if you find ways to reward yourself.  For example, if you quit smoking, save the money you would have spent on cigarettes, and every week buy yourself a treat with the money - some CDs, or books or whatever interests you.

Also, a healthy diet and daily exercise make quitting an addiction *much* easier.

Good luck!

Find a good therapist that can help. Therapists usually deal with people who have "adjustment to life" issues and don't really work with people that are mentally ill. They should be able to see how you think, what triggers you have, and recommend some changes you can integrate slowly into your life.



Another thing I would recommend is to find some things that you like that are good for you and keep yourself busy. Having a lot of time or being bored makes it easier to indulge. Get involved in things where you have to be somewhere, or you have to produce something, so that you are occupied and can't easily get out of it if you just don't feel like it. You can even make a mental game of it where you make goals that if you do xyz that is productive and healthy, then you will allow yourself to have a "treat". In the end though, we all fight with urges to do what we want vs. what we have to.



If you're not addicted physically, then it will come down to how badly you want it, what actual (practical) steps you are willing to take to make it happen (not buy something anymore vs. bringing it in the house), steps you are willing to take to find other more productive and healthy things to occupy your time. etc. But be realistic... do you really want to change? If so, you will more likely commit to doing better things and you will get more of a satisfaction out of them. There are many people who say they would like to be different but inside, they know they are really not willing to do anything to disrupt the status quo. You first need to decide if you are serious about it and then start making actual goals.



One thing that will not work is if you do something half-assed by saying "oh I want to do this and that" but you make no plans, no phone calls, contact no people, or you just do a little bit of it, and then when you fail, you will think you're not good at it and lose confidence. Don't attempt it unless you want to actually do the work because then it will drain your belief in yourself. I've done the same with diets where I tried them half-assed and then wanted to think "diets don't work for me" but the truth was that I wasn't sticking to it like I should and it wasn't the diet but my engagement in it. Be honest with yourself and with your efforts.



Also, people in your life are paramount!! Who you surround yourself with is important. Find friends that don't do the crap you don't want to do and hang out with them. In other words, if you don't want to drink, don't go to the bar. Maybe you liked scrabble as a kid... find a scrabble club. Too boring? Something else good you enjoy. Surround yourself with the kind of people and activities that are positive and then the more you live it the more it will become second nature and you will not miss it as much. Unfortunately there isn't one easy way to do it - it takes preparing yourself mentally for the fact that it will be hard, that you will have to do it when you don't feel like it, and that it's up to you and nobody else (you can't blame others). Taking responsibility is very important in order to conquer something.

Being from another country where strict discipline was practiced in school and at home, I am very taken aback with the permissive American attitude in schools and in parenting. There is little power coming from adults to try to shape kids to have self discipline and self regulating abilities. Excess is everywhere (look at the ice cream cones!) and marketing targets kids specifically and parents rarely set strict boundries... I see many kids today growing up without a lot of self discipline, goal setting, time manatement skills, etc. Sometimes they seem unprepared for the temptations of the world (first credit cards marketed to college kids) and the ability to delay gratification. Not saying anything has happened to you, just saying it's not necessarily an addictive personality - I see many people with problems like this where proper structure and discipline wasn't taught early on and then people struggle. Good luck and if you have kids don't hesitate to be FIRM with them. You have the power and it's up to you to help your kids develop a sense of balance and the ability to say no to fun until the work is done. Don't give in because they cry or complain or raise a fuss. The more you stick firm by the rules you make the more your kids will learn how to set firm boundries and stick to them, even when it's hard. But the younger that's learned, the better, because then these skills can be used earlier (college, etc.) and lead to success more than failure.

Good luck!

I would say if you have had some bad experiences with relationships in the past you may not be able to fully embrace the prospect of being with someone new in fear that it will end badly and you will be hurt, not to mention relationships aren't all sunshine and roses, it takes work and you may be dreading the hard times to come. You just have to keep in mind that it is always worth it to try a relationship with someone you care about and who cares about you. You never know, it could be that "one special person" you've been looking for!

How can I get my boyfriend to understand my Social Anxiety?



I have been with my boyfriend for 6 years and he has always known that I have a 'shy personality' but he doesn't realise the extent of my social anxiety... i can cover it pretty well but it makes me come across as hard and uncaring when I can't talk with his friends at social gatherings because of my anxiety.  He finds it so easy to chat to people that he can't understand why I find it so hard to socialise and he thinks I'm lazy and can't be bothered.  He leaves me alone at parties to talk to other people but I freeze and don't know what to say.



I tried to explain social anxiety with him yesterday but he just said that if I can't overcome it then maybe he is the wrong person to be with.  He just doesn't understand that it is not that easy and I want to be more outgoing and make friends.  SA is like a huge barrier I cannot overcome alone.  He has always been confident and outgoing and really can't understand the anxiety I go through when talking to people... how can I make him understand it when he's never experienced it?

We have another party to go to on Friday and I've said I'll do everything I can to try and be more outgoing at this party but I'm so worried about it... if I freeze up again I think he will leave me.

Do you have any advice?

Im sorry to hear of your issue with anxiety. If you have sat down and explained your condition to him then it sounds as though he doesnt want to understand.  If this is the case then you should re-evaluate if he's worth sticking with.  If he doesnt sympathise/understand your concerns with socialising after 6 years, then it doesnt seem he will change now.  Ask him to be more patient and try to understand that not everyone has confidence.  If he doesnt change, show him the door, you deserve better.
Hope things improve for you.

If he leaves you over that, then he isn't the right person for you. I know that's hard to hear, but it's the truth. I would describe with him the physical symptoms that you experience. Compare it with something he really hates to do. Have him imagine feeling the tense symptoms along with the irritation he experiences when he does his pet peeve. 
You could also tell him you are willing to work on it, but he has to work with you. That he can't just leave you hanging on your own, if you start with a few friends at your place so you are comfortable, have him lead the conversation within the whole room, focusing on things where you can chip in so that it will be easier.

aww poor thing. First of all this is a long term, ongoing relatonship. i suggest that you should try and talk to him again and make sure he listens, with tv off and no distractions. you have already sat him down and explained to him how you feel. if he isnt going to listen and accept you, then there is something wrong. he needs to listen, help you and work together to overcome this social anxiety. it takes time to overcome this and can't (i dont think) be resolved overnight. you have to tell him that you can't be pushed with this sort of thing, tell him he needs to be patient. the least he could do is support you, and be with you when either you or him are talking to people and not leave you by yourself. you should slowly let him go so he can talk to other people and gradually you'll gain the confidence to talk to people by yourself. as i said it takes a lot of time and work to overcome this, he needs to support you every step of the way and im sure wants to, but just doesnt know what to do. talk to him more and work out a plan as a TEAM that will help you gradually over come social anxiety. 
all the best with friday and the future. x

They say never answer a question with another question, but How can I get you to realize that you feed your social anxiety, in turn it becomes stronger thus making you less social? Wow thats a tough nut to crack. I am not refuting that Social Anxiety has its implications, but they say admitting the problem is the first step to solving it. So we can try that or I can tell you not admitting a problem is the first step to not creating the problem, ya get me? Anxieties and phobias are perpetuated by acknowledging they exist. Once they exist we feed them until they go from a minor problem, and then they become counselor worthy, so here is your therapy.

In an Anxious state of mind you have a reduced sense of self, reduced sense of control. Understanding your limitations is the first step in the journey. For example if you know you can't outright talk to a group of people, then why try. One has to walk before he/she can run. You are your worst enemy when it comes to expectations, your demands are worst than his, why? Because people create their own anxieties, sorry my dear, you react differently and you create the anxiety, tough truth.
So let me be raw, stop using your social anxiety as an excuse, its a crutch, you have tried and failed and now you'd rather hide behind something than bear the burden of taking chances socially. Look at it this way, I can be anxious about having a small penis, and I can tell myself that any girl who sees it will think its small, but if I think like that how am i ever going to get some action? Crude I know, but it should make it clear that anxiety holds you back from obtaining what one desires, in the above case its sexual interaction, in your case its friendships. I know you understand this, but do you really? Understanding is something that emmanates change, when you understand you are not the same person. Your boyfriend doesn't have the social anxiety because he understands something you don't. You want to get what he has. Its cute that you think you can't do it alone, but you alone are making yourself incapable. Now that I bashed ya a bit, lets look at some solutions

Your bf is your social side, where he goes you need to go. In the beginning listen to others, don't worry about speaking. You need to know who your talking to, what they like, what they don't like. I know when you walk in and start speaking without knowing anyone you seem kinda in your own world. Its almost the opposite of social anxiety in some regard. When someone says something reply with a quick remark if you feel you would like to contribute input. The intentions is not about what you say, its about showing the person you are listening to what they say. We are given two ears and one mouth so that we may listen twice as much as we speak. Being social is not all about talking. In your case being scene is the jumping point. Your goal is to not be left alone, your bf is not helping in that scenario, so explain to him you want to be escorted. Really when I am with my gf, I am her escort, my eyes are on her, if she needs me I am there or she is close. The party is secondary, gf is primary.
Secondly, at a party, everyone notices you, but no one sees you if that makes sense. If your anxiety stems from personal insecurity, trust me they don't see it. Its like a game of Poker, you bluff, someone calls your bluff, you wait for the next hand. Thats an idea, get your bf to organize a card game, something to occupy your mind while you listen to others. I worry about you doing this by friday, but I know the more exposure you get the greater your strength, so long as you don't hide in yourself. Heck if you feel insecure, get an elastic around your wrist and when your in too deep, whack yourself, your goal is not to be driven by your anxiety, only to drive your anxiety out. 
Lastly, if he leaves ya for not being social, your not losing much. You can't spend your life worrying, thats no life at all.

He has decided after 6 years that it is perhaps time to move on?  Perhaps you are better off without him if he does not understand or has not tried to understand.  Have you explained it to him only through your perspective or is he aware that you are not just different than he is or strange or imperfect but there are millions who suffer from this and studies have recently pegged social anxiety disorder as the third largest psychological disorder in the country.  Perhaps doing some research on the Internet and providing him with good sites that provide educational information would help him understand better.  On the other hand, have you just accepted this and decided just to learn to live with it or are you actively seeking therapy in an effort to better deal with it.  Please read at this site and get some help even if your boyfriend decides he does not want to deal or understand this better.  At least you can move forward in an effort to get a better handle on things for a better future for yourself.

Yes, especially in my job as a police officer.  I have suspects run, look at me wrong, etc. and cannot hold back the urge to wear my heart on my sleeve and say what I think.

It can get me in trouble potentially, but in the long run, I think it helps me more than it can hurt me, and most importantly, more than it can hurt others.

I self harmed a year ago and I'm 16 now so I know what your going through. I found it best to write a diary or call my friends every time I was really pissed off/upset and wanted to harm myself. I stopped gradually because my feelings werent as bottled up and I'd advise you to do the same...Dont let the bullies win either, your a way stronger person them them and causing yourself pain would be giving them what they wanted.
Go check out websites about it or contact me I'd be happy to help xx Good luck

Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. 
Please do not hurt yourself. You are worth way more than you give yourself credit for. And there is help available. Start with your counselors at school, clergyman or trusted teacher. You have people who care. Even us strangers on Yahoo Answers! God be with you.

Suicide is never an option, if you kill or hurt yourself because of others you are giving them all the power in your life. You need to find your own happiness within, don't worry and think so much about others. If you are a happy, confident person others will see that and want to be your friend. Find a better outlet for your anger and frustration, like a sport, music, poetry, etc. Please don't ever think that suicide is an option to end the hurting and pain. YOU are worth more than that!!

no. this is no way to go about.
you are giving the bullies more satisfaction by hurting yourself. you dont deserve to go through this much pain, why do it. 
you'll only make things worst for yourself. you need to take control of your life NOW.
get some help, and tell yourself no one is allowed to do such things to anyone, not even you.
theres no shame in asking for help, it takes guts and courage.
dont waste the best years of your life cause of cowards who bully you.

My daughter went through a period where she was describing feeling a lot like you're feeling.  Now, less than 5 years later, she's in a relationship with someone special, and all the pain and heartache of high school has been forgotten.  That's how the world works: we suffer for years in school and then everything changes when we graduate.

Have you talked with a counselor about your feelings?  If not, you need to right away.  Tell your parents, too, if you can.  They may not understand what you're going through, but I'm sure they'll try their best to help you get through this tough time.

suicide is not the answer. most people tell you to get help. yes that is true you should go to a doctor, but what you need to do first is realize that people not talking to you means that they MAY BE WORRIED about you, but they dont want to approach you for fear that they might be injured. If you think that talking to your parents about feeling suicidal is hard, would you rather have to tell them you are pregnant??? your parents can get you the help that you need. and stop hurting yourself. its not worth it. i get bullied all the time. either ignore it or look up some good comebacks for when they say something too you

Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.

Life isn't what you're going through now.  Being a teenager is the price you pay for being an adult later.  It'll get better. If you suicide, you'll miss what you've put up with all of the crap for.  The ability to make your own decisions about who you keep company with and where.

My dog is the same way.  He absolutely refuses to eat until everyone has left the room.  Of course, he's a dog and doesn't have any friends to hang out with at the mall food court or go out to dinner on a date.  Just order something that is neat and easy to eat.  Remember most people are more concerned with what and how they are eating than to pay much attention to you.

I had a similar problem and it turned out to be how I was brought up. When it came to meal times you were scared stiff of doing the wrong thing for fear of the reprecussions. You never spoke and to eat with your mouth open was a fate worse than death and to leave food, well need I say more.

I'm like that too actually, exactly what you described it as. It doesn't sound crazy and it's not at all weird. I'm not fat either, yet I share your problem. Maybe you should think about why you feel uncomfortable eating in front of him? You don't want him to think you're a big eater? Perhaps you're so in awe of him that you simply can't eat just because of that.



I'm one of those people who can't eat unless people around me are eating, is that same for you as well? I tend to think I'm making them hungry. My advice is just relax a little bit, if people around you or your crush is eating you should definitely feel free to eat too. If they're/he's not eating, then try to eat slowly and if you're in conversation, pay them more attention than to your food.

:O OMG I KNOW! Lol i think its because girls are always pressured into using there manners and you know.. whiping your face, eating spaggeti with a fork and spoon... so we are always paranoid of looking stupid and people judging us and saying that we have horrible table manners! I know i used to be horrible like id go to subway with my friends and not eat my sub there... id save it for later because subs were so messy! Truly though you just have to think that no matter how awsome someones manners are... everyone gets stuff on thier face... and everyone eats different. :)
Good Luck!

The electrical signals that allow us to store memories in our brains can take a number of different routes to arrive at their final destination. If a 'memory' in the form of an electrical signal takes a couple of different routes at the same time, it is possible that if one route is longer than the other, it arrives in the memory part of your brain only to find that the same memory has already arrived by a shorter route. This would make you think that you had already experienced the event on a previous occasion. A bit like hearing an echo when a sound wave has been reflected via different paths.
Thats my theory, and I'm happy with it.

I have to say that is actually a good answer, except I wouldn't call it a "memory",but rather things we are currently experiencing en route to the memory storage area via two paths.  Overall - this answer does make sense if you really think about it.  Kudos to Philbomoog and the Editorial Team.

I don't buy that theory interesting as it is.  If your brain were to short-circuit in such a fashion you would certainly experience deja vu a lot more frequently than you do.

I still believe it's kind of like experiencing the same exact thing again...a feeling or emotion...nothing more.

Deja vu came about because of the idea that all of us have past lives. Like the people in our lives now are the same people who were in our past lives. This theory emphasizes that these people will be in our lives again and again because we have some issues to resolve with them.

Deja vu could be attributed to premonitions in ones dreams. I often have vivid dreams, but forget about them almost the instant I wake up - most people are like this. If we did what some psychologists advise and put a pen and pad by the bed to jot them down, we would notice some interesting premonitions which may not be 100% correct coming to light.



I had 2 scary premonition dreams, I know the majority of you won't believe this, but I have my wife to vouch for me, and I honestly don't care if I'm believed or not. I woke up on the morning of the London tube bombings with a fright, as if waking up from a nightmare. When my wife asked me what was wrong, apparently I replied: "London is burning..." before rolling over and sleeping a bit longer. I remembered nothing until my wife brought it up. I was also 3 tube stops away from the Edgware road bomb when that bomb exploded.

Other theories are attributed to so-called parallel universes colliding at that one particular instant, where you feel as if you've done this before, and perhaps you may have, in another existence, or perhaps in a different time.

my theory is that when we have deja vu it is a way of letting us know that our lives are on track and we are where we are supposed to be at that moment in life.  i once had deja vu backwards and it scared the heck out of me.  i was driving down a road and had deja vu but i was supposed to be driving in the ther direction in the vision.  it was really unnerving and i didnt experience deja vu for years afterward.  it finally came again and it was right so hopefully i have my life back on track (lol).

I was just about to ask if you're the real deal.... My theory on deja vu is this, there are many things that are mysteries to us in this world, such as why we're really here & death... So in a sence, I think its possible, we may have had a previous life right here on earth, & the memory of that has been erased, so that we can live this new life without being concious of past feelings & experiences, for whatever reason, maybe a second chance to see if we would make different choices. I think our dreams are made up of that past life as well, thus the strange feeling of familiarity at times when you go somewhere or meet someone new. By the way I love you & the work that you've done..... I hope I meet you someday.... Best of Luck with the movie & your future endevours!

I don't believe in past lives, but I do believe in an earlier childhood life that is largely forgotten. Sometimes there is something in our current experience that tickles, or is in harmony with, one of these earlier forgotten memories so that we feel like the new experience is one that we can almost remember when it is the earlier one that we can almost remember.

There are of course other theories, but you asked for mine. I have seen the trailers for your movie, and it is definitely one that I plan to "vu".

My pet hypothesis on deja vu is that it is a filing malfunction in the brain.
I will try to elucidate.
Ordinarily perception is stored in short-term memory, and only through conscious effort, repetition or emotional significance is it committed to long-term memory.

In deja vu (so my theory goes), perception is simultaneously stored in short-term and a random area of long-term memory.

Long-term memory carries with it some temporal information, i.e. it has a TIME associated with it.  For example I remember having a car accident a few years ago.

When your immediate perception is filed in a random area of long-term memory, it has a random time association.  The result is:  "Hey, I remember this".
In fact you are perceiving it for the first time, but because of the filing malfunction you have a long-term memory of it and hence you "remember" it.

This is all simply conjecture.  I have no empirical evidence to qualify it.

Cheers.

Our brain is constantly cross referencing incoming information with stored information in order to help us make rational decisions that in essence help us survive.

My theory is that deja vu is our sub-conscious nudging the conscious, saying we've done/seen something very similar to this before. I don't necessarily think that it's the same thing/person but a bit like a fingerprint analysis, a 3 or say 5 point match on the basics throws up a hit-even if it's not 100% accurate with further thought.

Take people for example, realistically we see hundreds of people a day and of those hundreds we consciously 'see' only a very small proportion of those faces. Is it really any surprise that at some point we run into someone on a more one-to-one basis that we've walked right past, or not noticed on the television days, months maybe even years before?

I don't think so.

I'm certainly not dismissing the afterlife and all it's associated possibilities but I think for the more mundane day to day deja vu that we all experience that my theory pretty much covers it, psychic experiences and paranormal activity, in my humble opinion fall under a different heading altogether.

Hi Denzel,

I believe that déjà vu is Gods way of telling us things to our subconscious.  For example may have had a dream about someone or some events (no matter how minor they may seem),  but have no memory of it once we've woken up.  When we are live the moment,  or we meet that person in the real world,  that is when we remember everything from that dream.  I hope I have explained my theory well.

at home or in a familiar place when you have deja vu, you may have dreamt of the of situation , because these places and people are so familiar, it probably has happened before, but as for unfamiliar places and people its probably because you have been there or met them before, past life regression has begun to show that deja vu could be a past life memory deep within the subconsious, and who is to say this isnt true.

Hi Denz

My opinion is time is more  fluid than we currently believe.  We are all used to the current that we are all sharing at the moment but i believe that time as a concept is more like the ocean with tides that move both in an out.  These tides may take a lot longer than we can have perespective on.  So if time is not linear and instead ebbs and flows then perhaps all time has occured before and will occur again.



so perhaps deja vu could be the wet sands left on the beach when the tide of time ebbs away from the shore

I think it has to do with being tired.  The brain is a very complicated organ and we do not know a lot about it.  Many people have experienced supra natural cases including me but, whereas it is called spiritualism by spiritualists, at the same time, it is considered suggestion by psychologists, therapists, etc.  So there is a proof from medial staff we still do not know a lot about our physical experiences caused by our brain capacity.

I believe people  use only 34% of their brain's capacity on a daily basis. Deja vu is probably a sudden case of psychic ability for a short amount of time, therefore, making you believe that you had performed the action before you had actually done it. It's just that you had seen yourself do it a split second before you had actually done it!

Deja vu means you're on the right path - it's your intuition telling you that you are following your destiny as it has been laid out for you.  We choose to follow whatever path we want, but deja vu is how we recognise that we are following a pre-ordained path.

Or like me I think of someone and start to write them a text and before I am able to finish it they have called me..... Weird
Or you could be talking about something quite unusual and the telly is on and that same unuasual topic is then mentioned on the telly...... Spooky anyway you can see paterns in the way things happen you know like good things come along in threes as do bad things.....

Hi Denzel! Dejá vu is only a sensation of a face or place you 
have seen before and the similarity, of the present scene or
face brings back a long forgotten image to your memory. The
unusual experience is so stunning that you believe you have 
seen it before. Keep your movies going, I do not miss any of
them. Great acting, and I wish you all the happiness that life
can afford you.

Have you ever been so involved with a task that you have lost track of time? Have you ever driven from one place to another and arrived safely, but not remembered the journey? Have you ever read a book and become so involved with the plot you can see scenery and hear characters speak? Have you ever day-dreamed? These are everyday examples of an altered state of awareness. Hypnosis is another example of an altered state of awareness-one which can be used for self help. It is a perfectly natural state which occurs between being fully awake and fully asleep. In the clinical setting hypnosis is usually accompanied by a pleasant state of physical relaxation which in itself is beneficial, especially in the symptoms induced by or aggravated by stress. The term Hypnotherapy means the use of hypnosis for the treatment and relief of a variety of somatic and psychological symptoms

No, it doesn't work like that.

Think of daydreaming. Now suppose instead of just random thoughts while daydreaming you could direct your mind to thinking specifically positive thoughts. You have now hypnotised yourself.

Some people have the ability to get someone else into a relaxed state of daydreaming and then present positive suggestions to them

I don't believe so. Hypnosis for me allowed me to receive someone's
suggestions, but I was never re-programmed. It's said that hypnosis can't make you do anything you don't want to do. I don't even consider it a semi-conscious state. I was always fully conscious. If you are considering hypnosis, talk to a doctor. You can be sure you will not be "programmed" by anyone. Hypnosis is not brain-washing.

Hypnosis kind of works this way.

You give somebody permission to tell you what's real and what's not. Then they tell you how your should react to this imposed reality.

For example, theoretically nobody could tell you to jump off a cliff to your death. However, they could convince you that it's not a cliff, but a short step down. You would have no problem stepping down that short step... and you kill yourself.

No all hypnosis does is speak to the unconscious mind whilst you are very relaxed. This can influence behaviour but not to the extent that you would do something against your better interests. We access this very relaxed and receptive state spontaneously anyway throughout the day when very absorbed or very relaxed. How receptive we are varies from person to person and how willing to change our behaviour we are in the first place.

You have four levels of consciousness,  beta, alpha, theta, delta(alseep).  Your conscious mind (beta) does the creating and thinking. Your sub-conscious (alpha  or theta) controls behavior and does not create at all - it just listens...think of it as the "driver" in a computer.  It is from this level that you react and feel, not think.

I have been hypnotized several times and of course nobody can control your mind. Hypnosis  is that few seconds right before you doze off (Delta is fully asleep).  If you are dozing off and somebody says, "take all your clothes off," would you do it?  Of course not. You would wake up.

The reason to lower your level of consciousness is to get to a stage that communicates with the "driver" because that is the part that controls behavior.  You are bypassing the thinking/creating part of your mind ( beta, the conscious mind) and going right to alpha to make a suggestion.



You are always in control...you allow yourself to stay in that drowsy state. You remember everything. TV hypnosis is a big joke. That stuff is NOT real.

It's hard to say because no one really knows what hypnosis actually is. Even hypnotists like Derren Brown would admit that.

My belief is that you obviously have you conscious mind and your subconscious mind. Your conscious mind is you and your subconscious mind is like that of a child. All you do in hypnosis is distract the conscious mind so that you can 'talk' to the subconscious mind.

For example a hypnotist will often use double negatives or phrases that don't quite make sense. While your conscious mind is trying to work out what's just being said, your subconscious mind will be taking in the information that's said after the distraction.



It mainly works on the principle that in some way or another, some people (not everyones succeptible to hypnosis) actually want to be hypnotised. Or at least their subconscious mind does.The reasons for this differ between people. Someone who's outgoing might like 'taking stage', even if they are just running around like a chicken. Or perhaps a successful business man that - for once - would like to be told what to do as it negates all responsibility.



As well as this, people are often hypnotised to believe completely illogical things, like someone or something is invisible or that they've been turned into a bee. So in many ways, yes I think it does return your thinking to that of a child.

Your question is vague, but I'll give it my best.
This seems to be a question about learning- specifically how to teach someone to stop an undesired behavior, rather than continue the behavior and try to avoid punishment.
The simplest answer is to changing any bad behavior, is to correct the bad behavior, and REWARD THE GOOD.  A lot of people forget this second part, although it is actually easier to do correctly.
As an example, imagine that there is a child who talks in class.  Punishing them whenever they talk is easy (i.e. scold them), but how do you reward them when they don't?  When they behave properly?
In order to teach a new behavior, it takes an effort on the part of the teacher (or another class member) to reward them- probably by complimenting them on paying attention ("reward" is different from "bribe" because it is not a commercial exchange, "if you do this, you get this" but rather is a positive acknowledgment of proper behavior).  You want the award to be something intrinsic (coming from within) that makes them feel good about acting this way, such as a compliment and not a piece of candy or something which almost turns it into a commercial exchange.
Secondly you must correct bad behavior, which is VERY difficult to do right.  The easy (and wrong) way might be to tell the child to sit in the corner and think about what they did wrong.  But what child would actually THINK about what they did wrong when in time out?  There is a similar problem with almost any punishment, such as spanking.  When you spank a child, they are not thinking about what they did wrong, or learning that it was wrong, they are learning to fear and hate you.  A spanking is only a way to satiate your own anger.
To correct the behavior is difficult, because it is often difficult to address it without emotion (especially without anger or frustration).  The emphasis is not on punishing the child for doing something wrong- the emphasis is that the child has done something wrong and it must be corrected- just as if they were to get a math problem wrong.

The important point is that if someone continues an undesired behavior, it is because they never learned that is was wrong.  You need to teach them, like you would teach them a math lesson in school.  That means praise them when they get it right (or when they cease the behavior) and instruct them when they are wrong.
It's harder than you think.

I think that to find your answer it would be wise to read a book about toddlers.  Most will agree that immediate gratification for good deeds improves an already 'good' child and for the unruly child immediate consequences.

So if someone does something bad, he should be punished ASAP.  Something of importance should be taken away.

punishment is not therapy - when people have done something so bad or are deemed be incurable, such as peodophiles, then people want punishment, not therapy.

However if you take young criminals who are embarking down the road to crime I think that these would benefit from confidence building therapy.  A group of prisoners were given the task of helping disabled youngsters swim once a week.  This worked wonders, they felt that they were doing something really useful, it made them feel really good about themselves especially for people far less fortunate than themselves, it made a lot of them really want to change.

I think seeing life from a different perspective, working with people less fortunate can be good therapy.  Being made to feel humble is good, but also what is needed is the tools to make changes as well, such as education and job prospects.



When my hubby was younger and was going down the "wrong" road - he joined the army, the physical training and self discipline required was the making of him and completely turned his life around.

Depends on the crime or wrong doing, and the person's state of mind.
Some people can learn by having to do things that they normally wouldn't do, like community service. Some can learn from having things that they love in their every day life taken away from them. Some can learn by seeing what their actions have caused other people and try and put themselves in that situation ( I guess that would be therapy).
It really does depend on the person and their mindset to determine  which is the best way to get them to behave differently. But if it is ignored or they aren't reprimanded in some way, chances are that they will continue their behavior, when an act of some type of punishment could change that person for the better.

Explain to them what they did that hurt you. Ask them to respond. Then forgive the person and move on.It's up to you whether or not you want to continue the friendship, though. Just don't leave with a grudge.  Feelings like hurt and anger are the initial knee-jerk response, but taking it to the point of trying to hurt the other person back is something you do have control over.

Making someone feel bad does not equal to benefiting the person.  Once you cross a certain threshold, a person would rather rebel than correcting his mistake.

The best method therefore is to explain things to him in line with 'values' that he can understand.

Did you guys see "Cider House Rules"? Teenage girl raped regularly by her father, got pregnant, got an abortion, then ended up killing her father.

Strange yahoo answers anomaly ?



hello,

I was wondering why, when I ask serious questions on yahoo answers - I get blown off with only 1 or 2 flakey answers? These normally consist of 2 words at best. Sometimes, all I've got in response are single spam links.



Alternatively, If I ask a totally daft question, I get at least 30 responses ... some people sat there typing up 300 word essays, along with complete in-depth analysis 'of the question', as well as an additional character profile included for good measure. I’ve experienced this a total of 15 times under 3 different accounts.

Can anyone explain this mysterious yahoo answers anomaly please ?

Perhaps the "serious" questions are more difficult for people to understand, or require more thought or consideration than someone has the time to give.  The "daft" question perhaps amuse or strike a chord with more people, so they're quicker to respond or people find them easy to answer.  It probably depends on which forum your asking in, as well, and what the "culture" of that forum is.  Just a guess. . .

it happens to me too - Often people attack me without reading the question. I guess its like real life people give what they need to dump rather than responding to what is in front of them.



I have wondered sometimes if it has anything to do with the time that I post. Very early morning (6a.m GMT) seems to get better attention spans than early evening. But I cant say that from an informed place only my feeling.

I don't think it is just you.  I think that there are a lot of crazy people out there.  It depends on where you go.  On the bus, you will encounter a lot of weirdos.  On chatlines, you also will get a lot of weirdies.  Sit at the front of the bus.  Most odd folk sit at the back, and ignore the weird people that want to chat with you.

Opinion on this type of memory? Open minded people only, please.?



It's very strange, but this is a weird way of putting it...



Lets say my memory is two boxes. My front box is what i am thinking about directly. The back is what's wandering around the back of my mind, not concentrating on it. I remember things best if both have the same thing, but i'm a little distracted.

With dreams, whatever is in the back box is what i will dream about... if it's also in my front box, i can control the dream; a lucid dream, where you know you know you not in reality.
Thing is, i have a lot of nightmares where i am conscious of the lack of reality, but no matter how much i shout at myself to wake up, i FEEL pain in my dream, but i can also feel my warm bed.  Anyway, back to the memory topic, because they ARE related.

How's this: i went on holiday when i was 6 years old (i am now 14) stood up on a stage, and i can now remember exactly where i was sitting, the pattern of the chairs, lighting, people, and the face, location and name of every person who got introduced on stage (children in a competition). I can remember my entry number, what i said, and how i danced. But other times, NOW i can pick something up, memorise a page, put it down for 5 minutes and completely forget where i put it. I can look at a phone number, 11 digits, and most of the time remember it after 20 seconds. But other times i can write something over and over again and it just doesn't stick... say i'm doing a maths formula, and the teacher writes some problems on the board for homework, expecting us to memorise the formula. I can remember all of the 20 questions, but i can't remember the actual formula.

Does anyone else have this type of memory? It scares me sometimes. Open minded people only please, no abuse because i only want advice...  No i am not insane, i'm perfectly fine, and open about the paranormal ^_^

I thought I was crazy.
Seirously, that's pretty much defines my brain.
I always have that problem.
I actually had a dream that I got shot, and I woke up screaming. And forced my parents to take me to the hospital, because I had this strong pain in my chest and it felt like I was shot. But the nurse said nothing was wrong.
Weird, isn't it?

And the whole question thing happens to me too.
And you seirously have no idea how happy I am that you posted this question. Because I thought I was crazy, up until you poseted on Y!A, this .

You're right, you're not insane. I think you should talk to your doctor about this because he may know something about this. Do you ever kind of daydream but then when you try to daydream you can't? That happens to me. I am a tiny bit paranoid but mostly because I have read many scary stories and seen scary things and now I see things. I really think you should talk to your doctor about this. Just consider it. Thanks for taking the time to read this! Hope I helped!

That sounds like the same kind of memory everyone else has, we all remember some things and then forget others. I believe it depends on the kinds of distractions that you are experiencing that makes you forget certain things. I think you are normal in memory.

This one dream I had, I was in China, and everybody starts running like crazy, so I tried to to call my husband, but I couldn't put the numbers down on the phone. I knew the number, but my fingers wouldn't let me dial it the way I wanted to. I woke up punched my husband in the back of the head and went back to sleep. I was MAD.

and this other dream I had got an office job sat in my chair, I was spinning around and couldn't stop spinning, I woke up sick.

and my stair dream, I would fall down stairs,and my husband said i was shaking. and i always pull a muscle

I have just completed a psychology course and can tell you one thing, when it comes to the mind, memory and dreaming there are more theories and viewpoints as to their nature than would be possible to list here! Some would say that your feeling of a two-part memory is normal and healthy according to their theory whilst others would not. However, despite what they may or may not think, your own mind certainly shouldn't scare you! It is an incredible thing. For example, your description of your holiday sounds like a 'photographic' memory. Many people report being able to remember highly detailed and vivid memories of past events. Were you perhaps very excited or very nervous at the prospect of this competition? Some psychologists argue that high levels of emotion when in a certain situation leads to a stronger memory of it. Others would say something different. In other words nobody can seem to agree on what exactly memory is or how it works and this is the same for dreaming, so try not to worry, you sound perfectly normal to me : )

It scares me how lucid you are for a fourteen year old, but to answer your question, it seems that you are fixating too much on these things and you need to try and relax. 
In addition I would suggest that you are too young to get involved with lucid dreaming( the "in" name for astral projection) as this has its dangers.
Good luck.

That was a very interesting way to explain it. Very good!

This is my thoughts on this. We have certain memories like childhood memories that may stick with us for ever. I'm am 46 and can remember some things from childhood as if they happen yesterday. One of my sisters that I talked to about an event remembers nothing. She was right next to me the whole time. Other events she will bring up I have no recollection of the event.

About the dreams, sometimes I have dreams like that, I'm awake but dreaming. That's the only way I can explain it. It usually happens when I'm real tired and over stressed.

I really don't think you have anything to worry about. Some subjects in school maybe tougher then others or maybe your work load is to much. So relax you'll get the hang of it.

Take care and don't give up!

I cannot comment on your dreams because I know nothing about the subject.
What I can tell you is you have a short term memory and a long term memory. The short term memory is smaller than the long term and so it can actually fill to capacity if you are studying intensely over a period of time and that's when putting a book down and forgetting where you put it happens. The long term memory is not as chaotic and only stores things of long term importance, hence you can remember all those when you was 6 years old.
There is nothing abnormal with what you say, the majority of people experience it, some learn to cope with it, some don't even know it's happening and others know they can remember things from long ago but struggle with things they have learnt recently.
I hope this helps with, at least part of your question.

Well, I am considerably older than you (53) but I think my memory works like yours does.  My family and friends are astounded at how clearly I can remember the most intimate details of my childhood (I can remember my grandmother holding me as an infant - I remember the feel of her skin, the sound of her voice, her scent, and what it felt like to be held by her) but I can't find my keys; I forget what I said to people yesterday, I have trouble putting events in sequence when they happened only weeks or months ago.



My biggest problem is that my dreams are so lucid and detailed, that sometimes I have trouble differentiating between dreams and reality - "Wait - did this happen or did I dream it? "  and I just don' t know the answer.



And yes, like you, there are some details like number sequences or specific things that I will remember forever and ever, and other, seemingly similar things, that I can write down again and again and not know.  I can rememer everyone's cell phone number in my family except my son's - what's that about?



I have no answer except to say that you are not alone, and you are (hopefully) not insane.  Everyone is different - you are who you are and you remember what you remember.



A very wise man once said (and I'm paraphrasing here), "When you fear that you are alone and insane, the discovery of a mind that thinks like yours is nothing short of a blessed event".



I hope I have helped you.

Are my friends right was I raped?



I was drunk and my friend pressured me into sex and took advantage of me. I consented but he was really forceful and rough and when I told him to stop he didn't and just moved me into a different position.

I know he did wrong but I told my friends that I consented but all of them (male and female) are saying that it was rape.

Also I bleed badly afterwards and went into denial about everything. I drank and partied to block it all out

I don't know how the law translates the little details of your story . personally i don't think the bleeding in your case is a sign of rape . there is always first time . the girl always bleeds the first time she has sex because in the first time ; your virginity is torn . another thing is that if your period was going to happen in the same day . the sex may make it come faster and if you had sex before your virginity may didn't go fully the first time , so in your latest experience you may have felt bigger pain and seen more bleeding than before . I understood that you told him to stop but he didn't after you consented all the way . when was that ? was it when he was already having sex and you didn't like the pain ? 
i think there is too much ignorance here . you were a virgin and you wanted to have your first sex with this guy or boy . you thought as friends told you that enjoyment will not let you feel the pain . boys know that they should be careful if it is the first time for the girl . they should arouse the girl until she is really exited . and then he has to make the first pushes very slow , then retreats and then restarts going deeper every time . and when she feels the pain he has to see if it is ok to go on or is it very painful that he has to stop .
it takes too much carriage from the boy to stop at this point because he is very excited . another thing ; you were both drunk , and if he is totally drunk , then what happened was natural .

If he didn't stop when you asked him to and he was forceful then, it is possible that it could be considered rape.

There was a movie like this on lifetime but the girl consented out of want but then said no when the boy said that he did not want her anymore, so that was not really rape.

In your case I would say it was rape.

Well this is quite simple,RAPE !!!!,,if you have sex under any circumstances but you own free will it's rape,consenting out of fear isn't consent.

Quit the drinking and partying to block it out,easy said but the best thing you can do is accept it happened and let it go,(i'm talking personally,emotionally)

As for him,get the piece of filth charged if you can,seek legal advice rather then let it pass,he'll certainly do it to someone else !!!

I'm glad you wrote this...



The exact same thing happened to me... only it was somebody that I worked with who I didn't know long...

I was 18 and REALLY naive for my age cause I came from an abusive past... I didn't know any better when this guy called me in the middle of the night to talk and then told me that he was having a party and that my friend who we both worked with would be there...

He told me to meet him somewhere and he would pick me up (since it wasn't in the same city where I lived)... I went in spite of my older sister telling me not to go that it didn't sound right... I didn't listen...

When I got to his place there was no one there and no party.... my mind wasn't working (it was like numbness or not feeling at all... just not processing - I had a lot of problems with dissociation from my previous abuse and was always vulnerable to people hurting me and using me).... I sat down on the couch and he turned on the television which was "already" set to a porn channel...

I excused myself to another room cause I was scared and didn't know what to do... (I had never been kissed even before that night - I know for "18")... He followed me into the room and started to kiss me and touch me... when I moved away he kept on doing what he was doing and proceeded to lift up my shirt and my bra... I told him I didn't want to but he didn't listen... I told him "not tonight" (because I guess I was trying to be nice)... He just kept doing what he was doing... I never had anyone see me like that before and I didn't want to be seen naked so I just said "turn off the light" (it's funny because after acting like he didn't hear me the first times I said I didn't want to he sure jumped up quickly when I said that and turned off the light).

I felt there was no option... I felt scared (in shock mostly... my brain wasn't working or functioning... I guess that was the best I could do to think on my feet)... After that night I had to wait for him to take me back because I didn't know how to get home because he took me to a city I had never been to before.

After that day... when he saw me at work he kept trying to get me to quit and everybody talked about me like I was a whore and he kept telling people bad things about me.

So yeah... every time I tried to talk about the issue people (mostly other women) would try and call me a liar because they were raped in a violent way by a stranger and I didn't know if I had the right to call it "rape" because I didn't fight back... I just sort of laid there like a slug.

That was my first sexual experience and my first kiss and after that my face broke out in massive acne and everybody knew something was up... I got made fun of for going through puberty at 18...

It was only once that I actually reacted to the situation and had a "real" emotion after being numb for so long... I became angry and full of pain and wanted to cut off all the hair on my head that he had touched... I just stood there in the mirror chopping off all my hair...

Till this day I feel guilty for sharing that with others because I don't want to be called a liar from those who don't qualify that as rape.

After that experience I also began to act out and acted like it never happened that I was fine and it was just another "experience"... (I truly wasn't trying... my body and mind had automatically took away all of my emotions).

It wasn't until later on I heard an episode of Love Lines with Dr. Drew where one of the callers said she had been raped while sleeping and when she woke up to it she just lied there and didn't fight back... Dr. Drew said that it had to come from abuse or dissociating during the experience (like you weren't there... your mind was somewhere else to protect yourself). That made it real to me and something to validate all that happened.



Especially since I was abused all my life which made it easier for people to know how and why to target me...

THANK YOU for validating that it is real and it can happen and that we don't have to be called liars or manipulators of truth.

And just because you were not all there doesn't mean you did not know what waws happening. my friend was high off of extacy and she got raped and didnt even know it. And since you bled then you need to go get checked out and let them tell you that it was rape and put him away for that... I feel for you.

I would not consider this rape in a legal sense. You say you consented but asked him to stop. So did you consent or didn't you? Did you withdraw consent? I think you would have an impossible task proving to a court that he raped you.

Watch what you drink in future.

EDIT, I only just realised how rude, abrupt and insensitive this answer sounds, but I really don't mean it to sound that way. But it is true. Rape is notoriously difficult to prove in an English court, and for good reason. It can put a man behind bars for life and even if he is acquitted, the accusation can ruin his life, so the standard of proof needs to be very high. Giving consent and withdrawing consent can be hard to prove, and your actions as well as your words would have to be considered. I think you need to put this behind you, and seek help to that end if need be.

Most of the people I have cared about, deeply, have already died.
I would consider it an insult to their lives, and, more importantly, to their undoubted love for me, if I ceased to care about my own life. They, I know, would have wanted me to live long and to "strive" for whatever years I have left.
I would not dream to insult their memory by not caring about my own future.

Like say for example a young person age perhaps 16 - 20 liking music that generally older people age 60+ like.

I think say you play an instrument such as the piano exceptionally well and you are only 6, then someone may say this to you as a compliment. Perhaps i may be wrong but this is how i would see this to be. Hpoe this helps.

Hello,

(ANS) If this is your child we are talking about then I think your worries & concerns are clearly outlined. I would suggest that it would be completely appropriate to have this little boy assessed by a child psychologist.

**At aged 3-5 a child normally starts to interact & learn how to play with other children of the same age. The fact that this little boy stays by himself in a corner is rather unusual & could indicate he feels safer by himself for some reason.

**Compulsive cleaning behavior is odd in that age group.

**Does he communicate when spoken too or asked a question by a parent (by mum or dad or any other adult?). Even something simple like would you like a drink or would you like to hold teddy? It could be that he is quite withdrawn for some reason that is not clear at this point in time? again this is something a child psychologist would be able to understand better than most people.

**Perhaps the same clothes indicates a sense of security & the familiar thus, taking the familiar away for no apparent reason causes the child to feel very insecure & so gets upset by this. It might not make much sense to anyone else but trust me the child knows why. It has its own reasoning here.

**DON'T JUMP TO ANY DIAGNOSIS YET!! until you have the child seen & assessed by a professional child psychologist.

Kind Regards Ivan.

As an ex child counsellor and mentor i would have to speak first hand with the child's parents as there could be a link with something that is going on in the child's surroundings, these behaviours are signs of withdrawing and to a degree stress. The child would have to also be examined by a child psychlogist to dertermine any mental defects.

Always sitting in the corner, and excessive cleanliness for a 4ish year old is not a "normal" behavior.
Take him to his pediatrician, ask for a child psychologist.

Does your child respond to his/her name?
Can they communicate what they want?
Do they make eye contact?

This is worryingly similar to Autism when a child is withdrawn, has communication issues and displays some obsessive behaviours. Also being resistant to any changes and fastidious cleanliness are indicators. This child needs to be assessed by a Child Psychiatrist.

From this it sounds like the child should be seen by a psychologist. Autism is a possibility but there could be other explanations. Are the parents concerned at all? Is the child able to speak, just chooses not to?

As for your questions about 'types', autism covers a wide spectrum ranging from those mildly affected and high functioning (such as Asperger's syndrome) to more severe and complex.

This is unusual behaviour for a child of his age to be displaying. I would suggest he be referred to your local child development team/ centre for an urgent assessment.
While autism is a possibility, there may be a number of other things going on in his life that his behaviour is a response to. It is not possible to make a diagnosis on the basis of one or two described oddnesses.

Yes, doing anything like maths or puzzles helps. Try some logic problems with your friends (like the, dead man in a field, one. Where you get to ask yes an no questions)

Try reading something complicated and understanding it. I'm reading 'Introducing Quantum Theory A Graphic Guide To Science's Most Puzzling Discovery' by J. P. McEvoy & Oscar Zarate

Also, if you've got a DS or Wii, try Brain Training, or the one I use, Big Brain Academy.

WAITING

Serene I fold my hands and wait,nor care for wind nor tide nor sea,I rave no more 'gainst time or fate,for lo my own shall come to me.
I stay my haste I make delays, for what avails this eager pace?
I stand amid the eternal ways
And what is mine shall know my face

Asleep,awake,by night or day the friends I seek are seeking me,No wind can drive my bark away,nor change the tide of destiny

Captains Log ....

I find that keeping a daily journal helps me maintain my patience and keeps me calm.  Its a great way to spill and sort out ones thoughts, feelings and frustrations.



Some of the things I have recorded and looked at again, in retrospect - have been right down hilarious.  Over the years I have written, mused, researched and collected enough materials, situations and characters to write several novels.



BTW .... it's a great way to kill time.

you wouldnt know, thats the whole point of a dream. some people have been able to control what they do in there dream state, but it's a very hard technique.

you would probably realise that it was a dream but forget 2 or 3 seconds later. you would just be cought up in a set out senario that you couldnt control.

Well, in most of my dreams, crazy stuff happens, but near the end of it, I usually realize that I'm in a dream.  Now, I know that I am awake, as I am thinking about it.  In dreams, you usually do not think about stuff (at least, not in my dreams).

Your brain not only controls your thinking but also it tells your heart to pump, tells your lungs to breath.  etc.

It doesnt. It still has to control your heart, lungs, digestive system, kidneys, etc. If it stopped running, you'd die. Certain parts "take a break" when they're not needed, but the part of the brain that controls organs can never rest.

Well, its always on the go. Its what keeps everything working while you sleep. Mine is positively wheel-spinning as soon as I open my eyes. It drives me crazy, as I can never go back to sleep after a waking episode like that.

yes, the brain alwayss goes
sleep or awake
think about it this way
it doesn't just control your thoughts and things you can control consciously 
ok basically, if your brain would stop
youd stop breathing
heart would stop beating
basically, youd die pretty quickly in your sleep
and im assuming you dont want that

so basically, BRAIN CANT STOP!!

The brain rests when you sleep.

There are two things that run though: the hippocampus and the neocortex.

The hippocampus is used as a temporary storage system that is cleared when you wake up so you can store more memories throughout the day.

The neocortex is a long-term memory system that stores things permanently.*

*This is all according to a new study that has been worked on over the past decade.

Yes, because it has to be on "stand-by" as back in the caveman age, we have to be able to get up quickly and run away from the bear when it wakes us in the middle of our sleep.



I guess there are many instances in modern life that we still need to function quickly.  Eg. When we sleep too close to the edge of the bed and are about to roll off.

The best way to think of it is a computer; if you look at computers they are modeled after our thought and memory processes anyway.

If you hit the hibernate button or sleep mode it can still maintain itself but on the lowest power possible giving time for all other parts to rest and use less energy.



But yes, it is always running.  If it shut down you would not be able to wake.

Stutterer in need of serious help



Hello. I need some help. Basically i live in Europe and i have stuttered since i was 8 i think. I have a high-school diploma but i am afraid to go farther. School gave me bad memories and i do not see myself going back there. The thing is, to have a good job i need to have some kind of post-highschool education. I dread job interviews.



So here i am, a young adult that is not even able to be good at a job interviews or simply attend school. I would like to leave my country and start something new elsewhere. I know that going to another country will not take my stutter away, i wanna go elsewhere for my own reasons. My number one dream would be to go to Canada or USA (i am hesitating when it comes to USA as life there can be dangerous at some places) and start a new life. IF not possible (immigration laws will surely prevent me from living in canada or USA), i'll try to go to england or ireland or another european country (it would be very easy to go there, especially London).

By starting a new life in another country i mean find a job there, then save money to pay for speech therapy and college (correspondence courses preferably) as i would like to work in the entertainment industry. I do not care about how much time it will take me to succeed in another country, i just wanna move on. I know i am being naive but i gotta do something and turn my life around.  I do not believe in the american/canadian dream but still i gotta do something.  I am afraid to do something because of my stutter.



Basically if you guys got some tips: for example where i could find a good speech therapist and support group in USA, Canada and Europe (England, Ireland, etc...) or tips immigration wise, etc... please tell me, you can even leave your email adress if you want, well whatever would be cool actually.

Thanks in advance.

In addition to speech therapy, singing and acting are supposed to be good ways to overcome stuttering.  Maybe you could join some community groups.

Hi, I used to have a stutter, but I think you just need to shout out and assume a loud and brash personality (I walk around like a Dr. Joh becker from the 'Becker' show) and crank out sardonic cynicism at high volume about most things... it is hard to stutter when you are full of bile at many things in the world!



something that has helped me greatly is I went from being a bedroom guitarist to a party and bar player and singer.  I want to share the songs i love, (not my own, I don't really write) and love to get people singing along with me.  They do, and it is great, like flying!  I was also very self-conscous around girls, I conquered that by learning to dance, started Argentine Tango (one of the most complex dances) over ten years back, and have been helping to teach it for a few years now.  I can talk to a class, can approach a beautiful lady and ask her to dance, make conversation with her, and keep my cool.  I never thought I would be able to do that!



You can send me a message and I will email you back if you like.  You accept you have a problem, you want to conquer it... You are two thirds done already my friend.  One last push, and you have it!

How do you not believe...?



That God is savior of the universe.... ??
seriously. you go through life watching movies, listening to music, eating, shopping, and whatever else you are addicted to... but these things always leave you unsatisfied! Well God just wants to be loved by you. he loves you all ready! no matter what you think you've done that makes you a "sinner" he still loves you. he sent his ONLY son to the earth... God was put into the mold of a man, crazy... anyway, he sent his only son to save you from your sin. he was the ultimate sacrifice. he gave up his life, and everything he had for you, so that you could be purified and spend eternity with him... he made that sacrifice for you, are you willing to respond with a yes in your heart? will you say yes to loving him with all of your heart, soul, and spirit? i guarantee
that once you encounter God once, you will not be able to live life the same! please think about this... i am a Christian, and i used to think that people were all going to find God on there own, but if nobody tells them about God, then they will never find him. so i am telling you right now, PLEASE consider choosing God, it will be the best choice you ever make. if you have any questions feel free to email me!

No, "common sense", is the sense that we don't hear to much about these days, sure we have the five senses, and even there "common sense" isn't included, because, unlike the five other senses, once acquired, you can't or should I say, you shouldn't lose "common sense" and still attempt to function, but in time, "common sense" can be acquired.

yes. this happens all the time. In decision making people who are experts in their feilds can make stupid mistakes with dire consequences because they are so distracted with all the other complex information thats involved, they forget to get to the basics and and treat the real issue.



Sometimes a novice is better at problem solving than an expert who has had more exposure to complex info for this reason. It's even got a name for it but I can't rememebr it..This may also explain beginners luck...the novice isn't weighed down by all the extra info (coz they don't really understand the rules), which could otherwise overshadow common sense.

I'm sure that's a pretty common feeling.



I feel like that quite often about my circumstances but you can only play with the cards you are dealt. 
So I suppose the key is to take joy in the search for what it is that will make you content. 
Plus have fun with trying many different things along the way!

Oh my gosh, YES! You described it perfectly, I always just think of it as a void somewhere in my life, but I don't know how to fill it. I have a theory that the feeling is from knowing that you could be doing something, but you don't want to... like cleaning your room for example. There's probably more to it, I wish I knew why and how to fix it.

These are questions that I too ponder over.  I am very sad about the truth in it, but also somewhat relieved because I have realized I am not here for other people, in that I mean regarding trusting them.  We are created in the image of God...and for God, so all that we are, all that we do is meant to be in reverence and Glory to God.  People are human, and we all have our own demons to fight...ie; honesty vs. lying, authentic vs. guarded, human to human we cannot be either except to God.  I have tested this virtue, and I am finding it to be true more and more.  So, just be as nice as you can be, even under strenuous situations, like when someone makes a rude comment or whatever, I TRY to remember this is a trial from God to make me a better person and realize it doesn't matter what that person might do or think about me...God loves me just as I am through his merciful eyes....he has forgiven me for all that I have done, and all that I may do.  The only person I need to worry about as to why any of the above questions you pose is myself....I agree it is painful to acknowledge and accept, YOU just be what they aren't and we will begin to slowly rid this ugly world of all those evil ways.  Hope this helped.

We are people because God created us in His image.
3.



People are not perfect. Even Christians are not perfect. That is why we need Jesus. He is the perfect one. He is LOVE.
4.



Animals are not better than people. They will turn and bite you or kill other living things, sometimes just for the nature of it.
5.



Are you a living example of those things you desire in others. If not ask yourself why not.
6



People are full of sin and without the Spirit of Christ living inside,  flesh is weak.

I'm sorry that presently I do not have the time to give your question the proper consideration it deserves, but hope this helps in some way.

personally, i wouldn't tell her if you don't have to. if she should find out, then explain that you didn't know he was her grandfather and was too embarrassed to tell her. (or afraid it would upset her). 
EDIT* actually, judging by your other questions i've come to the conclusion your just an idiot. be careful if your friend finds out, she might pee in your pool or throw some pubic hair on your corn flakes.

This probably isn't the proper thing to say but... don't tell her. You didn't know and it was a honest mistake but no matter how you tell her your will probably lose her as a friend.



Maybe you should be more careful about who you sleep with in the future. If your going to have sex at least make sure that in the morning you don't hate yourself.

Bullies behaviour is getting more bizarre?



I've resigned, but I have a month to go. The bully mistakenly thinks I'm pregnant even though I never said so. (I said I couldn't drink as I have to have surgery and this morning, everyone knows I want kids, and this morning I told my friend within his earshot that I have exciting news). He doesn't know I've resigned. He brought a newspaper up to me with a headline about terminating babies and said, 'Isn't this unusual?'  Then sneered and walked away. I'm worried his behaviour is going to get even more freaky in the next month. I've tried placating him, ignoring him, and being average towards him but he won't leave me alone. Oddly, it's the second time he's mentioned abortion in my presence - it wasn't related that time either, but he watched me carefully to see how I reacted. I've realised he's a psycho.

Death, dying, bereavement - how do other people cope with these inevitable facts of life.  ?



</question>



<additional details>



Some days  like today, I just get 'set off' for want of a better phrase.  The whole day I just want to burst into tears and I have severe butterflies in my stomach.

Mainly I think about my wee girl (3) and it reminds me when I was her age and I remember when my folks were young and how hard their life was (money wise etc) and it is almost like the whole circle of life malarkey really gets me down.



It is really hard to explain but ultimately I am bereft at the thought of losing my folks, my aunt etc and all their generation of friends.  I also imagine rattling around this house in years to come when my daughter has grown and how ridiculous is this - she is only 3 but already I am just devastated.



I also am so so close to my Dad that I know when he does go I will never ever find someone who loves me that way ever ever again and I cannot imagine a life ever without him.



How silly is it?  It happens to us all and yet I try not to get upset but it feels like I am bereaved

The way I look at things may be a bit different than you, however, think of how hard life is for everyone, the pains you get everyday, muscle, headaches, sorrow, and then realize that God has a plan, and that plan includes death of people. This is not a BAD thing, but a Good thing, as people no longer have to suffer anymore, they will be totally and fully taken care of in heaven, and be with others they had also known who had passed away. Yes, you will be sorrowful when your father passes on, but realize he will be taken care of in a way that is impossible on this earth, and that he will watch you grow as well. I also see a nice lesson here in your question, your father taught you unconditional love, and that he loves you that much, return what he has taught you to your daughter, and your daughter will return that to her children as well, continue the good cycle your father has taught you, it's probably the best life's lesson you could ever learn, (most people never learn that lesson).

If your anxiety interrupts with your daily routine, and/or if  your sleep pattern is erratic, then you may have the onset of mild OCD which is usually due to extremely low levels of serotonin. If it is OCD and it is left untreated, it could progress to panic attacks and depression.

How can I recover from this emotional abuse?



I'm at my wits end with all this so any advice would be appreciated.



Several months ago, someone totally screwed my brain emotionally and I just can't seem to recover from it.  It's almost as if he set me up for a big fall and I took it all and then went on to tell lie after lie for him in order that he could get back to his real life without too many problems.  So not only did he take everything I had to give and then trash my life and my head, I then went on to make it easy for him to get back to normal and make out what a great guy he is.  I trusted him totally as I have known him all my life and I just should never have let go so easily.
I am just so angry with myself for falling for it all and for helping him get his life back in order whilst my own is under enormous strain.



I have ended up in a major depresssion which is starting to feel like more than I can stand, every time I think I am getting somewhere, something else happens to put me further back again and I cannot see a way forward anymore.  I have several other problems in my home life which is making it seem almost impossible to live.  Please help me out here, what would you suggest, not medication please, so I can start getting somewhere with all this because I am struggling on an minute by minute basis with what has happened.

Thanks, can't talk to my friends or family as they know or know of the person involved.  No sure how comfortable I feel about counselling but understand this may be my best option.

Wow, thanks CLGM for your reply (and everyone else for your helpful responses).  CLGM I do feel crazy and can't concentrate, I have brief spells where I feel I'm ok and that I'm going to be allright, then it comes back in waves and I feel like I'm drowning in the misery of it all again.  I'm definitely keeping too much inside, this happened 3 months ago and I still have not got through a single day without crying, sometimes for hours at a time.  I realise I need to speak to someone about this or else I am never going to be able to move on.  Thank you so much for your sharing your story and no you're not rambling, I understand what you are saying totally.

Firstly stop beating yourself up. We aren't programmed to expect people, especially those close to us, to be so rotten.

Secondly, know that you're not on your own. I guarantee there are hundreds of people here on YA that have been where you are right now.

Thirdly, don't expect a quick fix, something that has injured you to the core is going to take a while to get over.

All I can suggest is that you attend to your current problems one at a time to make some kind of order out of them. You can't focus properly when you're trying to deal with so many things at once.

Have you thought of writing a letter to this person telling them exactly how you feel and what you think of them? Write it, then burn it as ceremoniously as you wish.  DON'T post it!  Can't say it will make things alright, but guarantee it will take the top few layers of pain and hurt away.

Go to the Doctors & tell them how you're feeling. They can refer you to go & talk to someone - you don't have to take medication if you don't want to. Talking to someone proffesional & asking them for advice would probably be more helpful than asking a bunch of strangers on yahoo...also, do you have a close friend to talk to? I find that talking to someone close helps a lot too.

You need to talk to someone. If you tell someone, about what he has done or whatever the problem is with him, you will feel much better and your life will improve. Trust me. Hiding things, and telling lies will always make you ill in the long run! you need to explain to this to him if you can and explain how you feel. If this boy has ruined your head as much as you say he has done then he will have to suffer the consequences for it and you should tell someone. You could even be suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. This isn't good as other problems can occur shortly after such as anorexia, as all you are concentrating on is this issue, or maybe even obesity as you are trying to take your mind off the issue. Whatever happens i advice you to speak to someone whether it is your mum/friends/therapist. It's up 2 u but talking helps! :]

There are a couple of web sites that you might find useful. These are based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy  (CBT) which is evidence based.

You have to register with the sites however registration is free.

As mentioned above, work on one problem at a time and break that problem down into achievable goals.

Good luck and hope you're soon starting to feel in control of your life.

First let me say you are not alone. I ran for my life on June 12, 2008, and had to travel 350 miles before I could lay my head down to sleep. I have since made 2 trips back to deal with protective orders, pre-trial divorce hearings, etc. I am also a healer, and someone who after 49 years of being dissapointed still believe the rest of the world lives by the same moral code I do.



May I suggest you call your local domestic abuse shelter, and ask them about support group meetings? If someone had told me that 2 months ago I would have balked big time. I have attended 6 two hour "empowerment" meetings, and each time I walk out I feel better for at least a little while. You will encounter women who have had the same experiences as yourself, along with women who in far worse situations than you can imagine.



It helps to see what others are going through in order to see your own life in a real time sense as opposed to the bubble you have surrounding you. You are probably dealing with a million different thoughts going through your head all at one time, you can't focus on anything for more than a few minutes, you find yourself trying to say something and the simplest word escapes you. All of these things are normal and to be expected. It is called battered women's syndrome, post traumatic stress disorder, or many other taqs. Whether you experienced physical abuse, emotional abuse, or verbal abuse, each of us are affected differently than others from the same experiences. I am rambling and I know this, but truly want to reach out and help you as best I can.



Know this: It will get better! Today may start off bad, and end great. Tomorrow may start off great and end up sucking. Each day you wake up is a clean slate, so do with it what you can. Set small goals. For now set goals by the minute, then work up to the hour, and so forth. I have also gone to two therapy sessions, and have gained a world of comfort in knowing I am not "crazy." I have a strong need for valedation, but also realize it is not always possible. Those closest to  you will not necessarily be the ones to help you. Today is Sunday, and I have found in the past couple of months there is a great need for shelters, gardens, whatever where women (and men) can go and just "be safe'"



I am sorry for rambling, and I hope you are able to get something out of all of this.

P.S. Be careful who you trust now, and for the rest of your life. I am not saying to change who you are, just to set boundaries and be sure to keep everyone outside of those boundaries. Physical and emotional boundaries.



P.S. I am living with my overbearing, controlling mother, I can't seem to find a job, I hate cat hair she has 5 cats, I hate being hot, it is hot as H&%^ where I am. I carry a gun, I look over my shoulder constantly, and I have no friends where I am.... so I do understand how you feel, and then some.

Emotional abuse is awful. You tend to think of it and try to make sense of it all. You need counselling and to vent it all out. Try writing it down and finding ways to express how you are feelings and felt at the time.
I was emotionally abused in my teens by a step relative. For years I was full of shame, anger, hurt and confusion. Now I am a performer and managed to use dance to express how I felt and created the whole situation in art form. Also I had counselling, it took a lot but I am over it now and look back and laugh at the abuser.

Some of them do, but you have to think a little. Like i had this dream twice where my teeth either fell out or turned all yellow. It was terrifying and the silly thing is that both those nights i forgot to brush my teeth because i was wayyy too tired after babysitting and i guess my dream was warning me.

They don't make sense because you don't have any control over them--unlike your waking life, where do you have some control over your daydreams. Dreams are a jumbled mix of all your emotions and experiences, so it's not going to make much sense when put together.

dreaming is the result of a clash between conscious and unconscious brain. your thought of being right disagrees about a previous chosen thought or action. In religion term, you just made a sin. it manifest in your dream
its like your memory cells is trying to reconnect, it passes through your stored visual memory, kindof synchronization lost.

I currently study psychology and read a lot on my own time and in school.  I have the answer to your question, and you are not going to like it probably since most people do not like to read.  I assure you this will fix most if not possibly all of the problems you listed.  There is a science or branch of psychology called Neuro Linguistic Programming which is used by many self help/motivational speakers like Anthony Robbins only he  calls it Neuro Associative programming.  It is a psychotherapeutic approach to the problems most people face in their day to day lives.  If you want to know the science and apply it to your life to fix all of your problems read some Neuro-Linguistic Programming books which I'm sure you can download online.  I am currently reading one called Sleight of Mouth by Robert Dilt very mind blowing stuff.  If you simply want the benefits( fixing all of your problems),  pick up the book Awaken the Giant Within, its an Anthony Robbins book.  It's really good and extremely commonly used by CEO s, professional athletes....etc to improve performance and people's lives in general.  If you choose to read Anthony Robbins book do keep in mind what he is saying is based off science no blind faith is required.  I would recommend the NLP but if you don't have the time at the least read Awaken the Giant Within.

Your problems result from your unconscious or subconscious mind, since you consciously want to stop doing the things that you do but you can't.  So in order to do this, you must change your subconscious mind to do the things you want it to do.  Some NLP (Neuro Linguisitic Programming) techniques will help with this, for example are affirmations.  Affirmations from an NLP perspective is writing down what you want to accomplish twice everyday, in the pass tense as something you accomplished.  For example,  "I studied 4 hours today and ate healthy." Consciously this may seem silly, but remember we are not dealing with your conscious mind we are dealing with subconscious mind and the only way to penetrate it, to get rid of your bad habits and replacing them with good ones, is through different techniques that have been proven to impact/change it. This is one of the more powerful techniques that you should immediately start implementing, I guarantee you will see results within a week if not immediately.  Other techniques deal with viewing tasks in positive ways or different ways then you currently do to change your view or perspective on a situation or task.



All good things take a little time, I strongly encourage you to pickup, or download a book either NLP or an Anthony Robbins one.  The Anthony Robbins book will have most if not all of the things you will need to know for the immediate problems listed, but the NLP books are just so damn fascinating, applicable to your own personal life(the problems you mentioned), business life, social life.....etc. Anyway I hope this helped. Feel free to ask questions. Good luck.

Hi!

I looked at your question and thought "that's me" I have become exactly the same!
I am a lot older you than you sound-but am in the same position!
Let us help one another eh?
I think we need to plan our days so we get things done, we need to prioritise. 
Perhaps write down each night what we need to do the next day-giving ourselves small targets at first!
I think we need a routine, perhaps walk to the shops, buy healthier foods, tidy up as we go along and leave a certain amount of time for your studies (I don't have that problem)
Then each day as we find it coming together-it wont be overnight!!-we can treat ourselves.
Most importantly, I think we need to like ourselves a little more! How about that?
Lets go for it!
Good Luck

...with their consent! A lot of people will take offence if you flash them!

I think it's normal to enjoy being naked, but wanting to be seen naked is slightly different. It's not that unnatural to want to be seen naked. The way I'd recommend going about it is going to a nudist beach, and I've also heard of meet-ups for nudists, but I'm not sure how one would go about finding those.

Or, you could go for a job in the porn industry to be naked and broadcast to thousands! lol

I reckon Frank Herbert had the answer in his novel "Dune". Just repeat this litany in moments of fear.

"I will not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain..."

If you replace the word "fear" with the word "pain" in the above, it helps with that as well.

I think most people want to be talked out of it... I can't imagine that anyone REALLY wants to take their own life but they really just want someone to help them.



It is kind of sad that when people cry out for help they get called drama queens...and that people act like needing attention is wrong.  I have never thought about taking my own life but I have wished I could go to sleep and not wake up... but when people don't help or ridicule them for their feelings then they may feel that by actually doing it then others will feel that guilt for the rest of their lives... I think that is comforting for people who are really lonely and feel rejected....

In a typical case where it isn't a chemical imblance, it's usually just that the person isn't emotionally capable of dealing with life. They arn't cowardly, they're overwhelmed. It's not that they're afraid of dealing with life, but that they  feel like they are suffering through their own emotionaly problems every day. A lot of times they feel like it never gets better, and like any good times are overshadowed by the much longer bad times. They may feel alone or isolated because they can't share these feelings with people who are close to them for fear those people will not want to deal with something like that or they will make them get professional help which they may not want. Many suicidal people don't like being rationalized with, because many of their reasons seem rational to them. Often, depressed people don't have good relationships with the people around them including family or spouse, or friends. They may feel empty inside and pain or cold may seem to them like 'the only thing worth feeling'.
They typically underestimate the pain they would cause their loved ones, or feel that in the grand scheme their loved ones sorrows would pale in comparison to what they believe would be a better world without them. Suicidal people often want a lot of attention or affection, and don't get it from their loved ones. They also may feel unapprectiated and need more praise than most people for the things they do. Suicidal people often feel they are horrible people, or others extremely good people who don't fit into the world. Either they feel they make the world worse, or that they are the only good peopled in a jaded world.
Suicide is never the best choice, but for a lot of people it is better than continuing to deal with their lives the way it is. Still, life can always get better if you try hard, and most people have family who WILL help if asked to.

I guess you could blame it on FATE? I mean, if it's their end of time, anything could be invented to end them. Suicide is just an excuse to execute the bad souls and bring them back to life through reincarnation and stuff. FACT.

Need help with planning and foresight.



Generally speaking, I have rubbish foresight, and very little concern for even the immediate future and a sort of 'mental block' when it comes to any sort of future planning. MY QUESTION IS can anybody recommend any cunning 'exercises' which I could use to get me into the practice of routinely planning ahead without procrastination or ****-ups?
Many many thanks, oh mighty internet-goers.

A great question... and something I've wondered myself. Look up HOT WIFE.  It actually describes the activity of having your wife sleep with other men.  Apparently the husband derives some satisfaction in knowing that other men desire his woman... apparently an indirect compliment to the man. "If other men want my woman, then I must have great taste and be really fortunate."  Some might feel power in allowing other men to be with their wife... like the "keeper of the goods."

It's a really hard one to answer.
The first thing you have to concentrate on is yourself and the kids.
If you give them love then they will love you back and thats the start of the healing process. 
If your having hard times in relationships then get out of the relationship. I know easier said than done but you have to make a positive effort. Nobody else can do it for you. Your incharge of your destiny.
Don't go looking for love, it never works out that way. Love will find you but dont expect it to happen overnight. It may take months or years but it's worth waiting for. I found it last year and I'm 46.
Good luck.

He called me a trophy wife?



I went to a party with my husband, who I am newly married to, and he introduced me to his "good friend" who is supposedly important. The man just looks at me, and then says to my husband "I see you've been doing pretty well for yourself, even got yourself a trophy wife." That made me so mad, and I told him that was such a rude thing to say, and now my hubby is upset with me. Did I overreact or was I right to be insulted? And shouldn't my husband be more upset with him for saying that?

What a jerk. You're right to be upset.

Your husband has no right to be upset with you. The phrase "trophy wife" denotes that the primary reason that your husband married you was for your looks, which may almost be positive and, if anything, more of an insult to your husband than to you, but it also connotes that you are otherwise unworthy of him and that you're otherwise worthless. You need to have a serious conversation about this with your husband.

Maybe the guy was trying to make a compliment through a joke, as in you are very beautiful, thus congratulating your husband for his catch. Guys usually give these compliments to each other, sometimes more acid than others. If it was indeed a good friend, then it's probable that he didn't mean it in bad spirit. It's not really the kind of compliment I would give, cause I can see how it can be misinterpreted.

Mad doesn't cover it by half. Trophy wife? What are you an Oscar? If your husband is not seeing why you are so upset, you should have a serious sit down conversation about what is important to you. If he cant get on board with that and see why you feel that being thought of as a thing rather than as a person is wrong, you have a rocky road ahead. Best of luck.

Pointing out that a friend has a "trophy wife" is a compliment that guys give to each. It is a back-handed compliment that you are good looking, and/or that your husband has achieved such a status that he has "earned" you - much as many professional athlete's have "trophy wife" models for wives. It objectifies a woman, but it's harmless enough. A local radio station even sells "trophy wife" t-shirts made in ladies sizes and they sell out of them each mother's day! I don't think you should be angry and you have taken his friend's joking the wrong way.



I think if I was your husband I might be upset too, as you embarrassed him to his good friend who was actually trying to give him a compliment, in a round-about kind of way. His friend now knows that you do not have a sense of humour due to your reaction, and your husband is probably pretty embarrassed that he was just introducing you and you told his friend off! Awkward!

Yes you over reacted. It is meant as a compliment. Should he have said it? Maybe not. But it's nothing to lose sleep over, or to start a fight over either. Just take it for what it is. A compliment. He thinks you're gorgeous.

Good on yer girl!

Reminds me of that scene in the film "Shadowlands" where a professor colleague of CS Lewis expounded with a sneer about men having intellects and that women only have "souls".  Joy Gresham (the American writer who became Lewis's wife) squared up to the distinguished professor and asked him if he intended to be offensive or was he just stupid?

I am sure it was said light-heartedly and rather thoughtlessly, and was a bit of small talk to congratulate your husband on his recent good fortune, not said out of malice.

Trophy wife is not really so much of an insult to you (it means you are good looking) as much as it is an insult to your husband (meaning he cannot attract a good woman who loves him, he can only buy a good looker who thinks nothing of him).  You stood up for your husband as much if not more than you stood up for yourself, and you stood up for your marriage most of all.

Pity your husband cannot read this and realise this. My guess was that he has to contend with oafs all the time (especially if they happen to be his boss!), and the best thing to do often is just to ignore their thoughtless comments and get on with life.  That may be his way, but it doesn't have to be yours.

Am i over reacting about this too much???



i used to text one of my friends who i'm really close with alot before i went on holidays like a month and a half ago......like almost every day.

i was in florida for 3 weeks and i came back for like 5 days and then i headed off to spain for a week and just got back on thursday.

i noticed both coming back from florida and also coming back from spain that she hardly texts back to me anymore and doesn't strike up a convo with me that much which is really wierd cuz before i went away we'd talk all the time and she'd be striking up a convo as much as i wud be and now i feel like i'm the one who has to keep striking up a convo with her.

i don't know if i'm over reacting about it or not but i hate it because i feel like i'm losing my best friend because we hardly talk anymore - well i try and talk to her but she's hardly talking back - and not once has she striked up a convo with me since coming back from florida and then again coming back from spain.

whats all your opinions??? do you think i'm over reacting too much about her hardly talking to me anymore?? i just don't want our friendship to fall apart because she's one of my bestest friends.

Your best bet is to talk to her. Maybe she feels like you have been busy jetting off and doing stuff that she feels a bit left behind. Talk to her and see what she says. It's no good sitting wondering about it as the longer you leave it the more difficult it will be to ask her. 
If you are as close as you say i am sure things will be ok and will sort themselves out. Go and call her - NOW!!

She may have had a dull time while you were away and people do tend to let go a bit when there's a distance.

Think of something fun you can do together and it might help get your friendship back on an even keel. It's probably best not to bring it up, as she'll be a bit self-conscious about it and it'll suddenly be an issue.

aww no way ! i think its great because if your friends your not gonna want it to fade away are you ? youl continue to feel restless until you get this sorted out so why not call her if shes not responding. it happened to me once and i could not rest properly until i found out she was a crap friend anyways ! loll but consider yourself to be a good friend for reacting like this . cal her talk about and if she doesnt respond take it as a change in your friendship, if a friend doesnt make effort with you it says a lot about that person. best of luck!

She probably just detached herself because you were gone for a while. I'm sure if you invite her to do something or keep texting her she will come back around. Just ask her if you did something to make her and or upset but I'm pretty sure its just cause you were away.

Hiya,

I know this sounds silly but you can go into a book shop and find books on depression or you can go to Amazon.com or amazon.co.uk depending where you are and type in depression in the search bar and you'll find loads.

Pick a book based on your paticular problem and look to see what readers have said about it in the reviews. If you are short of money you can go to your local library and they will have books there.

I wish you the very best of luck!

find some positive outlets of your feelings. for me, writing helps a lot. if not writing, then try drawing, listening to music, reading, or even physical exercise. take care of yourself, eat right,drink plenty of water, and if your really stressed do something active. go on a run, jump rope, anything to get your body moving and your heart pumping. be around people who care about you, people who make you laugh and smile.

Depression is a state of mind. How did you become depressed? Wake up every morning and tell yourself " I AM HAPPY TO BE ME" Make a list of everything that makes you Happy. Also make a list of everything that you are grateful for. Forget all the things that make you sad or depressed. Do not listen to your sub-conscious mind that tells you, you are depressed, eventually your new understanding of how awesome this world is will dominate your thoughts. This is a beautiful, wonderful place to live and exist! Wouldn't you love to be part of Heaven on earth? The decision is yours.

I can understand the reasoning if it's logical, but personally I could never do such a thing.

It is a choice though, and although preventing someone from going through with it is fine, when religions get involved and say you'll go to hell if you commit suicide well that's quite messed up.

Maybe you can find a blog or something on someone who committed suicide?

i don't quite know how to answer this question, it's too broad..

if i could hazard a guess, it maybe because the idea of 'perfection' is related to visual things, thus we as a population tend to get sucked into the superficial things.. but i can tell you that even i look for perfection, but in the sense of cleanliness and healthiness and not just for the beauty.

I can't believe that some body would say better to be wrong and have everyone agree with you than be right and have everybody against you!! This is really the view of someone who is incapable of original thought and who is nothing more than a sheep who wants to belong to the flock rather than stand out against the crowd!

We live in an age where superficial is the norm and where anybody who is a little bit different is often thought of as "strange" or "weird". Take models for instance - women these days are so busy wanting to look like a size 0 that they entirely miss the point - it isn't what you look like that is important, it is what and whom you are that matters! Likewise, people who are perceived as "intelligent" are often dismissed as cranks, or "not one of us" but that only occurs when being "one of us" means that you have to descend to the lowest common denominator!



There will never be any substitute for intelligence and learning. If I had the choice of going out with some fantastic looking Blonde/Brunette who's brains wouldn't cover a pin head and a more plain looking female who had a brain holding her ears apart, give me the brains every time!!

The problem is that we live in an ever increasing materialistic world and we are the poorer for it!

I'm going to give you the same answer I gave someone else for a very similar question a few weeks ago:

"When we first meet someone, a whole series of assumptions are made. There is what is called the 'implicit personality theory' developed by Asch where minimal information about a person can provide us with a coherent idea of what that person might be like since we're already in possession of pre-existing knowledge which evokes more information about that person. Sometimes, the easiest way to do this is simply to size a person up based on what they look like and this does not necessarily provide accurate assumptions.

Asch also maintained that the order you receive information about a person is also important in impression formation. That is, if a person shows positive traits before negative ones (e.g. intelligence, industrious, critical, stubborn), they create a better impression but if they were to show the negative traits before the positive ones (e.g. stubborn, critical, industrious, intelligence) , a worse impression is formed in spite of the person being exactly the same. It is important to realise that looks are often the first thing people recognise in another person and can dictate what they think of the rest of that person.

It is easier to perceive a person superficially. The modern information processing theory of social cognition in psychology maintains that social information processing is effortful and that capacity is limited and so, superficial strategies (or mental-short cuts) are undertaken instead of deep-processing strategies.

The importance of attractiveness is therefore overjustified. People see attractive people as intelligent, successful, happy, 'deserving', well-adjusted, socially skilled etc. = the what is beautiful is good stereotype (This stereotype can be seen everywhere e.g. the the Wizard of Oz Dorothy says to the good witch "witches are old and ugly" and the good witch says "only bad witches are ugly"). This is a self-fulfilling prophecy where because people have these expectations and act in response to these expectations, it comes to be so that attractive people are less anxious, more popular, more sexually experienced etc. All because it's cognitively easier to process a person superficially, meanwhile, people are saving deeper processing for getting to know someone after they've made their initial judgements."

Good question.

Two ideas come to mind immediately.
1. They lack intelligence.
2. They have never been taught Thinking 101--how to
"categorize".

So they missed the basic lesson that 5--6 essentials in
prioritized order defining how something works or is man-made 
for value constitute how you judge something.

Either way, they're dealing with appearances and
recognition silhouettes--not with the reality of the thing
or person they're supposed to be really understanding.
not irrelevances, appearances, etc.

Well I dont know is it like white tip? It might just be an infection under the skin. This is gonna sound weird but, pinch it. If white pus comes out then keep pinching and then when clear liquid comes that means the infection is cleared out. It will swell for a little but then go down.

i dont know if it aids in it, but being isolated is hard on a person emotionally.  They lose track of reality and what is going on, what day its and seem to regress more... we have seen this alot in nursing homes with patients whose families dont visit them and yes some families do cut off elderly.  I will ask colleagues if it aids in it...

Do you believe that the majority of people are "superficial" or not?



i just read a question about "superficiality" i was finding it hard to get my head around it a bit. I understand "superficiality" to an extent: im on the assumption it somebody that takes looks into consideration and from what i can see bad attitude above all. I can understand how "they" act but can anyone enlighten me on why, psychologically or biologically speaking.
this is due not understanding their feelings i believe?
i was also trying to consider people i know to be superficial or not. if im taking into account my previous assumption of superficial people, i would say most people i know are, but i can also see that most of them are not bad people or id like to think their not. i can see their pain and confusion when they speak. 
back to my main question how would you consider that the majority of people (not just teens) to be "superficial"?

I think the majority of people in society today are superficial. I don't believe that I am per se, but then again, what car my man drives or how much he makes doesn't mean a thing to me. But, there are days when I'll just judge someone by the way they look or the way they talk. so yeah, like the previous person said, everyone is to a certain extent, but it does seem that the 'beautiful' people are WAY more superficial then anyone else.

By nature, we are all superficial. We present ourselves to others the way we want to be perceived. We have to make a conscious effort to open up to people. And it has to work both ways. It is like when people ask, "How are you doing." If you really start to tell them, many times you can see that they are uncomfortable with that, so the wall goes back up. As a whole, superficiality is with us to stay. That doesn't stop us from finding a small group of open personalities that we can be truly honest with.

While it is alarming, the American populace is one that if they didn't experience with their own eyes or do it first hand, then it didn't happen. Do I think this is wrong? Not really. In school we are taught to question everything. So, why not question if we really did walk on the moon or if it was just a made up event to take our eyes off of the troubles of the world if only for a brief moment? And why not wonder if perhaps 9/11 was perpetrated by the US Government or even the Jews? After all haven't you seen Wag the Dog? Besides, it gives the old timers something to talk about and debate and gives you a question for answers!!

Not sure what your bad thoughts were, but for me, after finding my ex-wife with my best friend, I would replay the event in my mind until I had worked myself up to a frenzy and then I wanted to destroy pretty much anything in sight.  I would think of new and different ways to punish her without physically harming her, but ultimately it was tearing me apart.



I found that when I would get so worked up, the only thing that helped was to physically stop whatever I was doing, take a few deep breaths and say to myself, "this is not solving anything"



It helped me to take a few minutes for myself, and focus on the fact that being pissed off about something beyond my control was counter productive.



Unfortunately, there is no "happy all the time" method. If there was, what would be the point of even being alive. My theory is that if some days don't totally suck, then really great days, would never be really great, they'd just be ok.

Try taking some time to think about you, and what you can contol and what is beyond your control, then focus only on what you can do.

I do not know what kind of " Bad Thoughts" you are having. However, I have Never in all of my Life seen Anyone that was Happy and Angry at the Same Time!!!! Please tell me more about your Thoughts and I can Help you to be Rid of them. If you are Angry at someone, some place, or some thing ; I suggest that you Pray for that person,place , or thing to Get the BEST and that God Forgive them and Have Mercy on them!!! If they have Everything that they want...... Maybe they will Leave You Alone!!!! Also, it will help you to Accept it and no Longer Upset you. I have done this and it Works--- Every Time.

If they're bad thoughts about you -- for example: I'm a bad person, I can't do things right, I'm a loser -- try thinking of affirmations instead. Make a list of things you do well or things you're considered good at. Ask yourself the question: If someone asked my friends what good qualities I have, what would they say? Write down the answers. Keep them with you. Whenever you have a negative thought, look at your list of affirmations to remind yourself what you're good at.

bad thoughts...that's a bit vague, but hey
when i have negativity flooding my mind, i take my diary and a pen, and write down everything that comes into my head. that way i can look at it, solve any problems that i can solve, and the rest of it is out of my mind. putting the thoughts on the paper makes me put them in perspective, and usually the writing calms me down.

I recently got raped and I want justice...if not...revenge.?



I got raped a few nights ago. I contacted the cops immediately after it happened, and they're going to have me talk to a detective and see what we can do from there. I've been keeping myself busy to block the images from my head and whenever I remember the scenario I get angry and think of a million ways of killing the guy that did this to me. I know where he lives and where he works, I want to shoot him and watch him suffer, blow up his store, burn down his house. I know that those thoughts aren't options and I'm better than that but I don't know what I would do if the cops don't do anything and let him get away with it. Tonight is my first night at home since that happened and I can't stop thinking about it or how icky I feel. It's finally starting to hit me harder and I know it's only going to get worse. I know that revenge isn't the way to go but I've lost my sanity enough to go ahead and do the things I mentioned...I don't know what to do. If any one's been through this road before I need some advise please before I lose it.

I am sorry for your situation. It is one that I can not say I have ever been in. You are definately not alone and I can imagine that most people who have been raped have had this same idea/ obsession about hurting the person who did this. Did you not get any referrals to support groups? If not, try reaching out to someone to help you find one, or someone to talk to that has been through the terror that you have endured. This is going to take a LONG time to get over, if you ever do. You need to find healthy ways to deal with your feelings and not bottle them up. I am sure you are still in a state of shock right now, but in time, I think you will be able to attain the coping skills you will need to deal with this. You can not do it alone though- talk to someone!

I know exactly what you are under going through. I had joined a help program before concerning those abandon and rape young kids in the streets. Rage burned in their hearts to get justice but as you said this is not the best option you have, you are only becoming one of them in the long run. We give advice on how to cope on these present crisis to live again and forget the past, but I know it is easily said than done.

If you want justice, you should have enough evidence like medical report of rape from a doctor. To determine the physical evidence that you are indeed rape by the suspect. Second, filing a rape charges against the suspect, third witnesses or evidence from the crime scene. Killing him will only make you the monster, while here the monster is that guy not you. I too have the same reason, if that happen to me revenge is a sweet answer. But on the second thought killing another person is not the solution to everything. Let the sword of justice fall on those wrong doers not to the victim. Even if you kill him the thought of the rape is still there in your mind, the only consulation you have is that you killed him.  What you need is seminar and therapeutic consultation to ease the pain or burden of these crisis in your life. A person who feels helpless need a hug or a tap on the shoulder, but to you much more is needed of course.

I like to look at things in this fashion.  When people are in lve they should simply say that....."Honey, I hate you the least of anyone in my life."

Of course not all people would like to hear a comment like that....and although honesty can never be judged....somehow I think a lot of judging would surface from such a statment.

Real love has nothing to do with hate. Simple. People get together too young...then grow up and find they don't even like each other anymore. Some confuse lust with love. Some get together for the wrong reasons, or sometimes just simply grow apart. You will love a lot of people in your lifetime. This shouldn't mean hate when you discover it's over.

I don't think music alone is the answer.  Music has never abruptly changed me from being in a bad mood to being in a good mood.  However, I also vehemently disagree with turning to religion to make yourself feel better.  Most religions I have learned about involve suppressing your natural urges in order to steer clear of 'sin' or whatever equivalent.



I think the secret to true happiness is just letting go of the things you cannot change, and enjoying your life for what it is.  Be happy with the cards you are dealt.  Look for the positives in every negative situation, as there are almost always some, at least minor, good things that can come from these situations.

Listen to me!

When i was your age i was spotty , short and wore glasses!!!

I didn't have weight issues, however i was different and wasn't generally able to get a girlfriend!

Even though i was different i did m,y best to stay popular and have fun!
ok i wished the girls looked at me but generally i just spoke to people with respect and had fun!

Be yourself!! you may not like yourself but you can like others right? the more you find good things in others then the more you will get back from them in kindness right...which makes you feel good!

When i left school, people used to tell me that they never really noticed how short i was or how many spots i  had because i was genuine and fun!........what even more shocked me was that some girls actually fancied me!!!! but i was too UNconfident.....BOYS like confident girls too!

another thing to consider is that you still have lots of growing to do! ( or shrinking)
I know of girls in my year who wernt that good looking and all that but WHAM they hit 21 and they Absolutely reek of beauty....because they found themselves!!!

Basically you wont learn to do that properly till you leave secondary school......because theres too much social pressure there!!



good luck and BELIEVE in ANYTHING!!!!

Don't worry about what other peoples relationships life is about. Most girl celebrities the really pretty ones didn't have a boyfriend 'till year 12. If you feel fat, Then exercise and lose some kilo's (stones) and once you do you will feel really good. If you feel not pretty ... Get some help. Everybody is pretty in their own ways, it just takes some time for someone to see it. You might have a really nice feature about your face, My feature is the drop dead most gorgeous lips in the world, prettiest eyes, cute beauty spot on my lip and the best hair. But yet I still haven't had a boyfriend since like grade 5. lol.



Have you ever thought maybe no one asked you out because they go for the popular sl**s, not the nice, smart, pretty ones? I'm not saying go become a sl*t I'm saying keep your mind off things, flirt with them, wear different hairstyles everyday untill someone says they like your hair like that, then wear your hair like that, same with makeup and everything.



I hope I helped you, Good luck! Sorry If i was completely helpless.

P.S Make sure you always smell good. Plus get a deadly tan :)

First you have to except yourself. You have to be able to look in the mirror and say I am pretty, and it doesn't matter what anyone else says! Stay strong! You will find someone one day. You are still very yound, and your day will come when people look at you and say wow she is chunky, but she is radiant, and beautiful based on her personality and confidence!!! Be true to yourself!!!

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



1. BREAK IT UP

Whatever your goals, whether it is losing weight, writing a book, or getting fit, the key is the same: break it up. A student facing five or more years of med school might think of the task ahead as daunting; how will she ever learn all that stuff! But how many people have done just that? The answer is simple: one day, one chapter, one step at a time.

When I first joined my local gym, I was overweight and totally unfit. I had never done any exercise harder that walking, and I set myself the task to start running. My instructor told me to set the machine so that I would run for 30 seconds, no more. 30 seconds doesn't seem like a lot, but when you're as unfit as I was, it feels like half an hour. So I tried it and yes, it was hard, but I did it, and the small sense of achievement stayed with me a lot longer. Soon I was running for a minute, then five, then ten, and after a while I started measuring my training in distance, not time.

Don't set yourself too hard a task to begin with. Success breeds success, so keep it small, and before long you'll be surprising yourself.

2. THE GLASS HALF FULL

If you encounter a setback, try not to think of it in negative terms. If you can see the positive in a situation, you can learn from it.

So if you didn't get that job you wanted, don't be down, think of the things you learned at the interview that might help you succeed next time.

If you're trying to lose weight, and have a disaster of a day, don't think: "well, I might as well give in". Instead, think of all the good days you've had, and how well you've already done. Everybody has a bad day, but you know what? There's always tomorrow. You can start again.

3. DON'T BE DEPRESSED

Everybody has bad days, days when they can't be bothered, or don't have any energy. The key is to turn bad days into good days. How? Be good to yourself. If you're feeling in a bad mood, put on your favourite music, treat yourself to an ice cream, take the dog for a walk, whatever you know will improve your mood. When you're feeling happy, you can achieve so much more than if you're grumpy and sad.

4. DON'T THINK!

If you're the sort of person who can talk yourself out of anything (I'm one!) the key is not to let yourself do it. I can find any excuse not to do the things I really need to. If I find myself thinking: I won't go to the gym today, instead I'll check out my friends on the internet I stop and start trying to name every state in the USA. Any distraction, TV, radio, even counting the roses on the wallpaper will do! If you don't think about it, you can't talk yourself out of it. And once you've done it, you'll feel a lot better for it, believe me!

5. NEVER SAY "I CAN'T"

We've all done it. We watch people running a marathon, doing a bungee jump, even more everyday things like learning to drive or going for a promotion at work. We think about it and say: "no. I can't do it." Well, my view is how do you know, until you try?

At the beginning of this article I told a story from the days when I couldn't run for a bus, yet now I regularly run five or six miles. If you had asked me back then if I would ever be able to run that far, I would probably have laughed at you. But now I'm doing it, and if I can do it, so can you.

We are all capable of far more than we think we are. So the next time you see that promotion advertised, why not give it a go? Think of it this way: if you try and fail, At least you'll have tried, and you might find your boss is impressed with your ambition and recommends you for another position. If you don't try, you won't get the job, and you might always wonder: 'what if?' And you might get the job!

It's not difficult to start thinking positively. You really have nothing to lose, and a lot to gain. It could even change your life!

- think about all the things you have accomplished in life.

- focus on the positives in situations, try not to think just negative.

- surround yourself with positive friends who don't bring you down.

- when you start feeling down, listen to some upbeat music, write in a journal, take a jog (exercise has been shown to give you a boost) or call a friend to chat.

breath through your nose, and exhale out of your mouth..be focused.

remember always that you will get what you want out of life if you are willing to do what it takes to get it.

If someone you know got a higher grade then you, lets say for our example,..don't mumble that you hate them; be happy for them and move on, you will get a better grade if you really apply yourself. That's all it takes. =]

First of all, one must realize that in most cases that the answers to all psychological dilemmas are more often than not already within the mind of the one asking the question. In other words, one must examine themselves and identify the source of the negativity. Is it ones past failures and/or disappointments that cause this negative vibe? Is it an individual's current living conditions i.e. socio-economic levels, relationship problems or intra-personal skills that causes one's lowly state of mind? Once an individual can access their own current reality a goal can be set to create a new reality. Once the goal is set then an individual has to strive to reach that new goal at all cost. You might lose some friends with the new you. Some family members might not like the new you. Co- workers might talk about the new you. However, in spite of all of that you have got to determine you course and set sail for the new you and when you get there recognize that you have arrived “bask in the marvelous sunlight of your liberation". When you realize in your mind that the shackles of depression can be removed, with a mind that is determined to be liberated then my friend you become "Free".

I am scum and I just want to quit?



Quit what, I don't even know.

I have been feeling horribly lately. I suffer from many mental disorders, including bipolar and schizo. My friend recently came out of a drug coma, which is upsetting because he has been to rehab so many times and has overdosed twice. My wife and I have been having horrible marital problems, my fault, and she couldn't take it anymore, so she took ournewborn son and left to stay in a hotel. I'm falling apart.

I am in therapy and on many medications, which aren't doing anything for me right now. I just want to die. I've attempted suicide 4 times. What should I do?

We all have those moments of weakness where we feel like we simply can't go on anymore. But truth is, we can. Think about all the people you will hurt and devestate expecailly your wife. You have a son, things may be bad now....but think about all the beauty in watching him grow in man. You were put in  this world for a reason, don't quit. As hard as it may sound you have to find so wat to get you life back in order....this is your life, you only get one....there is so much to see, touch and feel. Im sure you are an amazing person.



Find what you love doing, and go out there an make something of yourself because we are all braver and stronger then we think. Once you find what you love....everything just kinda falls into place. The first step is to learn to love and find youself and also realize that life is gift, its a beautiful one and embrace it.

Show your wife that you can get though this and make a better life for yourself. Just because she left, doesn't mean she doesn't love you anymore or has given up on you. Because as hard as it is for you, it is for her. Don't give up....don't leave your beautiful wife and son alone in this world because as much as you need them, they need you. Family never quits or gives up on each other.



The brave are simply those with the clearest vision of what is before them - glory and danger alike and notwithstanding, go out to meet it.



When there is something that you really want. Fight for it. Don't give up no matter how hopeless it seems. And when you lost hope. Ask yourself if your gonna wish you gave it just one more shot.

Tell your therapist about your suicide attempts. Keep trying to look for positive things in life. Be open with your friends about needing help. Don't worry- you'll find a medication that will work for you.

How do I stop comparing myself to other people physically and start accepting myself more?



I have had alot of problems with learning to love myself and accept myself for the way that I am over just the past few years.  I'm not sure what led up to this.  Maybe it could be because i'm almost thirty?  Maybe because most people are so stuck on the physicality of someone that I don't give myself credit enough that i'm an attractive person on the outside, therefore i'm always feeling ugly or just "ok" and always wishing I looked different.  I've tried all I can think of to not feel this way, but it's been in vain.  Anytime I see an attractive guy, I feel bad about myself.  I wish I looked like that person OR i'll just get frustrated and not watch tv or go out or read magazines or heck, even get online.  All in the fear that i'll see more beautiful people and feel even worse about myself.  I prepared dinner tonight and right as I was about to sit down to eat, I saw this guy on television and I suddenly lost my appetite.  Not because he was ugly, but because he was so attractive, I looked at myself and felt ugly.  Can anyone help?  I know other people out there know what this is and how it feels.  I guess i'm just hoping someone can give me some great advice to help me deal with it.  Thank alot for all your help.

You know, I felt that way for a long time and it was so bad that I couldn't even talk in front of people because I felt so ugly and stupid. I found the problem was that I was consuming too much media. I was looking at magazines, TV shows, movies, and actresses that get paid millions of dollars a year to LOOK GOOD. And have their hair and makeup done by people that get paid millions of dollars a year to make them look good. And airbrushed models etc etc... I stopped spending so much time looking at that stuff and started working on myself - physically as well as mentally. I read books, took a guitar class, attended the gym. 
My advice is STOP looking at those images that make you feel bad about yourself. DO something to make yourself feel better. Do things that you have always really really wanted to do but haven't for whatever reason.
Much luck! :)

i know what you are feeling kind of. my boyfriend and i came up with this thing so that i wouldn't think people are like perfect and it helped bring up my self esteem. it's like where we take one of the attractive girls and find a flaw in her body and once i do that i'm like well she has this so she's not perfect. i know it's putting people down but it has also helped me realize even pretty people have flaws and they are still good looking and they worry about not being perfect just like me. also i use to look in the mirror and tell myself that i am perfect and over time i began to believe it. i picked my best features and made them stand out so that my little things didn't matter that much anymore.

Wow. Find things you like to do, go after women... find one that's at your "attractiveness" level? You wont care at that point... I'm sorry but that is upsured, there is much MUCH more to life than how you look, plenty of "beautiful" people are completely empty and depressed.



Make your outlook change, opt for a relaxed and go with the flow existence. You can be confident is so many other areas I'm sure.

First and foremost you must realize that you are not perfect. None of us are, not the men on tv or in the magazines. We all have flaws. Accept your flaws by embracing them. start loving yourself. Have faith in yourself, think positive and then start working out, running, walking, going to the gym and watching what you eat
You have already started dealing with your issues by talking about them.

I would guess that the brain is like a super super computer..although our conscious memory is aware of very very little, our subconscious is super powerful...and is CONSTANTLY processing everything we see and do within the day...and it is running scenarios, scenarios to try and deal with any problems that may arise...or just anything that may arise, not necessarily problems but just situations, like sitting down and watching TV...

Ever notice than when you get a deja vou, it feels like you DREAMT it before? I would guess that you have already...out of the millions of possabilities you subconscious brain pours over (like a chess computer) on occasion it get it right, from all of the experiences you have it predicts what the future outcome will be- and you experience Deja Vou.

It seems almost supernatural, but that's because we use SO little of our brain in everyday life that its surprising that the thing records and processes billions and billions of things everyday, every smell, color, word, etc...Its all in there, we just don't use it. (like our pinky toe)

Want the honest answer - ? Go out, find and bring home my dead cat. It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. It was winter. He had had a heart attack and was frozen stiff under a neighbor's front porch stairs. He had managed to crawl in under there to die alone and in total peace. I was in tears and walking home with him in my arms, holding him as close to my chest as I possibly could, crying my eyes out. His fur was all wet with my tears when I got home. He was the dearest thing on earth to me. It was my turn to have to collect and bury my dear little friend. I had named him Baby Puss and he trusted me utterly. As a small kitten, he had originally been thrown out a car window  at a McDonald's drive through, all hunkered down in a small ball, cars rushing by him and was in total shock when I first got him. He lived a perfectly quality life with me for over fourteen years. He trusted me totally, and would sit beside my big chair in our living room waiting for me to come home from work volunteering at a local charity retail store. Baby Puss. He would wait for me beside my chair. He would always welcome me home again that way without fail. He would sometimes wait over an hour like that until I came home. Loyal...faithful... constant...my little friend.



Source(s):



I have been blessed to own and care for a number of precious cats, all of whom I have loved dearly and with everything in me, but this little orange cat was different. He had been scared to death and I nurtured him back to wellness over those fourteen years. When he died, something got ripped out of the front of my chest. I will never forget him and I will love him and I hope one day to hold him in my arms again. If that were to ever happen it would be my definition of Heaven.



Sent with positive energies from Chris in South Portland, Maine, U.S.A. I am 65, so I have an idea of what love means, and I can honestly say I loved Baby Puss...

The hardest thing I have had to do?
Gosh...I have a huge lists just for that.
For the last 2 and half years,, i've been dropping out of school and college, i've been find it so hard to concentrate on my school work when i have my parents contantly fighting and always in the middle to try and stop them fighting. Because of this, it makes me stop hanging around with friends alot, makes me lose my confidenece. I wanted to leave home. And when I did, I met a guy, he changed my life, but the only problem is, my parents dont like him and dont want me to be with him. Esp when hes in another country.
And now, if i do go and live with him and get married to him, that means leaving my own homeland, my family, my friends, to a country i've never been to, a country that i dont know anybody, a country which is America...

That doesnt stop me, though it is hard, but I want to be with my man, I dont ever want another guy but him.

How do you feel when  your wife does not involve in normal conversations with you?



She loves you but avoids talking to you on any subjects, rather enjoys other SILENT stuff like movies, books, internet, etc. That does not mean she is bad in conversations, she is very intelligent. Maybe your questions are dumb for attracting any of her attention or time?

In my case, it's that after being married so long (and so well), we don't need many words to communicate.  A lifted eyebrow or a head tilt is often enough to speak many sentences.  But, since we commute together, for about an hour each way, every day, we have at least 2 hours of steady conversation 5 times a week.

I feel like ending my life?



I've been thinking about it for a couple of months now but I never get myself to do it, I always think, "maybe next time". I don't even know why I'm on Earth because my life basically sucks and I know that many of you will think that I'm another teenager who wants to kill themselves but I'm not. I'm 16, I live with my mum and dad, I've never had a family other than them because my Dads family are a waste of time and my Mums are in another country. I've never ever seen them, I've never been on holiday either. I’m really ugly, I have buck teeth and I don't really have much confidence either, yet I'm forced to hang around with cool people at college. Nobody wants to be my friend, I'm guessing because of my appearance. I'm short (4"10), I sweat an awful lot... my college is a 25 min walk from where I live and everyday I have to stand 5 mins outside the college before I go in because I'm in a pool of sweat. This really gets me down. I've never really had any friends at primary school and secondary school, I mostly got bullied by my peers, this got worse in secondary school. Me and my mum always argue at home, I don't know why. She says that I have an attitude at home but when I'm outside I'm like a chicken, that's completely true. She can never take a joke, and I joke around a lot because I can't help myself and the way she just shuts me up or blanks me really winds me up so I just snap back and then it goes into an argument. I'm always rude to my Dad but I don't know why he takes it. I'm a loner; I have no friends, no cousins, nothing. Even if I do die, nobody would miss me... probably only my parents. I’m recently getting down because I’m girl; I don’t want to be a girl because it’s horrible. Boobs, other ****, it’s getting worse everyday and I can’t stop hating myself. I can’t stop looking at everybody else and wishing I were them, but they’re not THAT special, so why do I think this? I hate the way people look at me, the way they judge me by my appearance, just because I have buck teeth doesn’t mean I’m stupid. I’m actually moderately clever, I’m doing A levels at college right now but being by myself all the time gets me down. But don’t get me wrong, I am independent. I don’t know what to do… I don’t want to have one to one’s with anyone because I did all that in school when I was getting bullied and it doesn’t work, it’s all bullsh-t.

Thankyou for the replies everyone, it definitely made me think a lot harder, and made me cry a lot too. I agree with Dodoria, the fact that I haven't till now means something, but each time I tell myself that I'm going to give it another go, something worse happens or I end up feeling shittier. I did make this friend in college who's in two of my classes but whenever class ends she doesn't want to hang with me but go with her friends from her other class, it gets me down. Sometimes I think she's a user, she even have me her appointment letter to give to the teacher today and I did it, I don't know why. I really should stand up to people. I'm planning on ignoring her tomorrow and see how SHE feels about it, my Mum told me once that it's only when you ignore people they want to talk to you. Again, thanks for the replies, it really means a lot to me.

Your life is special and you sound like an intelligent person as you mentioned who is independent.  If you truly don't want one on ones, trying calling your local help line and just talk.  Try to volunteer someone in your area and find out what your good at and see that doing for others will make you feel good.

Please don't do anything serious - you're worth it.

Get a pet, I know it might sound silly but when I felt like life was **** I self harmed I even thought about suicide, I really regret it. I always thought of my dog and it helped me get over it. Talk to your mum or dad about this, even a teacher. Look how far you have got in life, even research people who have lost someone to suicide and see there reactions. Please don't do anything stupid!

Being 16 is hard but all you need to do is work out what is making you unhappy and make steps to change it. So you say you have buck teeth - well now is the perfect time to get a brace and get them fixed while it's free. Also you say you have to walk 25 mins to college which gets you hot - well why not get a bus or even a moped you can ride one at 16 and this would give you more freedom. You feek you don't have mates at college, well why not get a part time job maybe in a shop or a pub where other people your age work, places like that sre less clicky than colleges and you will make friends that way. As for your parents well everyone struggles with their parents when they are a teen. And also remember life has it's ups and downs you are just on a down at the moment and things will get better and you will look back on this and think how silly you were being.

Please don't do something that is not right. You may think you're ugly but what are you like on the inside? You are in turmoil, you need a friend who accepts you for who you are and not an air head who only cares about good looks or pulling fit blokes. You should be able to get help with the sweating from your doctor, go and se him/her and get help. As for the teeth you may be able to get a brace fitted - see a dentist. Bullies are cowards, they pick on the vulnerable, stand up to them and make yourself proud.
Feel free to e-mail me if you need further help.

You really shouldn't do anything like this. The fact that you haven't, proves that you still belong here. Forget about your appearance, because it's not like everyone is so awesome in that are, anyway. You also need to just understand your parents for who they are, and lknow how they'll react to certain things, depending on what it is of course.

Don't worry about wanting to be other people, because for all you know, their lives might be worse then you think. Also; don't feel like that because you're a girl. Girls are precious, and you wouldn't want to be a guy like us; it would just annoy you more then you think.

Please understand that you shouldn't do this because you have a great chance to be someone special, even though you disagree. Good luck.

I'm not going to say "Don't do it". This may sound harsh, but the fact that you have wriiten down the fact that you are taking your own life you probably won't.
My dad phoned me up one night when he found my mum had found a bew partner after her and my dad got divorced. He told me he was stood on Putney bridge and was going to jump.
I know how you feel about being bullied, I was bullied at school, always the odd one out and the more you try to fit in, the worse everything seems to become.
In regards to the sweating, maybe change your deodorant to one targeted for Men. I use Lynx. Men tend to sweat more than women and thus they protect against outbreaks alot better.
Also maybe carry a spare deodorant / body spray in your bag so you can quickly spray some on when you get to school.
In regards to your mum, the fact that your parents seem to be arguing is probably why they seem to be taking things out on you. Things that she would have found funny in the past are more than likely just frustrations and she can not explain this to you which makes her situation worse; hence the shouting.
Have you thought about possibly moving college, start somewhere new where nobody knows you or your past and have a fresh start.
Maybe take some time out to get your head sorted.
You don't sound like your suicidal, you sound depressed, again I do not want to sound harsh. Go and see your GP, explain that you do not want to see a counsellor as you don't think they can help. Maybe he can put you on some anti depressants. If you tell him you might be suicidal then the chances are he / she will not give them to you (overdose potenetial).
All I'm going to say is keep your chin up and remember you are not alone on this world. There are others out there who will be feeling the same as you.
Are there any club / activity groups in your area that you could join?
I hope I haven't come across to harsh, but I'm not going to mollycoddle you and in certain ways make you feel worse.
Just look after yourself, but please try and talk to someone.
Wishing you all the very best x

You see, someimes **** really happens. Worst case scenario is if **** happens everyday. Why don't you start thinking this way... You get straight A's in school. A good sign for a good future. What I mean is that after schooling, you will definiteley find a good job with a good pay. Then you could have you teeth done. Buy nice clothes. Prove to them that you are not just a push over. If you believe in God, someday he will pay back all the things that you have been through. Just listen to him everynight. You might not hear anything but you will see and feel what he means. Just believe in yourself. You are not bad at all. Just be yourself. You know yourself. Have a good life.

I was suicidal off and on from about 12 to about 35, and the teenage years can be pretty sh*tty at the best of times.

I had a couple of different therapists. The first was for about 18 months and made no real difference to the way I felt about life. A bit like you said about your one to ones.



But I stayed with my second therapist for about 10 years, and he helped me to learn how to love life. So all of the sh*t that had happened to me over the years was all okay.

Talking isn't what it's about. It's being listened to and being allowed to express yourself and be you without other people making fun or having a problem with your attitude. It sounds like you get little of this sort of help in your life right now.

If you want my advice: find a young female GP locally and talk to her. If you don't have one at your local doctor's clinic, try a well-woman centre or drop-in centre.



But if you really want to do something about this, you will have to take advice that you might not like on the face of it. God forbid they'll tell you to take some happy pills and to come back in 3 months if you don't feel better. With any luck they'll give you some good advice you feel comfortable with and...well, that's just the first step.

I wish you well.

Please, please don't talk of ending it all......... I know you said you didn't want one2ones but try two things please........ The Samaritans are really practical people who have listened to people in your situation many, many times.  When you ring them they will keep it private - just you and your contact, so that's a help, and they won't have any silly short term answers.  They are prepared to spend hours and hours talking to you trying to sort out your problems (you don't have to meet them face2face it is all done on the end of a telephone.)  They will definitely not pressurise you into doing anything that you don't want to do.  The best thing they do is to listen to YOU and their aim is to help YOU over this period in your life.  I'm sure they will help so look them up in the phone book and give them a ring, I'm sure they will sort things out for you.

Second, if you don't want to do the above then ring your NHS Direct and ask them if they have a psychiatric department where you can talk to a psychiatrist.  This may not be as private as the Samaritans but I'm sure it will be a help.

The thing with both of these alternatives is that they are not a quick-fix, it will be long a term solution to your problems with an aim of helping you in the long term, which, seeing as you are intelligent and young may not take as long as it would with an old fart like me.

Good luck - hope it all goes well for you

i've felt really low at times and had negative thoughts. But in all that, I have always realized that nothing beats the light at the end of the tunnel. Growing up is really hard and believe it or not, i thought i was ugly too and i was called 'rake teeth' by my siblings, but now i know am pretty. Its all a phase that passes. Get involved in activiteis that make you happy and active-it doesnt have to be school and if you cant make friends, try and see if you attitude scares people off. Get involved in social networking sites and occupy your time. That way, you take your mind off negativity. Good luck!!!

Yes we should always tell the truth!

If you don't tell the truth and your lie gets discovered you will looses the trust of the person you lied to in the first place.

I had to learn the hard way with my boyfriend I kept things from him and he doesn't trust me as much as he used to, he told me that if I kept lying he would leave me and when I did him the truth he didn't fully believe me, trust me truth is always the best answer!

Well, depends on what it is. Sometimes you have to lie to protect yourself, its not good to habitually lie but if you need to do so for protection out of fear then lying is okay. Its pretty much a "necessary evil" at times.



Other than that if you can't lie say nothing at all. Sometimes being too direct can hurt even more believe me.



(Mind you I'm all for honesty, but it depends on the situation when it comes to exactly how you should go about it. Sometimes being honest is not what it seems).

Yes, you should always tell the truth. If it's a painful truth, try to avoid saying it altogether; if you can't then you just have to, well, say the truth.

Although some truths are too painful to be revealed or when revealed, will cause terrible damage. In that case, a little lie might help at first, but the truth will indeed come out at the end anyway.

For example, when my aunt and her family died in an accident, our family lied to grandpa, telling him that she's overseas or something hence her absence. Telling him the outright truth straightaway would have caused irreversible health damage to him and will do no good at all. Eventually, he realised what had happened and took it hard, but I do believe it is better that way than revealing the terrible truth at one go.

Yes i do think we should always tell the truth and be straight forward even if it does hurt, because a lie will always be found out, and when it is, it can be more damaging than the truth i have always spoke straight and even though it has got at people but in the end they have been grateful for telling the truth.

<question>



I think i'm being abused?



I'm currently living with my partner a father of my baby, recently things have changed between the two of us, he started being so in-secured over stupid things, i can't talk to any man, he accuses me of sleeping with him nor when he comes from work he checks on all the phones in the house who's been calling me then calls the person back, i'm in a terrible situation as my parents disowned me after having a baby with someone they do not know and who does not want to be known. Im not working at the moment we are relying on him and he treats me like a piece of trash, he is not talking to me at the moment and the situation is so tense i really don't know what to do...



</question>



<additional details>



The thing is he knows that my family has disowned me he sometimes tries to be sympathetic, but when he starts behaving like this i think he is taking an advantage of it. I love him, but i think i have a problem myself of not knowing how to stand for myself, so he always thinks he is right no mater how hard i try to talk but he always find ways to win the conversation and i end up crying.

Try going to social services, or you can call the steve wilkos or maury show, if your into that type of thing.
I'd suggest steve wilkos, I'm not sure if social services can do much if your not being physically abused, but an angry giant bald man might just scare him straight.

i think you need to leave.
maybe if you talk to your family about your situation they will understand and help you out.
this kind of behaviour is NOT normal and NOT right, if he is making you feel scared and unsafe i think you should leave him for the sake of you and your baby.
you dont deserve to be treated this way.
this kind of relationship could turn agressive, you dont want to take a risk.
hope things work out,

that sounds like a really difficult situation for you!  you aren't happy at home, but don't know where to go if you got out..?  have you any friends who you can talk to about this and see if they have any advice, or whether they can put you up for a few days if things worsen?

Ultimately of course, it's up to you what you do in this situation.  But if was me I'd say DEFINITELY get out!  It can never be healthy for you to stay with someone who you're unhappy with and who doesn't treat you with respect.

hes not phisicly abusing u but i think baybe emtionally he is. try and talk to him and tell him u have nothing to hide so he just has to relax. ask him if has any problems at work or somthing and thats why he is being so upset. if he starts hurting u try to talk to ur parents for help. once they hear ur getting hurt its there parent helper that will go off and rescue u
if they dont pick up, then just leave a message or try to visit their house 
dont wrry everything will be okay
and if he hurts u go straight to the police and make sure that he will never touch u again.

Well, 
I'm sorry to hear that.
Congrads on your baby by the way.
He is being WAY too paranoid, and that's not right.
Talk to him and tell him something like you swear that your not cheating. He needs to trust you because that's the main thing in a relationship. If he says he can't, tell him that this relationship isn't going to work. If he continues to behave this way tell him that your breaking up with him or go to therapy. 
Hope I helped. 
&& good luck to You!

One great big red flag is the fact that he does not want your family to know him!!!! The first thing a potential abuser does is separate the intended victim from his or her family. This is because the victim now has no support system. you need to contact your local domestic violence shelter asap. I think you can do this by email. Or, call a friend and have them call for you. Also, try contacting your parents. Yes they may have disowned you, but that in and of itself is not a permanent thing. If the first thing out of your mouth is I love you and need your help to escape, well, it is a cold parent that won't help after that. Start going over in your mind what you will take at a moment's notice. be ready to leave as soon as possible. DO NOT STAY!!!!! He is setting you up to hurt you! First you, then the baby. Even though it is scary, you need to get out now and do NOT go back!!!!!

If you feel abused then you are being abused. Do you feel you can talk to him or are you scared of his reaction?

How did you get along with your parents before this all happened? I don't think they would truly disown their baby girl, it's probably pride or tradition making them act like this but they wouldn't abandon you and their grandchild at a time like this.



Also what about your girlfriends, could you speak with them about it while he's at work?

Please talk to them and also there are many organisations that can help women in your position, which Country do you live in? I could send you some links.

Take care

You are correct, you are under-going psychological abuse, but the question is why is he behaving in this fashion.



You might want to ask him "What you can I do to help you feel more secure?  "

What can you do to help him feel like you are loyal and with him.  While at the same time you might suggest to him that he is just being paranoid and it's really hard on you but you want to work with him to help show him that he has nothing to worry about.



You need to be more specific please, tell us how he is treating you that is treating you as a piece of trash, and what you are doing in response to or to invite this kind of reaction.  Many people are lashing out because they feel they are being cheated or let down and don't know how to communicate what is bothering them so instead they just act like jerks to the people around them hoping they get the message.



Edit: Fixer of all is correct about creating seperation, I am not certain about something in here, is this man the father of your baby, is did he come after the father of your baby?



Though I disagree about this idea of "setting you up for abuse" this almost seems to imply that his behaviour is designed intentionally to hurt you.  This is doubtfully the case, he is more likely just terribly insecure and well... a fearful coward that doesn't trust outside sources having influence over you.  You of course need to be thinking about you and your child's safety first, but it is possible that with some therapy he will be able to get past his insecurities, though the question is, is that the ideal situation for you and your child?

Space is wrong, do not ignore the situation, no offense space but if she ignores the situation it isn't going to get better.



I don't agree with CeeCee's method of standing up for yourself, but yes you should stand up for yourself and it is possible she is on to something suggesting he may be committing infidelity, for people to act strangely and jealously when they are cheating on you is very common.  It may also be a good idea to reverse the role on him to show him what it feels like to be tormented by a jealous lover, but tell him that's what you are doing so he can understand what it feels like, it may be a good method of making him more sensitive to your feelings.  But you have to tell him that's what you are doing otherwise it may look like you are just being mean and punishing.

It's obvious.
That's why he's insecure because he's noticing how easy it is to cheat..so he thinks your gonna do it.

Stand up for yourself. Call him out. Say.."Piiisssstakerrrr..what the fuk is your problem.."..Get a backbone..you pushed out his fuking kid..so you HAVE EVERY RIGHT..! Next time he checks the phones..smash every fuking phone up in the house and say "now there ain't no fuking phones to check wannnker"!...I wouldn't have a BAR of it!!

I know it seems impossible to get out, but you must do it! He is showing signs of an abuser. Many women have been killed or permanantly scarred by boyfriends or spouses. They always start out by just being jealous and controlling. Checking the phones and keeping you isolated from family and friends is the first step. Make sure you have a plan to get out safely. I'm sure if you talk to your parents they will help you to get out. They love you. They want what is best for you. If they won't help for some reason,  get a job or get on public assistance. There are also shelters that will protect women and children. In the meantime, tell anyone that calls you to use *67 before they dial you so that he can't trace the calls. Speak to a neighbor that you can trust to watch for your porch light. If you feel you are in danger, turn your porch light on. Tell your neighbor that if they see your porch light on to call the police. Set up a code word with people you talk to on the phone that if you use the code word you need help and to call the police. As soon as you receive public assistance, go to a shelter. Just get out before it gets worse. You need to protect yourself and especially your child.

Engage yourself in the activity that you like, example listen to music, draw pictures etc.. If you have exposure to computer, try to learn something new daily, if interested. Also find relaxing techniques.  Enjoy your time at home with baby, watch TV etc.

Do the best you can and think positively. Don't beat yourself up, over his action. If it has been good all married life, the his change is only for a while.  Make a life for yourself in your world, that you can enjoy.

If you have been good, keep the faith. Make a routine for you. Don't disturb your self. Don't be provoked, Just handle the things in calm fashion. Keep reminding him that you can help him, wherever possible to get over this issue.

depression is a long term thing where you constantly feel sad .



you can feel sad for a couple of days and then get over it. but getting over a depression takes more than a few days.



if it's a mild one it could take up to a couple of weeks or few months...but if it's more serious it will take much longer.

depression can sometimes be a react after a bereavement, or a tragic event, you tend to act out of character i.e scared to go outside or meet people, you tend to end up not living life but merely just trying to survive
the only way i can describe the feeling for me was like being stuck in quick sand; every piece of bad luck/stress/problem feels like an added layer of sand and you feel like you can't escape.

Whereas as feeling sad you can cry for a bit and feel better after the cry and can move on

Depression is looking at everything in a dark way. Not having any good thoughts and feeling low.



Sad is feeling like crying over a loss but being able to laugh as well and handling most things ok.

Are you guilty of fantasising too much when you get the slightest bit of good news?



For example do you have one date with someone then imagine marrying and moving in with the person and having kids and what would all your friends say and where you'd take holidays together. Also what sort of things do you do in your fantasies?

Isolating myself socially,....young depressed...Am I doing the right thing by..?.?



I dont speak with any of my "friends" at school anymore. I thought they were my friends for these three years in highschool but they are those "messed up friends" who call you names and are cool with you other times...some names are racist making fun of my skin color or the way I look..after three years of abuse I have said enough is enough and I have ignored them when they tried to talk to me...some friends seem to wonder whats wrong with me...this is strictly the senior class....some of my friends are a little disturbed..but I dont freaking care anymore..so.. I have isolated myself socially.....male seventeen years old



P.S. Oh yeah. The only people I speak with is my best friend, Charles outside school, my girlfriend, who goes to another school, and a friend from my school who has always been cool to me...

she is quite a shy person and this year she is first year uni(we live in australia) and when she isnt at uni she comes home into her room and plays her guitar or studies. she never goes out anymore because she cant be bothered with all those pathetic high school teens that are immature. at the end of the day, you dont need them! you dont need people who tease you, it sounds like you have a lovely girlfriend and that is all that matters. those outsiders will just bring you down and inside you know you are the better person :) all those losers can do is talk about you but when you show you dont care they know they are not getting anywhere. goodluck :)

I can relate to what you're going through somewhat.  it definitely isn't good to isolate yourself from everyone, but i do think it's a good thing that you're distancing yourself from the so-called friends who sometimes call you names.  they really don't sound like true friends to me.  friends shouldn't make you feel like crap!  just make sure you don't punish yourself by shutting EVERYONE out.  consider yourself lucky that at your age, you have 5 people who you can call good friends.  good luck!

It might be better to socialise a bit even if you don't like those people. Its a good skill to have  to be able to deal with people effectively. You don't have to be friends with them but being friendly and polite always helps. It would help in later life around the work place and such.

It's perfectly normal.  I went through this at 15 and found that many people begin to realize the difference between real friends and fake friends.  (Erikson's Stage 6 - Isolation vs Intimacy)



A successful person will learn to be selective in those he calls friends and will put others in the 'acquaintance' slot.  Don't fully isolate yourself from the fake friends, but don't let them "in".  This will lead to fuller relationships with the real friends and the ability to make 'small talk' with those who aren't.



Since Erikson's theory has empirical evidence, it's best to keep in mind that at the end of your life, you want to be happy with the decisions that you've made.



(I believe it is also part of Maslow's level 3 and 4 - Finding those you belong with and getting respect from those you find valuable.)

Why did my therapist ask when was the last time I wet my bed or crapped in my pants?



We were talking about if I had ever been sexually abused and I dont believe I ever was, then she asked me when was the last time I remember wetting my bed or peeing in my pants or crapping in my bed or crapping in my pants



What does this have to do with sexual abuse and what does this have to do with psychology, I thought the questions were annoying and weird and didnt really have an answer

In looking at your description it would be difficult to 'diagnose' him because it appears that you've painted a rather negative picture of him.  This is because either he's a negative person or you are.  (iow, it's not a very objective description.)



In order to get a better view, get to know him better.  You need to have known him as a child, as a teen and as a young adult before you can fully understand why he is the way he is.



That being said, I agree with hopesclan: he's human.

How to get over food phobias?



Off and on I go through bouts of having food phobias, which is really odd and paranoid I know, but sometimes I have to actually stay in the kitchen with someone to make sure of what they're putting in food, and that it's safe, then sometimes I'll buy something at the grocery store, like say a loaf of bread, but if there's a speck on one piece of the bread that looks even slightly suspicious, I cant eat any of that bread.  this phobia makes me feel like a wasteful person, and makes me feel very guilty, also its hard to explain to a friend, when you go out to eat, that all of the sudden you re not hungry (which you are) because the meat has an odd hue, or the potatoes look as though they've been cooked with something else, or any other assortment of lame things that can look wrong with it?
also it makes others feel weird when I cant eat their food at their house and i have no reasonable explanation for this... other than i'm not hungry (which is an obvious lie if they've been with me all day and i've not eaten).
So how to get over it?? I've tried just eating it afterwords, but i'm so afraid of getting sick, that it sometimes makes me feel sick or even be sick, just because it could.

I'm always seeing the number 11 in time  everywhere ? Especially 9:11 ?



For the past 2 weeks  Ive been Experiencing a very strange phenomenon, seeing the number 11 in time ..Meaning _ when ever I looked at a clock the minute hand is always on  11.. , now at first I didn't think anything of it .. dismissed it entirely..



But after a few days  , got alittle creepy .. now its every time I look at a clock , it would be on 9:11 , playing games , the clock would stop on 9:11 , movies , The movie would pause 9 Min's. 11 seconds into it , on its on .. just strange stuff like that ..



now its progressed to , 3 :11 , 6 :11 , 7:11 and so on , only in time though .. So today I figured I would type into google to see if anybody else has Experienced this strange phenomenon ..



and find Melinie with this posting



"When I look at the clock at random times,
its usually 1:11, 2:11, 3:11 etc...
Especially 9:11. "



needless to say I was shocked somebody had written the exact situation I was experiencing , down to seeing 9 :11 the most ..now that has to be such long odds of experiencing such a specific thing..



Question is , who else has experienced this odd phenomenon ? And for how long ?

pretty much if you are thinking of the number constantly you will notice it more often. you could change the number you are thinking about constantly and you will notice that number everywhere as well. it is just your mind telling you oh remmeber that number its right here too.

me too, I look at the clock about 6 times a day, and usually about 2 of the times each day I see ?:11.
do you know anything of the Law or Attraction?
if you start thinking of the number 9:11. The more this number will pop up in your life. I use the Universal Law of Attraction to  access great power for my life. So do all our big leaders (Rockerfellow, G.Bush and other acult like people)
I like Blue Star, it's an awesome book upon a real phenomenon story of the author.

Sounds spooky the way you describe it.



What I believe is happening though is that you look at the clock several times a day, but only consciously remember when its 11 past the hour.  You have, through your 'fear', trained your subconscious to alert you whenever it sees the number 11.  Isn't the mind wonderful!

Lots of people experience this. I don't want to burst your bubble, but it is natural of the human mind to notice things that 'mean' something to them. The fact is that 11 is a memorable suffix to an hour, especially with 9/11 in many people's minds as it was drummed into us by the media. Chances are that you look at the clock many many times in a day (I never noticed how often I looked at my wrist without realising it until my watch broke), but because other numbers seem insignificant, you take notice only of 11.

Yep, the time thing has been happening to me four about 7 years now.  So I decided to make 11 my favorite number. For ex:I was doing a cake walk and the number 11 was called when I was standing on it.  So I won a cake.  If I have to pick a number for anything, I use the number 11 and I will win.



But I also started noticing how much the number 11 has showed up in history like the date something big happened there is a number 11 in it like 11-01-44.  That date adds up to 11 and has the number 11 i it.  What about 9-11?



Just go with it.  I think 11 or 111 or 1111 are great numbers!

Perhaps they are right. Perhaps they are wrong. Maybe you're delusional.



Do you think you're a jerk? What's a "good" guy? Is this the the "good" guy you think other people may regard in the same positive manner.



If its a girl whos calling you a "jerk", are you being sexist, vulgar, deregatory? Are you messing people around?



Do you treat people with the same respect they treat you. It doesn't matter, you should always treat people will respect even if they dont to you. At least you'll feel the better person.



Its easy to say: "Stop being a jerk". but we haven't even established the problem. It may be that there isn't even a problem. You consider yourself a good guy, but clearly other peoples opinion is important to you, so theres definitely some self doubt there.



Do you think you treat people with dignity, kindness and respect. If you do, then there should be no issue. If people think youre a jerk, then screw them. They are not worth your time. But if you think otherwise, try this:



Imagine every action you make and every word you speak. Imagine that someone is saying that to you. Comprehend your situation, their emotions, their feelings. Empathize with them. Can you ascertain a problem, does something not feel right. IF the answer is yes, maybe you need to change.



As much as i despise having to change, sometimes its necessary, but i certainly dont condone a whole personality "revamp" as it were. And that means you shouldnt pretend to be someone youre not, just to be well liked.



1. Treat Others with respect. Treat yourself with respect
2. Be kind and be fair.
3. Believe in yourself. But dont be arrogant.



Chances are if you follow these tips, people will see you for the "good guy" you really are.

There must be a reason why people call you a jerk. Evaluate your actions. Ask a close friend or a family member, "Why do people think I am a jerk"....dont ask them if they think you are a one because they might not be honest.



Think about how you interact with other people. Be deliberate with your actions. Would you say you are aloof? You may be a good guy, but the way you present yourself to others or even treat them make them think otherwise.

Human beings are uniquely tuned into the world around them. We are born with the capacity to be shaped by our environment. We copy the sounds of our language, imitate the gestures of our family, vibrate with the emotions of others, absorb the feedback we get about how we should be. It's a huge strength, the bedrock of civilised society, the only route to proper togetherness. We call it empathy. Those who lack it are not very nice.
The challenge of maturity is to balance such empathy with a strong sense of self. Clearly, that's a difficult road to travel and none of us makes it entirely. Nor should we. Deaf to the sounds that others make, we become selfish, static, boring and very hard to like. Needing too much feedback, on the other hand, turns us into emotional blotting paper.



Find a balance.

1. Deal in reality. Don't lie to yourself or others.
2. If you make a promise, keep it.



3. Have compassion toward others, especially the weak.

Wrong Yahoo site for this.



"Jesus" (Hebrew: Yeshua, or "Joshua") of Christianity and the New Testament is likely not to be an actual historical person, but a made-up religious hero similar to other fictive religious figures throughout history. There is nothing to suggest that he actually existed as a human being.



The Bible (specifically, the New Testament's four gospels, three of which are almost the same, present conflicting stories. There is NO credible evidence outside the four gospels.



Jesus is featured in the four gospels: Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John. None of these people knew Jesus. In fact, we don't know who they were, and the names Mark, Matthew, and John were added later to give the gospels credibility. Luke is likely to have been an actual person (a doctor who was a friend and companion of St. Paul).



Mark contains no birth or resurrection stories. It is the basis for Matthew and Luke; Matthe and Luke each include more than 90% of Mark. When we put the three gospels side by side, we see that they are almost identical. They are called "synoptic" (from the Greek: synopsis = view together) because of this "parallel" effect.



-- Mark appears to be the first gospel, and contains short stories of things Jesus is reported to have said and done. If Jesus actually existed, this gospel comes closest to giving the bare bones of the man and what he said.



-- Matthew includes nearly all of Mark, adds a few thigns, and re-arranges Jesus' life for his own purposes. "Matthew" wrote to convince the Jews of 65 AD that Jesus was the promised Messiah. In many places Jesus is made to look like the other great Hebrew leader, Moses. Thus his "sermon on the mount" is meant to remind Jewish readers of Moses on the mountain getting the ten commandments.



-- Luke is part of a set of two books (the other being "Acts") which gives a history of early Christianity starting with Jesus' ministry. Since Christians had begun to be a force in the Roman Empire, Luke went out of his way to present Jesus as no threat to Rome, and fobbed that threat off on the Jews. Thus Luke had the Jews, not the Romans, putting Jesus to death. It was this anti-semetic flavor that make Luke's gospel the favorite of Adolph Hitler.



So much of the three gospels is obviously "made up" to present a certain portrait of Jesus that we can't be sure what Jesus really said or did...except for the parables. These little stories to illustrate his points are general agreed to be the only true "Jesus words" in the Bible.



Matthew and Luke both have stories of Jesus' birth and resurrection. They are all different, and were obviously added many years after the original gospels were written, to prove something or other about Jesus. The Christmas "Nativity" plays combine them all. The birth narratives are so obviously full of fiction, falsehoods, and contradictions that they are laughable. (King Herod never called for a census. That was added to get Mary and Joseph to the place where the book of Isaiah predicted the Messiah would be born.)



--  John is the fourth gospel, and is entirely different fom the other three. It is aimed at countering the first Christian heresy: Gnosticism. In it, Jesus is a symbol and part of a secret code; only those who knew it would get into heaven. John treats Jesus as "the Word made flesh," or "incarnated." The Word being the cretive word spoken at cretion: "Let there be light."



The only other place the name "Jesus" appears outside the New Testament is in the two histories written by the Jewish historian, Josephus. Unfortunately, he slanted his histories to what those who paid him wanted to hear. When he wrote a history of the Jews for the Jews, he made the Jews sound good. When he wrote for the Roman Emperor, he made the Jews sound bad. There are a few references to someone named "Jesus" but these were clearly added some centuries later to give "proof" that Jesus lived. Since then there have been constant efforts to discover "the historical Jesus" because there is so little to prove that he existed at all.



So you ask: "Do you believe in Jesus?" Which Jesus are you asking about? There are as many views of him as there are Christian groups/churches/believers. And one of the biggest problems of all is that believing in Jesus does not make him "exist" any more than believing in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy makes THEM exist!

I'm not sure exactly where you are trying to go with this question or what you hope to get out of it, but here's my thoughts on things.
I believe that Jesus exists or existed, but I don't choose to put my faith in him. I'm a person that believes in a bigger world than just us. I think that there are probably many gods and goddesses out there and that we should respect all equally even if we don't follow their teachings. Personally I like to give tribute to the old world gods and goddesses. But whatever you believe as long as you really believe it and it makes you happy is a good belief system and you should go with what you believe. Having a open mind is good but in your heart and soul you will know what is right for you, even if it isn't what is right for everyone else.

Yes I do,  Read the bible, if you want help, join a free bible study. Jesus who is the son of God died on the cross for your sins, so that you could go to heaven. He is the only reason you are here on this earth. If you don't believe in him, and ask for your sins to be forgiven you will burn in hell for eternity. Anyone that disagrees has not read the entire bible.  This world is full of sin, soon God will come to get us (His followers), and take us to heaven. The rest who refuse to believe in God will then go to hell, and live with the devil and his followers for eternity.  Talk to your paster.

An emotional affair with a friend...what should I do?



I have fallen in love with a very close friend who has girlfriend. He would call me most of the time, stay for hours on the phone and tell me everything. I thought he should not be spending that much time with me but to his GF. Because we spend so much time talking my feelings for him became stronger. I think its what you call an emotional affair. He told me several times before that he likes me but he is already comitted. Because we have been like this for a long time I told him I love him and that we cant be friends anymore because it would be hard for me to control my emotions. I did not ask him if he loves me too. He would not let go of me initially insisting that we remain friends because we started out as friends. But after that we have not talked again. He stopped calling. What happened? I thought he wanted us to remain as good friends. Did I confuse him? Where is this friendship going now?

It seems you like him and he likes you a lot , but that doesn't mean you two know each other well. This kind of problem happen when a guy committed or a girl committed , they freak a bit and thinking that there might be better chances for them. Especially, you showed up and let go of your feeling, that will confuse him for real. The best advise i can tell you is that you get busy away from him. I know it is hard, but i think a guy like him who might take a decision under emotional control, will wake up later on and regret. Give him a space to wake up, it is good for you. However, he didn't call you again since, which means he is thinking. If you call or start it, you will interrupt his peace.

I do find it strange that he stopped calling so suddenly if he felt anything towards you, either as a friend or more.  But not knowing the guy, its impossible for me to say what might be going through his mind.



You need to first ask yourself what you expected from him.  You ask, "Did I confuse him?".  Well you said you didn't want him to to be friends with you anymore, and now he doesn't ring.  So where exactly is the confusion?  I think, to be honest, that you are the one confused.



Were you hoping perhaps that he would make a decision between you and his girlfriend?  That is how it sounds from where I am standing.  Pehaps you were hoping that he would claim his undying love for you, or even just to carry on ringing and saying he wanted to remain friends anyway.



You need to sort out how you feel first, then plan your next move.  Do you want to try and rekindle the friendship?  Do you want to be his girlfriend?  Do you want to attempt to break up his romance (not recommended cos a real friend wouldnt do that)?

Actually, you should stay away from him for the time being so he can evaluate his priorities in life.  He's kinda having his cake and eating it too.



You were right to separate yourself and the relationship he has with you SHOULD be with his gf.  (And I commend you being respectful of his gf's position.)



Chances are you are more valuable to him than his gf.  I seriously question any guy who says he's committed to a gf but then spends all his time with you.  If you mean that much to him, he'll find a way out of the relationship and find a way to be with you.



After all, you deserve his full attention.

It would be very difficult, but if you shot yourself through the cheeks (bullet entering one and exiting the other) you might be able to, if you could keep the pain from making you involuntarily dropping the gun. Maybe if you took tons of morphine in advance...?

You could also have a gun in each hand and shoot through head, seems like the easiest way.

Yup, if you're lucky (: well, not lucky in the sense of being shot but... you know what I mean. Some people have gotten shot in the head before and lived to tell about it, so, yes, there isn't a good chance, but you can.

My older brother went to university many years ago. We shared a bedroom in our house. He had an old US 2 dollar bill in his dresser drawer. I traded it for a ring. I wore the ring to school for two weeks untill some bigger guys started acusing me of stealing it from them



Maybe the ring was stolen but I bought it with a two dollar bill, which wasn't mine anyway. As the story moves on, they beat the livin beejeevers out of me and took said ring away. I have lived with this guilt for years. I can't go back and unsteal the two dollar bill.



The moral of this true story is your choice.

This might be silly but when I was little I was notorious for stealing produce.  Whenever we went to the grocery store I was always munching and my mom finally figured out when she checked my pockets and found grapes, berries, and crackers from the salad bar.  I guess I figured that they were there for my entertainment and delight.  I can laugh about it now, but when you think about it is kind of gross considering how many people have touched them.  I never got caught at the store, but my mom was sure peeved.

Don't worry about it. When i was younger i stole money from friends and family. I was so jealous that i did not grow up with the things i wanted. I was a big thief for the longest time. I turn eighteen years of age and gave my life to Christ, and he change my sticky fingers ways. I even stole from my own grandmother, who just passed away this pass Saturday. I am now in my thirties, but people can change, especially if Christ is the center.

Its not only some people worry but i think they are more than some.It is because of your age growth.It is becasue of your home family environment.It is because of how your parents treat you in your younger age.I saw many peaople happy and enjoying even they were in bad times but i always saw smiles on their faces.Your environment is very effective on your feeling and thoughts. There is nothing to worry about short life.Every one knows that every living thing will die.

People worry because it alerts them to possible negative situations that might happen so that they can adequately prepare for them.



The problem with worrying occurs when it is a situation that they can’t do anything about or when it is a trivial problem or when they already have a solution but they continue to dwell on it.



When nothing can be done about a problem there is no benefit to worrying about it! Worrying brings physical and emotional ailments and damages interpersonal relationships.



In order to stop worrying people should identify the issue they are worrying about and think of resolutions quickly. Pick one and stick to it. Some people worry a lot because they are indecisive. I have found it best to quickly decide on a resolution, forget about it and shift my focus of attention to something else so that the negative feelings associated with worrying go away.



"The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, not to worry about the future, or not to anticipate troubles, but to live in the present moment wisely and earnestly."



Have a great day!

Superstitions tend to be remnants components of religions that are not heavily practiced anymore.  I can see why someone who practices an older religion or way of life might believe in what you would call superstitions.

Life is exactly the right length.  We come to our lives in order to learn spiritual lessons.  We'll stay here until our lessons are completed.  I've given this a huge amount of thought over the years, and reincarnation is the only thing that makes sense to me.  Okay, I know you didn't ask about reincarnation, but that's the central theme that forms my answer to your question.  If I get a D- in humility this lifetime, I'll be back to bring my grade up in my next life.

There's no way.  That's philosophy and the main feature of the movie The Matrix.  that said, a most famous quote I think by Aristotle goes "I think; therefore, I am"  You exist, if you can even think of that question.

No You can`t. It is a philosophy paradox. Because even if You know You are in comma You cant wake up anyways or 'go outside Yourself'. So actually knowing this doesn't change anything for You. You live this reality and can not go outside.

You should just slapped her. If she was dreaming wouldn't feel anything, but wake up instantly. If in the comma..she wouldn't respond at all.
If the slap would have sent her to comma..she would remember when/if wake up..and never ask such a stupid question again.

coma = unconscious state of being
comma = ,



anyway, Descartes said, "I think, therefore, I am!"



This is a deep philosophical question and cannot be proved one way or the other.  It is not a scientific question and I would ask your chemistry teacher why he asked this question in a "hard" science class.



We have at least 5 known senses.  Everything we KNOW is learned in some way through experiential means.  That is exactly what experimentation in science is...a means of experiencing facts.  The way that we  KNOW is of course based on the first KNOWING...self-knowledge.



God said that His name was/is, "I AM who AM"  God is the one who exists in all places and states at all times.  If God is the ultimate I am then humans created in God's image are also able to say, I am...I exist...



But while there is incredible scientific evidence for creation, the flood, and archaeological and literary evidence for the existence of the cities and ppl of the Bible and logical evidence for the reality of Jesus and His life, death and resurrection; there is NO scientific PROOF of the existence of God.  So no scientific proof for the existence of me and you.

I am real because I feel.



No one can live in a comma because it's a tiny punctuation mark, unless I guess you build a giant comma shaped house, which would be kind of neat, then you could in fact live in a comma.



However I would say that even if you were in a coma, you'd be real, your actual presence may not be real, but you as a human are still real, as you'd have to be a real person to be in a coma.



Unless maybe your teacher is in a coma, and you're actually just some made up thing in his subconscious, but then you wouldn't exist when he wasn't thinking of you, so he'd have to be thinking of you all the time and be in your presence all of the time or you'd disappear completely.



Maybe you do disappear, maybe that's why you can't seem to ever remember anything except for chemistry, weird?



:) just relax a little and realize you are real.

How to get over food phobias?



Off and on I go through bouts of having food phobias, which is really odd and paranoid I know, but sometimes I have to actually stay in the kitchen with someone to make sure of what they're putting in food, and that it's safe, then sometimes I'll buy something at the grocery store, like say a loaf of bread, but if there's a speck on one piece of the bread that looks even slightly suspicious, I cant eat any of that bread.  this phobia makes me feel like a wasteful person, and makes me feel very guilty, also its hard to explain to a friend, when you go out to eat, that all of the sudden you re not hungry (which you are) because the meat has an odd hue, or the potatoes look as though they've been cooked with something else, or any other assortment of lame things that can look wrong with it?
also it makes others feel weird when I cant eat their food at their house and i have no reasonable explanation for this... other than i'm not hungry (which is an obvious lie if they've been with me all day and i've not eaten).
So how to get over it?? I've tried just eating it afterwords, but i'm so afraid of getting sick, that it sometimes makes me feel sick or even be sick, just because it could.

Most food is cooked at pretty high temperatures...so most bacterias that could make you sick would die anyway. Maybe the only thing that you can do is to eat it anyway, even if it looks weird/gross, but only if other people are eating it too. Since you don't trust yourself to be able to know if something is okay or not, watch your friend eat it. Then you know that since they can eat it, so can you. So basically order what your friends order, or try to stick to the same foods...and over time you'll get used to eating that and then maybe you'll be able to start eating stuff that your friends aren't eating.



I don't think you should feel guilty. Sometimes I have to eat things that I think look weird or unappetizing..but then I eat them anyway and make sure to drink lots of water afterwards. I think over time you'll just get used to it and hopefully won't have to think about it as much :)

hi!
do you eat bread? as the yeast fungus can mess up the brain anyhow if you dont like the look of something you dont have to eat it, so dont worry about that bit.
i think st johns wort or a homeopathic or a bach flower essence will help you feel better to avoid this prob
also most of us dont have enough gla, so that can mess with a girls head. You will find gla in evening primrose oil take it with flax or fish oil.
flax is better, its vegatarian. as vitamin e needs to be taken with fish oil.
you will be right, its good to be careful what you eat, i dont usually trust anyones cooking either cos lots of people are simply not very hygienic when it comes to food. You can always eat fresh- fruit etc just wash yourself & eat or take your own snack.
cheers!

I think you should change your life style and it will effect your hormanal behaviour.It is nothing to loose some one. You are very young and energetic.I will give you 3 steps if you do everyday that will change your attitude.



1- Every morning go for long walk in somewhere garding.
2.Reduce phone calls,smoking or drinking if you can do.
3-Sleep minimum 9 hrs every night for atleast 3-months



I believe that after doing this there will be much better than now you will feel.

Is it hard to find someone who actually gives these questions much thought?



hi and thank you for your answer I LOVE YAHOO ANSWERS, sorry about the gender mix up, and i do appreciate your taking the time answer my question,  i can see i didn't make some points very clear, my apologies for that as iam not  very experienced with these kinds of forums i do better with live responses. anyways  i think what you are saying about perfection is there needs to be some kind of conscience purpose to keep the perfection accurate or some reason which shows  cause for it to be perfect.



When i say people are perfect it is because no matter how they act,or choose,or make decisions,  they will always be perfect because of all thier lifes experiences, that means every single experence they've had. it doesn't mean that thier act, choice or decision with be the best for anything in the future, only that it is perfect for them to come up with those acts, choices, or decisions, they cannot do or make any of those without  every experience leading up till that point, i hope iam making myself a little bit clearer on that point, again iam using deffinitions in the dictionary, and the one which says perfection is something without flaws, it is projecting a purpose for it needing to be without flaws, but those flaws got there from some action which again would make the flaws perfect. Even if we dont like it all the good and evil in this world are still perfect, every action or thought comes from a previous reason right before happening, if you bring purpose into it then you are projecting into the future and comparing it to something else,  it's kinda like that song which say EVERY THING IS BEAUTIFUL IN IT'S OWN WAY,



if you change the word beautiful to perfect it describes everything according to itself. and by seeing this it able you to understand that everything is indeed perfect already whether we like it or not lol.  again if you can find something which happens without a reason then it would be imperfect.  reason makes the next action or thought perfect. not that it would answer a question the way someone would like to be but it is still perfect.



free will has nothing to do with your surroundings i dont think, if you make a decision, and could go back in  time to the exact time you made that decision you would make it exactly the same way. a split second difference would change your experiences and therefore give you a chance to make a different decision, but again all things being the same as when you made the decision you would make the same exact decision,  if this is true then where would free will be,. anyways i love discussing issues like these i think it is a great way to spend time as it keeps us and our minds moving and to possible thinking of new things. i know i make long questions and descriptions but thats just the way i am lol take care and thanks for reading this



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Philosophy is not giving thought to a question, rather it is like thinking up the questions in relation to the answers.  Finished in advance. Thus, if you say that every decision is perfect, there would be a perfect outcome, and because everybody is perfect, (God does not make rubbish) all outcomes would be perfect. Thus, the world would be perfect.  See the error in the reasoning?  The decision you make, is the one you must make, as you state so clearly.  Not because it is right or wrong, but because that is how you learn.  Some people need the same error 3 or 4 times before they get it, and some only once.  And the rules behind the decision are, nature, nurture, expectation, experience, trust, religion, ethnicity, etc.  All of them combined to a certain degree.  Add more religion and take away some experience and the decision is completely different.  You have to look at the garbage that that person is carrying with him/her as baggage.  And the fuller the ego is of all that cr@p, the worse the decision becomes. And that relates to religion: "the sins of the fathers....."  What did the extended family, teachers, peers, acquaintances teach the child???  You are worthless!
Peace.

Other possibilities might include, that you heard something and it startled you awake and being so startled caused you to scream, I don't know of any other causes.

It could be the starting point leading up to marriage if the relationship becomes something much more but it could also just be way of becoming close to people; or gaining extra companionship.  You could just be getting to know them, you might fall in love with them or you might not.  It depends on their personality and if their interests are compatible with yours.  It could also be the means to put yourself out there and let others see more of you, learn about you and you can gain more companionships that way.

There is never a "need" to worry, as worrying in itself can never achieve anything positive, or have any influence over events or other people. Worrying is usually a habitual behaviour, and is driven by fear of the unknown. In order to stop it, you need first to trust that whatever will happen, you can and will deal with it as and when it comes.

DO  NOT  WORRY



Jesus went throughout Galilee and the surrounding regions,  preaching the good news about God's kingdom and healing everyone who was brought to him.  Large crowds followed him, so he went up a hill,  sat down and began to teach them.  One of the lessons had to do with worrying about the daily needs of life.



Jesus told them, "No one can serve two masters;  you will end up hating one and loving the other,  or you will be loyal to one and despise the other.  You cannot serve God and money.  This is why I tell you,  do not be worried about the things in your life.  Don't worry about what you will eat or drink;  or about what clothes you will wear.  Isn't life more important than food,  and the body more important than clothes?  Look at the birds: they do not plant seeds,  harvest the food and put it barns,  yet your heavenly Father feeds them every day!  Aren't you worth more than the birds?  Who of you,  by worrying,  can add one moment to your life-span?



And why do you worry about the fashions or the clothes you will wear.  Take a look at the various wild flowers in the many fields around you.  They do not sew or shop for the latest fashions,  but I tell you that not even King Solomon with all his wealth had clothes as beautiful as one of these flowers.  If God can clothe the fields with such splendor,  which blooms today and is gone tomorrow,  won't he take care of providing the clothes that you need?  What little faith you have!



So do not worry, saying,  'What shall we eat?'  or  'What shall we wear?'  (The people living in the world who don't have any use for God are always concerned about these things)  Your Father in heaven knows all the things you need.



First seek God's kingdom and his righteousness,  and all these things will be given to you as well.  Do not worry about tomorrow's trouble;  live one day at a time and know that each day will bring it's own challenge."

We worry about things because we love those things and we are addictive and habitual.It means they are like oxygen to us and we feel if we loose them we will die.To stop this , you have to kill the fear of loose and it is only possible when you change your mental behaviour that control every single instintc in your mind.So you have to do mind excercises and it will help you grow your mental power.There are many mind excercises that will help you upgrade your existing brain version.Be care full when you do these excercises ,You must be alone and concentration is required and if possible you can do all these excercises in somewhere green grass.

Yes it is a good idea to say what you need to say, your opinion is as important as anyones.
But remember the 3 wise monkeys...see, hear & speak no evil!
On the other hand i bet you have a yeast allergy, so take olive leaf to kill the yeast fungus & eat no yeast bread or just make your own chappatis.
The other thing that helped me speak my mind & stand up for myself was to take evening primrose oil with fish oil, (but flax is better than fish)
Bach flower essence or a Homeopathic remedy can help here as well.
Do you have metal fillings? mercury can leach out & that can affect the brain too
Coffee, tuna, microwaves, pasta, cheese, white bread / sugar / rice, homogenised milk, pig meat, yeast, margarine, canola & vaccinations can all make the brain feel bad/unconfident

Hi Jack,
You may have a yeast allergy so eat no yeast bread & take oliveleaf to kill the yeast fungus.
If you have metal fillings the mercury can leach out & affect the brain too. Plastic fillings are better.
One of the best things is to take evening primrose oil with flax oil everyday.
Your opinions are as important as anyones, a Homeopathic formula or a Bach flower formula will help you with this.
Another vital thing is to deflect the radiation from electricity, try keeping a crystal quartz with you all the time.
Or check out the qlink, spiral of tranquility, tesla or zeusite.
Also music from manifestationmeditation

There are many psychological theories suggesting why our memories decline as we age. Some are:



Age related factors: with advancing age, the body's central nervous system slows, and information is not processed with the speed and efficiency it once did



Lack of motivation: If an elderly individual is not interested, or does not find something important enough to remember, they will not be as motivated to remember it



Loss of confidence: research has found that 60 -80 year old's were less confident in their memory skill then 18-30 year old's because they do not believe that their memory is as good as is used to be



A decline in memory systems: over time, we have a gradual decline in episodic memory (the memories of personal events). However, there is hardly any decline in procedural memory (our memories of how to do things) and semantic memory (memories of the facts we know about the world).



Measures of retention: it is also shown that as we age, we decrease i our ability to recall (remember information with no cues), but perform the same on recognition tests (like multiple choice tests). This is because recognition does not require the individual to produce the information by themselves, they have cues (a,b,c,d) to jog their memory

well if you mean like a visual illusion, it is a misinterpretation of real sensory stimuli. This means that what our eyes sees, and what we know is real contradict each other, making an illusion.



A hallucination is the brain's reception of a false sensory input. This means that an individual is experiencing an event through one of their senses that isn't actually occurring in reality. This doesn't just have to be visually either, someone can also have auditory hallucinations (hear voices).

Can you explain his behavior?



So I asked him the other day if I could call him. He said sure at 8pm I should be home. I did. he picked up and said, I just got in the house  - I will call you back. Ok, so he didn't. Yet he kept sending Good Morning Sweetheart texts. So, a few days later, I just texted and asked him why he didnt return my call. He has been acting really funny tords me. He didn't reply. So the next day he sends his usual, "Good Morning,sweetheart" text..but forwarded to other numbers to. So it was never just for me anyways. What is your thoughts on him?



I think he always forwarded them anyways.

He doesn't sound that interested.  He wants to hang on in case he decides to start something with you.  But right now, he's either playing games or doesn't want to bother with you and your feelings much.

Pretty much all of the dreams I've had of my boyfriend have been negative. For some reason, he is either ignoring me or breaking up with me in the dreams. It really depresses me and I can tell it hurts his feelings when I tell him about these dreams, because I know he would never do either of those.



I also had a dream that he never existed and the past few months of my life had been a dream. Of course, he missed school that day, so I began to think my dream was real. I freaked out and had to call him right after school to make sure I wasn't crazy, haha...

Working alone is good for getting things done. You don't need to explain or consult, just do. Explaining and consulting takes time.



Of course, some jobs are bigger, or trickier, this is when working alone is more difficult.

It helps you connect with yourself and assemble thoughts and ideas in a way that's unique to you. It does raise intuition and cuts out human noise... But on the flipside, you won't have anyone else to communicate with for a second opinion or get an objective view of ideas and plans.

DO YOU THINK he likes me?



ok well i am 16 and he is my sisters friend and is either 17 or just turned 18.
he always mocks me but not in a mean way and comments on photos that are on my sisters face book account with me in them just funny stuff or jokes that i am dumb. this sounds sad but his humor is just weird. he saw a video with me in it (rather drunk which is embarrassing) and was like: hahahaha lauren is the funniest etc...
he has been talking to my sister about me quite a lot too.
i know this is really undetailed but what do you think?
be honest.



thanks!



p.s i put this in this section because i want to know if him mocking me could be because he likes me and i thought people in this section would know. =]

Yes it sounds as if he likes you. Maybe its the start of something bigger then just friends.  OR he could just joke around because he's trying to be nice since he's your sisters friend.. Its hard to say without being around you both but you could try flirting back and see where it goes from there. Good Luck

It definitely sounds like he's interested.  I was teased a lot back in middle school and high school by a lot of guys and I was too shy to stand up for myself.  I was very impulsive when I was younger and I jumped to conclusions a lot.  I didn't think that the boys who teased me might like me.  But my mom told me that if they tease you in a friendly way and not a mean way, chances are they like you and they are trying to get your attention in their own way.  It sounds like he thinks your cute and very funny, and you must feel the same way about him right?  You're just unsure about where to go from here.  No matter what you feel for him, make sure not to label yourself, you have the freedom to choose what you want to do.  You don't have to hurry to make a decision, just focus on spending more time with him and laughing more often. Try laughing off his jokes and just going with the flow.  Don't worry, you'll do fine.  Trust your feelings!  I wish you the best.

This is important for women to know if some one likes her or not but what my opinion is do you like him because you are the one who is seeking answers for him .I think you have already crush on him and now you want us to give you clear picture about your thoughts otherwsie he will be the first questioning on yahoo.Are you asking us or just telling us.These are 2 different stages.If you think something you must tell him or bring it out otherwsie these things will disturb your more.

Depends what he's talking to your sister about....if it's just some minor stuff about you then it's probably nothing, but if he asks a lot of questions about you then he has something on his mind ;)



I'm 100% he has bed time fantasies of you, but honestly doubt he'll do the first step, or any other for that matter...maybe he's afraid your sister won't approve him as your boyfriend or something like that.
If I was you, I would ask him (in private of course) straight: ˝Do you like me?˝
That would catch him off the guard and he wouldn't be able to hide the truth. Try! What could you lose?

Help a friend or tell them to go see counselling?



Sometimes I feel like people come to me for free counselling. I know, sometimes people just need to vent, but when its constant negativity of "Oh, my life sucks. Oh, everything's so bad and I need a new job, new car, new  blah" BUT they don't do anything about it, they just go out drinking or do something stupid then go.. Oh my life sucks. They're sucking my life energy! I've tried helping them by listening, tried telling them they're being stupid (nicely of course).. but where do you draw the line to tell them to find another friend or go find help? Also how do you tell them to go get professional help, cos I can't help you.

Professional counsellors develop their listening skills and set clear boundaries.  With what little you've described of your friends' behavior, I'd be inclined to say something like, "I'm confused.  On the one hand, you say ...., but then you go and do ...  Why do you suppose that is?"



In this way, and many others, professional counsellors try to help clients solve their own problems.  Of course, some clients don't want to solve their problems either.  With MY friends and acquiantances, I tend to be fairly direct if I think they're just wanting to vent.  I'd probably say something like, "You know, mostly when you start talking this way I feel drained.  I'd rather not talk about all the ways your life sucks.  It's frustrating to try to help you and then see you act in self defeating ways.  I really think it might benefit you to talk to a professional counselor."



Hope that helps.

options-if not a good friend you may see them less or not at all. Or if good friend direct away from the complaining Allow them to vent for a minute or more if needed, only provide reflective listening-(look it up). then there will be nothing for them to complain about, like "No that won't work", pressuring you to try to "solve" their dilemma. Never offer that advice. When tired of listening, make a transition statement like Looks Like you've got quite a dilemma on you  hands, let's relax and forget about it for now so you can deal w it later on freshly. Then end that conversation and move on ,get up, or excuse yourself to do something else on your own if the person wants to continue to whine. If you wish yu can say,"you know this conversation is not helping you I can see you are just in a mood where you need some time tto be on your own, I'll leave now and chek with you tomorrow to see if we an plan some fun activity for the weekend,. Or suggest they volunteer for habitat for humanity and do some real work to get your mind off your problems. Or get a kid to mentor in a program.
You can offer some books to read(later time when the person is not asking you to listen or fix them) like "feeling good" or other self help books. That is if you feel they would respond, not if that entangles you more. Also schedule more activities together that involve less down time like a movie  when you must leave right afterwards or a sport like biking. The conversation would be less and the activity helps depression.

It depends on how much you are overwhelmed by the situation....actually it shows how much you have ability to adjust... but once you  come to terms with it you will certainly find it getting better and you will learn to master it!...when you eat with forks for the first time..how is it...the same way..once you get used to it it will become easier...but some are not able to adjust themselves because they are not willing to accept themselves in those situations...they want to succeed immediately and if they don't they lose faith in themselves

it all depends on the individual's attitude.



If you go around with the assumption that everyone is basically the same, then you don't really get overwhelmed as easily.



I do that, and it is a good way to start. It only gets weird after a while when you get to know people a bit and it turns out they are different. But by then I'm usually comfortable with the new situation that is doesn't matter.

So I was doing breathing meditation and I received a nightmare?



What does this mean ? I did it for 5 minutes .
should I have done it longer ?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Are you having "night terrors"? Like really bad nightmares that takes awhile before you can really calm down or/and after the dream you gasp for air, shakes and cold sweat? "Night terrors" are like panic attacks that happen when you are asleep.
Relaxation techniques like, breathing exercises, are helpful because they release a lot of stress and relax your mind so that you go to sleep with a calm mind, which gives you a peaceful night sleep. But five minutes daily is not enough, you need more like 15 minutes daily.I know that it sounds like a lot, but you can mix it up a little with progressive visual relaxation and breathing techniques. Here's an excellent college website that has links to meditation exercises and had free legal downloads called "Relax with Steve" and "Relax with Bonnie". The "steve" one is breathing and relaxing muscles and Bonnie is more visualization.
http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healths...
Also you might want to cut the amount of caffeine that you take in, try not to use your computer or watch tv before sleeping and have a nice warm bath before sleep. A bubble bath with Lavender relaxes you a whole lot, trust me.
If you continue to have "night terror" and losing sleep, you might want to talk to your doctor about, so that maybe he will give some some sleeping aids.
Good luck and I hope this has been helpful:)

To me, days go by faster if I'm doing something I enjoy, like hanging out with friends, listening to music, going out at night, dancing, playing with dogs, spending time with family, etc.  If I am upset or bored most likely the days go by much slower.

Dude, try getting a girlfriend.
Getting a part time job helps to get a girlfriend (I'm not saying girls only like guys with a bit of money, just having a job and a few $ give you more confidence and girls like that).



Havng a girl at school makes time go faster there, and outside school you'll be too busy working, doing homework, finding time for your girl/other friends that you wont even notice individual days, only weeks as they pass.



Oh yeah, maybe actually do some freaking work during class eh?



(And if you are a girl replace girl in my answer with boy.)

like yourself and it will be infectious -people will like o be around you as they see your zest for life and things you love to do. Get mre involved with things you enjoy, try out new clubs or sports or activities that are healthy and interesting. Expand your brain don't wait for someone to ask you, say Im going to this blank( museum,skating rink,park,library,dance competiton,martial arts demo,mountain climbers demo,etc,etc) today and talk about it inan excited way whether you actually fell that way or not you will help yourself to stay pumped about it. Smile alot, i helps your mood even if you dont actually start out feeling like it. Do more fitness type activities, it helps depression and mood. Others will eventually look at you as someone they wish they could be like.

Join a soccer team and try not to be shy (without being pushy). Be as natural as you can, in other words, be yourself and don't care too much about what other people think of you and then they will want to get to know you. When you care too much about not being popular or liked, you send out the wrong vibes, People want to get to know you when you seem happy with yourself I'm afraid. It's a pity it's that way round because if people liked you, you would probably be more confident, but that's life!

don't change anything about yourself, you were made the way you are and you are perfect the way you are. Secondly, maybe reconsider your want to be popular, ive found that a few really good close friends do miles more than a hundred friends.



Anyway, if you accept yourself for exactly who you are, even if ur a tad shy, people will notice your confidence in yourself (you can be shy and be confident) and they will be intrigues with you and drawn to you.



Stay true to yourself, don't stress, make friends with yourself, then others can make friends with you =)

You first need to admit your fear and then take out a realistic plan of action for change. Take out a piece of paper and jot down realistic goals for yourself and give yourself benchmarks to follow your goals. You can't change unless your first admit you have a fear of change. Second you need to be committed to your plan of action.

everyone feels lonely at some point in their lives, but don't be afraid, everything happens for a reason, and only time can reveal these reasons. So take life as it comes, never miss an opportunity, an don't worry away the time that you have now, treasure every moment until mr. perfect comes. And when he does come, don't fret about love or hurt or disappointment, just take it as it comes and enjoy everything you have right now =)

Don't stress about it.  Learn to love YOURSELF first, and everything will come in it's time.  There is a difference between loneliness and solitude, learn it and appreciate the solitude.  If you really love yourself, you will attract positive energy and people and will have more than a choice of one.  Take things slow, enjoy life, and don't rush into anything.

I used to be lonely.
I went through a series of unrequited crushes who broke my heart before I found someone who loves me undyingly...unconditionally.
All I can tell you is that you should never go after guys like I did. Don't aim for the guys who are egotistic and cruel.
If you want the right guy, let him come along. You'll know when you've found him, just don't drive yourself into a bad relationship.
Loneliness follows people for a long time but, once you find that love, the door slams shut and loneliness is only a skeleton in your closet.

Funnily enough I was talking to my mother about this only the other day.



Ive been going through a rough patch. Work isnt what I expected... Im too busy all the time to have much of a social life. And I gave up on men... I am lucky my parents are still togethr and going strong, so Im confused as to why I feel this way. But then I look at the relationships I have had.



I was 19 when I met my first boyfriend. He was a first in everyway. He moved in after 6months of being together and everything was brilliant. We were together for 3 and a half years... It went very sour, I couldnt stand being around him. He was very feminine and I never felt protected. He always used to mouth of at guys when we were out, but then couldnt loko after himself which would leave me standing there in the middle.



After we split up I met this guy who I thought was AMAZING!! He was a fire fighter from Birmingham and a few yeras older than me. I fell for him hook line and sinker. He was so masculine so fun, and could deffinately look after himself! BAM!!! He was seeing three other girls at the same time as me! - The wrong guy. Even though that was over a year ago now. I still keep in touch with him and still have this love for him, why I dont know. But what I do know is that he was the guy.



That being said I tried again. This time someone a little younger and so not my type but again masculine and could look after himself.. He has a baby but that was fine. We got on really really well, and he kept asking me why I never told him my feelings. - Thats becasue I was worried about what happened last time would happen again. Eveuntually I told him. BAM - "Sarah I think we should just be friends I dont want a realtionship" Wrong guy number 2 - it turns out he was a massive druggie as well!



By this time I started to think that it was a waste of time and I was destined to be alone then I met another fireman he was not my tye again and I really didnt like him that much. But somehow we got together and seemed to be hitting it off really well. We presumed we were both together and it worked. - He was a little naughty for me - but I think that is kinda why I liked him. Anyway then the bad thing happened... I got pregnant! I was waiting for ages to tell him, and I was worried that there would be yet another big BAM!! I told him and I waited for the screaming... But nothing... enfact thte first thing was - Are you ok?! I was gob smacked... We discussed eeverything and we were going to work through it... But then I had to have the baby terminated becasue it was in my tubes. BAM!!!! - The wrong guy... Now he didnt care and was a nasty nasty nasty person!



So at the moment I am on my own and a little worried that I will never find the one, or getting the wrong guy. But you know what. From the first person I went out with to the last person... I have become such a strong person... For myself. Yes yuo go through crap and yes you will meet the wrong people - but it all for a reason... The way I behaved with one guy I would never do again becasue Ive learnt that it gets you hurt or no where.



If feelings fade away they fade away... I thought that me and my first boyfriend would be together forever, but we werent and are not, but it makes room for you - to find out who you really are...



You have to kiss a 1000 frogs before one turns into a prince. - That is just life Im afraid you will get hurt... But it makes you such a stronger person.



Im having great fun at the moment meeting new guys etc. Ill be honest all I want is to settle down with someone I love etc... But  I know who I meet at a club tommorrow night probably wont be him... But then the one in the coat q might. If neither of them are then hey I can say Ive lived!



Sorry to babble on - probably most of this is garbage... But I hope it explains things a little. (It helps me too to write it down ha ha)

though your question is not easy to guess what you want to know i will give my opinion thinking that this what you are expecting as an answer.to show people that you are showing interest in them, the best attitude to show is the interest, you should be first good listener to what ever they are telling you, accordingly you answer them of whatever you may think, you nod if you have nothing to say or you look at them showing your interest though you are not, and this we call it public relation.
i know it's not easy to do, i used to be like that i haven't got interest with people but experience taught me a lot, we have saying that says treat people the way you want people treat you and believe me it pays in the in the long run.

Physicists have been saying that time actually has been going by faster over the last 10 years



but the less something moves, the faster time goes by .. or the more inactive you are, the faster time seems to pass



they're also learning that gravity and time effect one another



via an EEG it was determined that my frontal temporal lobe fires neurons more slowly than the rest of my brain, so i translate time differently too

I think it's because as we get older we have more things to take care of, worry about, and feel like we have less time to do it than when we were young with more time for ourselves. I wish I could tell you things will slow down, but they don't, the years seem to pass in a flash. I long for the days when weekends were slower and summer vacations seemed like they would go on forever. The best advice for "time flies" is probably, "don't forget to stop and smell the roses".

It's not time that goes faster...so those "professionals" are wrong. ;)



It's your perception. As a child, small things occupy our minds more - and we have less responsibility then, too. The more responsibilities that are heaped on us, the more time flies, because our minds are over-occupied.



I would say that "time goes faster as we get older" because we are no longer as aware that it is passing. As a child, nothing seems to happen fast enough. Once we reach a certain age, though, time never stands still for us. It's just life.

My best guess?



Time doesn't go by faster but I know what you mean. Our perception of time changes as we grow older. Think of time as a... well, timeline. If you have a very long line, a summer's worth is a smaller proportion than if you have a very short line. So a 5 year old will perceive summer to be a lot longer than a 50 year old.

It's certainly true that time goes by faster as you get older, and the older you get the faster it goes. I would love to know the reason too. The person who said that the more inactive you are, the faster time flies has got it just right, I have found this to be true, I wonder why it's so? Some law of nature that hasn't been explained yet!

What is the main reason for my habit of thinking excessively?



I have the habit of thinking too much about what others will think of the way I behaved. It is quite obvious that I don't have any power to control their thinking but still I make my life hell by thinking about what others will think. Even daily routine reactions like saying Hello and Bye will make me think excessively whether I have done right or wrong. If I say Hello I feel like I have made a mistake. If I don't say Hello I feel like I have made a mistake. What do you think is the reason for this? And most importantly, what can you suggest me to get rid of this habit? Thanks.

You seem to be suffering from a major form of low self esteem. it sounds lame, but I think that could be the cause of your constant obsessing over how you interact with other people. I found this:



There are many basic causes of low self-esteem which can also have ongoing and debilitating effects, but the most significant ones are the following:



1. Guilt. This often takes the form of self-torture. Such people worry about everything they do and tend to regret every decision, often believing they did the 'wrong' thing. They tend to see their actions as unforgivable, their imperfections as permanent and believe improvement is impossible. Thus they are kept feeling constantly inferior to everyone else and totally inadequate.



2. Fear and uncertainty. The hallmark of non-confident people is naked fear which they wear like a welcome sign on themselves. They fear making mistakes, upsetting others or becoming ill. They fear not having material things and not living up to the expectations of someone else. They fear not being liked, being hurt and fear taking any kind of responsibility. They fear even being themselves, because of the risk of disapproval from the significant others they value or wish to impress. Such fears are fed and maintained by negative experiences, lack of self-belief and an absence of trust. People driven by fear are plagued by self-doubt, submissiveness, over-conformity, sensitivity to criticism, feelings of inferiority, being unloved or rejected.



3. Self-Shame. Keeping secrets about themselves which then makes them feel 'awful', 'disgusting', 'weird', 'stupid', 'ugly' or unworthy, especially as they would believe themselves to be the only ones with such experiences. This lowers their self-esteem even further and keeps them from trusting others. They would live in constant fear of what others might find out about them.



4. Trying to be a perfect person. True self-esteem means an acceptance of our being, warts and all, with no desire to be anyone else. But if we keep finding faults with ourselves, we will always miss our strengths. But if we do not accept ourselves, who on earth is going to accept us, either? In such a way we keep feeling inadequate and unworthy.



5. Unforgiving, unrealistic expectation
______________________________________...



To be specific, a person with low self-esteem has the following characteristics: overly conscious about what image they project on other people, unwillingness to take on challenges, blaming everything on themselves, unwillingness to assume responsibilities, less social conformity, lack self-confidence, emotional confusion, anxiety, and depression.



If you have one or many of the mentioned characteristics, you might be suffering from low self-esteem. Though this is neither a decease nor contagious, actions must be done in order to transform your self to a person with healthy self-esteem. Now, how do you do that?



First, you should realize and acknowledge that you have a low self-esteem. A person who could not accept his problem and could not realize that he has low self-esteem would not be able to deal with it.



Then, you have to identify your weaknesses. Which of the mentioned characteristics reside in you? After you have answered this, you know what are the things you can do. How? By simply taking the opposite of who you are. For example, you are the type of person who is afraid to take responsibility. Deal with it by starting to take little responsibility. Start within. Take small responsibility you think



you can do. Once you have dealt with it, take another one, and another. Then, work your way outward. As you take on one responsibility after another, you are gaining confidence, which by the way is something you also lack.



Dealing With the Problem of Low Self-Esteem: Common Characteristics and Treatment in Individual, Marital/Family, and Group Psychotherapy It is also good to set goals. Start with simple goals you can easily achieve. Then, you can set bigger and more challenging goals.



If you happen to have 2 or more of the mentioned characteristics, start by focusing on one. You should realize that all these are interrelated. So if you deal with one, you will surely deal with the rest.



Deal with your low self-esteem by treating yourself well. Never punish yourself with wrong thoughts because most of the time, these are only false impressions you have created on your own. Never focus on the negative things. Instead, focus on thinking positively.



Treat yourself right by getting enough rest, eating regularly and healthily, doing regular exercise, and giving yourself treats after you have done something good. Pamper yourself.



Give yourself the chance to have fun. Do something exciting for the day.



If you think you have deeper problem, seek help from a professional or talk to other people. If you have problem with sharing to other people, start on your closest friends or people who are willing to listen to y

Dont become self absorbed - you are operating out of fear of offending people - why do you think you are not good enough and what does it matter what people think. If you have to live your life around what people think about you, you are heading for destruction.  The answer is to recognize that you are great - you are somebody and God made you to be a unique special priceless person who has his own set of talents, gifts and skills.  You are worthy, you are not hopeless and you are able to do far more than you can imagine and have the power to be anything you set your mind to be.  God knew you before you were conceived.  He knows your thoughts from afar.  He knows your comings and your goings.  You cannot hide from him.  he knows what you are choosing right now and that is negative.  Instead concern yourself with pleasing God.  People come and people go but you have to live your life and live it abundantly too.  God says he has come to give you life and in abundance. Get to know your creator. Get to know the way he thinks.  Delight yourself in him and he will give you the desires of your heart. Instead of worrying what people think, you go and do good things for people by being a good listener, by being a friend, by being accountable and being helpful. Be kind, be good, be faithful, be peaceful, be happy and find joy, be wise and understanding and merciful and gracious towards others, be patient, don't be excessive and greedy, be humble and thoughtful, considerate and faithful and loyal. Choose the opposite to negative.  Be thankful for what you have even if it is little. Be content with what you have. Life is about choices. You have to choose and its what we choose that is either constructive or destructive!  Please remember that! SO what are you going to choose?

ooh i feel sorry for you, i don't know how old you are but what i can say is that don't be cruel to yourself. your attitude is just but normal which you will eventually conquer. if you are young it's because you lack of experience. however, i advice you to stop feeling guilty of whatsoever, what might people think don't attach important, just stop thinking things that will harm you, when events occur or present themselves infront of your eyes, immediately chase them out by ignoring it like if nothing happened. i am giving you counsel because i was like you before and it's really hell to be like that. until oneday as i am sufferer until today i taught myself to ignore people, things, events to what extent. believe me when you learn this attitude you will feel happier and loose. do your best to avoid thinking what might people  think of you try not to enter in their brains of people what they are thinking about you just ignore and pass to another step of your life.
once you learn all these things you will see the effects in your life what it makes.

Sounds to me like you have some self-esteem issues, although you recognize that you can make good decisions about the big things in life.
The way to stop might be to follow up the inevitable "that was stupid" self-talk with an immediate self-affirmation, like "No, it wasn't stupid, it was the best decision at the time, and I am intelligent and capable of making good decisions."  And, also, stop yourself when you start to think negatively.  Saying "Stop!" out loud might even work.  (When you're by yourself.  Doing that around other people might cause them to look at you strangely.)
Recognizing that you are doing this is an excellent first step.  Changing your behavior will not be easy, but if you try to self-affirm after each negative thought, in no time, you will be forgetting to think the negative thought in the first place.

You are just like me :-).



But this happened to me till an year ago. I have a possible solution that you can work out (it worked for me). Thanks to my friend :-)



Small think matter and shatter your emotions.



When you pick up a wrong dress for school,
When you get late to bus,
When you buy something at shop and doesnt like that after reaching home,
when you always think about others much and yourself.



All this kind of situations have one simple formula:



1. Dont let your heart make your mind down for small things.
2. Suppose, if you go for shopping, you like one dress... just keep it aside... and roam in the shop for another few minutes, comeback and look at it again. Look at the negative things in the dress (that we never did before :-) ). Now you will start knowing the dress better and will decide whether to buy it or not.



3. If I buy that what is the purpose... ?
4. This is for simple shopping.



In case, you are talking to somebody, dont just babble. Speak 1 word for 3 words that come in your mind. Select the best word out of three..



Slowly you will be gaining confidence and think correctly and feel proud or atleast happy about your decisions.



All the best!

I used to be like that. Anything that I did  I was highly critical of. I also lacked confidence. But one day I was with a colleague, who I considered to be really confident. We had booked a room for a meeting and there were people in there. He was really nervous, but it was something that I had no problem in doing. Since then I have sat back and observed a lot more and I have realised that everyone makes mistakes. Everyone is nervous in certain situations. The moral of the story is - don't be so hard on yourself - if you strive for perfection you will always fail. And as by driving instructer used to say - forgive the mistakes of others, and hope that others will forgive yours.

I'm currently doing a personal development course which has really opened my eyes to how I think about myself and the way it affects how I behave, and i think that what you're doing is called negative self talk. it develops after years of being told these things, by our parents, friends, teachers and other people in our lives who are important to us.



I think it'd be a good idea to write down a short list of things you like about yourself, another list of perhaps 10 things you don't like, and then try and talk yourself out of the negative thoughts and self talk.



i'll give you an example. I have had to listen to various people in my life tell me that I'm stupid. Recently, I decided to tell myself that I am not. I listed my skills and qualifications, and realised that, far from being stupid, I'm actually an intelligent person who makes the occasional mistake.I learnt to accept that I'm not perfect - after all, who is? - and to accept myself as an intelligent human being, and am slowly coming out of my shell (my negative self talk had turned me into a very shy person, who was afraid of letting anyone see how bright and capable I actually was - not any more!!) The shyness is still bubbling under the surface, but I'm not going to allow it to hold me back like it has previously. As the old song goes "Ain't nothing gonna break my stride... I got to keep on moving"

next time she tells you a story, try to remember it in grave detail, do everything you can to remember it, write it down if you have to. then like a month later, ask her about it. a liar never remembers every detail they tell someone. and a person who isnt lying does. they remember everything. well anyways when she messes something up confront her about it. then ask her why she thought she had to lie to you or something

A pathological liar usually does not know the difference between a lie and the truth. They actually believe their own lies. A sociopath knows that what they are doing is wrong, they just don't care. They have no guilt or conscience.

Honestly I hate when they ask that because my life has been nothing but stress in the last two years and don't feel that it is their business! However I usually tell them that while I don't want to discuss the issue that I dealt with it well! Explaining that even though I was stressed I still dealt with daily life and things went on! Making sure they understand that my stress will never interfere in my work life or in customer relationships! If they persisted on knowing what was the stressful situation I would just say, "It was a family matter that has nothing to do with my work life!"



Personally i don't want to work for a company that is to nosy about employee's personal life! If they can't understand that I'd rather not discuss it then i would rather not work for that company! I have always been head strong and find it to be a clash with some companies! This being why I might start my own business in the next few years with my husband. I'm to bossy to be having a boss interfere in my life!

Time is not running, actually we are running.
We tend to be so busy in our daily schedule, may be due to heavy job schedule, road traffics, disco night etc. that we really donnot have time for our body to relax.
Time is just 24 hours in a day, but we have multiplied our needs and wants and therefore keep running to get it fulfil.

Do you think it's possible for your soul/heart to feel pain before your brain knows there's an infliction?



Can a person sense pain without knowing why and then later find out the reason? Is this intuition?

Can you forgive someone like this truly from heart and be free?



The Power of Forgiveness



“When you forgive somebody who has wronged you, you’re spared the dismal corrosion of bitterness and wounded pride. For both parties, forgiveness means the freedom again to be at peace inside their own skins and to be glad in each others’ presence."
Fredrick Buechner



Peace is not possible without forgiveness. Martin Luther King once said, “Forgiveness is not an occasional act; it is a permanent attitude.” The only way children can learn the habit of forgiveness is by seeing us, their parents, forgive others and forgive ourselves.



The freedom to be at peace in our own skins - that’s what forgiveness allows. We relinquish this freedom when we hold onto anger and resentment. Enormous amounts of energy are wasted when we hold back our love, hold onto hate, and harbor acrimonious feelings. The only remedy is letting go, and being willing to forgive.



But how? Here are four powerful steps to forgiveness from one of the world’s foremost experts on the subject, Dr. Fredrick Luskin:



1. Close your eyes, and for about 20 seconds, picture the person who hurt or angered you. Let all your grievances come up. Notice what happens in your body -- acceleration of heart-beat, shallow breathing, tension, etc.



2. Now let go of this image and take some slow, deep abdominal breaths. Focus on your abdomen, and imagine the breath going down into it as you inhale. Expand your abdomen on each inhalation, and deflate your abdomen as you exhale. Take about five breaths and keep your focus on your abdomen. If your mind goes back to the person who hurt you or to anything else, bring the focus back to the rhythm of your breath and the movement of your abdominal muscles as you inhale and exhale.



3. Bring into your mind an image of someone you love very much, or a place of peace and beauty. Allow yourself to be flooded with the positive feelings this image elicits. Now bring those feelings down to the area around your heart. Allow the good feelings to penetrate your heart and soothe you.



4. Lastly, keep breathing the good feelings into your heart. Now take a look again at the person you are angry at. Let the good feelings protect you. The purpose of doing this step is to break the pattern of stress reactions that normally occur in your mind and body when you think of the person who hurt you. When you surround your heart with positive energy, the power the person has had over you begins to dissipate.



Resentment is a habit, and habits take twenty-five days to change. So if you do this exercise each time you think of the person who hurt you over twenty-five days, you will literally change your mental and physical reactions. They will no longer have power to hurt you because you will have reprogrammed your own reactions. And when this happens, you start to become free.



Sometimes we need to forgive without reconciliation: forgiving for the mere purpose of forgiving. Certainly, what we strive for is to reconcile all conflicts, clear the air, and understand one another. But there are times this is impossible - with a parent who has passed away, with someone who has wronged you and is long gone, with someone who is unwilling to communicate. These are the times we must dip deep into our own souls and see if we are willing to forgive anyway.



I have on the bulletin board above my desk a yellowed article written by the scholar and Holocaust survivor Elie Weisel in 1997. In it, Weisel expresses the most profound act of forgiveness imaginable. It is here that Elie Weisel expresses forgiveness toward God for the Holocaust.



In the article Weisel asks God the question he has struggled with all his life: “Where were you, God of Kindness, in Auschwitz?” Weisel had never been able to understand how a loving God could have allowed the Holocaust to exist. But out of the question that has tormented him for fifty years, Weisel gleans a sudden insight: “Watching your children suffer at the hands of your other children, haven’t you also suffered?”



In this moment of compassion, Weisel is finally moved to offer God his forgiveness: “Let us make up, Master of the Universe,” he says. “In spite of everything that happened? Yes, in spite. Let us make up: for the child in me, it is unbearable to be divorced from you for so long.”



This story is a reminder to me that forgiveness and compassion are essential and possible under all circumstances. For the child in all of us, we must learn to forgive. And for the sake of the children we love with unparalleled ferocity, we must model the most magnanimous and humbling of all acts - the act of forgiveness.



Forgiveness Exercise:



- Is there someone you need to forgive? Write about that person and the circumstance below. Are you ready to forgive him or her? If so, go onto the next step.



- Do the process outlined above.



- When you feel ready, complete this forgiveness statement .

I forgive you for:



Abusing, Insulting, Breaking, Destroying, Hating, Lying, Decieving, Defrauding, and Hurting
me, my country, my religion, my feelings, my heart, my body, my money, and my soul.



-Talk to your child about the importance of forgiveness. Ask him if there is anyone he needs to forgive. If so, have him do the 4-step process, then copy the above forgiveness statement, and have him fill it out.



Nelson Mandela once said, “Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.” You have the power to change that. Peace is built on the decisions we make and the actions we take in the small moments of our life. Deciding to forgive is one more way of creating peace, the most important job any of us can do right now.



The Power of Forgiveness

Before I decided to forgive her truly from heart, here is how I was feeling;



Tonight I want to write something and need the writer inside me to speak so much that I don't have any more desire to speak about love and the pain it may cause. But the moment I start writing or even start pressing the first keyboard button about Love, I get confused. Why? I should never get confused cause love is a universal, simple and so common thing. Yes, it might be but whatever happened to me, it made the love just an illusion that one can only see or talk about in movies or other fictional books. In reality, I tried to love someone but failed so miserably that I wish I did not exist at all. This experience was so awkward and so unbelievably terrible one that my soul, body and experience of life, everything seemed like nothing. I was treated like a piece of trash and thrown away in such a merciless way that I kept wondering what the hell did I do wrong by loving someone?

This isn't a question but it is very insightful.  I have told many people that they need to learn forgiveness for themselves...not necessarily the person they forgive.  It takes too much of our lives and too  much energy to everyday living to be bitter and hateful and sorrowful that we were hurt.



Thanks for such a great piece...those that need to forgive need this peice of life and insight to move on and live a happier life.



I too had to forgive and it took me 20 years to do it.  I now have a relationship with my parents...superficial as it is...I can understand them a little more....even though I can't forget what happened...I can forgive them and give them peace along with myself.



They haven't given me any peace or said they are sorry but I can deal with that.  There are blessings .....in everything....if you look for them.  But you have to heal the hole in your heart first.



We all have illusions on love...it is not a fairy tale thing.  It is work...always work and you will always be disappointed because it involves another person that you want to make you happy and you feel SHOULD.  The truth is..no one can make you happy but yourself.  You cannot hand your life over to someone and say make me happy.  It will never happen.  You are putting too much expectation on someone when you do that and it is doomed to fail from that moment on.



Love is work....it IS forgiving and accepting what you don't think is fair or right or changing it.  You have to bend with life or you will break.  There is someone else in the world..not just you so you have to accept the fact that they count too...and it is up to each of us to pick and choose what is important to us in life and what we can live with and what we can't.



It takes maturity and it takes commitment...because you will never have everything your way.

Actually forgiveness is totally different....people say it is divine and noble to forgive...we are all human beings and at times we are ordinary....we cannot be noble and divine all the time.....and it is not compulsory to forgive....just like any other thing.. whether to forgive or not is highly a personal choice.....we know the pain it has caused by others...so we simply cannot forgive...and when you have chosen to forgive it means that you are simply forgetting the wrong doings he has done...it is way of stating that ' life can indeed be hard and unfair but still we choose life'....
Whether you want to forgive or not is highly a personal choice.......

you may be noticing changes in your daughter or maybe she didnt approve of you working for your old boss. if you had feelings for your old boss then maybe subconciously you feared your daughter finding out so your dream is acting out what you feared would hapen in reality. your daughter may play a big part in your life and consume a lot of your time if your old boss gave you a hard time then you are dreaming that your daughter is over protective of you there are many different angles to interpret this dream from but i would interpret it as you have to keep your work life and your home life seperate because the two are coliding. dont bring your work home with you and dont bring your home life to work

If you repress ANGER...yes.  Not desires.  Desires are emotions and you are in control of  emotions..or should be.  If you aren't you need to work on maturity.



In life you grow up and make choices and make them for what is good for you and desire leads your life to what your future will be.



What is good for you isn't good for someone else.



It is anger you need to get out and talk about or it will manifest into other things.



Desire is  to long or hope for : exhibit or feel desire for



You can desire many things....success...love...children...
money....education...clothes..
homes....ANYTHING.



If anything desire should result in a shift in motivation and ambition to get what you want.



I went to Catholic schools all my life (back in the 60's and 70's and I never had a mean nun.  They were soft spoken and kind and loving.



On the other hand I went to public school one year and the teacher threw a desk across the room because he was mad.  Is he any different?  No .. what happens is individual..there are mean people in EVERY WALK OF LIFE...abusers in every walk of life...alcoholics in ever walk of life....you are all generalizing and it is unfair.



If you had red hair would you like it if everyone said you were a angry person...or if you were fat would you like people to say you were selfish and a slob etc?  Get real.



You are talking sex....there is more to a nun's life than that...and it should be more to life than that in YOUR Life too.



When you base life on sex...you are very superficial and you will have problems.



Nuns DESIRE to serve God and God bless those people that have a big heart and a big capacity to love and teach !

Nuns are simply people - human with human needs and desires.  I think you can choose to be a nun and be quite willing to give up your desires in life to serve GOD and be successful at it.  I think that is what Mother Teresa did.  However, there are MANY nuns that are resentful of giving up earthly things (including desires) .  I also went to a catholic school and most of the nuns were nuts/violent or both and with very crazy ideas to scare the kids into submission.

1.) Try breathing deeply. It allows more oxygen into your system which has a calming effect.
2.) Mentally release all the tension from one part of your bod at a time. I know it sounds silly, but it really helps.
3.) Go to your happy place. Visualize somewhere or something that calms you and releases endorphins.



4.) Play with a stress ball. It gets your mind off of the stressor and allows you to relieve built up muscle tension.

I always like to have a hot bubble bath with candles lining the bathtub and soft music playing. A glass of brandy or cognac is a nice addition as well for relaxing. A really good book that I can read while laying in the hammock.

Reverse speech experiment?



Have you ever tried reverse speech? Did you find any messages when you reversed your speech? I used the sound recorder on my old computer (with windows xp, can't do it with vista) one day. I talked about my job that year and how much I enjoyed it and gave some details, and things like that. When I reversed it, there was only one phrase but it was very clear....."It's a challenge."



After I thought about it awhile decided the job was a challenge even with the most pleasant assignment.

Are you responsible for your happiness or should you rely on others to make you happy?



Topic of discussion this weekend at a get together.  An acquaintance mentioned how she had met a guy who made her happy.  Me having the big mouth I do...said "what you weren't happy before you met him?"..that sparked a discussion....I personally believe that you should be happy with you and rely on yourself for you own happiness.  People (friends/gf/bf) can ADD to that happiness but you shouldn't  rely  on others to make you happy.



In case you're wondering...I'm in my late 40's divorced 13 years and I have dated but am currently single.



After many years I am finally comfortable in my own skin...am content with my life as it is.  Not saying that if someone came into my life i'd push them away...but they wouldn't be my main reason for being happy.  What's funny is that i've found a majority of the folks my age who are single....have the same thoughts...



Any opinions?  Care to share?  Thanks!

She says she cant have my kids?best answer 10 points?

we are in love more than a year..!



and a about 6-7 years down the rod,we have plans of getting married..



but recently she gave me shock she is not interested in having kids



reason:



having kids can be highly painful and her mom has said about it to her that its painful to death so she dont want to tolerate it..!



she feel after kids come in between us,the love between both of us would reduce as we have to concentrate on kids too and show love for them and so we would become routine parents after a certain age and no more unconditional love between us..so she wants both of ud to live for each other for ever and no one else :O



i was like WTF and whe had a big fight about this..



i said i love kids..i cant resist from caressing and kissing ANY kid that comes across me even in roads..she know that too..i have so much of love for children and want to make some for me and bring up them up too...its one of my dreams to be a great father because i didnt get that good a father.even after i dsicussed all these to her and explained that even fter having kids..i would be very lovely and affectionate to her as ever,she keeps in saying she cant and that i am not respecting her opinion..then what avout my opinion?



at last she disclosed this arguement saying we are hardly 20 we'll discuss about this during the marriage time..am damn sure am not have anyother girl in my life than her as i love her to death...but what if she comes at last and say i cant have kids?

if you know you want kids and she knows she doesnt then i wouldnt really expect her to change her mind. you cant base a marriage on "hope that she will change her mind" nor can you force her to.way  too many people enter into a marriage hoping to change the other person. you can respect her choice, as she has to respect yours. but i really think you both need to look else where for a more compatable marriage mate. never assume anyone will change. sorry but thats my opinion. i hope things work out for the best for both of you and you can at least remain friends.

her idea about the pains in having kids is highly rediculous in todays improvised world. cos. no lady really unless she wants to go for pains. she can as wellh have a surgery and get the baby out.  and well about concentration on children, unconditional she iis being rationale.  cos. that very true. cos every parent (mother and father indivudually) will have their reservations for kids compared to spouses and both parent's' priority will surely be kids first and then if something  (it could be naything time, money, energy, etc) left will be for spouse. so that is rationale. however you refuse today. that will be the ultimate tomorrow.



but i would suggest you instead of having a row over kids 6-7 years before. you better continue loving each other uninhibitiously. cos  every woman feels and gets fulfilled only upon having atleast on kid.  she will  slowly know the value and pleasure of pregnancy, listening to hte heart beat of hte the child inside her womb which any woman would want to have and cannot miss,  the movements of hte baby inside her, etc, etc, such feelings will naturally come to her once she gets a status of a wife in the society. as she realises the importance of WIFE so will she  feel hte need of becoming a mother. and she  being a woman will automatically realize the need of a baby once she becomes a  wife. her woman instincts  will make her beget children even if you stop her then. OK so just relax and be rest assured.



god bless you both with lots of love and cut kids.

Having children is a big responsibility and I am not surprised your girlfriend does not, at the age of 20, feel ready to commit herself to having children yet.  However, as you are so keen, make sure she does eventually want children. Also, tell her that each baby bring its love with it and it will not affect what you feel for each other.  She has not been given one portion of love which she will have to share with her children and their farther.  Yes, having childen can be painfull, but there is pleanty of help now.  If it was that bad, each couple would only have one child as no woman would want to go through labour more than once!  Nature has a way of erasing the pain from your brain.  Yes, we remember it was painful, but when we feel ready to have another baby we cannot really remember exactly what the pain was like, and anway, the most important thing is that you really want another child. Remember, for every person you see, some mother has gone through labour and there a millions of us. The human race has not died out because of possible painful labour.  Good luck, but make sure you are both really comitted to the responsibilities, and possible sacrifices, that having children brings, and have a bit more time to yourselves beforeyou make such a serious comittment.

I met my husband when I was 16 and he was 19.  A lot of people said you don't know what love is yet.  You won't get married, but I knew he was the one and today we have been married 11 years.  So I do believe you can find the one you will marry at a young age.  We never spoke about children or anything like that when we were discussing marriage.  I assumed we would have children, and we did have a child years later.  My point is that if he would have came to me and said I don't want to have children, I would have felt the same way you do.  I would have been broken, and I wouldn't want to leave him to find another that did want children.  I would drop it, and give it some time.  Bring it up again before you decide to get married.  If she still doesn't want children then you will have to make your decision.  Because if she still says no and you decide to marry her anyway, be prepared!  She may follow through with that and you need to realize this before you say I do.  That could tear a marriage apart.
When I was younger I wanted children, but not for a long time.  It hits you all at once, and then you know it is time.  Maybe once she gets older, before your married, she will change her mind.

Negative effects and disadvantage of cognitive behavioral therapy?



is there any proven negative effects and disadvantage of cognitive behavioral therapy?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Some say CPT is a model of emotional response, which has no place in behavioral psychology and is based the idea that our thoughts
cause our feelings and behaviors, not external things, like people, situations, and events.



External events need to be looked at -- If practiced correctly,a look at the person's surroundings - how they grew up, how they interact with others, etc.



I think if you Google you question, you will fine predictions, but not proven effects.



Read ABOUT BEHAVIORISM by B.F. Skinner.

What do you do when you don't know what your interested in i.e hobbies and interests?



See i just don't know what I like... I know I feel lost and lonely and don't wanna be some boring guy for when I eventually date again and believe me its been a long time!
I'm on anti depressents so hopefully they'll work in time although i kinda messed them up by drinking these past 3-4 days but i'm back on them now and not gonna drink till I become happy and off the a-d's
I don't wanna be some bum who just watches tv all the time, eventually if not straight away a girl will get sick of that and leave me lol
Oh man do I need help, here I go again asking away...
I suppose I need a wise council and hopefully someone who felt lost, confused, frustrated with not knowing what to do in life and lonely!
Maybe I am just depressed and its stopping me from even trying new things like drawing or playing the keyboard or evn going out!
Yep I don't do all those things but think I wanna!
Thanks for taking the time to read my question

Depression and lethargy are common friends. You feel cr*p but don't really know what to do about it.



Watching TV isn't all bad. At least watch a documentary or something so you're learning something! Learning something new will make you feel more interested in life again and you may make new friends from it. Perhaps getting yourself a part time job or doing some volunteer work?



I currently volunteer for St Johns Ambulance and have made friends and get to go to lots of different places. People also seem to think more of you if you do voluntary work. At least volunteer work would get you out the house, speaking to people, learning something new and helping others. The good thing about SJA is you get to go watch sporting events and things and gain the knowledge of how to potentially save someone's life. Now that can't be a bad thing, surely?!



Good luck in whatever you decide!

wow seems you are depressed.. er my advice, is dont bother looking for a interest now nit whilst ur feeling so low. wen u do feel better and start to think Straight then get out more try things and find out wat u like an wat u dont like. join a few groups and make some new friends then life will start to look up for u and u will find a job and get more friends and interests. but if u start thinking like this now u will make ur self feel worse.ps the drinking will not help either. good luck and i hope things look up for u very soon. concentrate on u. number 1! hope this helps

The best thing to do is to take up some form of exercise. Its a known fact that it produces endorphins in the brain to  beat depression and give you a feel good factor.

Danny I feel like that all the time. I don't like the idea of antidepressants. a) they take too long to work, b) I am forgetful-apparently this is a big no no and could cost me my life c) others find it a bit disturbing d) it costs money that  I could otherwise spend more productively and e) it makes my head feel tingly.



Not knowing what you like is completely understandable because you've never been given the chance to try new things. You could be like me and wait foopportunitieses OR you can try to find them yourself. Hopefully you can find a buddy who you can drag out to these things. If you look for things you just might find them, it takes practice.

Well, if you didn't spill the beans then you shouldn't have anything to worry about.  Ask your friend what he/she is talking about.  This may all just be a big misunderstanding.  on the other hand, just come clean, apologize to your friend, & stop lying to yourself if you did tell something that you shouldn't have. You will feel much better.

Correlations between physical coordination skills & empathy/self-insight - any data?



Hi



I have a theory, based only on observation, that people who are the most finely coordinated physically also tend to be the most self-aware and empathic.  Those who come up short on physical coordination skills tend to be more ham-fisted interpersonally and lack a little self-awareness.



To the extent that our experience of 'emotion' is (perhaps) largely about our minds sensing signals coming from our bodies, the above makes some kind of sense...



BUT, I have no data.  I could be imagining all of this.  Does anyone know of any research studies which correlate physical coordination skill with self/interpersonal insight in adults of normal intelligence/mental status?



Thanks.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I don't have any research, but I'd agree partly with you, albeit in reverse.



People who are not finely coordinated, or clumsy, are both less aware of their bodies and less aware of their environment than people who are more self-aware (and usually with a correspondingly higher awareness of the envirnment).



Empathy usually develops as a factor of self-awareness, along with the understanding of the similarity between the self and others. So I'd suggest that self-awareness is the root, rather than empathy being a cause in itself.



All on personal experience and observation.

What I learned in the year of Psychology that I did is that most psychological theories are just that theories and cannot be proved.  However, we were told that there are three parts to the self concept:



Self Image - How you see yourself and how you think others see you, not just visually but as a person.
Ideal Self - How you would ideally like to be.  This is often influenced by people you look up to in your life.
Self Esteem - How confident you are in yourself and your capability of completingn tasks well.



To me it sounds like your self image isn't close enough to your ideal self.  Think about your ideal self, then go out and take yourself a step closer to it in your self image.  It may well increase your self esteem and you might not hate the mirror so much.

In all honesty, because you think too much about what others think. I don't know if you're good looking or not, obviously I cannot see you. However, I do know that even good looking people don't always like the way they look in the mirror.



There are several reasons why you are self conscience and generally the most common is low self esteem or lack of confidence. You need to concentrate on what you like and go that route and quite worrying about what others like. You'll never make everyone happy and trying to is obscenely impossible!



Keep in mind those who are quick to judge the looks of other are also quick to judge themselves. Instead of putting others down when you look upon them try looking for something good about them and soon you'll do the same for yourself! Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and if you think you're ugly others will too. You are only as ugly and old as you think and/or allow yourself to be. If there is anything about you that you don't like that can be changed (ex: over weight) start trying to change it slowly, just trying can often boost your confidence.



Be proud you are you and not somebody else and try your best to be happy as you.

<question>



Are you responsible for your happiness or should you rely on others to make you happy?



Topic of discussion this weekend at a get together.  An acquaintance mentioned how she had met a guy who made her happy.  Me having the big mouth I do...said "what you weren't happy before you met him?"..that sparked a discussion....I personally believe that you should be happy with you and rely on yourself for you own happiness.  People (friends/gf/bf) can ADD to that happiness but you shouldn't  rely  on others to make you happy.



In case you're wondering...I'm in my late 40's divorced 13 years and I have dated but am currently single.



After many years I am finally comfortable in my own skin...am content with my life as it is.  Not saying that if someone came into my life i'd push them away...but they wouldn't be my main reason for being happy.  What's funny is that i've found a majority of the folks my age who are single....have the same thoughts...



Any opinions?  Care to share?  Thanks!

I agree that happiness lies within yourself, but that is probably the hardest thing in the world to do. You shouldn't have to rely on others for happiness, and I don't think a man in anyone's life is going to automatically make them happy on a longterm scale.

I think it's an issue of responsibility.  People don't like to be responsible for their own feelings because we like putting the blame on others.  If we are sad or upset or depressed we don't like to reevaluate what is causing us to be that way; instead, we just like to say "he or she did this to me, and it put me in a bad mood."



We are most certainly in charge of our own happiness or our own sadness for that matter.  We should take control of our own life and not choose to allow people to get the best of us.

Public speaking works wonders. I know it sounds backwards, but I was shy as a child until I got a job as a tour guide. From there I went on to community theatre and found I genuinely enjoy speaking to large groups. Because of that, speaking one on one with folks is cake. Just know that we are our own worst judge and that no one criticizes us more harshly than ourselves.

One way to raise your self esteem is to set small goals and then meet them. This means doing things you don't feel comfortable doing, like going to the mall for a few or attending a dance or striking up a conversation with a stranger. Even though you have butterflies at first the feeling you will get when you finish your goal will be great! Good luck!

There is nothing wrong with being shy. Instead of trying to be something your not how about working with what you are.



If you want to be more social then join a club or two. Make friends or BF in a casual environment. Many shy people like intimate settings rather than crowds. That is just fine and no need to change that. Just seek better ways to meet people that are in conformity with YOUR personality.



Movie groups are kinda nice. Basically they go to the movies together and then maybe coffee after words.



I would recommend changing the way you socialize and stop looking at others thinking you are wrong. Shy, is nice and many people like that. Many guys would rather date a shy girl than the big mouth life of the party anyway.

I know it's hard to overcome but you can do it little by little. First off, try looking online for a group you would enjoy. There will obviously be people there with the same interests as you. I'm sure you can make at least a friend or two.



Confidence comes from within but if you feel good looking, it'll bring out your inner confidence. Go shopping and buy an outfit that will make you confident or go to the hairdressers and get something new done with your hair.



You can also join a gym. If you are fit, you will be full of energy. Everyone looks at buff people and that will make you feel good. Good Luck!

You can't reverse it and you really wouldn't want to, trust me. But you can change the outcome. Ask someone to go with you. Get the details and ask, ask ask away, start with family if you have to. Look for other people that are shy too. You can't possibly think your the only one. Find other shy people, you might throw them off a little (as it would you) but give it time. Only other shy people would find things as awkward as you do, try to find the humor in those moments and express them. You'lll find that others feel the same way too just never said anything about it.



Some say shyness is a lack of self esteem I disagree strongly. Ithink that they are two different things.

im assuming ur talkin bout DID-dissociative identity disorder or previously known as multiple personality disorder
well i know it helps a person block out and deal with severe trauma like childhood abuse an stuff,the personalities split and each identity takes on an issue the body and mind cannot deal with.
the down side is u they hav lots of blackouts,no control over their body and actions and people think they are crazy, they are also a harm 2 theirself as they can try commit suiside often and also attack others

Do what you love . . . ?



Is it really possible for someone to do what they love and still make heaps of money?? They always say that you will never be happy in a job, and that you must follow your heart and success will come. I am currently stuck in a VERY mundane job which is very negative and depressing - sometimes its hard to believe that I could ever be happy doind another job. Anyone have some interesting success stories of how they left working in a job they didnt enjoy it and are now doing something they love . . . and are well off as well?

I honestly think it's because of the music they listen to now. I remember when I was younger I listened to a lot of Alanis Morissette, The Police, INXS, Kenny Loggins, Billy Joel, Madonna, etc. I was born in 1986 and I was never in that "poor me" attitude. My mom would also probably slap me if I was ever like that, because she wouldn't handle that. lol
I think also it might be because more parents are having to work, because our economy sucks so the kids feel like no one cares about them so they get that "poor me" attitude. Or, maybe parents (mothers mainly) aren't working but still don't pay attention to their kids.
I'm not really sure why more kids are like that these days. Maybe when I was younger I just didn't notice it because I loved life growing up and had a lot of fun? lol I'm not really sure.

No one likes the word NO.
Kids of today don't get punishment's like they did in the 40s50s etc. etc.
Kids of today can tell their parents to get **** ed and not get punished.
Its sad but its Evolution.
We can't punish our kids like we used to be able to do.... I fear that in years to come the selfish carefree attitudes of some teens today will produce parents with no respect for not only relationships with family and friends but their own children.

The liberal media and many other forces have taught kids that they are all "victims" of some injustice and that they are not personally responsible for anything. If a kid acts up in school, he/she has ADHD and is given ritalin. If a teenage girl gets pregnant, she must have been abused somehow, and (if she doesn't kill it) she can take her child to school where day care is provided. If a kid is lazy and doesn't do their homework, they must be "intellectually challenged" and are put in a special class complete with tutors.You get the idea.

that no matter how much in love you may be and how much you loved each other it doesn't follow that the love will be returned forever
I had to accept that no matter how much love i had for this person....and you can't really measure the amount of love anyway........it might not be reciprocated for ever

That sometimes you can try your best and still not win.  I saw this through the eyes of my children and it was so painful.  You tell them all the time that what matters is trying, not winning, but it's so hard to see the disappointment when they've worked hard for something that just didn't happen...

you can choose your friends but you cant choose your family. so make sure you pick you friens wisely because if your family are a constant let down and your friends are no good then you have nothing except emptyness. once you have found a good friend always treat them how you would expect to be treated

I have been upset all weekend.. is this normal?



Many things happened this weekend that got me upset... such as i found out my boyfriend had a kid and then he broke up with me after I got mad and he changed his number. Then I went to my ex's for comfort and caught him in bed with another girl, even though i know he has the right to be with someone else. It still hurt and I think i cried so hard non stop that my chest hurts and my heart hurts a lot even right now. I keep crying but no tears will come out, and i cant breath and cant sleep or get out of bed. I still feel like Im in shock. I have never felt so depressed or cried so much but im not sure how to help myself and get over it. What would you do if this happened to you and is this normal for my body to react this way? Am I supposed to be this emotional to the point I want to hurt someone..I already see a therapist but it isnt working. Please no rude responses but any advice will be appreciated. Thanks

Lately, I'm driving myself crazy! Am I crazy? Idk. Do you ever feel like you don't quite know who you are? Do you ever feel you have weird thoughts and that if people knew about some of the things that cross your mind they would think of you as a completely different person? Just because people sometimes have strange thoughts does that make them a bad or strange person? And should you have to reveal ALL of your thoughts in a relationship?

What does my dream mean?



the dream started out with me bringing my first born home ( a little background, i dont have a baby but i might be pregnant) and i took a shower when i got home and got out because my son was crying... i went to my room and got dressed and herd the front door open, thinking it was only family coming to visit i paid it no mind... i opened my door and there was a man with two children about the age of 8-10 they looked like normal people but the only difference was they had very blue eyes, like glazed over and possesed eyes, they came at me and my child and tried to take the baby away from me and i ran to my neighbors house and they brotected me but the man and children were extremely strong! it seemed as if years passed by as my son was standing in the kitchen with a sippy cup as i was in my room packing my things, he started crying and i ran to him.. there was that man, no children i sight and standing there staring at my child! i grabbed him and ran, a few years passed again and my husband built this beautiful house with secret rooms and doors becasue as he had never saw the man and children, he beleived me! so he built rooms so hide in if i was scared when i saw them again! so my husband was at work and the ma and children showed up- me and my son now 7 ran to the hidden room, but the man found us and we went to a differnt room attched to that room and we went to the next and the next, and as the rooms got smaller and we got further and further away from the man my fear subsided, and when we finally got to the smallest room, to where we could go no farther, i called my husband and he was on his way home, he got home and found us, and we came out shaken and scared, we looked around and it was as if nothing happened, everything was in place and clean as i had left it! and then i woke up!



i was so scared to go back to sleep because everytime i would close my eyes i would see those blue glazed over possessed eyes! i eventually went back to sleep and had another dream that linked to this one, it had the same baby in it, but i do not remember much of it, as the first dream was ver detailed and scary!

maybe its your worst fear. or maybe its something similar to something that may happen in the future, or it just might be a dream that will never happen at all. that would be hella scary if something like that did come true though

No offense, but I think that you are taking this too seriously.



You do have a point with what you are saying about profiling, but that isnt really what is happening because  this is an opinion site, you arent forced to put information on this site about yourself, you can set your profile to private, and you arent sponsering the government in anyway.

i think motherhood is something that you'll react to directly when you're put into that situation. just because you aren't interested in babies now doesn't mean that if you were to ever have your own you wouldn't be a wonderful mother. it's just "not your thing"at the moment. you're young, go live your life and if the time comes for you to have a baby then embrace that opportunity. and if not, then maybe it's just something that wasn't in your cards.

I am 43 and I still Hate babies.. (I had one kid then had tubes tied)



for me I think its because my Mom LOVED them.. in fact she loved them so much she had 4 - I was the oldest... I think I hated babies because they got all the attention.. I was told to "be quiet.. you'll wake the baby" or "not now.. the baby needs me" etc..



nothing wrong with not liking babies.. although most people will think there is..
personaly I think its odd when people go nuts over other  peoples babys...
once they can walk/talk and do things I dont mind them so much myself.. and my kid is now a teen..



some times a better parent is the one who does not like babies.. but actually does like children...

Alpha, I don't know about it being inborn or not - the science of genetics hasn't progressed that far yet, LOL.  But a woman's feelings about having children can change drastically over time, and depending on her circumstances.



As a young girl and woman I wasn't "into" babies either, but in my mid twenties this changed and I started to want a child.  I ended up with just one (I never wanted dozens!). From experience I believe the urge to have children is governed by our hormones, although it isn't as simple as people make it sound.  Certainly, once you've been through one pregnancy, the urge to repeat the experience may become strong.



Some women feel this urge not at all, others with overwhelming intensity. Every woman's different and shouldn't be pressured to have children if she doesn't want them.  It's not as if humans were an endangered species...



The other thing is, you can love your own baby passionately without liking other people's children much at all!

How can I make myself study regularly and seriously instead of doing everything at the last moment?



I always study at the last moment. For instance, when I know that there's a class paper coming, I always put up the work until the last day, and even then I just start working at about 8 or 9 p.m. Actually I do work seriously then, I usually get fairly good marks, but I'd still like to study more and more regularly.



How can I do this? Is there some way of making yourself study even if you know that you still have some time left?



(I always do other, unnecessary things as long as I have time to study later...)

Create an artificial sense of urgency.



I suggest that you make sure you spend a certain amount of time, and accomplish a certain amount before you do other things that you want to do.



As it's mostly difficult to START doing your work, work yourself into say a solid hour of actually working on your stuff, but begin by costing yourself 10 minutes. (if you get a head of steam, you can stay longer)



This will have you practice at starting it, without thinking about what you're missing elsewhere. Work up to longer periods of time.



It worked for me.

I'm a procrastinator too.  What works for me is just stop thinking about it and just sit down and study!  i also trick myself into believing the deadline is sooner to make me do it.  Also if you tell family and friends to make you do it and check in on you if you don't then you usually stick to a study timetable.  Have you tried a study group?  if you study with a group of people regularly you become accountable to them and will feel bad if you don't do the assigned reading/studying in time thereby making you study or complete the assignment in good time and not last minute.  Goodluck

I had the same problems.  Studying was just something I didn't want to do.  I started a new study habit by simply studying on and off several times.  I would read over my notes for about 30 to 40 minutes.  Then go do something I wanted to do.  Then I would come back a hour or two later and read over them again.  It worked.  While I was doing the things I wanted to do, I would also have something I was studying come to mind.  It made test a lot easier.  Good luck.

Hi, I used to be a procrastinator also but with a little will of power and some tips I now do things in advance.
Doing class assignments was not the only thing that I always left to the last minute, maybe you are the same. I always waited to the critical time if I had to do a something around the house for my parents, if I had to file some papers for registration, etc.
First step is to be aware that leaving things to the critical time bothers you...so you have already taken a step forward if you want to change. Good for you!
Tell yourself that if you can do it today, do not leave it until tomorrow...constantly! Think about how bad you feel when you get stressed out at the last minute, the bad night you have thinking that you haven't given your best, that you could do better in the assignment if you had taken more time thinking about it.
If you start a few days earlier, you have more time to think about things as they come in the assignment. As a resutl, your work will have more insight.
I made a routine for myself. Set aside a specific time of the day to start your projects, rather early than 8 or 9 pm. Always the same time worked best for me. I went into my room, turned off all the lights except the one at my desk (so you have a focal point on your PC or your books. I enjoy music, so I played something that I enjoy but that makes me relax...and I set out to work! I ended up enjoying the time, because when the routine sets in you feel comfortable and happy in that space.
I also had a calendar that I followed. Whenever I was assigned a project or a test, I would mark the date and time in my calendar. Then, I would think about how much time it would take, and I would break it down in 1/2 or 1 hour segments spread out along the days I had left for the assignemt. 1/2 hour working on a task doesn't seem intimidating, and if you set yourself easy, attainable, tasks, you are more likely to finish. The end result is that big projects seem easy when broken into pieces. Just think that you do that 1/2 and hour first, and that's it! you are done with that task for the day!
What happened to me is that once I worked some time on a project, when in bed just before sleeping, I thought about what I would do next day in the project, so when the next day came along I already knew what the 1/2 hour on the task would be used for. Focus is a great ally!



It is an unbelievable good feeling to sleep every night knowing you are ahead of schedule and that you are turning in some homework or going to a test with the certainty that you have worked enough for top grades. Once I had that basis, doing things in time around the house, filing paperwork, etc. came easily.
Good luck!

8 Steps to defeat procrastination:



1.	Pick one area in which you find procrastination most annoying (homework, studying for tests)
2.	Begin small and progress as you experience success. Be patient. Establish your own deadlines. Be realistic in setting a timetable.
3.	Break the project into smaller parts. Chip away at it in small bites. Don’t wait for that “big chunk” of time.
4.	Set a definite beginning time. Yuu must break the inertia of inactivity. If getting started is especially troublesome, set a time for 10 or 15 minutes. Commit yourself to doing something on the project until the timer rings. Then you can decide whether to stop or continue. Chances are you will gain momentum and continue after the timer stops. If not, try another 10 minutes later in the day.
5.	Do the most important things first. Avoid the distractions of the trivial and routine tasks when a higher priority job is waiting in the wings. Examining each task in light of your goals will help you set priorities.
6.	Reward yourself for completing parts of a major task. It may be something as a 10-minute walk, a Coke, or a call. Contract with yourself for a big reward for completion of important tasks. A pizza, sleeping extra late on a weekend, or shopping for something may help motivate you to complete the job. Be nice to yourself.
7.	Avoid perfectionism. Excellence is a sufficient level of performance for most things in life, and for many tasks (a new hobby, cleaning your room) adequacy is all that is necessary. Give yourself permission to be less than perfect. A good garden may have some weeds.  You might double the amount of time spent typing a paper, attempting to get the spelling perfect.  Could that extra time be better spent in another activity which will better help your grades? Probably so.
8.	Procrastination is a learned habit, and can supplanted with a more constructive habit, giving your greater control over your life. If procrastination has limited your achievements, do something about it now!

I have been upset all weekend.. is this normal?



Many things happened this weekend that got me upset... such as i found out my boyfriend had a kid and then he broke up with me after I got mad and he changed his number. Then I went to my ex's for comfort and caught him in bed with another girl, even though i know he has the right to be with someone else. It still hurt and I think i cried so hard non stop that my chest hurts and my heart hurts a lot even right now. I keep crying but no tears will come out, and i cant breath and cant sleep or get out of bed. I still feel like Im in shock. I have never felt so depressed or cried so much but im not sure how to help myself and get over it. What would you do if this happened to you and is this normal for my body to react this way? Am I supposed to be this emotional to the point I want to hurt someone..I already see a therapist but it isnt working. Please no rude responses but any advice will be appreciated. Thanks

1st sort out your priority... which is more important, keeping the job or the housemate? i assume its the job. Do consult sum immigration lawyers.. usually their 1st consultation is free. Or you can also search online for lawyers near your area.Then start sending your resumes to different companies, you never know your luck. There are companies that also sponsor their employees. Just hang on for a while ....

To recognize a happy ending, someone has to package the story of your life in a way that points it out to you.  Real life doesn't have a bunch of endings to your stories--so whether your current adventure is prolouge to your 'story' or the end of the first installment (with a sequel to come) is something you really don't know.



I read Glory Road by R. Heinlein--where he tried to prove that there is no such thing as 'happily ever after'.  Basically the hero helped the princess save the universe, slay the baddie, and they were married and returned to the wonderful palace--2/3 of the way through the book.  The rest of the story made the point that any real hero won't be happy lounging around the palace like a playboy, so happily ever after had to turn into something a little different.

I would start by working on your inability to make a complete thought, then start working on your ability to compose a paragraph that is worth the time to read.

But in every group, some people are naturally dominant and others are naturally submissive.  Just don't ask your uncle about this, because being in prison is hard enough without your own family humiliating you.

I have worked with ex-cons. Rape is there, but it doesn't happen to all men. A person who breaks the prison code of ethics might get raped or what ever. A child molester can be raped but they are usually protected by seclusion from population.
A man who carries himself with respect, is quiet and goes about his own business gets along in prison. A mouthy punk trying to act bad takes his chances.

There are often subsets of prisoners, e.g. whites, etc., which band together to protect one another, literally watch one another's backs.  It may be the better part of wisdom for your relative to join with a non-abusive group.  Consider praying for him to be protected, to act wisely.

Where do you draw the line between empathy and co-dependency?



What symptoms or behaviors indicate that you've crossed the line from a healthy compassion and feeling to dysfunction?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



That's a really hard question to answer.  Every co-dependency situation is different, even though all of them share common elements.  The addicts use any trick they think will work to get them what they want.  For my cocaine-addicted daughter, it was money.



When I finally realized I was being conned, and shut off the money fountain, she had just given birth to her drug-addicted daughter....at age 42!!  Refusing to give her any more money was the hardest thing I've ever done.



I think what it really comes down to is that you have to use "tough love" if a person doesn't want to give up the addiction.  Nobody will change as long as their "routine" is still working to supply them with the whatever-it-is that they want.

Depression causes you to become less motivated. Yes, If they don't understand that  been depress is a chemical imbalance which affects a person's whole psyche and the people can't function properly either physically or emotionally. Yes, they may think you are lazy.



Some people might say they are depressed when they are demotivated, tired or a little down, but the debilitating, day-to-day living with clinical depression it can be a nightmare.



Laziness is totally different to clinical depression, but yes it can be mistaken for the one who doesn't understand the Definition of depression.

People do tend to blame depression on laziness and hypochondria. They think you should just snap out of it and stop feeling sorry for yourself. They don't understand it and being around it makes them uncomfortable. Sadly many people are just plain ignorant on the subject. On the other hand a person who is depressed may not realize they're depressed. The fortunate ones have someone (friend or family) who recognize the signs and see they get help. Others recognize the signs themselves and get help. Education is important both for the person suffering the mental illness and the people around them. You can't ignore the symptoms, they don't just go away.

Why make someone else responsible for your emotional well-being?  If you're depressed say so!  Then see your doctor.  She can give you medicine to bring you back to mental health.  You only need suffer from depression for as long as you choose to refuse to see your doctor.  We all go thru times of depression.  It's you who determines how long you wallow in it.

I have noticed that some (definitely not all, I promise) guys say very sexist stuff about women. I have been personally asked if my IQ is 40 or 50 by people who have never met me before because I'm a girl. I automatically assume that everyone I meet is very smart and has a potential for success. So why are there sexist pigs who assume differently? It is 2008, after all.

It sounds like you may be ready to get into Dr. Alfred Adler (the first psychiatrist to work with Freud, the first to leave him, and cdertainly the first psychiatrist in modern times to be considered a feminist or at least a male/female equalitarian.



When he debated Freud in early 1911, Adler suggested that some of the psychological problems (neuroses) women had in his day (and in Austria) was a result of "macsuline protest," or their unwillingness to remain within the definition of womanhood imposed on them by the men of their society.



Here's something I wrote about it briefly in one of my books on Adler:



"[In the debates] he also offered his theory of masculine protest in which certain symptoms are explained as reactions to society’s definitions of male and female which limit both men and women to definitions by the dominant male culture. Only a few options were available, one of which was to engage in neurotic actions or thoughts. (Today we call these “cognitive disorders.”) Thus the individual’s inability (or unwillingness) to reconcile personal definitions with socially acceptable sexual roles results in neurosis. Adler said hysteria (a woman’s problem because “hysteria” is from the Greek word for womb) could be explained not by repressed childhood sexual memories (Freud) but as a protest against restrictive female role stereotypes in a masculine society. From the beginning, Adler was a believer in, and proponent of, equal rights among the sexes."

They have low self esteems.



It doesn't help that the previous generations benefited from having privileges exclusive to them that are quickly getting stripped away.  So they are beginning to feel emasculated by society and have fathers that can't relate to this changing society.



(Don't get me wrong, I'm not advocating their behavior, but when it comes to change...men are more resistant than women are and they are not as able to verbalize it as well as women are.)



So pity them, they haven't learned what you've learned: that all people are equals and there is no need to put down someone else; it just makes you look pathetic.

I was always told that SAD was due to less light available during the winter and cloud cover.  One theory was to introduce UV lightbulbs in your house during these months but I think they ended up changing to these other lights that are very bright. (I don't remember the name...I'll see if I can find it.)



I end up doing a lot of exercise in the winter and spending as much time outside when it's clear.



But yeah, almost every light in my house is on during the winter months.  Then I go through a week with it being normal and then back to bright.  I was always told that the 'change' stimulates the brain.

Do you think she is insane?



My friend and I were watching the movie King Kong on the weekend, and there's a part where these guys are attacked by these giant worm like animals. One of the giant worms grabs a guy and takes him back into it's cave where it's probably eating him.
My friend laughed and I asked what was so funny. She said she loves scenes in movies where guys get eaten by animals, and that it turns her on in a way.



She has had the same boyfriend for years so I know she doesn't hate guys or anything.
Why would she find such scenes so interesting or even arousing? Is she insane?

know just how you feel have suffered from depression for 3 years now bought on by my partner having 2 breakdowns and me nursing him. Just invested in some animals to make life better got four ducks 1 drake, some bastard dumped a belgian bunny on the motorway near us so have him too he's called hercule as he looks like hercule poiroit. But seriously find something that makes you feel good and go for it no matter how extreme or daft it sounds its the only way to get back on an even keel.

Hello,



(ANS) technically your suffering from REJECTION more than depression I would suggest. But sad & painfully anyway :-((



YES! chocolate is a good one for comforting provided you don't over do it of course then you'll just feel sick on top of feeling down & blue.



**People don't behave in ways we expect or would like, there is always a reason for why people do things. Even if they don't make any sense to us at the time. That's because human beings are & behave in irrational & illogical ways, otherwise we would all end up like Dr.Spock from Star-Trek?

Perhaps pain is the only way in which we grow. But for most of us, it is not very quickly that we do. Here is a really great video that explains more about the pain we are faced with in life, the reason behind it and the purpose it serves. I hope it might help in answering your question. Best wishes.  Peace....River

Interesting thought. Rita



A saying I got from Dan Millman and I've found to be true is: Stress happens when you resist what is.



If personality is the ego as opposed to soul or spirit, then it's Spirit's way out of resistance and toward truth that brings redemption. But pain isn't necessary since the ego makes it up as an illusion. God didn't create a universe with pain.

If your not willing to tell your mother about it ... then ..



1. Discuss it with you BEST FRIEND
2. Or tell your mother IN A INDIRECT WAY, like you make up something very closely related to the disease that you have so that when she is asking you question about it , you may find a open field where you tell her actually whats going on with you ...



EXAMPLE:
you: mom , i have feaver
mom: ohh
you: i think my belly hurts



things like that

Tell your mom you don't feel good and have to see the doctor. It's not right, but even if you have to lie about your symptoms.  Then when you see the doctor, he will diagnose your problem and if it's not what you think, you're home free.  If it's what you think, discuss with your doctor about informing your parents . . .perhaps he can do it and in such a manner to lessen your burden.



BUT, you have to get into the doctor.  You can't stop having this disease on your own and either way, your parents will find out anyway and then you can be a lot sicker and pending what the disease you can die!  Or, it will get worse waiting to see a doctor.

Go to the doctor if you are able to get there on your own and get checked out. If you can't, time to fess up and tell your mom, and get to her take you to a clinic. No serious illness should be messed with. Especially if its serious enough to be asking on here.

Do you have another family member you can go to that can help you talk to your mom? If you do not go now, whatever you have can spread and make it much worse. Your mom will always love you because you are her child. No matter what you do or whatever happens, she will always love you and will do anything to help you. That's just what we mom's do.

you sound like you are a young teen, if so then this is normal.  We have a lot of emotions between the ages of 12 and 17.  We dont even know ourselves and slowly you will figure it out.  I dont think its that you necessarily like these guys but just that you yearn for romance and love.



Love yourself and then you can love others :)

That's perfectly normal to have some daytime fantasy's.  People fantasize about a lot of things and yours are pretty calm compared to other people.  If you had thoughts of violence, crimes against humanity while having a sexual thought . . .then you'd be in trouble.



You are perfectly normal.

It depends how you mean?



I wrongly take care of myself.



I don't take care of my inner body, as I eat junk food and I don't exercise (i'm not fat by the way but i'm just not healthy).



I take care of my hair, make up etc, and like to make myself look presentable with the clothes I wear.



I know ive got it the wrong way around and plan to start looking after what's inside my body soon too... but i'm only 23 at the moment and am enjoying being young and a little irresponsible!

it depends on what you mean by "take care of yourself."  If you mean am I independent,work a full time job, keep the house clean and pay the bills then, Yes I do. If you mean exercise regularly to to stay in top physical shape the answer is, No. Why? because my job keeps me busy and I have maintained the same weight since high school, I'm 43 210lbs and 6 foot 1. I am not toned but I am by no means fat or out of shape.

LIFE AND THE HIGH WAY....?



in ur opinion what are the similarities and differences between life and the high way ??



in my opinion :
the high way represents life ..cars represent humans .. similar cars r like soul mates, the different ones r family members, Friends, companions, co-workers and even enemies !! and when a car leaves the high way -in our case- it means death !



what do u think .. share ur thoughts if u don't mind :) and if u have a different way to represent life .. it would be great if u share it too :)



thanx in advance



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The highway is like a path you take in life to reach a certain destination, and you can either choose to stay on this path or take shortcuts that may be good or bad for you.



Cars are people, some driving faster than others because they think they know exactly what's ahead or they think they're able to grow fast without seeing what's really there beforehand. These would be people who speed thru life, thinking they know everything and want to grow up fast, and then they crash and burn out faster (flat tires, low gas, or car crash represents this).



The cars that go slower (steady people who take their time) who drive the speed limit (they're on the level they should be) have a more safer journey than the ones that speed.



Those who take different paths or shortcuts (quicker and easier ways thru life) could end up at the right place (good life) or the wrong place (bad life), depending on how well they know what locations are where (what life leads to). Those in the wrong path don't make it back (people end up dying or in jail).



It's our (cars) decision to make about what we want to do with our life (what roads you drive on/take to get to the right destination). We have maps and directions (role models, people willing to help us, friends, family) to help us along the way, but it's up to us to make the choice.

Prevent self from being stuckup?



I'm thirteen and I go to a very good private school and I play two instruments right now and am gonna start playing guitar as well soon. I do gymnastics and I am currently asking if I could take hip hop lessons.



I am so blessed to have all these things and I really do want to be kind to everyone and treat everyone nicely. I really want to think positively but I'm scared that all this will go to my head and if I become really good at something I'll.. yea let it go to my head.



I mean it happens to a lot of people. Whether they were already nice or mean. I think personality is the most important thing ever.



You know, beauty is only skin deep but your attitude is to the bone.



I'm very lucky and I know that. But I'm worried that I'll forget and let all this stuff go to my head.



I would try and earn the money to start hip hop lessons myself, but where I'm from, everyones already got maids to do work for them. Dog walking, babysitting, everything.



And I don't want to take money from my parents. I overheard them talking about how much money they've been losing lately. So no. I cant earn it.

If you see that you're doing something because you want to fit in, to be accepted and liked by others, you're forcing yourself to do it, and it's going out of your way to help others, you're not really doing it for yourself, but for them.



You do things for yourself when you don't care what others think, when you feel good about it, when it helps you out a lot, and when you don't have to worry about doing the same thing for others.

I guess it would make sense to simply ask yourself, "Hey, is this something I really want to do or am I only doing it because everyone else is?"  Would it be something you would still do even if you were the only one?

First, take your time.  You can always "choose a path in life".  Some have done so in their 80s (!), though not many.  Point is, you don't have to do this at any particular point.  Since it is a major decision, take your time.  An except is, if you are in college and facing your 3rd year, you would likely need to decide on a major.
If you are conflicted, and that led to this question ("p.s: in my case i can't choose a mix of both based on my circumstances."), you are not ready.  Give it time, write everything down (all the possibilities, every aspect, and reasons for and against each--that you can think of).  Take time, again, to develop your list.  Wait until you see the way more clearly, AND both your head and our heart give you the go ahead.
You need both, or you could make a major mistake.
A slow decision that is a good one is far superior to a poor quick one.

What ever it is it's not an open and honest relationship right now. I'd hate to man bash right now because it sounds to me like your already on that, so playing the devils advocate I'll go the other way and suggest that you support his need for privacy and ask him to see a doctor about his tiredness. He may be trying to avoid or is afraid of a health issue. Look at him more closely does he seem ill at all. Did his father have any health issues, such as heart failure or prostate problems?

It could be he has a low testosterone level. This happened with my husband. This is not like erectile dysfunction in any way. With erectile dysfuction the male parts do not work properly but the desire to have sex is still there. With a low testosterone level, all the parts work properly but the desire to have sex is NOT there because of the low level of testosterone. I guess you could say they have a very low libido. After running several blood test the doctor put my husband on testosterone replacement therapy and our sex life got better. Tiredness is also a symptom. Take your husband for a physical and bring this problem up to the doctor. My husbands doctor said this was a common problem with men but they usually don't talk about the fact that they just don't have the desire to have sex.

It seems that perhaps you are not able to communicate properly right now, and it's hard to be intimate if other things are not right. Are there  parts of your relationship that you are finding it hard to talk about?Is there a long standing difference of opinion that you might both be having which is unresolved? Is there an age difference between you? He may have become less interested because of that. Some men do!

Spiritual awakening? Can one conversation/friend/experience in life completely open your eyes?



I have been ignoring and suppressing so much in my life for years now, and I am young, only 26. I have recently had a friend that opened my eyes in a way no one has even been able to do. I mean I have had friends, boyfriends even my husband and family who have never made me feel this way or helped me recognize what I have been missing and doing to myself. It’s amazing, I mean it’s like a hit a wall and this person has in a way changed my life…I am thinking of things and thinking of dealing with things that for years I have ignored, put on a happy face and told myself were great when I know they weren’t.



Why is it that there is one person that can get to you in this way? Is able to touch you in a way no one ever did to realize what you have been doing to yourself? Do you think god puts these people in your life? If you don’ believe in god…then whatever it is you think brings these people to you. I don’t know how to thank them, I mean trust me pain has been involved as well with this friendship but out of pain is coming such an awakening in my life. Has this ever happen to you and how can this be explained?

Maybe "this person" as you refer to him, just had a better way of understanding and getting through to you better than anyone else has.  Sometimes, with the people who have always been in your life, like you family and husband, we have a way of shutting them out when they reach out to us, frankly it's because we assume they don't know what they're talking about.  So maybe you actually just listened to this person.

They listen to people whine all day then offer direction and advice. If you're good, you will lead people to discover their own answers which will leave them better off because of their new insight on themselves.

first of all its a competitive field that you need a masters and sometimes a phd for. theres 2 types of therapists..psychatrists and psychologists. psychatrists also have their doctors degree so they can counsel people and dispense medications and can sometimes act as a regular doctor.
psychologists deal with more counseling and give out IQ tests and learning disability tests. and do more behavior therapy with people.
so basically what therapists do is they help people and listen to people one on one and you have to deal with people from mild depression to severe schizophrenia. you might do simple chat sessions or intense behavioral therapy. its a tough thing to do but if you know what your doing and your organized it won't be a problem.

It depends on what type of therapist (I assume you are talking about psychology and not a physical therapist) you are referring to and if it is private practice or otherwise. Either way, they analyze people and their situations and try to show their patients ways to re-direct themselves in ways to function better in a given situation. My daughter is in her 3rd year of college in psychology and still has not completely decided exactly what direction she is going to go with it, but this usually happens in the 4th year and then you concentrate on that during grad school.

Is it common to feel extremely sad when thinking of your old home? Am I crazy?



Hey all, I'm off at college and even though I'm doing alright, I'm still having a tough time adjusting. It's fun and exciting starting a new life and moving on from where I used to live. I get so excited when I think of moving somewhere even newer after college. But whenever I think of home, I get very sad. The stupidest things trigger these memories and emotions. The other night, I lit up a lighter outside to start a bonfire with some friends and the leaves were all around, and it reminded me so much of my mom lighting candles on Thanksgiving day, and my loving family all around partaking in this meal, that all these memories just flooded back and I had to go for a walk by myself away from everyone, feeling as if I might cry. I never know when it's going to happen or what will trigger these memories. I feel like I'm going nuts. Is this normal, and if it is, does one ever get over it? I've had my share of hard knocks but I don't know if anything is as bad as bittersweet pain. Gosh, am I stupid or what? Thanks for reading and any advice is greatly appreciated, especially from those who have lived through my time and can tell me how it turned out.

Psychologists' Earnings



It varies - depending on location, experience, education, etc.



According to http://www.apa.org/monitor/mar00/facts.h... about $60,000 - $80,000+ - information is almost six years old though.



According to http://swz.salary.com/salarywizard/layou... generally $65,000 - $85,000



According to http://www.bls.gov/k12/social04.htm $1138,000 - $1165,000



Here is more input:



There are WIDE variations in part because psychologist is a fairly broad term - pay is going to vary depending on where one practices and what kind of practice one has, not to mention education, etc. For instance, a psychologist in NY is going to make a lot more money, probably, than a psychologist in a small town in the Appalachian mountains. On the other hand the latter's cost of living is MUCH lower. Also, you don't state what country you are talking about. I just assumed USA, because it was easier. I just went into Google and searched with the terms psychologist and pay. You might also want to check with your local library. Narrow down your question, if possible, for more accurate results.



The median expected salary for a typical psychologist in the United States is $72,487.



There are too many different ranges of psychology to put it simply. But, generally, they get that money flowin'! I'm suggesting around $50,000+ salary. It most definitely could be higher but it depends in what field of study and if the demand is high. However, that's if your willing to spend several years on psychology education. But it all "pays off" and it's definitely worth it.



Most careers in pyschiatry earn up to about $163,144. Due to the fact that psychiatrists are doctoral level professionals you would or should be expecting to make up to more than 100k.



Psychiatry is much different than psychology. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor that can prescribe medicine to his/her patients. Most psychiatrists no longer provide therapy but tend to treat mental disorders by prescribing and managing medication. A psychologist holds a PhD or a PsyD (Doctor of Psychology) and treats mental disorders using psychotherapy. The tend to make much less than a psychiatrist. Depending on where they work...(private practice, hospitals, schools) psychologist salaries range from 20,000 to well, well over 100,000. There is no real median.



Psychologists can be paid very different salaries and rates. Some of the best therapists charge their clients hundreds of dollars per hour. Counselors at clinics and non-profit organizations might make minimum wage. The best income in the field goes to psychiatrists, who have an MD.



Some psychologists work for the state in administrative positions, evaluating people at prisons and mental health facilities. Others may work at state employment service or other state facilities that need psychologists. The specific dollar numbers vary from state to state. Some psychologists work for private industry and some are self employed. The pay scale varies greatly, partially depending on the opportunities that came to the psychologist and partly depending on the skill of the psychologist. Some psychologists who work in a private office can make a very good living, but like most professions, only the best will be able to make the top dollars. If you aren't very good you won't get many customers in a private practice situation. If you ARE very good, you can set your own price and you'll still get people pounding on your door to give you money.



The median salary for a psychologist in Denver, Co for example is $78, 668 per year. Try www.monster.com and you can refine your search to any city in the US. The career section allows you to search for this data and its free.



The range can vary from $20,000 a year to $100,000 a year, depending on what and where they practice. Check out salary.com or the occupational outlook handbook online for all kinds of salaries.



According to the most recent American Psychological Association salary survey (2001), the overall 11-12-month median salary for licensed doctoral-level clinical psychologists was $72,000.
To learn more about clinical psychology, go to the website for the Society of Clinical Psychology:
http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/about...



The average salary varies according to experience and the location of the practice. Here is the most recent (2003) APA salary survey.
For a doctorate:
College psychology faculty made about $62,000 per year.
Research psychologists made between $78,000 and $95,000 per year.
The average salary for a clinical psychologist is about $75,000.
School psychologists made an average of $78,000.
Industrial-organizational psychologists made an average of $130,059 (this number is misleading..there were a lot of outliers).
Administration of applied psychology positions had an average salary of $143,344 (this number is also misleading for the same reasons stated above).

I want to be a doctor but specialize in psychology, do I need physics to achieve this, because I don't need to work machinery or anything like that... Do I? Thanks!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You don't typically need physics if you're gonna be a M.D.  Biology, chemistry, anatomy and physiology, maybe some maths (such as statistical analysis).



However, what you need to decide is what career path you want in psychology.  Here's a basic breakdown of "titles":



Psychiatrist - An medical doctor (that means med school, interning and residency w/ specialization in psychiatry).



Clinical Psychologist - That's a PhD kind of "doctor".  No med school, so no ability to prescribe drugs, BUT you pretty much do everything else a psychiatrist would do.



Then, there are the other kinds of psychology specialties which include counseling, forensics, etc., etc. some of which may also offer a PhD level of academic preparation.



So the first question is what kind of "doctor" do you want to be.  Then, research what schools you would be looking to gain such a degree from and what the degree plans at those schools require for completion.



Hope that helps.

"Why do men have to be macho ?
Is it to look respectable in front of other men ?" Yes.



"Or to impress women ?" Yes.



"Do guys beat up other guys if they are not macho ?"  No, not usually.



You seem annoyed at men who are macho.  Understand that society conditions men, telling them that they have to be strong.  Women do this to, making it obvious, though subtle, that they want strong men.  Just because feminism has been around now for a few decades doesn't automatically mean that men will lose that conditioning.



Feminists, at best, want to compete with men for position and privilege, and at worst, hate men, and downgrade them at every opportunity.  What do men want? For the most part a nice gal.
I say this: If we still can't get along after centuries of trying, how far have we come from cavemen days or the Middle Ages?

What is the best way to deal with a bully at work?



I work with a fellow who fancies himself as being "open-minded" and "tolerant", but the reality is that he is a smarta** know-it-all who gets a great deal of delight out of being argumentative and verbally abusive.



His idea of a "conversation" is to lecture at people, and when they disagree with him, or simply get tired and get up and walk out, he dismisses them as stupid and unenlightened. His patronizing attitude is really grating.



When you point this out to him, he becomes hysterical and defensive, and says that we "need to lighten up", and that he is "only kidding".



HR and management ignore his tirades, so we are pretty much left to our own defenses. I'd like to think that he really is a good person who just has poor social skills, but the reality is that he is just downright mean, and enjoys being a jerk.



My guess is that he is very insecure, and knows deep inside that his behavior is wrong and that nobody likes him, so he keeps lashing out because he can't deal with his own faults. Still, I'm not sure that is license to be forgiving and "take the high road". Fact is, he's a twerp who needs to have his clock cleaned . . . obviously not physically, because it's not worth losing our jobs for . . . but once-and-for-all in a verbal rebuke that lets him know we are fed up and we are not kidding.

I can't find happiness, can anyone help me figure out what is going on?



I am junior in engineering at a big 10 school known for the subject. my family has a history of bi polar disorder and addiction to drugs and alcohol, i have been in and out of depression before and I've dealt with it and come back stronger than ever, but this time is different; however mind you i understand my family loves me and would care if i were gone i have no desire to end my life, i just want to be as proud of myself as they are of me. The things I am good at and love to do just don't satisfy me the way they use to. I am paying for school on my own through loans and whatever money i can make over the summer interning. I am good at what i do, i know this, my bosses know this, even though its not comforting knowing that... which it should given the field. I use to love to draw, play hockey, play tennis, hang out with my friends, now i just find myself being unsatisfied with everything as if i am not good enough to do any of it. I understand this is not a simple question, just asking what is wrong with me is an issue in itself in that is not a simple question expecting a simple answer.

I think that you're intended to hold a position higher than the one you're preparing for.  Your spirit (if you're a believer) or subconscious is prodding you to move forward to something more challenging.  That's why nothing is satisfying to you now, to challenge you to get up and go find something better.  I've been through that twice.  It's a hard step to take, but now I'm glad I did it.  And it gets easier with practice.

Reading your history, not just medical/family, but how you USED TO love to do things, I really think it is clinical depression.  Fortunately and unfortunately, ant-depressants are available.  However, if you should chose to do so, research shows taking the meds as well as talk therapy is the most effective.



However, having said that, remember that happiness comes from within, not from DOING or receiving from an outside source.

I recently underwent something similar.



I am med student at Johns Hopkins, 38S on my MCAT, and almost full ride scholarship. Anyone would assume that I was ecstatic, I wasn't.



I became apathetic, loss all of my drive, and just didn't give a damn anymore, like you I wasn't suicidal. I just found it hard to really put meaning to anything in life.



Here is what was wrong: I was bored with life, and the trivial nature of ... everything.



I'm gonna assume that you're an intellectual capable of strong rational and abstract thought with a large helping of common sense. Our decisions come easier and seem more obvious than those around us, we have become so good at what we know that we temporarily forget about adversity and take for granted the concept of 'not knowing'.



My advice: take on activities that are completely foreign to you, something what you will make you challenge yourself again.  It wont be easy to get up, but find something that will light a fire under your ***.



Good luck, and keep on keepin on.

It has to do with serotonin. Serotonin has also to do with your feeling of being full. You over-produce serotonin when in love, and thus lose your appetite.

Binging and using laxatives to purge can be considered a form of bulimia.  You may need counseling to get to the root of the actual problem that is causing this behavior.  Good luck.

Honey you are at least on the verge of a very serious disorder if not even more in depth of it. What you are describing are signs and symptoms of an eating disorder.
You will need to get a Professional diagnosis and go from there. Usually people need help with that disorder. Please get an appointment with a therapist to be evaluated. Be as truthful as you have been on here.

School spirit made me cringe and group work made me want to break my leg... why?



In highschool my friends and I were basically a group of loners who hung out together, listened to nirvana and metal and smoked marijuana. we avoided group work with other peers, we refused to participate in activities on school camps, we didn't join in swimming carnivals or sports days, and we didn't celebrate school spirit. i spent a lot of time studying at nights and on the weekends. on weekends we would go to the cool kids parties and get really drunk. all my friends went on to university and have jobs now or are nearly finished their degrees. i have one degree and im onto my second. i was just wondering what type of people my friends and i were in highschool?

Why are they so prejudiced against my security blanket?



My problem is that I have a silk hankerchief "security blanket" that I've had since I was a little kid. I've become kind of dependent on it, but so what? It's not hurting anybody. Anyway, I think word must have got out about it because people in work look at me funny and avoid me. I mean, I'm discreet, I keep it in my pocket and rub it at odd moments. Sometimes I have to rub it a lot. Occasionally I rub it in meetings and all anybody seems to be doing is watching me. What's wrong with having a security blanket?

I agree, it is not hurting anyone else so why should it be a problem? I do agree with the others saying it would now be considered a "good luck charm".



There's nothing wrong with a security blanket, I think it's just that most with security blankets are usually children, however you are not. Those who are avoiding you are just being ridiculous, it might be a little odd or cute, but it doesn't make you any less a person or an oddball!



I think in fact we all have our own security blanket but it might be something as simple as "carrying a mobile phone constantly". I would imagine those mobile (or cell phone) freaks would be quite insecure without it! So there you go.

Yes, calling it a good luck charm might be more appropriate. And rubbing it in your trouser pocket may not be a good idea, as they will definitely think you are doing something else. :)



But as you say, it isn't hurting anyone, so to hell with anyone who wants to make something of it.

All the music I listen to is prior to the year 2000. The movies I love are all old. I love old clothing styles. The list goes on! I love history and stuff, maybe I was influenced heavily by my parents I dont know. I know I hate change and against most new things..

This is just a guess, but it's based on personal experience.  If you're facing some problems, you could be longing for a time when life was slower and simpler.....when you didn't have to make big decisions.



I like 50s and 60s rock, because it brings back a period of my life where I was young and footloose.  Next to the sense of smell, the sense of hearing brings back the most powerful emotions for me.

Patterns, habits, memories, etc., all help form our personality...in fact, we could almost say they ARE our personality.

Well, nothing has worked so far, except for this ONE time a few months ago when in my dream someone was attacking me and i used my mind to make him fly around out of control...

I have always been able to control what happens in my dreams. I have lost this ability. Why?



I used to always look forward to dreams. Especially nightmares as they were always such thrills, and I was in complete control of them. Turns out that nightmares are not quite as thrilling when I do not defeat whatever the problem is, though. I no longer seem to realize I am dreaming, and do not gain control over it anymore. What could cause me to lose this ability, and how do I regain it?

I believe when you are 'in control' of your dreams, assuming you arent under delusions or something, you are having a lucid dream. This is the transition when you are awake and asleep, so it's like you realize you are asleep kinda thing and can control some parts of your dream.



I think it might be because you have been very tired lately? Or falling asleep very quickly. This speeds up the transition from awake to asleep and when you fall into a deep sleep, you dont dream consciously anymore.

your falling out of touch with yourself. do you meditate? i dont and can lucid dream but ive heard that it helps to lucid dream or learn to. also if you tell yourself everynight before bed to rub your hands together when you realize your in a dream...somehow you realize your dreaming and do it (at least that worked for me...took a few weeks of saying it to myself first tho). i cant remember where i read that at lol. i think if you try real hard to remember to do this, you will catch on. sorta like when you almost over sleep? ever done that? its like something tells you to wake up? well i think thats sorta the same thing.

If you're wishing bad on someone because they did better than you did then your focus is on the wrong person.  (Jealousy stems from low self esteem.)



Don't compare yourself to others' abilities but compare yourself to yours.  When I shot archery, I competed with myself and didn't much care how else other people did.  Pretty soon, I was winning the respect of 300 shooters.



Did you do the best that you could do?  If so, then let it stop there.  If not, figure out what you could do to improve.  But if you live your day based on whether other people do better or worse than you do, then you give them power over your feelings.



The more you are proud of YOUR achievements the higher the self esteem you'll obtain and then you'll genuinely be glad for others' success.

My biggest problem right now is the fact that my fiances mother tried to beat me up earlier today. He is eighteen years of age and we wanted to get married. His mommy didn't like that so she literally man handled him, took him to his grandmas and dumped him there where I couldn't help him. He called me yesterday night begging for me to come get him. Well, I wasn't about to go anywhere at midnight, so I called him back today and he said he wanted me to come up, to make sure his grandma was okay with this I spoke with her. She invited me up and sure enough as I got there, his mother was there and I wouldn't stop because I am sick of her and not wanting to get into a fight. I called my fiances grandmas house to let them know what was going on, my fiance was crying his eyes out, begging me not to leave him, but I didn't want his mom to try anything to me nor him. I left and his mom followed me thirty miles back to my house, where she then got out of her car and told me to stay away from her son, which hello he is eighteen. I told her to get off my property, she threatened to hit me, I again told her to leave, she then tried to hit me. She is trying to say she has guardianship over him, which I am now trying to find out whether that is true or not. I ended up calling the police, his parents were trespassed from my property and told to leave me alone. This is my biggest problem because I am heart broken, he is heart broken and I am terrified he may attempt suicide. And I do not know what to do about it.

School spirit made me cringe and group work made me want to break my leg... why?



In highschool my friends and I were basically a group of loners who hung out together, listened to nirvana and metal and smoked marijuana. we avoided group work with other peers, we refused to participate in activities on school camps, we didn't join in swimming carnivals or sports days, and we didn't celebrate school spirit. i spent a lot of time studying at nights and on the weekends. on weekends we would go to the cool kids parties and get really drunk. all my friends went on to university and have jobs now or are nearly finished their degrees. i have one degree and im onto my second. i was just wondering what type of people my friends and i were in highschool?

You don't fit into the standard mold.  I'm sure you're having a hard time of it now, but in a few years you'll have new friends in a new place, and you'll be satisfied with your life.

no i dont think so. i used to be very confident, not shy and in my opinion had a great personality. i was liked by everyone and was just a generally nice person to be around, i know this. but things happened in my life that knocked me for six and i now have a super low self esteem which i need to get back. its hard as i know i can be a good person yet i feel trapped in this situation. i have become extremely insecure about my looks and this makes me conscience in social situations. like as im always thinking about myself and others perception of me then i struggle to communicate properly with people as my mind is never really focused. so to sum up, you devolop low self esteem and i think the way to overcome it is to build up confidence within yourself, as when i feel confident very rarely, i have good self esteem. so just be confident about your looks and stuff and you will feet better, gd luck x.

No, you aren't born with it.  You get it from your parents.



According to Erikson's theory, you develop it from 6 yrs to teen years and according to Maslow, you develop self esteem after you've had the first two levels of his pyramid met.



Erikson has empirical evidence (which means it has a lot of data to back it up).  That's why I use him in almost all my answers.



And if your parents meet Maslow's level 1 (giving you shelter, food and clothes) and 2 (creating a safe place for you to fail, rebel, etc.) you'll be able to obtain level 3.  Iow, you'll have the objects that you need and the acceptance that you need in order to try new things and develop your own relationships.



BTW, it also helps if your friends give you a safe place to make mistakes but that's a hard thing to find until you get to the later teen years.



Hope this helps.

I think I have something like you have.  I spend like a hour reading a page and I still won't process any of the information.  I'm really bad at learning stuff right away and I need the teacher to slow down sometimes and keep explaining.  I forget stuff easily too.  Its very frustrating, because I know I can do better, I just can't help myself sometimes.  To deal with it I usually go to the library in the study area where its quiet or to a spare room at the end of the hall.  Little things like music, voices and colors can easily distract me.

I studied with a psychoanalyst who said that a dream will stop only when you have discovered its meaning. It is the subconscious giving us a message. The person you lost is actually a part of your personality. What characteristics does this person have? That is the part of you trying to speak. Worry less about what is actually being said, but instead how it makes you feel. I don't know the details but you said you felt unaware. In other words you are confused. Is there a decision in your life that is confusing you? The person you lost represents the part of you in conflict and confusion. I hope that helps you think on it a little clearer.

How do you learn to lucid dream?



I read somewhere to just randomly throughout the day think "Ok, am i awake or asleep? Can i make that thing over there move?" etc so then you should start thinking that when you are asleep as well...
Well, nothing has worked so far, except for this ONE time a few months ago when in my dream someone was attacking me and i used my mind to make him fly around out of control...
But the point is, how do you learn to do it? thankyou, hehehe!



</question>

theres many sites ''claiming'' to do this but i think you just have to concentrate really hard before bed, saying to yourself '' i WILL lucid dream tonight''. then clear your mind and go to sleep, it might work. but i feel that an element of it is what you are born with im not sure. good luck anyway.

In the famous bobo dolls experiment, children imitated what they had seen adults on tv do, by violently hitting dolls. This would seem to suggest this. Certainly children are more impressionable then adults. However, i child cant learn to speak from television as it is inherent in the human mind that it isnt real. This would inform us that television is escapism and even children can distinguish it as false. This is a long debate, but tv and video games are a current scape goat for the present moral panic and before this rap, metal, radio have all been blamed. Parenting and peer pressure are bigger issues.

Most definately - children are developing and their brains therefore absorb and learn from what they see and hear.

The majority of studies show short term effects in younger children especially boys when watching violence on tv, but older children and teenagers are less influenced by television.



There was one study, I forget who conducted it, that had children watch either someone hitting or hugging a blow up toy, when put in a room with a similar blow up toy the children copied what they had seen earlier on the screen.

How can I get my oldest son to help his siblings?



I have three kids, two sons and one daughter. My oldest son who is 32 runs a couple business, own three houses, two business properties, and coach kick boxers and few professional fighters.
He has always been the type who keeps his eyes on the economy, current event, and everything. He have always been very paranoid type, he have been hoarding on precious metals and diamond, investing, and spread moneys in couple different countries ever since he started his business.  Ever since around 2004, he have been freaking out about the economy and telling everyone to start keep their eyes on the economy. But we didn’t take him seriously.
My daughter who is 27 and her husband bought a house three years ago and just opened a construction business about two years ago, they are going through a incredible tough time right now. I’ve never saw my daughter so badly stressed out and upset. They’re seriously considering closing the business down and walk away from the house. On top of all this, they have two children.
My youngest son is 24, just graduated from college but is still living with me and my husband because he was unable to afford to live on his own with the high gas price and trying to find a job. It just got worse for him, his car broke down and he doesn’t have the moneys to afford to repair it. He also desperately wants to purchase a house while the price is low.
My husband got laid off from his job three weeks ago and is still trying to find a job. So we’re very tight on moneys and living off my income and our saving.
We have tried to ask my oldest son for help. He told my daughter that since she and her husband was spending moneys like water and buying bunches of junks then a year after they opened the business, they take a expensive trip to Europe. So he’s not going to help them out unless my daughter sell her car that she adore, close down their business, and her husband to pawn their expensive brand new entertainment system.
He told my youngest son that he’s not going to help with car since it will just cost more moneys in long run, he’ll buy my son a bicycle. As for the house, my oldest son say if my youngest son would have saved his moneys instead of buying a car, throw moneys away all way through college, and listened to his advice, he’d be able to have a house by now.
Normally I and my husband would help our children, but we’re in no position to. We’re shocked by how cold my oldest son is. He has nearly or even around a million of dollars in assets or cash. He could spare just some moneys for his brother and sister and not even feel it a bit and make a big difference for them. But he refused.
I’ve tried to explain that my daughter and her husband have a very tough time with starting business because they have two kids so they want to reward themselves for making it last a year. Especially since my oldest son have been all around the world and talk about it all of the time. They wanted to see what it is like and if what he say is true. My oldest son just say that it is their problem since they never listen to him when he warned them about things or suggest a advice.
He could easily help my youngest son and my youngest son will pay him back. My oldest son knows it. My oldest son may not mind walking or riding bike everywhere, but he’s incredible athletic, even for his age. So it’s unfair for him to use that as a measure stick. My youngest son may make some bad decision in college, but that is normal part of college. My oldest son doesn’t know what it’s like to be in college. He attend a community college and dropped out after a year to pursue a career in kickboxing before he start all businesses.
My oldest son also repeatedly tells us that if we’d have listen to him long time ago, we’d not be in the spot we are now. I’m so offended by this. I don’t like how he expected us all to go through all hassle to do what he did.
I just wish he’d have some heart and help out. I don’t understand his issue with all of this.

It's not people skills you need. It sounds like you need just a touch of confidence. :) Stop paying attention to your voice! Very few people like their voice. (Trust me I know! I am an actress for stage--which is the most difficult place to hide a horrible voice-- and find my own voice almost nauseating, HOWEVER, people tell me all the time that it sounds sexy and adorable! :P I have done several one woman shows, and it is nice to be reassured that my voice is ok, by how well people pay attention to me while I act before them.) If you really don't like your voice in another week, sign up for voice classes. This will teach you how to change your voice to your liking.



Good Luck!

I know the feeling. I have pretty bad speaking and communication skills. I used to get nervous very easily when people talked to me.



It's one of those things that just goes away with experience. I agree with the above poster that working as a cashier does help develop people skills if you're willing to put forth an effort. For me, going to University also helped me get rid of my nerves because you're constantly meeting and interacting with people.



I know JUST what you mean. Sometimes you can't stay focused when trying to deliver a logical sentence and halfway you sort of lose your train of thought due to nervousness. Even I still have that problem.

Don't concentrate on how you sound when you're having a conversation - concentrate on the subject you're talking about and what the other person wants to hear. When you talk, don't think "I sound crazy right now." It will only direct your attention away from the conversation. Relax and realize that people are not judging you and they see you in a whole different perspective than how you see yourself. Before other people accept you, you have to accept and be sure of yourself. Have confidence - everyone wants to talk to that type of person.



Best of luck.

The best talkers listen. There's a best seller by Dale Carnegie called "How to Win Friends and Influence People". It should be required reading in school. I would say about 80% of people do not practice the skills in this book, but should.



One trick I do when I feel like you do is to just ask the other person a question. Take the talking burden off of yourself for a few seconds to give yourself a breather. Works great on interviews. Plus people love any evidence that you've listened and processed what they've just said. So, paraphrase what people say. This is kind of cheating but people love it. You basically say what they just said to you back to them but switch up the words a bit.

Sounds odd, but practice. Focus on the topic at hand....smile when you talk, of course unless it is a gruesome topic... Don't worry about what others 'hear'... worry more about what you are saying, what you are meaning... and just focus on that....their perception of you will be formed no matter what. Make it the more sincere value of what you are contributing, then just the mere sound of what you are saying. What is better then How any day...

Be patient and tolerant...what others do or say must not affect you at all. They are just giving their own opinion, or made mistakes. Things that are happened, that are already in the past which cannot be undone, then don't think about it anymore, even if it's just 1 minute ago. Try not to be too stressful or being sad as it will provoke frustration when you encounter things you don't like more easily.

Observe the emotion, but don't touch it.
Noone wants to have negative feelings, yet when they arise what do they do? They grab onto it and feel a strong burn. Then you ask them why and they say they had a good, rational reason for being upset, so they grabbed the emotion. If they just start using their logic to say "if you attach to this emotion that's arising you're going to get burnt, so just let the emotion be and watch it die on its own" rather than "this emotion's arising and I so have a good reason for agreeing with it that I'm gonna grab it as hard as I can" they wouldn't burn themselves.



Anger, stress, fear etc. are all like a boiling pot of water. They don't care why you're putting your hand it; all they know is to burn whatever touches them. So don't touch them. Practice meditation and you'll learn to avoid putting your hand in because your logic will program you to move away from the pot instead.

Try to remember  that when you're faced with an issue, that YOU have a choice to feel something about it or to feel nothing about it. You don't have to respond to things just because they are placed in front of you any more than you having to eat food you don't like just because the plates there.
I make it a practice to take my time to think things through before I respond especially if it's provoking an emotional response from me immediately. Patience is a cool frustratingly wise teacher.

Breathe in slowly through your nose and out of the mouth.  This will keep your heart rate down ank keep your skin from flushing.  When you feel like you are about to loose your temper, count slowly to five before blinking.  This will distract you by waiting for the next blink instead of (add your violent fantasy here).  You might try a slight smile but without teeth.  Try to apper as if you are listening to a long boring joke.  The antagonist will get the idea that you are amused and not dying to (again with the violence thing).  It takes practice but if you are smart enough to ask, you know you can be the better person.  Best of luck.

Is it possible to radically change your life?



I'm 31 and I've always been an optimistic, positive type person.
Recently my 6 year relationship with my girlfriend has ended (she dumped me - none of it was my idea) and i'm finding myself evaluating all aspects of my life.
At the moment I'm living back with parents and just recovering from the break-up, but i've started to realise i'd put a lot of my goals on the backburner for the last 6 years.
One of the big things I wanted to do was open a chain of shops and for one reason or another I never got round to sorting it all out.
At the moment i'm slightly destitute - i've lost my apartment, furniture, car, my current job has suddenly started going wrong (and i've got bored of it anyway) and obviously i've lost my GF. I don't actually feel depressed, but just a little sad at how everything has changed suddenly within the space of 4 weeks!
Do you think it's possible for somebody to make a massive comeback and say in a year or two's time to be achieving the things you want at 31, or do you think at 31 i'm past my peak??
As I say it's very unlike me to question myself like that but I just wanted some other opinions.
Thanks!

Generally, it is slow for life - but that does not mean one cannot excel at life.  Memory has a factor here too, as does maturity and personal responsibility, upbringing, and a host of other factors.  It is more noticeable in an academic atmosphere because it takes longer to learn, but with hard work and lots of studying, you CAN learn and even test better than "average" learners who have not studied!

You feel bad about yourself.  You feel unworthy, hopeless, disliked anxious, and many other things because of the way you entertain negative thoughts feelings and emotions that are deceiving you into believing this rubbish about yourself.  Your self-esteem is low and you have no confidence in yourself.



You need to stop this because you are going a destructive path and its not necessary.  You need to do the opposite and substitute negative thoughts feelings and emotions with positive thoughts and the only way you will succeed in this matter is to realize that you matter to God and even to the world, because God brought you here for a reason.  You are not a mistake.  You are somebody.  You are unique, priceless and precious.  You have talents, gifts and skills given to you to use.  You have allowed people to dominate and oppress you in the past, possibly a parent or a brother or sister or even people around you have bullied you.  You need to stand up and be accountable to self.  You are worthy and acceptable and you are imagining things that are not there by entertaining presumptuous and assumptious thoughts! You think that people think badly of you when they are probably wondering why you look at them funny because they cant figure you out.  People will treat you the way you treat yourself.  You have to get out of this bad habit.  So from now on begin saying: " Lord Jesus forgive me for insulting you and telling you that you made a mistake with me. Thank you for showing me that you car about me.  Thank you for all my blessings.  Give me the will to will to be positive and remind me every time I get negative that I am totally off the mark.  Father become very real in my life and lead me besides still waters where you say you will restore my soul.  I place my faith trust and hope in you. Help me not to be so self absorbed and to fight the pit of self pity where all the negative things dwell.  Take me to the fields of hope and to the mountains of possibility, opportunity and abundance. Run the race of time with me and pick me up when I fall and also give me strength when paths become too steep for me to carry on. Thank you Lord for rescuing me!"



Go out and be a friend to someone who is lonely, hurting, poor and helpless, do things for your parents, do things for others and when you do this you will forget all about these issues that are trying to break you down.  You have one thing in your favour and that is the freedom of choice.  Now choose the right and positive things and let go all the negative things.  Its something you have to work at all the time until the old bad habit you cultivated disappears and you have substituted it with a better one. You are the master of your own destiny and no one is responsible for what you have allowed to consume you all these years but you.  Rise up and be the person God wants you to be.  God bless you!

you can control your dreams to a particular point once you reach a state of deep unconciousness then your dreams take there own way and when you wake up you can kind of remember what you were dreaming about but you probably wont be able to for long unless it was something that was really scary or something that stuck in your mind

<answer>



Dreams are three:



from God, from the devil and from yourself.  Visions and prophecies are sent to blessed people so that they are imbued with more insight, knowledge than others.  Nightmares are a deserving reward for those who are unrighteous in spirit and those from the self,...well, they pretty much either filter out the mundane, day to day happenings or manifest some event or undertaking in your life in ways different from reality.That's it.

What Makes A Person Intelligent?



I have asked a similar question on this before.  But would appreciate advice or views on the following.



Are all people born with the same intelligence level?  Are we all born the same?
Or is it down to how that person takes note in class?



My previous question on the above resulted in an answerer saying that it was not down to genes-as this person was studying at uni.  He was the first person from that family to attend anything like that.  So it’s not down to genes (??)



So if that is true is it down to that person paying more attention in class-hence succeeding in life.



What makes a person intelligent?



Thank you

I think about intelligence this way:



If our brains is like a computer:



Intelligence would be the processor and ram (doesn't change).



Knowledge and experience would be the software (changes).



Although, intelligence may help our processing/rational abilities without knowledge you are pretty much useless.

I'll have to say a combination of things:



1. Genes: you can't deny the relation, but it's certainly not the only nor the major influence.  I believe genes do have a role because some people need to work harder to understand the same thing despite the education and all other influences being the same.



2. Education: the more you study math as an example, the easier it becomes to understand it!



3. Actually using your brain (i.e. constant training): in the end it's like any other part of the body, use it and it will become stronger, don't use it and it will rust, or even worse - totally die out.



4. Age: unfortunately it's true, younger people still have more brain cells alive, plus, they still have a lot of empty space on their memory chip in the brain (metaphorically of course) to save new stuff and hence understand easier.



5. Food: if you don't eat enough, your brain doesn't either so it's no longer healthy, if you eat too much your whole body will be affected including the brain. And if there is wrong food and right food for the body, then there is some for the brain.



6. Self confidence: if you believe down deep that you are stupid, you make yourself stupid. The thing is, the brain is the quickest part of your body to actually respond to self induced things like this; smart people KNOW they are smart, not only BELIEVE it.



7. Passion: if you want to learn, you become smarter – it’s never the other way round, it’s not “smart people want to learn”. If a high school dropout that worked as, say, a telephone operator suddenly got a passion about leukemia (for some reason, say her son got it), she would want to learn more about it, she would slowly become smarter until she reaches a stage where she can actually argue with doctors and scientists about the subject!



Maybe there are other factors, but this is what I noticed.

It's how a person processes and responds to things that he/she has experienced. There are plenty of book smart morons out there as well a absolute foolish and immature people on top of the business world and rich, even running the world.



It's a choice that each individual makes at their own personal age of understanding and comprehension.



Again there are those who have not been groomed by family or school but simply have learned as they have gone alone the things that are worth knowing. Good, evil, right, wrong, life, death what are these things really?



An intelligent person takes the time to ponder, not just correctly answer what is fed him.



And you won't know until the actions show.

It simply means accept the point of view of somebody who does not see things the way you do.



You may have an opinion about something, someone has a different opinion, you can still accept that person....even be that person's friend. You don't have to not like somebody because they think or feel differently to you. They have a RIGHT to think differently to you. And you should accept that right.

Hold my hands up. If someone thinks differently than me, and doesn't have a 'valuable' or 'sound' reason, I don't tolerate them. If others views have non sensical reasoning, I can't agree, or agree to disagree. But if they have a completely different view, but with an objective reasoning, I may not agree, but I respect it.

All to often for some of us, we get caught in being SO responsible that we can't even get things for ourselves simply because we want them. We feel we have to work hard and earn them for ourelves or that maybe we don't even deserve stuff. I can be as little as candy that you would never get for yourself or as grand as taking a trip to a place you want to go, not because it's good for business or to study, but just for the fun and adventure of it. Life is too short. experience it before your too old and tired to really enjoy it.

yes there's one person that i'm sure knows me more than i know me....we've talked for a lil over a week but i don't think i gave him like any personal info about myself rele but this is wut he IMed me:ok for starters, you are a caring person who likes to help if you can but doesnt want to get too involved because you're afraid you might somehow become wrapped up in the situation, second, you are a very loving person and you love me more than words can express, third you care about people's different opinions and views on things instead of trying to force your own off on them. I am not done.... fourth, you are a very kind person and will sacrifice alot to make other people happy, fifth, you have a great personality and anybody who actually decides to give you a chance ends up thinking you're an amazing person, sixth, you have a good sense of humor and you almost radiate with joy when you like someone, even though you don't always show it. i could go on for days but thats a shortened version of what i think you are.



he was absolutely correct on everthing and we haven't even talked in person or over the phone yet only IMs, he knows gurlz rele well and makes us all feel comfortable talking to him. he and i r actually sorta dating too i guess. all i cud do wen he said all that was cry and tell him how fuckin amzin he is!!!!!

I can't provide a in-depth analysis on this, since i'm not educated in that matter, but as long as you want to understand the basics, you should see the movie Shawshank Redemption - it deals with the problem of institutionalism - when long term prisoners adapt themself to the prison enviroment, they create new values, they climb up the hierarchy latter inside the prison and they learn to survive. They do the same everyone does in the normal world, only in their own given micro-universe. No one wants to lose his home or social status, and neither do they. After releasing they start from zero, often being +60 years old.

I can't explain to you why I know this but I'm compelled to answer you.



For one, you kind of have to view them as people who have been put one pause. They have been denied social development. For example. If a guy when to jail in the 80's he's gonna believe that we are still in the 80's. but view of us even remember the 80's and there are SO many things that have changed. Cell phones, Internet, dance clubs dateing, street fights, schooling, the police force, shoppping, fast food. I mean everything has changed in a really big way. Even Crime. This guy is so far out of the loop in every way, he's just not prepared for what's out here. Most of us can barley keep up let alone catch up on a life time absence. He wouldn't even be able to go back to his old ways. It's funny I kinda think the same way about people who get married and children. It's a strange way to think, I know but think about when you've been in a long term relationship and have left many things behind only to find yourself single again with no friends and personal social life. It's teriffying to feel that alone.

So, what are you asking?  If it is why you have no relationship, it is because too many lick their lips in your presence.  It's a choice you made - you have severely limited the possibilities simply because they licked their lips - it's your choice, now live with it and stop complaining.  Or get over it and see what a person can offer you in terms of a relationship...

I'll give you an example:



If I answer your question, you will take the answer and submit it to your teacher and get an A; but this is cheating, so if I answer this question I would be rewarding you for cheating, which is a wrong behavior.



Good luck in your assignment.

Maybe for children, which is where it all really begins, undesirable behaviours, such as tantrums, bad language, or general misbehaving, should be nipped in the bud. Set out a punishment, and STICK TO IT. By not sticking to it, it reinforces subconsciously that they can continue to do it, slightly be punished, momentarily, but will effectively get away with the behaviour. By stopping it initially, they will know they should not do it.
By not rewarding the wrong behaviour, you don't give in to the initial punishment, and let it slide. Stick to your guns.

Actually I feel like I am about to get tied up and beaten and lead to my death by a beautiful person. I never should have watched "Samson and Delilah" with Victor Mature. I also wonder about what happened to the prom queen the day after the big party at Jake's place in "Sixteen Candles". Do you think that made Farmer Ted more appealing or was she simply embarrassed that she had sex with a freshman, to embarrassed to say he wasn't any good?

We can necver tell.



i have gone thru some others' researches and reports, and mine own observations and musings in my own life. Out of my experiences. One can nevre decide whether we decide what we want and then get it or it is tht we just take the grind and then come up with something cuz no-one knows where we started from... pinpoint. So it is like the egg and hen issue. Whether it is the hen first or is it the egg? who was first?... one example of what i saw in an american library video... that we react as per the reward we get from something in the first trial... like dopamine or other chemical releases. this causes mind to ask for more of it. but what caused the first action? no-one can pinpoint. may be it is the theory of chaos. nothing is predetrmined, or planned in nature. It is sheer cahos. There is no telling anything of future or what follows what. evryone's got to have bread and butter... so there is this drama of being some thinker-researcher-and somegreat plan of nature. There is nothing. All have lobbies to make others pay for their facades to hide their weaknesses and stand agaiunst the powerfull... to survive. It is all games of survival. Nothing else. The powerful-musculars rule by muscles. The weak find such academical and psychological ways to hold off the bullies psychology--wizardry--marketing. It is all live game. There is no telling what is what first or second or last. It is a round world, dear. maybe we shall meet too, someday.

I didn't dream last night if I did I can't remember. But a lot of the time I have nightmares or bad dreams. Not necessary horrible ones, just about people forcing me to go places with them or getting lectured or losing my temper and yelling at the people who won't listen in my bad dream. Then there are those dreams that are less real with creepy spiders that come in bunches. Those ones are definitely nightmares, but far more fun than the reality dreams I get.

What are the principles of knowledge retention?



in terms of cognitive psychology



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



well there are three ways to test a persons retention, they are called measures of retention, and are split into three measures - recall, recognition and relearning



Recall is the reproducing of information with the fewest cues to aid retrieval. There are 3 types of recall: free recall (reproducing information in any order with no cues), serial recall (reproducing information in the same order as learned) and cued recall (reproducing information with cues such as photographs to aid retrieval)



Recognition is selecting the correct information from amongst alternatives. For example, the multiple choice section on an exam



Relearning is the relearning of information already stored in memory. When you relearn information, it is much quicker.



Relearning is proven to be the most sensitive, or most effective, measure of retention, followed by recognition, followed by recall.

Ah - I watched that so many times the other night. Fantastic movie. Anyway, I really do think tragedy movies make people a lot more emotional because if something like the Titanic did happen to end in a happy ending, not only would it be slightly unrealistic and like any other common disney movie, but that would be the end. We'd be happy that they lived and that's it. The fact that Jack devoted his life for Rose and she was the only one who lived formed a deeper astonishment and power than if they both survived.

I didn't dream last night if I did I can't remember. But a lot of the time I have nightmares or bad dreams. Not necessary horrible ones, just about people forcing me to go places with them or getting lectured or losing my temper and yelling at the people who won't listen in my bad dream. Then there are those dreams that are less real with creepy spiders that come in bunches. Those ones are definitely nightmares, but far more fun than the reality dreams I get.

How to stop myself from ?



i have a problem.im an introvert person,and i wud say that i already accepted with who i am.i am comfortable with myself.at leisure time,i always spend myself alone in my room doing my fave thing,which is listening to the music.it is like a must to me everyday. i have seven housemates who get together a lot,like they like to hang out in the living room watching tv together.joking,talking and others.so im kinda feel left out and i also dont want my housemates to think that im avoiding them.the problem is i enjoy what i always do at leisure time alone,at the same time i also enjoy and want to join my housemates,who i can get along with,cause i always have fun being with them.spending time alone is no fun but it is more a like a release to me,after all day long being around with classmates and people,talking,which for most introverts,is mentally exhausting.kind of sick of being in my own world at my free time.i want to get toghter more with people but it's just that i can't stop myself from too being in my own world.how to just talk to people without feeling mentally exhausted?

I know how you feel. I think the best thing to do is to plan. if you are into a habit of always going to your room, and the usual tensions exhaust you, try planning one new, small, activity into your week. Make it something that involves someone else, and make sure you have some time to yourself that day. If it is something where you do something together, as well as talk, that would be good. Something like physical activity, a movie, or something artistic would be good. then you will have the activity itself to focus on and enjoy, and the talking won't be so hard.
I think that you sound a bit shy, as some introverts are. But we can be valued friends, trust me. I was a lot like you when I was in school, and still feel that way from time to time, but I have made meaningful relationships in my life.

Do you think that a confidence based from POPULARITY is wrong? ?



Why??? I was popular back in hs and i really didn't care what other think of me. I did lots of bad things w/c i normally don't do. I criticize people even if its not me. But still i don't care. Coz you know i still have the brains. But even since then i started to have gap w/ some close ppl.. why do you think is that? I really need an answer!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I think popularity based confidence is perfectly fine if it is because you respect and love yourself, and you respect those around you. Someone who loves being in the skin they are in are infectious and people love to be around them. So that's good popularity.



But if you openly do bad things, and criticize people, well i don't agree with that. Those things don't make you popular. They make people fear you, so become friends or nice to you.



Remember, popularity isn't being the queen of the school. One of my best friends is quiet and hides behinds peoples shadows and lets them take the lime light, yet everyone knows and loves her because she respects each and every one of them and treats everyone equal.



I'd much rather have 3 or 4 really close friends who will stick by me no matter what, then a whole school who are only by me while im 'cool'

Psychology  is an academic and applied discipline involving the scientific study of mental processes and behavior. Psychologists study such phenomena as perception, cognition, emotion, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships. Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including issues related to everyday life (e.g. family, education, and employment) and the treatment of mental health problems. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of these functions in individual and social behavior, while also exploring the underlying physiological and neurological processes. Psychology includes many sub-fields of study and application concerned with such areas as human development, sports, health, industry, media, and law.

If there was only a pill we'd all make a fortune. Therapy has helped but I wish there was a cure as if it were a disease. Perhaps discovering what has brought you to this conclusion is something to consider. Have people in the past made you feel low, undesirable, stupid, unattractive,
unintelligent? have you been told that a sibling is more worthy than you?



Any of these things are contributors. Liking yourself when filled with doubts of self worth is difficult. I've certainly been there too. To quote my therapist, "maintain altitude." in other words hang in there. Good luck and wish I could give you a better answer.

Think of any ability or talent that you have, and then use it to achieve a small goal. Whether it is to learn something, to teach something, to earn something, to give something for yourself, for your family or for your community, it will make you feel better about yourself. We are designed to have active mind, body, and soul, and to be part of a culture or a society. if you are excited about an activity, or engaged in what you do, you will feel more similar to others. You will see that no one is perfect, and we are all in this together.

It's spelled liar.



Examine the reasons you lie. Are you lying so that people will like you more or find you more interesting? Are you doing something so wrong that you need to make excuses for your actions? To quote Judge Judy, it's easier to remember the truth than remember all the lies you've told.



I too told some wild lies when I was much younger and always seem to get caught. Can you imagine if your parents knew all the truths and things you've done. Yikes. I told my teacher I couldn't study because my mother had triplets. (I have one older sibling) i told a girlfriend that I was from California. All went well until she asked in front of everybody if I've ever been to Disneyland. When I said no, she said, you lived in California and you never went to Disneyland? At that time- I never left the east coast. My family's jaws dropped. So did mine.
These are not the same as saying I went to someone else's house instead of where i really was.  PS this all the truth!

Finding it very hard not to care about what others think of me.?



All my childhood i grew up in a knit tight group of friends who didnt fight very often and didnt judge others either. But that was then. Now im 16 and everything is so different. Theres always someone bitching about someone else and for some reason people dont seem to always like me even though i try to as friendly as i can. Some of my very good friends just tell me not to care about what others think and to stop being paranoid and stop worrying, but i cant. I actually do care what people think about me and i dont understand how others dont care either.

Unfortunately, I cannot offer you proof that this will ever change.  I too have a hard time dealing with this behavior in others.  I cannot stop myself from expecting others to be good.  I expect people to be the best person they can be and I usually find myself disappointed.  I also often find myself being the outcast and not being liked and still have trouble dealing with this from time to time.  I simply cannot understand why people choose to hurt others in their pursuit of personal gain.  It doesn't matter though, because I cannot stop it from occurring.  I can tell you though, that over the years it has become easier to deal with.  I no longer allow myself to believe that I am the one who should change to please them.  I am proud of the person I am and the way I conduct myself and lead my life.  I am very proud of the fact that I can truly say I like the person I see in the mirror because I have not compromised my beliefs or my integrity to satisfy any need or to move up any proverbial ladder.  I have often found myself hurt though by believing that I could change someone who would sacrifice anything or anyone in the process of attempting to achieve success.  You cannot change people.  You cannot make them want to do what is right and you cannot make them like you.  For the most part these people will dislike you intensely because you personify the morals and values that they chose to toss aside long ago.  You are real proof of what they can never be because they choose to step on people to better themselves as opposed to helping people and helping themselves as a result.  You cannot make these people go away no matter how hard you try and you cannot change yourself to suit them.  Just don't allow yourself to give up your ideals because you become convinced that joining them would be a much less difficult road to travel.  Once in a great while you will have the pleasure to meet or cross paths with someone who shares your beliefs and has lead a life that will inspire you and motivate you to remain true to who you are.  It is these people who make a real difference in this world.  Everyone else is a dime a dozen....It is we who are unique.  Hope this helps...good luck!

I'm in a similar position. You need to do it slowly. Decide that you will do it and just go out and become independant. Don't answer your phone every time she calls. Do what you have to do.

There is nothing wrong with the way you feel now.
If you want to stop though, you'll have to pace yourself in doing so.
Enjoy her company, but slowly stop doing any sort of activities with her, consider moving out,
then just settle for phone calls
try finding new things to do like a new hobby
maybe start or try dating
Hang around with friends. :)
hope this helps? :&gt;

No,if she is here now,(your mom) do not abandon her now.....sounds like you two have a good relationship built...but...you do need a change.Do things for yourself......do you live with her?If so,move out.Do your own cooking,do your own laundry. If you already live on your own,then just teach yourself NOT to depend on her for so many things.Learn to become more independent.You don't really say what makes you a mamas boy,so maybe before anyone else answers your question you could explain WHY you think you are a mama's boy.Limit calls to her once a day,if you do not live with her.Get some outside interests,to occupy your time.

the only problem with being refered to as a mamas boy is that people think it means you will put mum before anyone else.



your mother should be loved and respected at all times an only exempt if she is not worthy ie she has been a bad role model etc



the love you should have for a partner  should be different yet equal eventually.
some mums think only they can make their sons happy and know whats best for them.
however if your mum respects your need for freedom and growth then you should be proud to refer to yourself as a man who has no shame in  admitting he respects and loves  his family.

Their immune system. The more germs you are exposed to over a period of time, you get stronger and you are less likely to become sick. If people keep away from sick people all the time and have very clean houses, they are not exposed to a consistent amount of germs, so when they do come in contact with a sick person or bad water, their body is so fragile that they can't help but get sick.

Why do i feel disoriented and alienated?



sad, and lonely, disoriented, don't know how my future will be really?



i start the day with a plan that totally falls away by the end fo the day.



confuse about my life, want to find love and get married, but i lack social interaction to find it. and i m fed up with living room marriages embarrassing situations.
even when you start to know a girl, you hisitate by the faer of repeating the same mistakes confused by your hopes not to mis the chance of being happy.
career frustration, money stress. are additional issues
the future seems like today and yesterday.. seems like no change is coming the future.



feels lonely, even here in YA when some trying to make you feel bad when he present his own concept of happy life which is out of reach.

Yes. It is can be like you are in a room feel of people and feel like you have a bubble around you that keeps you from communicating what you really need to with everyone else. A lot of times it is because someone has hurt you and you are not sure how to deal with it and it can make experiences with that person (or those people) very uncomfortable. Worrying comes, but it is not the best solution. When you are worrying you have to think of something positive like Mathew 6. in the bible. That is what helped me. Also sometime going to an event like the party can help because it helps you face the feelings you are having. It may be uncomfortable at first but just ask yourself where these feelings may be coming and attempt to address the problem, even if it seems hard at first. If you continue to struggle try to find someone that you can confide in and talk the whole situation out.

One half of your brain just works a bit faster than the other. The slower half can sometimes think that it is remembering something, when in fact what it is "remembering" is the info' that the faster half has already processed.

If you do not think it is impossible, please assume that we are not going to evolve backward or destroy ourselves. I want to know if this is what some people mean when they say things we value will continue to improve non-stop or develop forever. I know evolutionary process is simply just the process by which we adapt to changing environment but I just wanted to know your opinion.

To organize your paper, consider using the approach of a well-known developmental theorists such as Erickson or Piaget. Go through your life stage by stage and describe important events.

Michelle's suggestion to use Erikson's stages of psychosocial development is a good idea - but you need to do lots of reading of Rogers so that you can link it to your own experiences. Counsellor training essays usually allow more subjectivity than other academic fields but you still need to show how you are applying the theory to personal experience. If you are doing your research on the internet you also need to be very careful about the academic credibility of your citations

<answer>



You can if you don't have muscle memory. If you have used the steps enough than it's already mapped out in your brain you just have to remember it. Adding a big enough box or a heavy enough box will mess with the recall so it's still dangerous.

Why is she being so mean?? Please Read! (I'll pick best answer!)?



So, I've been planning to hang out with girl for awhile now, but things end up coming up and I end up ignoring her. So we were planning on hanging out this weekend and I said this to her on myspace:



Me:im going to do everything i can to make this work. i need to



Her:Good. =)
thank you.



Me:dont thank me. not yet.



Her:...uh?



Me:thank me when you see me.



Her:Thank you for hanging out with me??



Me:no. for doing my best and makin it possible to do it. for trying to redeem myself.



Her:That's what I was thanking you for.



Me:i want you to do it.
once it happens. am i confusing you?



Her: Um, no--I'm not stupid, actually.
I'm just thanking you for making an effort now.
Why is this such a big deal?



Why is she being mean?

Seems like she's a little frustrated about the pointlessness of your respponses. You should have taken the thank yous and left it at that. She also seems to have taken the confusing comment as an insult. Your response should go as follows:



No big deal. I was just trying to be cute. I'm looking foward to spending some time with you this weekend.

You have some serious issues!  Wow, I mean you had a conversation with icons and everything.  I got swept up in the storyline and forgot for a moment that I have two jobs, 4 classes and a carnivorous toddler.  Okay, I sound like a mean-spirited beyotch but...really?  This is trauma?  (You promised me best answer and I know where you live.)  Shake things up if you want to keep this girl.  It sounds like she is reading a magazine while typing.  Take her somewhere new and in person.  Make her laugh out loud.  Hard.

Weird dreams happen, I think that most of us have bizarre and disturbing dreams. It's nothing to feel ashamed about, nor should you try to figure them out. Just drop it. Your not a freak. These things are just another part of life and no one can really be an expert on it.

It just means you're trying to aknowledge your own nurturing qualities. Probably need to let the billy badass routine go and try a more balanced approach.



Cry
To dream that you are crying, signifies a release of negative emotions that is more likely caused by some waking situation rather than the events of the dream itself. Your dream is a way to regain some emotional balance and a way to safely let out your fears and frustrations. In our daily lives, we tend to ignore, deny, or repress our feelings. But in our dream state, our defense mechanisms are no longer on guard and thus allow for the release of such emotions.

If you want to see him then you will. Don't be stubborn.



As far as you thinking that he favors your sisters and only called you names tells me that you are missing something.



He may perhaps get along with your sisters more (I SAID MAYBE) but you might want to ask yourself, if you might be harder to get close to.



Don't fight the one thing that you have, family. You have got to stop thinking that your alone. You are not. And now is the time for you to step up to the plate and show your daddy you love him and will be there when he needs you.



Think about it. He is sick and your thinking about how he should make you feel better. Stop it. losen up. Give in and show love for crying out loud. Love should not be hidden.
If you really want to show your true colors maybe you should also think about your mother, his mother and the others who might need your kind of courage. Take care of your family. I hope i wasn't too harsh and I really wish you the best. Do the right thing, I'll bet you'll feel much better.

She says she cant have my kids?best answer 10 points?



i love her so much as as her!



i am 19 shes 20..



we are in love more than a year..!



and a about 6-7 years down the rod,we have plans of getting married..



but recently she gave me shock she is not interested in having kids



reason:



having kids can be highly painful and her mom has said about it to her that its painful to death so she dont want to tolerate it..!



she feel after kids come in between us,the love between both of us would reduce as we have to concentrate on kids too and show love for them and so we would become routine parents after a certain age and no more unconditional love between us..so she wants both of ud to live for each other for ever and no one else :O



i was like WTF and whe had a big fight about this..



i said i love kids..i cant resist from caressing and kissing ANY kid that comes across me even in roads..she know that too..i have so much of love for children and want to make some for me and bring up them up too...its one of my dreams to be a great father because i didnt get that good a father.even after i dsicussed all these to her and explained that even fter having kids..i would be very lovely and affectionate to her as ever,she keeps in saying she cant and that i am not respecting her opinion..then what avout my opinion?



at last she disclosed this arguement saying we are hardly 20 we'll discuss about this during the marriage time..am damn sure am not have anyother girl in my life than her as i love her to death...but what if she comes at last and say i cant have kids?



what should i do?plzzzzzzzzzzzz...help

If I am not certain then I will say both and explain both. The one that sounds better to the questioner will help to influence his/her to make up his/her mind.



Better to seem indecisive that to give someone a bad answer and find out later he/she acted upon that advice and was hurt.

"It depends". For example, answer to your question depends on what are the implications of saying "yes" or "no". E.g. you can ask "Will you vote for McCain?" or "Will you vote for Obama?". "Yes" to one questions means "no" to another.

It sounds to me like you are questioning yourself. Well..... so.....



actually I have a bold thought I mentioned in a different Q: but seems to have more merit here. Forgive my bluntness.



The question was (sort of) "why does the grass always seem greener on the other side"?  And my reply was perhaps it IS greener on the other side because you are neglecting the grass on your side.



Bold, I know,  but perhaps your not getting what you want because your not giving what you can.



Just a thought.

Life got "Up and Down", "sweet and bitter", "enjoy and suffer", be with somebody or not, it is not important. We must live life to the simplest, then you can enjoy life.



To me, life is great and beautiful, because I handle my life, I own my life, all depend on me, I want to make my journey (life) smoothly, peacefully and safely. So I enjoy life. You are not me, or I am not you, we cannot experience each other life, we just share "what is life?", I enjoy life... it doesn't mean that you enjoy life, you see life in another angle that life is sophiscated, confused and ugly.



If you really want to enjoy life, treat life beautiful and happy.



A fulfiling life is not preoccupied with material with material object, prestige and power. A fulfiling life is filled with true love and friendship, sharing and caring for each other.

First let me tell you what would make me gain hope. It might sound weird and crazy, but the moment the American Economy will crash would be a moment for all those criminals to get the upper hand and begin looting and wars and such in America. This would be the only way America could be restructured from its current idiotic system.

Well you probably feel like he is hurting your ego by neglecting you and you're mad because he is supposed to be your bf the one you can always count on but instead he is acting like a total jerk.It is normal to miss him because he is your BF but at the same time you shouldn't give in and call him or anything...give him the space he needs and he will come around eventually......and if he doesn't well there are plenty of other guys who will.

I'm depressed right now too.  I pretty much go from trying new hobby to new hobby and don't stick around long.  I feel very different from other people and feel like there's something wrong with me, which cripples my self esteem.  The good thing is that I can take the energy I have and use it to learn anything I want to fast and efficiently.  The bad is that I get bored easily after I get to a certain level.  Plus, I always feel different than other people.



You have a lot you can do in the world and find out what you want to do.  FIND YOUR IDENTITY and what career you'd fit into.  Take the Strong test.  It's great for that.  So develop your beliefs and values.  Get books on psychology, philosophy, and religion and start incorporating beliefs into your own.



EXPERIENCE LIFE and get over your fear of living.  I swear, everytime I do something I wouldn't normally do I feel better.  It's a laugh and fun!  The other day was the 1st time I wrote in drying cement.  It was right in front of a store so people could see me! lol.  Today in class I held the door shut so some classmate couldn't get in.  It was all in fun!  Being hyper I'm sure there are random things you feel like doing.  As long as they don't hurt anybody do it!  Of course going on vacation to places you want to go and see would be great, even just places close by.



Take lessons in things you're interested in.  This is YOUR life so live it.  Rent documentaries and instructional dvds from any subjects that might interest you.



Lastly, KEEP DEVELOPING YOURSELF.  Learn more about confidence, motivation, and relationships through psychology.  You'll get books on ADHD to understand yourself more.  There's one called "The Fire Within."  Basically most the great artists and people of human history had personality disorders, ones like ADHD.  Of course it's speculation because they were not diagnosed, but where else would they get the energy unless they felt all that pain of life more than regualar people did?  So you have way more energy than most people.  You just have to choose what you want to do.  And CHOICE is the greatest thing we have in our lives.

Don't be depressed! I used to feel like I didn't belong so I did whatever I could to be liked and accepted. I turned into the ultimate people-pleaser. I did whatever was necessary to be approved no matter what the costs.......But I am being cured of my condition! Now I LOVE being different. I have generalized anxiety disorder. You are truly special and unique! Why don't you go to amazon.com and buy a book on ADHD? Best of luck!!

<question>



What do I do, I know I have asked similar questions but I need some guidance on the issue? ?



Last time I asked this question, someone asked me if there was anything sexually arousing relating to this. What should one do if there is? In seventh grade, and I know this is kind of weird, but there was something sexual relating to the costume that I just liked about the costume.



BTW: I am a boy and have just graduated high school. This has “plagued” me throughout my life and I feel like it has been a burden on me unfortunately. I don’t want to talk to anyone face to face because I feel so deeply embarrassed about it. Please give me some REAL advice, criticism and making fun of me for this will not be tolerated.



Keep these questions in mind when you read through the details:
1. Do I just watch the episode because I miss my mother, or is it like a “baby blanket” or is it just for comfort?
2. Do I try to suppress the episode from my mind (even though I think that has failed)?
3. Should I make/get a bee costume, why am I so obsessed with the costume to begin with?
4. How do I just let this go, is there a way to just accept this without being so uptight and super embarrassed about thinking about this?
5. Should I keep watching the episode, how do I get myself to stop watching it?



Anyways, let me begin:
When I was really little I loved watching kid television shows with my mom. One of the television shows I watched was called Barney and my mom used to tape the first season episodes for me. One of the episodes in particular, that I loved watching was titled, "I Just Love Bugs." The part I liked the most was at the beginning when the "I'm Bringing Home A Baby Bumblebee" song was performed. During the scene, a girl in a bumblebee costume pretended to sting the 3 other kids in these 3 verses to the song, “I’m Bringing Home A Baby Bumblebee, I’m Going To Swat the Baby Bumblebee, and I’m Running from the Baby Bumblebee.” I used to watch this scene whenever I could when I was little and probably like tens of times per day on some days since the scene was only a couple of minutes long. I used to LOVE the look of the costume and the way it just stood out. I also used to really like the way the scene played out where the girl in the costume stung the other kids even though she was outnumbered and I used to love the little hand motions of victory as well after she pretended to sting them. Anyways, I watched this episode until I was like 7 years old for an ENORMOUS amount of time and when I got to that age I had wanted to put that bee costume on (replica since I loved the costume so much) and perform the song with myself as the bee. I wanted to sting the other kids and be like the bee pretty badly because it looked so fun to do as shown in the episode. I didn’t tell my parents I wanted that type of costume though ever.



I eventually started to forget about this episode after making many new friends at school and experiencing some homework in grade school. Also, a new thing came around called Pokemon and I got into that and played all the original games. I used to collect all the cards as well. Anyways, in like fifth grade or so, my family was going to move to a new house and I for some reason wanted to watch the Barney episode again. I ended up finding it and watching it again. I loved seeing it again and it comforted me as we moved to our new house.



Again, though, I gradually forgot about the episode, I continued on with school, made new friends, and just continued to do well and have fun. In seventh grade though, my life began to become amazingly stressful again when my mother fell ill with cancer. She ended up dying from it and I became very sad. I ended up pulling out the old episode of Barney and watching the bumblebee scene over and over again after school when I could. I must have watched it for at least thirty minutes straight, over and over again. Also, I used to, for the first time, actually imitate the scenes sometimes just by myself, when I was alone. I watched this episode randomly through eighth grade. I never talked to my father about it and just didn’t know how to talk to him about it.



</question>



<additional details>



We moved again when I started high school and, unbeknownst to me, tons of stuff was given away including the Barney tape. Since I didn’t mention anything about it being important it was just given away. Anyways, I eventually found out after searching for it. I thought that my life will be better now that I am not addicted to that Barney episode. In high school, I gradually forgot about the episode and focused again on school work and hanging out with my friends. In Junior year, I somehow remembered it again while thinking about college and stressing about it. It wasn’t at home but, since I couldn’t get it off out of my mind, I decided to check online for it hoping that by watching it once I could appease my mind into not watching it after that. Surely enough, the episode was there and I became almost addicted to watching the opening bumblebee scene.



Anyways, it hasn’t really gone away, and I for some reason like the bumblebee costume more and more and want to wear something like it.



So what do I do now, how can I just phase this episode and the costume out of my mind?



I hope I don't come off as seeming weird to you, I know I might.



Anyways, please give me some suggestions.



This is so embarrassing

If you truly want to eliminate your fascination for bees then you should watch some programming which is contra to the association made by the episode you watched. Watch some bee-farming documentaries to learn about how bees really behave. Bees are well-controlled insects that are kept in check by the bee-farmers trapping the bees in containment areas where they won't be able to sting anyone.

Okay so it sounds like you use the barney video as a comfort, for something stressful happens. Because the seems like that is when the wanting to watch the video comes up. I dont know if you feel anything else while watching it. But it sounds like it is just like when kids have a favorite stuffed animal they cuddle up to and stuff like that. I dont know about the wanting to wear the costume maybe it is because you want to be like the bee, you know be able to stand up to your stressful situations when you seemed to be getting out numbered by them. My advice is to try to find something else that is safe (no drugs or anything like that) to do when you are feeling stressed. Like instead of watching the video talk to a friend about how stressed you are to get comfort.

I don't understand what is wrong with your watching the episode as much as you want, it seems innocent to me and if you want to wear a bee outfit, that is fine, too, maybe for halloween,  and if you want to play the bee scene out, that also is fine, I think you would have gottened away from the episode if it weren't for the computer, the computer makes it so easy to have the episode available all the time,  I mean you are not doing anything wrong like a lot of other things, so I say enjoy the bee episode to the max

Ok - i am so glad you asked this question here and I happened to read it. I know that sounds really weird but I am studying to be a therapist and am going to start applying to become a Sex Therapist and this is really a topic that interests me and I would love to work with people like you.



We studied situations just like this in my Sex Therapy class already. Basically, if you'd like the long story short ... it sounds like you have a fetish. Fetishes can happen with any thing / any object at all. Some people like feet, some people like hair, and oddly enough some may like Barney and bumblebees. It doesn't sound crazy at all to me.



Now about your connections with it - your mom and/or sexually. Two things may have happened. While you were younger and growing older, you may have some how sexually connected yourself to the bumble bee. There is a book I read in high school that reminds me of this, even though that story goes off weirdly at the end, called Equuis  (not sure how that is really spelled but it is the play that Harry Potter was playing nude). What happens is that growing up the boy becomes fascinated with horses. He obsesses over them and starts working at a stall even. He LOVES horses. And eventually, his mind somehow sexually connects the two. The end is not important in your case, but it is really an interesting book/play to read.



So that is what you may have done. And it is completely normal to have fetishes. The only time it becomes abnormal is when you can ONLY get aroused with that object/thing and if it is harmful to anyone involved. So... being intimate with someone and role playing (with costumes) may be fun every so often in your case.



Now why did you watch the video when you got older again and again? I think its important that you have forgotten about it every so often since that shows you havent become too obsessed with it in your lifetime to the point you can't function anymore... but it does show a significance. So in your case, it's a method of coping and dealing and comfort. You did this as a child with your mom who you no longer have and it is your way of bringing you back to those happy times and happy memories. That is completely fine too.



Don't worry so much and don't beat yourself up over it. I know that this could be easily a target for many bad jokes from many Yahoo users and may be... but everyone is unique and likes different things. As a kid its ok to fantasize about playing with friends dressed like the bee that had fun on TV but as you got older, you realized that would not be fun at all (instead you'd be made fun of). And now you are still connected to it in two different ways, it brings you back to old happy times and is comforting, and you may also have a sexual connection to bumblebees because of it.



It sounds like you want to desperately get rid of all this though- so I would advise maybe seeing a sex therapist to talk about how to decrease your fetish (it's like a spectrum and can be from mild to very bad)... or you could just accept it as it is like I have said - because it really isn't anything horrible, in my opinion. Unless it gets to be consuming of your life and mind, then that would be a problem.



My mom died of cancer too when I was in middle school and some of the weirdest things can bring you back to memories of our loved ones. My mom died on Halloween so I obviously am not too fond of the holiday at all - and I have the ritual of always making sure to wear something she gave me as a child (usually a charm necklace). So it is ok to remember the times you spent with her, and to you, the thing that helps the most is a video from you childhood that you loved. And it's ok. :)

People who are seeking counseling often can't solve their problems on their own. Why is it so? Because something about their recollection is contradictory. Therefore, a counselor can facilitate solution of a problem by pointing out any inconsistencies in the recounting of the events in question. Second, the counselor can learn about how the client wants to be "cured". People often don't want to change their lifestyles, so it is the counselors job to think of ways to help the client continue their livelihood in their current state of mind.

why do you want to fear, u are a very balanced individual! :)
substitute the adrenaline of fear for the adrenaline of getting what you want. Since you are a master of time and space dream of an elaborate event and see if it will happen via law of attraction.



Lack of fear usually means you are in full grasp of love, love is a creating force, create your future and present moment.

How can I find a job that would no drive me mad?



I am intelligent, hardworking and know two other languages apart from English, but I think I have ADD. Ideally I would be doing a creative job, but at the moment I still need to earn money so I can return to university.
So I need a job that would see me through that period.
I worked in retail (I left after a while because I could not stand the fake atmosphere and the repetitiveness/ lack of thinking involved, I kind of like to make coffee though) Currently I work in an office and the space combined with the fact that I have to sit on my bum like prisoner is positively driving me mad. The job is data entry and basically I am driven crazy, because I have to stop thinking for 7.5 hour solid a day.
The work has no meaning whats however.
So I cannot stand office spaces, I hate the retail environment.. and those feelings would not matter if I could  focus but I can't and  have difficulties getting the work done. When I was in retail I had drive and speed now I am very sluggish...Ideally my job would take place outdoors, don't involve sales...I am totally lost. I tried working in a pub but was lousy at making conversations with drunks. If I was not afraid to cycle in London I would probably become a cycle courier...any ideas...help!
This is a serious question. I am giving my notice soon, because at the moment my coping mechanisms have deteriorated...

It can be difficult finding the right job. It seems like you are saying that your current job is too easy, but often that is a good thing. Really, it is up to you. If you want to find a new job for the reason of 7.5 hours a day of work then maybe you should investigate part time work and smaller living accommodations.

i think it really depends on the person who uses them...



in my opinion, irritated is less severe than annoyed or angry. its like when you go to the store looking for a specific brand of candy but they don't have it. you are a little upset but you get over it quickly.



annoyance is more like when you are starting to get bothered by something that is continuously getting on your nerves. its a stronger feeling and doesn't go away as quickly.



Anger is when you are upset with something having not gone how you wanted it, or something getting in the way of something you wanted or what have you, and you are consumed by the feeling of being upset over it. you don't get over being angry overnight, it takes a while.



this is how i see the three emotions, but like i said, its really up to the person using them. some people see irritation as a stronger feeling than annoyance.

Annoyance is an unpleasant mental state that is characterized by such effects as irritation and distraction from one's conscious thinking. It can lead to emotions such as frustration and anger.



Irritation or exacerbation, in biology and physiology, is a state of inflammation or painful reaction to allergy or cell-lining damage. A stimulus or agent which induces the state of irritation is an irritant.



Anger is an emotion, "subjectively experienced as an aroused state of toward someone or something perceived to be the source of an aversive event

Annoyed is when something ticks you off, right there, right away.
Irritated is when something keeps scratching at your nerves.



Angry is when you're full-blown mad, when all the worst feelings come bubbling to the surface.



At least, that's how I've always thought of these three terms. Was that any help?

The degree of intensity. They are all forms of being mad, Annoyed being the lesser and easier to get over, Irritated comes next and last longer, and then Angry, which typically lasts many hours (if not all day) and can result in headaches.

Im so scared. I love my boyfriend more than my life, but Im afraid one major difference we have will be a great obstacle. Im very intellectual, and need to talk about my ideas and feelings a lot or i will feel unhappy. Hes totally rational and calculated, and only talks about facts, and has no real emotions, or philosophical/intellectual thoughts. Im afraid that I will be unhappy for that. On the other hand im too intellectual, that Im becoming a daydreamer, and being like I am will not get me anywhere in my life. I hate that attribute of mine, and WANT to change it, and Im really uncomfortable with it. I need to start doing more instead of just talking. Now Im having serious anxiety attacks because im really confused. Were both 21. Together for over 2.5 yrs..

Paranoia - the noun from the adjective paranoid. It is a feature of many mental illnesses including bi-polar disorder, certain types of schizophrenia, and personality disorder. Some types of obsessive compulsive disorder and autistic spectrum disorder include feelings of paranoia. Thinking about it, nearly all types of mental illness can include feelings of being persecuted, even "simple" depression.  So it's a very broad syndrome.  Sometimes whole countries are afflicted with it. But it is always worth remembering that quite a lot of people really are being persecuted and they are not mentally ill to believe so - the authorities love to dismiss people as paranoid because they think someone is out to get them.  Plenty of examples of people who have said the secret police are out to get them, and then the secret police have done just that, got them.

Why won't my head stop hurting?



I know this might be long, but I'm trying to give the full details.



It has been going on for over 10 years now (i'm 19). I know that it is psychologically related because I saw a medical doctor for my headaches 2 years ago and had many tests done (nothing medically wrong with me). Even going on a very dangerous drug that my doctor gave me because it just would not stop (I threw it out, I was beginning to have heart problems). And now it is just getting worse because it has brought some new wonderful problems with it. I daydream, think, have "inner conversations", get extremely lost in my thoughts even worse now, to the point I find myself just sitting on my bed for maybe 30min -1 hour at a time. And everything in my head feels so real I actually have to shake it off. I can't pay attention to anything or anyone for that matter long enough to comprehend what they are saying. I just drift in and out of everything. I will be talking to someone for example and all of a sudden I will hear a word or think of of something and I am gone. My head also feels dizzy and fuzzy all the time. I can't even read anymore. I can't stay focused long enough. The only thing that I can pay full attention to are the clouds and sky. When I look at them, I just feel peaceful. It is affecting me in all areas of my life. In gr. 9, I used to be able to write, read and think at a 3-4th year university level (confirmed by school). But everything is just getting worse. I have so many thoughts and it is preventing me from having a "normal" life. My short-term memory is practically gone. ALL because I can't pay attention. I sleep all day.



Please Help me, I am so very desperate and I am completely lost. I cry all the time.



</question>



<additional details>



p.s. I cannot talk to my family or friends, it's complicated, nor do I have any money or intention to see a psychiatrist. or taking drugs-pharmaceutical, recreational. (i'm very anti-drugs)

You should go to an emergency room if your pain never subsides. If going to the emergency room isn't an option then try starting an exercise program. Exercise is a great natural remedy. It might be difficult to begin due to your exhaustion during day time, but you can do it. Once you get into that rhythm your sleep schedule will likely improve as a result within a couple weeks(or less, just keep at it).

Where are your headaches located?  Sometimes the brain can swell due to too many Yin foods - sugar, chemicals in foods, drugs and the pressure against your skull from the expanding brain tissue can be painful..



Do you eat regularly? What kind of diet do you have?  These factors are important.



First look at the physical and see what you're doing.



If you're really into physical health, which I doubt because of when the headaches started, unless your parents or parental figures taught you, then the headaches may be due to psychological reasons.  I would also look at what's going on in your life and what you may not want to look at.
We can use all sorts of distractions to avoid looking at our present emotional realities, illnesses, headaches...who wants to look at the emotional pain when we're all tied up looking at the physical pain? We can change our personal realities by recognizing down, self-defeating "self-talk" and consciously replacing our "bad feeling" inner dialog with better feeling, uplifting inner dialog.
Are you getting enough oxygen in your blood?  It's amazing how shallow we all can breathe.  Be very conscious of your breathing!!  Stop right now and see if you're deeply breathing.  I'll bet you that you're holding your breath.  Lack of oxygen in our blood is responsible for so many physical pains.



This just came to mind:
You mentioned being on a dangerous drug prescribed to you by your doctor.  You said that it had affected your heart.  We all know that the heart circulates the blood which carries the oxygen.  You said that you've had many repercussions related to taking that drug too.  I don't know what the limitations are for law-suits, but it sounds to me that you might have a case.  If I were you, I would get the prescription records from the pharmacy that you had the drug filled at, and also the records from your doctor.  I would not tell the pharmacy or your doctor the reasons that you wanted the information for.  A good lawyer will get payment after the settlement.
I'm so sorry that you're having such problems!!  Usually these problems are reserved for older people : (
Bless you and follow through with this.  Time is wasting.
Hope this helps : )

There are three possible explanations for this..



1-You hang out with some really dumb people..

Everyday. The stupid people (my friends, even though I think they are smart) admire me. I'm actually really smart yet dumb at the same time, or maybe I'm just a little slow. But I know exactly what you mean, so try convincing yourself that your smarter than most but you gotta prove to yourself that you are.I think dumb people never ask this question. When I was in 5th grade they said I should be in 8th.

You might think differently from other people.  I did as a kid back in school (was very "gifted"), and recognized I did think very differently compared to other people.  Isolating in a way.  I needed to speak to my peers in a much different way than I could with adults, and it took some time to find intellectual peers.  In time you will meet or at least be exposed to the ideas of others who think more like you.



My advice is to not focus on perhaps being smarter than other people/thinking different from them.  Develop whatever gifts you've been given, be true to yourself, and try to connect with the people around you in as many ways as possible.  Be open to friendships with all types of people. Always be open to learning (not just in school, in all areas of life).  Don't pretend to be someone you are not (but don't rudely alienate people just because they might not seem to think the way you do).



More important than how smart you are is how much good you do in this world, and the relationships that you form.

Sure I'm with you 100%.
I don't feel like I'm better than everyone, but I sure feel like I know a lot more than they everyone thinks. People think I'm intelligent too. But a lot of the time I keep quiet because I don't want them to think I'm weird. Because I believe I am truly gifted with something no other person has. Well, besides you my friend,lol.
I do feel different. Like I'm different from everyone else and see things differently. Sometimes I've thought I'm an alien. Maybe a special being. One of my ex-boyfriends said he thought I was what NASA was looking for. Don't know how serious he was about that. But I am a pretty complex person. Very wise for my age and I know a lot. Sometimes it just comes to me and I didn't even know I knew it.
High IQ perhaps?
Those are our Superhuman feelings. Do you spend a lot of time alone?
Sometimes when you're alone a lot and think too much you start feeling different about yourself.
It is always good to interact with others, keep your social life alive. Even if it's just chatting to friends or family now and then.
When you isolate yourself, you begin to feel like you're not "normal".
Being around other people you care about or people that share the same interests as you will give you a sense of normalcy.
You begin to realise we are all the same. We're all human. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. A strength of yours is intelligence.
We are all different and unique. With our own thoughts, feelings and outlooks on life. Every individual is special and was put on this earth for a reason. With a purpose. I feel maybe mine is to help people.
Reaching out to and helping people is something that fulfills me as an individual, among many other things.
I'm sure there are many people who think they have super genius traits, not just me and you.
It is very possible that we enjoy learning and therefore constantly stimulate our minds and consequently are always open to absorbing new information which adds to our intelligence. Nothing magical. Just Great minds. Is that what you meant, or am I way off?
Anyway special one, don't ever dumb yourself down. Be who you are all the time, proudly. Stay true to yourself. You are not insane.
Change the world with your mega thinking. Don't keep it to yourself.



We can start a revolution!
I wish you the best of luck in all your adventures!!

I think i tend to attract freaky people. ?



I always have these weird phsyco stalker dudes intrested in me. I don't like it, I'm naturally really nice. Agh. I don't know if i can word this correctly. But, for example if some strange dude liked me, and i had no feelings for him, i try to hurt him as less as possible. I'm nice about it....if that makes sense. And lately, these creepy dudes started bugging me, like stalking, and this isn't the first time, and i just wanna know if its some vibe i am giving off ? Am i being to nice to them or what ? Because they have said some creepy, uncomfortable stuff. Does anyone have the same problem ? Help please.

Some guys are just creepy like that.  You pay the slightest bit of attention to them, or maybe you just say something because you want to be polite, and they just won't leave you alone! Yeah, I've had that happen a couple times. Just be assertive and tell them NO when another guy like that approaches you, and you won't have that problem.

They've said some weird stuff, but more like sexual harrassment or trying to impress me & stuff and some guys are like that.  they do it for a while (cause they like you) but if you don't wanna be mean and just ignore them, they back off sooner or later-they'll get the point, however, one time, I was very uncomfortable with this one guy and I had to be kind of harsh to him, and so he stopped.

I had a silent stalker once. I call them that because whenever they called they never said anything, or if they did it was something really weird that you couldn't even really understand. They only called when I was home alone. Really creeped me out. To this day I still don't know who it was.
Point is, some people are just weird like that. Some people think that if someone is even a little bit nice to them, it means they like them. A lot of them probably need counselling. I would say be less nice. You shouldn't have to put up with that.

think about everything you do and why you do it.  when you pick up the phone, what do you say?  When you look thru a  magazine, what does your eye go to?  liking love songs is a general universal trait, but you can build off of that.  Why do you like love songs?  are you longing for love mentioned in the songs?  it all depends on you.  You need to act on knowing yourself.  You already know this:  You need to get to know yourself.  That is half the journey!!  no body knows themselves completely, but every step you take could help.



Well begun is half done!!

what do you mean you don't know yourself? you mean you don't know where you fit? like if you are an athlete or a punk or emo, or whatever? Don't worry about that, you don't need to be any one thing, that's what makes you you. being different than other people is what makes you unique, hold onto that. as far as not knowing what you like, I guess there are so many influences on our generation today that sometimes its a strange FEELING to wonder what you like and what you don't, what you are supposed to like and what you shouldn't. If I were you I would just try new things, take a big look around and give some new things a chance, you will know pretty quickly if something doesn't feel right and you will move on to the next thing, you're only 18 man that's what everyone 18 is going through, you didn't come out of the womb with a plan, you gotta make yours now. just try to have fun doing it and trust me when you find something that is "you" you will know right off, it will make you feel good and you will love it, just keep looking you will find yourself!

One rarely forgets things that are stored in "mechanical" memory. These are the things that you learn mechanically, riding a bike, skating, using tools, that sort of thing. This is because you are actually using your brain to teach your body and then your body reminds your brain. This is different from cognitive memory because with cognitive memory you only use your brain and these memories if not used will fade and be replaced by newer ones.

Just to add to the others - the later/earlier you learn, the sooner/later you lose it. EG immigrants who learn a language later in life lose that before their native language.  I have a Czech friend whose father is now in an old people's home where they speak Czech, because he lost his English first.  My mother in law, who is now quite elderly, is beginning to lose her ability to drive a car because she didn't learn until she was in her 40s/  But she is still brilliant on a sewing machine, because she started work as a seamstress at the age of 14. And I am always amazed when i go to France, even though I haven't used the language for ages, it all soon comes back.

I'm trying to remember what I learned in 'The Physiology of Behaviour' back in the day...



Now, I am not sure if this is entirely accurate, but this is how I understand it.  Information travels to and from and within your brain on a system of neurons.  Neurons are nerves that are set up like pieces of a kid's train track.  Everytime you nervous system sends a signal down a certain path of the track, the space between the "pieces of track" gets a little smaller.  The pieces of track are the neurons, and the spaces are called synapses.



When the spaces get smaller, it makes it easier for you brain to use that particular "track" next time.  This is why when you practice something, it gets easier to do.  This occurs in the spaces between the neurons in your brain, and in the spaces in the pathways of your body, too.  Over time, if those pathways are not used, the spaces get wider again.  Then it is harder for your brain to follow that path the next time you try to access it.



Okay, now getting to so-called 'muscle memory'.  If memory serves, the neurons in your body are longer, so there aren't as many spaces to depend on as in your brain.  Also, the spaces are more resilient, and need less stimulation to stay close together.  So, if a large part of your learning occurred in the synapes and neurons in your arms, a physical skill, like typing, would be less easily forgotten, then a mental skill, like long division.



I hope that helps.  Maybe someone else will be able to confirm or deny what I have already said.  It has been a while since I learned this information.

Okay, I recently started dating this guy that I work with (we are co-workers and it’s recommended that co-workers don’t date) anyway, we kissed and I asked him if he wanted to start dating and he got really nervous and couldn’t decide.
I then asked him if he liked me and to forget about everything else, because taking a risk is better then doing nothing he said he did, and we decided to start dating.
But the problem is he just got out of a two year relationship and I was talking to his girlfriend (when I told him about this he got really mad) anyway she said that he can not make decisions and that is why they split, she said he even has trouble choosing a movie and relies on others.



I think are relationship may be a bad idea, but even if it is I want to help him become more independent, his ex also said this was his fathers fault for criticizing every decision he made as a child.



How can I help him to become more independent?
everyone has feelings, so lately I have been trying to get him to talk about feelings then making a decision based on that rather then facts.

Why are you feeling like it's your job to fix him?? It's up to him to take the matter into his own hands and figure out what to do. And I wouldn't have liked it either if my DATE talked to my ex about me. Theres always 2 sides to a story. You haven't heard the other side.

The last person I would trust is a person's ex. Does it appear to you that he is capable of making decisions? It sounds to me like he might soon make a decision to end your relationship. I don't know anything about the dynamics of your relationship, so you need to decide what you want.

I am eccentric, and I'm wondering if my brain is just wired differently apposed to the average normal individual ( I know everyone is their own person and different) But I'm different in a whole different level; not of the average individual.



I hope I did not come off as vain, but I guess it depends on the audience. to those of you who think I am vain, I understand your point of view, because you do not know me personally so it is only logical that you would think that, I wish I could have been clearer but that's the best I could put it.

Sometimes people hurt others because they are hurt themselves. Sometimes it makes people feel better to take it out on someone else or to make someone else suffer like they did. Some just do it because they have a mental illness (that either tells them to or makes them not see how it is wrong to do that).



Either way, you should not be someone's punching bag or be the victim of someone elses pain. You need to go tell someone as soon as you can so that it doesn't happen again. Someone you trust like a teacher or a school counselor. You could also tell a friend's parent that you trust too. You don't deserve to be hurt and no one does. And the only way to prevent it from happening again is to let someone know.

The best advice I can give is to evaluate whether it is worthwhile to maintain your relationship with the person. Often even our closest friends do hurt us from time-to-time, so keep that in mind when making your decision. Of course, if you have been harmed physically or threatened of harm then you should report it to the police.

You dont need to know that.....maybe you are still in your hurting stage and need to know that to understand---closure???  If you are a good person and that has happened to you, know that you dont deserve that and whether or not you understand their reasons for hurting you, you will have no part in that dysfunction.  If it is a mental thing that the person maybe cannot help and they are serious about change, build yourself mentally to be there for them.  At one time I did not believe certain things, but experience has educated and matured me to be strong in differenet areas.  Being in a dysfunctional situation that has no intention of moving forward is not healthy nor can it help you in a positive way.

Perhaps you could try getting him into a routine. For example, when he gets up in the morning, make sure he has a list of all the things he needs to do and by what time he needs to have them done. Having a routine is a good way for him to know what is expected of him.

That sounds like a good tactic but if it is a stalker-type, get support and help sooner. Don't encourage even a moderate relationship with someone who is trying to impose influence over your life. Get a big strong friend or a law enforcement person to put that person out of your life. Even if you are concerned about that person....

That is one option but it seems to me that it would depend on the situation and degree of violence which you mean, for example is this individual a partner or a relative or a workmate or what? Is it so severe that you are in real fear and if so you should consider getting the police involved because running away might resolve it temporarily but there is always the chance that it might not end there, but whatever you choose to do, I wish you luck

Sometimes people just fall in love with the outside appearance.
Once they find someone they like and are liked back, they go out with each other.
And then there are other good looking people they see and then they suddenly want them too.
It's like girls in a store with cute jewelery.
You just can't decide which one is the most beautiful.
If you think you found one, you look at the others and say "But that one is nice too."



Anyway, this is just one case that I've been looking at. :P

Usually baby dreams mean that something new and exciting is going to happen or is happening in your life, and for some reason you are either consciously or unconsciously trying to keep that aspect out of your life. Do you know what I mean? Like for example, maybe there is a guy who would be a good match for you but you stay away from starting a relationship or admitting you like him because of other reasons.

well i'm not sure how to answer you 'cept to tell you of dreams i use to have for years.
my parents and i would be on a battle field, they would gorily be killed off and i would escape unharmed.
FOR years i worried and fretted over those dreams that would reoccur nightly all for nothing cause eventually with time those dreams no longer haunted me and my parents are just fine today and life does go on.
Change the things you can and move away from the things your not able cause then it's easier to sleep and awake refreshed.

imagination is the beginning of the path towards creative ideas,towards the reality that we try to reach ,we sit and our mind drifts away taking us to places with different colors,the harsh reality makes the mind escape to a place where he can fill all his desires ,away from the closed doors and the cruel rules ,the unfair society ,we need an arsenal of weapons to overcome the reality that seems sometimes too big to live in ,and we are too weak to defeat ,how many of us have sit in moments of solitude..i would say John Lennon said 'IMAGINE" with a view for a fair world ,beautiful song many should listen to .

Imagination is a powerful tool, for that is how we create our realities, our worlds. We have to learn though to use it as such, creating what we want and enjoy. Everything existing has been imagined into reality, and can be imagined out of reality, at any given time. It is our choice.

Imagination is a part of reality....if you can imagine it, you can figure out how to do it. I like Alice's analogy of imagination being like a tender to the larger reality -but I wonder what she's thinking when she says "smoother (or hardest...)".

Why should one fight reality?  Reality can be fought with illusions too....
Imagination on the other hand, helps reality to become better, problems to be smoother (or hardest..) . I believe imagination is tender to reality.

Who says that "reality" is truth. Humans create their own truth, it is a state of mind to believe the world as seen. Reality can be totally composed of imagination.

Could You Please Help Me Focus!!?



Ok I am Jimmy and I am 23 years old. I am 6’0 tall, brown hair and blue eyes. And I have Addison’s disease but as long as I take the hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone I live a normal life. I as well have ADHD.I myself would think of myself as a highly intelligent person. The thing is my brain goes faster than me all the time. This is very frustrating for me. I am trying to focus and retain information but I forget lots of it. It really depends on my mood I guess. Well I need your help I’m trying to read A+ CompTIA so I can finally take the exam. I am merrily hitched to this breathtaking woman who has changed my life around to the better me. We have been together now for 1yr and 3months and still day by day we learn something or educate each other on something new. My question to all of you is what can I do to be able to retain what I am reading and as well what people say. Instead of always getting distracted? Yes I know that I could take the pill. Trust me I have in the past and nothing ever worked. Now it’s like I really want to comprehend this book as well as get a career going. After all this I want to get married. Our wedding date is Aug 21. 2010. The year 2010 was chosen because that’s when my fiancée is done with college. She Is In business management and I took Computer Administration at school and finished. Currently I am in the process of thinking on going for the externship which my school provides me. I want to do all that I can do for myself very badly. I need to really read this 1200 page book lol please please assist me!! I have found many sites that you can remain relaxed all just as easy as to listening to pleasant music which creates a feeling of being somewhere tranquil.
ILL TAKE WHATEVER YOU CAN DISH OUT AT ME PLEASE HELP ME!!
Thanks!!

Hi Jimmy......While i understand how frustrating things can be i have learned from personal experience the writing detailed notes on the subject and making flash cards for my self and frequent self testing i was able to retain roughly 90% of what i was studying. With persistence it all paid off and i graduated top of my class in my CNA course passed my state exams and did this while being a single mother of an Autistic child with learning problems as well. To help yourself  do better i suggest making notes notes notes. It helped me alot and being OCD and having learning disabilities my self i can assure you it helps alot. Since you have a g/f that is supportive she can quiz you with the flash cards and i am certain you will retain much more information. As for finding a happy place in order to remain calm while you study i found just playing soft music or working outdoors say like in a park helped tremendously. There is really no perfect answer for each one of us learns and retains information differently but i think you may have success trying this. Good Luck To You and may your future be a bright one.

I had to study for a really boring exam once and the only way I managed to keep myself focused for long enough, was to smoke a very light joint. I retained the information for just long enough to pass the exam. It was one of the highest grades I ever got.  I was living in The Netherlands at that time, where smoking pot is not a problem.  Nowadays I keep my life simple. What I cannot remember I do not need to know. It works fine.  All this might not be the right solution for you though. I wish you the best of luck.

You could read it out loud to yourself a few times.
You could take notes.
You could have a friend look at the book and make self check quizzes for you.
Lastly, you could set aside a "Quiet Time" for when you work, in a place with very few distractions, and don't look at peeling paint on the wall.

Is it possible to change his mind? Guys help (girls' opinions valued too)?



This guy liked me in school and then 4 years after school ended tried to ask me out. I wasn’t interested and we then lost contact for another 4 years. I recently saw him, he was flirting and even made a joke about us dating. This time I thought I’d like to date him and so I asked him to hang out (shoot some hoops like we did at school – so not really a date or anything). He said yes but when I asked when he’s free he didn’t reply to me. Two weeks later I sent him a small text to ask if he’s chickened out. He said he still wants to hang out but because he’s busy on the weekend maybe the weekend after. A few weeks went by and I never heard from him. His b-day was a few days ago so I wished him a happy b-day and asked if he wanted to do the basketball on the weekend. He replied to me and told me that he’s been busy, thanked me for the b-day wishes but didn’t answer me about the weekend but ended the message with a see you. So I assume he is not interested.



Now, it is clear to me that he is not interested anymore so don't tell me that please…I want to know if there is any way a guy would re-consider a girl who he liked in the past but perhaps is not too keen on anymore for whatever reason. What would she have to do? Tell him how she really feels?



He is single now (he told me himself), got out of a long term thing a few months ago, and he’s very shy and indecisive. I don't know but he must know i am interested right?

first off, he could still be interested but since he's shy he doesn't know how to approach the situation.



and as far as reconsidering,



guys are weird, like me...one day i can "like" someone and another day I wont feel interested and just want my space.



and yes i'm pretty sure he knows you're interested..just give it time...don't stress it...continue playing the field



i've done the same things to girls i liked in the past...made it seem like I didn't care at first and push the girls away but deep down I really would like them...

How is it possible for some people to actually spend more time talking than breathing?



I work with someone who, I kid you not, can literally talk for HOURS without pausing for a single moment of silence.



It's like a stream of consciousness, and no matter how serious or trivial the concept is, she lets it fly, and doesn't give a second thought as to whether it actually needs to be said.



I suppose one could defend it as ADHD, or a serious personality disorder such as narcissism.  My belief is that it is a stunning level of selfishness and immaturity.



What are the reasons for someone blurting out every thought in their head?

I don't think there is anything wrong or unhealthy with speaking one's mind. Of course, if you feel uncomfortable as your comments of selfishness and immaturity imply then you should seek association elsewhere. I think that healthy relationships are found on clear communication. That said, it is possible that a person who is insecure feels obligated to share every thought in their head with the world. In which case, it isn't healthy for the person to feel that way.

Stress can do that, make people think and problem solve out loud.



There are lots of reasons..including the ones you mentioned.



If this person is otherwise functioning well, then she may have some awful stuff happening in her private life that is making her need to hear her thoughts to drown out dwelling on the problems and function.



If that is the case she is oblivious that she does this and when the crisis is over she will lighten up a lot.
I have been doing this a bit myself since my dad died in Aug.  I can hear myself but not stop babbling anyway.

Researchers agree that if there is a chemical imbalance in these brain chemicals, then clinical states of depression result. Antidepressant medications work by increasing the availability of neurotransmitters or by changing the sensitivity of the receptors for these chemical messengers. It is believed that modifying these brain chemicals can help improve emotions.

Why do I tend to infatuate?



Hey there, I am 17 years old. I am a really nice and mature guy but I feel like I tend to infatuate alot. I also have mild cerebral palsy which affects me physically, not mentally. It started 2 1/2 years ago, first it was a teacher which lasted around 1 year, then girls in my classes, first girl lasted 4 months, then another girl which lasted 3 months, and now i've crushed on a really cute/nice girl since February.
I have been crushing on this girl for nearly 9 months and used to feel like it was true love when I first crushed on her. I knew her 2 years ago and we talked and had her on facebook but I never crushed on her till last February, it was so random. I've seen pics of her before and thought she was cute but never crushed on her till now.
In February, one of her close friends told her I liked her and she started flirting with me but I dismissed that she liked me because she is a bit of a flirt. I am also a shy guy though so I was scared to flirt back. In April, I found out another guy liked her and got jealous so I tried to get attention which irritated her, she ended up blocking me on MSN and moving to another part of the class. We talked about it in June when I told her how I felt and I was sorry for what happened, we said we should move on. We still talk though.
Why do I infatuate? How can I stop infatuating? Does my disability contribute to this?

Infatuation is usually what guys do actually, you think that you would hate the feeling of being infatuated with a girl. but guys actually like that feeling of being in love.  can you imagine not liking somebody. it would be unusual and annoying.



well now that i answered why I will attempt to help with how you can stop rather than infatuating about a specific girl you can give all your attention to find a person you think would need a friend or maybe just start doing thing for ppl find one person to serve do things for etc.

Capt. you came to this earth school to learn to love.  Thus the infatuations.
The life script you prepared for yourself is not an easy one.  But you do
not require easy.



Having a friend that you have no responsibility for is easy.  Having a friend
that potentiality might need tlc some day is off putting.  Not every girl
is ready to contemplate that possibility at your young ages.



Eventually fate will intervene and the right one will show up.  In the meantime
enjoy infatuation all you want.  Have fun and have faith

You either fear pregnancy or you want it. Not for your self but in your life. The fact that it was a work colleague means you have a close enough relationship with her that your subconscience could image her carrying your child. The fact that is was a WORK colleague maybe means you think pregnancy and your job are interconnected in some way, like both of them add worry or stress into your life. Maybe you worry about work , and you also worry about the fact that you could get someone pregnant, and so both of those interconnected.



If maybe you were happy during your dream maybe your subConscience is trying to make it obvious that you want something steady and firm like a job and a relationship as well as your own family. It could mean many things but really , only you know what it means. Not us.

Communication is the key to a happy life.  You should tell who ever it may be rather then wait for them to find out themselves it would be worse if that happened. Sorry that happened to you.  But if your partner really loves you and it wasn't your intentions in the first place he should except you no matter what!:)

You need some counselling to help you sort out your guilt feelings and depression. Go and see a sexual abuse organisation. They will be able to help you.
A future partner should be aware of it as you need someone sympathetic to your problem, plus it will impact on your relationship and he should be aware why.

yes definitely, everything that you are or have done, have heard or seen or being exposed to is part of who you are, and will affect your marriage life. in a bad way? that's your call. i say it's your opportunity to make a good thing out of a disaster, like making sure something like that never happens to your kids...
what to do i just felt very guilt and depressed of this???
heel yourself by turning your experience into a good one, like maybe be part of a group to fight against, or write about your experience....
what happen if i would not inform my future partner?????
he simply wouldn't understand what you are like, and why  you do certain things. he might take you for someone else..

How does this sound to you? Its for one of those "tell us about your self" type things. for an internship...?



My name is Hakim Husein, and I am attending San Jacinto College in Houston, Texas but plan on transferring to Birzeit University located in the West Bank. I am 21 years old and the youngest of six children, with a loving and caring mother and a deceased father who worked sixteen-hour days to support us. In the early days of my life, I vividly recall waking up in the middle of the night for a cup of cold milk and overhearing my parents crying while watching the Arabic news. I was too young to comprehend the situation and assumed they were watching a sad movie. As a first generation American-Arab, I have experienced first-hand the effects of the seemingly endless violence in Palestine. The  fighting between Israeli solders and Palestinian civilians would be a staple topic of my childhood. However, this life experience could be interpreted as a blessing in disguise because from that point on I knew in my heart what my true calling was, that there is absolutely nothing in the world I would rather do than render aid to people who really need it. I have dedicated myself to my community and the greater good, such as acting as a crisis counselor, and have very high aspirations on one day becoming a United States diplomat. I am a Foreign Affairs major and like the great Martin Luther King Jr., I too have a dream, that one day a Jewish and Muslim child will be playing side by side in a better world for all to prosper. It all starts with tolerance of one another, and can only end in peace.

Do you ever hear voices in your head(that aren't your own)?



Sometimes I can hear people having conversations in my head. Often they're talking about how they could do things without getting caught or debating over the rationale of murder. Sometimes my thoughts accidentally chime in and provide them solutions and ideas for their problems.
When I was a kid I lived in a haunted house and I could physically hear the spirits conversing around me.
One such time I was sitting up in my bed, not able to sleep. I could hear them in the upper right corner of my room, near the ceiling. I was frightened and so I pulled my covers over my head. They noted it and said "She thinks we can't see her."



Sometimes I'm convinced that maybe I'm tuning into some sort of astral projection of thought on a communal level, but I'm more of a serendipitous party. I don't think they hear me or know that I here them though. It's almost as if they seem to receive my thoughts as if they were their thoughts.
For example, they may be talking about what color to paint a wall and I automatically form an opinion.
They'll act upon my thought as if the thought was theirs. They might say something like "Purple! I think purple would be nice." immediately after I thought about purple.

Can you help me with this problem which may reflect your own problem also?



Hi Guys,



I want to prepare a questionaire for my own self in order to analyse where I am lacking in or mistaking or where I need to make some potential improvments, and where I am doing good. Let me explain a little more: I am feeling like running away from everything I know, see, feel, and even from my own self! On ther other hand, I have some very important plans that I need to carry out successfully. But I am not being serious about them and they are very-very important. I need to pay my attention to them and regularly. To be specific, recently I took an admission into an IT degree course and I am not studying at all. I work for 9 hours and 2 hours get wasted so I have 13 hours. I need to rest also.



Well, I feel so much tired and feel I am getting lazier day by day.



So, I am looking for a psychological approach to help me solve my problems and heal my brain and body as well and finally get my mind set on my goals that I am struggling here for.



Did you get it all?



Some samples questions that come in my mind right now are:



(1) What is top-most important task for you to accomplish these days or months?



And my answer is: To start my study and get in pace with the chapters already covered at my institute so that I am not running behind the other students, and get success in my course.



(2) What disturbs me most and how I can overcome it?



Etc.

It's probably curiosity, because you don't usually see people dying in front of your eyes everyday do you? But if one was to watch someone die in front of their eyes, they would definitely not want to watch people suffer any more as they have experienced it first hand,

Also ( no offense ) see the signs : Is she interested in some other guy ;
Maybe she is stressed , First talk to her about it , If she still not responds properly , Check whether is there any other guy in her life

I think that when you are a teenager you actually think that they are the hardest years of your life seen that all these new things are happening all of a sudden and everyone's changing, but I think that things do get harder when we grow up but we won't actually think that since we will know how to handle them because we learnt how to in earlier years (aka our teen years)

when your a teen then yes, it seems like the hardest years. but just wait until you have kids of your own and have to earn your own way in this life. then you will realize that your teen years was a piece of cake.

Looking back, Id have to say that my teens were very tough because I was so unsure of myself and where I was going, who I was, what I wanted, what I wanted to be, confused about what was important to me instead of others, etc.....as an adult, Im confident and sure of what I want in my life and am up to the challenge of doing what it takes to get that.  Emotionally, teen years are tough.  Once you mature, its still tough, but at least you're more sure of yourself and what you're working toward. Hang in there. Things will be better. Good luck to you.

When I was a teenager I thought life couldn't get any harder.  Now as an adult with a child of my own -  I rethink that and not just with a child of my own I also have 3 step children (of whom my husband has sole custody of).  We've been together for 10 years.  They are ages 21, 17, 12, and my 9 year old.  When adding step children in the mix - and they are teenagers - its even harder!  I won't go into all of the problems we've had but they definitely are different and more challenging problems than when I myself had when I was a teenager.  But as an adult - when you have kids - you become responsible for more than just yourself.  So - adult life is more difficult and hard than any other!

I am a lot older than you and I can tell you it was very difficult for me when I was your age. It must be even more difficult for teenagers in today's world. I am watching my 14 soon to be 15 year old daughter go through a lot of very difficult struggles right now. I can help her with some things but not everything. I try to be a good listener. Try to talk over your feelings with friends,family , maybe a school counselor. Don't let this tough period get the better of you. Things will get better. Good luck!

It's funny to think that a person who has no reference beyond there own experiences can try and state something.  The years you are a teen are no harder than the years you are a infant or elderly.  Life is what you make of it.  If you believe something is difficult then you just promised yourself that it is and will continue to be.  The power of your mind is deeper than you imagine, you simply need to let yourself believe in the only thing that you can rely upon, yourself.  You can't buy confidence in a bottle.  Confidence comes from inside of you so don't let anyone push you around and remember who you are.

Yes, with new privledges come new responsibilities that you will have to deal with. Accepting these responsibilities & making the right decisions is very difficult given the limited experience you have in dealing with your new privledges.  This is a transition phase from childhood to adulthood & will without a doubt be confusing as you watch peers attempt to deal with these issues too.



You must also learn to deal with the changes hormones are forcing on your brain chemistry & body... this is the period of huge mistakes & confusion.  I hope you have adult mentors to help you deal with this difficult period... things get better after High School & strangely those that dislike their teen years seem to do much better as adults than those that enjoyed their teen years.

I'm 28 and I can honestly say that looking back, while at the time I thought my teen years were hard, they weren't too bad for the most part. I'm finding now that what was so tough about it was the emotional aspect. I was unsure of who I was and tried too hard to be what I thought everyone wanted me to be. It wasn't until I was about 17 when I said "Screw it! I'm sick of playing a character all the time" and I really just let myself be me. Other than that, my teenage years were a piece of cake. I didn't have any major responsibilities outside of school (and even it was easy compared to college), I worked part time and made enough money to do the things I wanted at the time, I didn't really have any bills other then paying for gas for my car (which was only about $1.00/gal back then....dangit!), I seemed to have time to do everything I wanted like theater, soccer, hanging out with friends, etc. Now that I'm in "the real world" it can be tougher having all this responsibility, plus I have a 6 yr old daughter and a husband now, but that's the great part about getting older, you learn just what you're capable of.

They are pretty tough, i'm a teen myself. Most of us are emotional at this age, i don't speak for all teens though. I still haven't really gotten to know life, maybe i'm wrong to say that they're the toughest of all years because i still have a lot to look forward to..and maybe things DO get harder. It's just the constant worrying about how you look and how you'll fit in. You want to feel accepted especially in highschool. I always used to worry if i was measuring up to my parent's expectations or not.
I was constantly trying to figure out who i was..and my future.
But it's all just the hormones. Things will start to fall together as you get older.

Can you please explain the psychology behind my  problem ?



I am a 18 year old gay guy , fell in love with my professor , He is a Sikh 29  year old , I am also a Sikh 18 year old ,
Before I met him , I always finded beards a turn off , & always preferred a



clean shaven look from guys , But after I met him , I began to find beards sexy , because we ( he & I ) are Sikhs , & hence males are prohibited from trimming / shaving beards , So he has a short yet a flowing & majestic beard , & a very beautiful turban ; So , Now I wish to look like him now , sort of trying to copy cat him , I dont know why but I wanna look like him , a flowing beautiful beard & a turban on head , This has inspired me to follow my religion , because earlier as I said , I didnt liked turbans & beard , So I cut off my hair which I ve grown since childhood , but now I am growing them again , I even wanna wear my turban in the way he ties;



To be honest , I also see him as a sex object , Every night I go to bed , before sleeping  , I wished he would have slept with me on my bed with me ; ( sorry no offense ) As I masturbate , I imagine he is on top of me ;



& this may freak you a bit , I picked a hair from his beard that was on his table , I was so nicely placed there as If he has purposely kept it there



&  to this day , I ve preserved that hair



& last but not the least :
I ve felt this thing : Small Sikh boys remind me of him , I think this may be because This 29 yr old sikh prof. must have been such a small cute sikh boy in past , also religious objects , Sermons of Sikh temple remind me of him , So Sikhism in short reminds me of him ,
SO  WHAT  IS  THE  PSYCHOLOGY  BEHIND  THIS

Thanks for you answer to my question. I'm not a psychology expert but I think yo're just obsessed with him. Your professor is the object of your dreams and maybe you idiolize and want to be like him. Do you aspire to be like him? If he's your crush, then it's normal to want to be like him as he's the same sex as you. Obsession makes you do crazy things, trust me, I know. But a teacher / student relationship is strictly forbidden, so one day you will get over him once you find someone else. It might not seem like that right now, but it will happen.

Years ago I read a little book when I was at a very bad place in my life.  "How to become happy in 8 minutes"  Not sure of exact title. Do what you love, that is positive and satifying, like art, music, drawing, cooking, sewing, whatever you enjoy.  Try this simple test: get a mirror, look at yourself, and smile.  Hold the smile!!  You will begin to feel happy!  Your brain will begin to release seratonin (sp). You will find it impossible to cry, you will find it impossible to think bad things with a smile on your face.  It works. Practice that little test often!!!

when you feel upset or unhappy for a period of time, maybe you should go out for a trip. That might do the trick. Go to some ancient countries like Egypt, Roma, China, etc. China is especially proper if you want to visit some great places of interests. You can check some information of the Chinese cities on internet. Echinacities.com could be a help.

Dosage of gamma rays. It would have to remain constant, though (well, for it to be a good experiment). For example, there are multiple groups of the morning glories (all kept in the same conditions except for the dosage of gamma rays) and each group gets a different dosage of gamma rays. There should also be a group of morning glories that gets no gamma rays, called the control group.
And actually, the dependent variable wouldn't be the morning glories themselves, it would be the growth of the morning glories.

Okay listen... you just need to be really outgoing....



Not care what others think and just be yourself.



I know that sounds preachy... but I have come to learn that in my high school career. I've finally become the person i want to be. Someone who is comfortable in m own skin. I'm a little arrogant, and a bit loud at times... but hey, what teeanger isn't?



Hope that helps ;)

what's wrong is that you are hiding you real personality - which is not either of those you have you described.



neither you nor anyone else is perfect in every way - and you are pretending to do the impossible. It makes you mad and rebellious, which is not your nature either.



Quit trying for perfect (pleasing someone else, your parents? God?) and explore what YOU want, and what you think is right - i think then you will find you just have 1 real personality.

Well do you actually do these things or just think about them?  Sounds like your trying to suppress your real personality by trying to be something that you think is or have been taught is morally good.  This may be causing you to go from one extreme to the next instead of finding balance in both sides.  I'm no doctor but that is my take on things.

Oh Sweetness...you could but honestly? I think you sound young. :) You are just a nice young man who is trying so hard to be the best nice young man he can be...and fighting his normal erdges to sew a few wild oats. I don't think there is anything wrong with you except you are trying to hard. If you are really concerned talk to someone. Go see your doctor and tell him/her how you are feeling. Iam sure you will be ok and since you seem to be a believer...I will be praying for you. (lol i would pray for you anyway...just wouldn't tell you lol!) Hang in there dear.

Ok now my boyfriend has admitted to me that he occasionally snorts coke. How do I deal with this?



In relation to my previous question: http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...



My boyfriend hid from me that he snorted coke. Before I got the chance to confront him he finally confessed it to me randomly out of the blue.



Ok call me crazy but he has opened up about a lot to me and I do respect him for being honest.



But....Now I know I really don't know how to handle this. My step dad is a drug addict and an alcoholic, my bro used to smoke marijuana and got violent on it so I know from experience that nagging doesn't work or trying to get them off of it; they have to do it themselves.



We have a perfect relationship (no over exaggeration). On coke or not on coke he is still a gentleman but this is still serious.



I don't want to leave him so what should I do?

Paul R: Good point. that is why I have never taken drugs because before it has reached the buyer many people have suffered.



I've lived with junkies so mixing with them is nothing new to me. I hate them but I can relate to them because to be honest it is all that I know.



I believe that he is a non-addict drug user but I know that even a non-addict wastes their precious money on their drug hobbie. Thanks for you answer it made me think x

Being honest about it, is all very well and good. But you have to take stock of the situation and decide what you want in your life. Buying drugs funds crime. There is no getting around that. And I mean serious violent crime. Even the buying of canabis funds violent crime. Drugs are moved around the county by quite shocking means. Drug users who say they are doing no-one any harm are just naive fools. So you have to think about that one first.



Your boyfriend will be mixing with drug dealers. You also have to decide if you want to have connections in your life with people like that.



You also have to find out how serious a habit your boyfriend has. Is he addicted, is his habit out of control? If it isn't out of control how close is he to being addicted? Coke is an extremely addictive and expensive drug.



So if you don't want to leave him, you have to decide, can you live with a boyfriend who has an expensive potentially addictive and dangerous habit that funds crime?

talk to him, try to find out why he s using coke, coke is a heavy drug that people use in order to avoid or cope with something. Tell him youll stay with him, but you want him to get clean because of the experiences you have witnessed with your father. yOu can take him to Na or ask him to enter therapy. Often all addicts need is a supproting hand. Tell him youll be there every step of the way.

I was always told by my uncle 'I wouldn't piss on him if he were on fire' about people who do chemical drugs.  I totally agree, also my uncle was married to a lady who was into coke and she had a huge debt.  You do not want to be ending up paying off his debt if he gets a major addiction.  LEAVE HIM! He probably will have one heck of a time not doing it  again, and he will hide it from you.

Tell him he needs to give it up or you have to move on. Tell him he has 30 days without seeing or talking to you. Set a date for dinner 30 days from then and either have dinner and say goodbye or continue your relationship with him knowing that any such relapse to even a "casual" line is the end of your relationship.

Leave him.



I know this isn't what you want to hear, and it's not what I wanted to hear when I was in the same situation, but if he's a high-functioning coke addict and he's successfully hidden it from you for awhile, he's trouble.



I was with a man in college who seemed perfect--smart, handsome, responsible, had everything in common with me--but it turned out he was a coke addict. His life eventually deteriorated to the point that he couldn't function anymore, and he couldn't hide it. Cocaine is a powerful drug. It is NOT like weed, or alcohol, or cigarettes. It is not harmless.



Inevitably, your boyfriend will either quit (and I hope he does) or it will destroy him.



I assure you, it is not worth the heartache it will cost you to see him devolve into a shadow of his former self--coke will destroy his brain, and it already is. I had a child with the college boyfriend that I mentioned--I'm raising the child alone, because even though his father is clean now, he destroyed his mind with cocaine.



This is a red flag. It's unequivocal. You need to leave him now.

If he is buying it you should tell him to cut it out...if it's something he comes across from time to time I would say drop it. As long as he isn't looking for it I'd say he's just living life...



Not to say that I condone drug use...but it happens.



I used to do a bunch of blow. I realized it wasn't for me and was disgusted with how much money I wasted.



If you find that all of hisclose friends blow coke...well then chances are he is a cokehead. Cocaine is one hell of a drug and it's not nearly acceptable as pot. So usually people that do it cling to some sort of group so they can pool their money and get more for cheaper.



Find out what "occasionally" is and I think your answer will become much clearer.

Oh I know I should say counselling,gp,group therapy but you know something??.A lot of people can happily use drugs and live useful,normal lives.



I'm sure i'll get slated for saying that but it is true.The fact that your boyfriend doesn't noticeably change personalites and owned up of his own free will to you prooves that it hasn't got a hold of him.



I'd relax but then most the people I know take some drug or other cannibis and valium being the most common but well have plenty of mates that regularly use coke,while myself I'm a regular amphetamine user yet I work full time,have done for years and have normal relationships and a decent member of society.



I'd suggest you trust him ti know what needs to be done and leave it at that,he sounds like he is in control and not the coke thats the main point !!!

I think there are 2 ways, the hard way and the soft way.



The hard way, put yourself in a situation there is no turning back. For example (extreme) drop yourself in Paris, I bet you have to approach people to askt he road to the airport :)



The soft way, you need a bit by bit. You need someone who can push you a little bit. Giving you trust, faith and confidence.



I have helped many people to be less shy. For example going to the cinema. A friend of mine is very shy. I took her out for a movie. While we were standing before the cinema, I asked her to pick which movie. She didnt respond, I keep asking her, she said I dont mind just pick any. I gave her simple choices A B or C, Still no responds...



Ok ask her to flip a coin. Head is A and Coin is B. etc etc etc. Finally she has decided.



Second time, she did it to me, flip a coin.... Darn it...



Hard way,.. I "dropped" myself in Paris, and had one bloody address. Its either you starve to death or you start asking people.

just listen to good music. You may just be hard on yourself. I bet you have great qualities and do not know yet.  Don't force yourself to socialize with others that you may not be comfortable with. I bet in a year you will feel different. I was very shy and sometimes still am. I am cautious and want to know people before I call them a friend.  you are a nice person and you know that. don't fall with the so called popular crowd and go out partying and getting drunk!

Find your passion and your talent.  Then, do it often and do it in front of people.  You will be most comfortable in your element and you'll want to be around others like yourself.  This is where you will find your comfort zone.  It's easier to talk with other people if you have something in common.

Sometimes when you procrastinate it's because unconsciously you realise that what you are supposed to be doing is wrong for you, or will have a negative outcome. Eg.: you are supposed to be filling in a form for an interview, but the job would be terrible if you got it.  Whatever anyone says (and it's a Protestant work ethic thing) daydreaming can be good for you. It's nature's way of helping you think of all the alternatives and therefore becoming more adaptable.  I am old enough to know that lots of the things I worked really hard for in my youth were a complete waste of time.  Some of the things that seemed like wasting time (writing letters, playing music) have come in really useful.  Just because you enjoy it, doesn't necessarily mean it's bad for you.  Passing the time joking with friends will stay with you for the rest of your life. But obviously, don't be a complete slob!
Best wishes to you anyway.

I don't know your personal situation.  Whether you are in school, what age, all the particulars.



Simply put find something that you want to do.  When you are doing something that you enjoy you wont feel the need to procrastinate.  If your goal (what you want to do) is something that just inst possible at this time you have to remind yourself that what you're doing now is to get to what you really want to do.  Sometimes we just have to do things that we don't like in order to do the things that we love.  In a society of instant gratification its easy to get lost in the moment and forget your true goals.

What do you do when a person you care about is feeling really bad ? ?



Ive gotten to know this guy, that has an amazing personality, he is smart, funny and caring. But he has had a really messed up relationship with his family, mostly his dad. And his mother died about five years ago. Still he is so strong and manages to live a somewhat normal life, he has an apartment and a lot of friends. But he has told me that he has a lot of anxiety, and even anxietyattacks that made him faint a few times. And trouble sleeping, and really feeling like everything is meaningless. And I really care for him, I know he likes me more than a friend, but I dont know how to handle someone who is feeling like that inside . He knows all of his issues and that he is carrying all the pain inside of him. And I just wish he would talk to me about it, and maybe in some way I could be a support for him along the way. But he doesnt want to do anything about how he feels, he doesnt have any good selfesteem, but I know that he is a wonderful person, he has showed me that. I just want to know if I could say or do something for him ? ... so that he would realize that he needs to talk about this and start loving himself instead of feeling so bad inside all the time . Im afraid he`ll get a depression if he doesnt do something soon. Any ideas or tips on how to make someone so stubborn deal with his problem ?

To answer this question, lets imagine (God forbid) that your mother has died and your relationship with your father was screwed up somehow i.e. you and your friend's roles have been switched, how do you think you would cope? How could the pain be possible to bear?



The answer is simple. Strong people like your friend have found some coping strategies to tax on the pain, at the price of some aspects of his life.



As long as he's strong and you make him feel that you got his back, he WON'T suffer from depression.



To hear him out, don't  interrupti him, take him out to a walk in the park (or something like that) and ask him about how life is going, how he's coping (ask him in order to trigger him into talking himself out) and when you do that, it will be a first step to sorting out this mess.

I'm miserable! The only thing that keeps me from offing myself is the fact that I have to live for my family's sake. I'm disabled, in pain most of the time, physically and emotionally, going through a separation. My credit sucks because of my ex. I'm broke and will probably end up homeless after my mother's demise. Does that answer your question? I hate my life and wish I was never born.

Yes, every action is a reaction to something else. It's not some cosmic reason, but because of something we did or didn't do. Sometimes it is just because someone else wasn't paying attention to what they were doing and it affected us. We do learn lessons from what happens to us but I don't think it is all planned ahead of time.



Most people don't want to accept the fact that most of what happens to them are directly because of choices they make in their own lives. So their answer to everything is some cosmic "reason".

Yes....  The Law of Cause and Effect.



Everything that happens (effect) happens because circumstances allow it and some domino up the line was pushed by someone or something (cause).



However, your question is probably aimed more at does everything happen for a "higher" reason aimed at helping us grow as ppl.  Alas, I have to say I agree with that phrase, "Sh** happens!"  And it does happen for a reason....  But that reason, that cause, may not be something that helps us feel better in knowing it.



It's on us to find meaning and/or give some event meaning (in a personal way) that helps us move forward or else we will stagnate and wither.

Smart people tend to get work done in a quick, efficient and even fashionable way, making it look easy.  Smart people are generally the people who tend to easily recall facts and ideas and have excellent reasoning and comprehensive skills, hence being known as "know-it-all"s.

Societal ideology. In the U.S. we value things like strength, beauty, fearlessness and independence. The more bold you are the more popular you are. The social parameters for being considered Intelligent are different in Japan than they are here.It's the shy kids that are more popular because their ideology is different than ours.

What is meaning of transit and how we take advantage in life(ways)?



I have taken the time to reanalyze your Astral configuration and I can confirm everything I have previously told you about this vitally important Transit period and this is why the reading which I have produced for you last week is extremely important as it shows that you will soon be entering into an Astrological Transit which is going to have an enormous importance for you,

Transit is short for transition which means changing from one style to another. It means a change in your life.

How to stop my parents from thinking I'm faking sick?



For real, it seems like my parents would send me to school even if I was dying. Ok, so the other night it all started off with a very sore throat and it's hard to swallow. Over the course of the night, I was awake with fever and a serious earache. So at 6 I go to my mom and dad to ask if I can stay home and THEY THINK I'M FAKING. I had a calculus test that day, but honest to goodness truth I was horribly sick. They keep using the excuse that they know what I look llike when I'm sick (like my dad would say: i've been raising u since u were little. When u had a fever, yours eyes would get dark and a bit red). The problem is: THAT WAS WHEN I WAS A BABY. I remember a tiem when I was 7 where my mom said i didnt have a fever and i showed her that thermometer that said I was 103 degrees. Or another time when i told them I had the stomach flu and they said I was being a punk and I was faking and they didnt believe me until I threw up in the car. So apparently, they arent good at noticing symptoms (yet my brother can fake sick and stay at home). PLEEEEEEEEEZ someone tell me a way where they can stop thinking I'm faking sick

If you have a temperature of 103 degrees then you should see the school nurse. If the thermometer read 103 there is no way your school is going to want you sticking around the school and getting everyone else sick. Your parents will receive a phone call to pick you up.

There has to be a reason why they think this. Are you ALWAYS complaining about not feeling well? I'm sure sometimes you have done this and maybe you've done it to the point to where now when you are sick they don't buy it. It's like the crying wolf story. I'm not saying thats what went on. I'm just saying there has to be a reason WHY. So think it over and ask yourself if you might have done this a little too much. I know my son did it when he was younger, and I was always confused whether he was faking or not because he did it too often.

Have you ever faked it? The thermometer said 103, but was that because you ran it under hot water? Are you mad that your brother can fake sick and stay home but you can't because you aren't as good at faking it? (or have lost credibility?) When do you want to stay home...is it usually when you have a test? How serious are your symptoms...do you exaggerate them to yourself?



If you are satisfied with your answers to all these questions, then sit your folks down and ask them why they think you are a faker. Take in everything they have to say without defending yourself. When they are done, calmly present your point of view.



Good luck!

<question>



Why is rape considered a crime, and abortion isnt? Another hypocrisy of feminists?



First of all, with the whole feminist rights movement; feminists have tried to justify their actions in all proportions.



You might tell me that abortion takes place generally with the consent of both a husband and wife (so you cant blame only women), and in case of rape; is needed to protect a "13-year" (or whatever) old child's life from the difficulties of parenting. Have you realized what you are doing to the fetus inside her: you are KILLING it, MURDERING it. It is a crime against humanity. You might tell me women are not solely responsible for abortions, and I can also say that rape isnt committed only by men. So why all this hypocrisy from feminists?



Studies have shown that only 1 of 4 women report rape, and 1 of 10 men report rape because it will hurt their ego and damage their reputation in society. So men get raped a LOT too, they just dont tell it.



I think abortion should only be used in the case of the girl's "near-death" state. If she's about to die, she should have the right to save herself over the child. However, we have seen in the past how women have sacrificed their lives to save the child in them. Abortion is getting misused a LOT these days, over the smallest things; like a girl is not ready to start a family. If you didnt want to have a kid, you shouldnt have had sex (or sex with protection). If you wore protection, but still got pregnant; tough luck, you should have known better; now deal with it, raise a kid. Dont put your mental deficiencies on your child.



You tell me that women should have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies, the thing is: from a christian point of view, the body is not exactly yours: the body is only for the time-being; and the soul is for the hereafter. When you take a child's life; more than taking its body, you take its soul. Im sorry feminists, but you have to realize there is a LIVING child growing inside them, and taking its life is a very serious matter. Dont justify it to make women look falsely independent, you arent doing yourselves any favors.

You sound introspective and weird. There's no clear signs of schizophrenia in this question. Anyone can watch a t.v. show and learn something about it.. that's usually why there are family movies and movies that generate a positive outcome.. the producers want you to learn from it. That doesn't make you crazy!!! Start watching different movies.... and stay away from the horror ones!

schizophrenia onset is typically between the ages of 15 and 25 (although it can affect children younger than fourteen, with a subtype known as childhood-onset schizophrenia). The disorder can come on over a period of years (called insidious onset) or be very rapid. It affects 1% of the general population.

What you say may be ridiculous to someone else, but what it is for you is your own interpretation.  We all have a different path to take.  That is why when born, you are given your own Brain---Eyes---Limbs---Ears---Mouth, you see where I am coming from.  Yes, you need guidance sometimes, and for some of us we are not fortunate to have, Great mentors, Sensible Parents, etc. you have to be wise about certain things.  I can't put you in the direction you need be, but these few words are the best that I can do...

And Basically If Your Saying You Take Lines From Movies Or Examples And Use Them As Your Way Of Life I Wouldn't Know What That Has To Do With Schizophrenia.Never Drink And Have Sex Im Your Outcome.

I know it's hard, but first try to let it go. Especially since you think she didn't intend to hurt your feelings. Everyone at one time or another says things that could hurt another person's feelings.



However, if she continues to say things that offend you, talk with her about it in some way or another, preferably in person or over the phone. Just breifly tell her that what she said upset you and if she's a good person that cares about you, she'll understand and apologize. And if she's still causing problems after that, it would be best to avoid her from then on.



Good luck

You know.  She's not thinking about it.  You still are but she isn't.  She wins.



But if you're certain she didn't mean to offend you then why not just approach it rationally...and IN PERSON.  Personalize it.  Let her SEE the person she offended.  Let her SEE the look on your face when you tell her.  That will get the point across far better than email or a phone call and she'll be far more likely to understand the extent of the offense.

If you really feel the need to approach her, try "I felt hurt by your comment" instead of "YOU hurt me."  Tell her why it hurt you, and that it's still bothering you (why you're bringing it up)



Time out of you life is being wasted by thinking about it.  Best to choose not to allow someone to have that power over you (you get to choose what to think about).

I had the same dream over 4 days.?



It was about me and a butterfly. The butterfly could talk to me, and she sounded a bit like my sister. We played alot and stuff, like I would chase the butterfly and it'd say 'can't catch me'!

Basically when a person can either put 100% effort or 0% effort in things with no gray area in between. Can someone also explain it to me and what the causes and solutions for it are? Thanks!

I suppose "confidence" is about trusting yourself.  What ends up happening when you have a friend with similar views as you do, they CONFIRM the things you may already have the answer to but are unsure about.

when you are with friends you feel more confident because you've got someone by your side if things go wrong. but if your saying that not even your best friends give you confidence, then..



Do you possibly like this girl.? sometimes, if you really like someone, you only think about her/him and you forget about making a fool of yourself and only concentrate on being with them and that makes you feel even more confident coz you have got someone even better than a friend.



none of this probably makes any sense, it was just a spur of the moment thing..got cuaght up in all the drama going on. :}

Confidence is all in the mind.  There is no difference between when she is there and when she is not, the only difference is your perception of the situation.  As far as talking to people I think it is often easier to approach somebody when you are with somebody else because of, 1, the safety in numbers and 2. the diffusion of rejection if the approach does not go down well.  You can laugh it of and make a joke of it if you are with a friend, where if you you by yourself it would be hard not to take it personally.



I have a website that deals with self confidence that you might find useful.

Why is this guy playing games with me?



For about 2 months, this guy was flirting with me. He would find ways to touch me, compliment me often, always sit near me, glancing over, tell me personal stories, joke with me/focus on me in a crowd, etc...Then a few weeks ago, while in theatre class, his partner for a scene of his (a kissing scene) asked me if I would do it. I said I wouldn't only cause of my germ paranoia, plus it would be in front of people. Well, this one guy said something like "ooh that was harsh" or something like that. I said that I thought he was a good looking guy, I just would feel weird doing that in front of people. Later, he came from his end of the room to come sit next to me at the other end of the room. We didn't speak at all, but I spoke to another guy in front of me for a few seconds abour something. I forget what, but I wasn't flirting. At least not intentionally, maybe it looked like that to this other guy since me and the guy I was talking with were laughing.



Anyway, for about a week or two, this guy that I like and was flirting before, just stopped. He would act very distant and kind of ignore me. If he did talk to me, he would treat me like a friend. If I touched him, he would lean back afterwards and he wouldn't touch back, I would see him eyeing up or checking out other girls, etc...



Now today, since I just love halloween oh so much, I decided to give little treat bags to my theatre class (I'm in college BTW. I know, a little old for that, but oh well). Anyway, after I gave him his baggy he says "You're getting a hug later" and I didn't think much of it. After I was done giving them out. He says again, "(My name), give me a hug" or something like that, so I did. Well, later on at rehearsal for a play I noticed he was trying to get my attention more. Like if I was talking to someone, he would be walking around in circles near me and I could see him out of the corner of my eye looking at me from time to time. Or if I would enter the room he would look real quick. Also, I tested touching him again. And I noticed he would reciprocate. Not immediately, but after a few minutes he would play with the strings on my shirt or joke around with me (like physical movements), and he would start telling me personal stories of his again.



So what is going on? Why is he acting like this? It almost seems as if he's interested again when I do something different (like if I wear a crazy outfit for example). I have a tendency to dress a little...odd, lol. And lately I've been lazy and wearing more black, but as soon as I wear something crazy again and seem more cheerful and stuff,
he "takes notice" i guess you could say. I don't know if it has anything to do with that, I just noticed that he suddenly seemed closer now that I dressed differently today and was more "happy". Confusing, I know. Any help would be greatly appreciated.



Sorry this was so long. Thanks!

I just sounded like you were giving him messages about how far you wanted your relationship to go with him.



"It's okay to joke around and stuff, but we can't kiss, and definitely if it's not in public" was apparently what he got from that situation.



Obviously it's been a few days, and you've been acting normal to him so maybe he's gotten the idea that you've eased up on him, and he can be more friendly to you like before.



It's not too confusing. You just gotta know the steps in this little dance we call social interactions.



If he takes the lead and you say no, well then he has to back off so that he doesn't get embarrassed, if you happen to make a scene.  Now that things are a bit better, he can lean a little bit into the lead again with you.



If you really, like this guy you should definitely drop some hints his way. Although it seems as though you guys have a little game going on between each other. Someone seems to be chasing someone else.



He obviously very friendly with you and enjoys your time with him. And you seem to care a little bit about him, if you're asking others of their opinions on the situation.



You guys seem to have a fun relationship going on. You guys could be more without actually saying it. A lot of relationships I've seen have had a steady backbone of the guys trying hopelessly get the girl. The chase after all, is half the fun. You guys could still joke around but on a more personal level. And when you do feel it's time you guys could step it up, you guys definitely have the choice to do that.



Hoped this helped, good luck

He likes you.  Ask him to do something outside of class!  The games are all about his ego.  Unintentionally he backs off when he feels you don't like him back.  It's not a game, just the way that it is.

You probably want to be more interactive with kids your age rather than being at home all day long. I think it's normal for you to feel that way, I know I probably would. It's tough because you can't really do anything if your parents won't allow you to go to a public school, but I'm sure there are kids in your neighborhood you can become friends with and talk to about how you feel.

What's the difference between an addiction and an obsession?



Can an addiction turn into an obsession and can an obsession turn into an addiction?



</question>



<additional details>



This is my take on the definitions:  An obsession can be an unwanted thought that sticks in your brain and you have to perform certain rituals to alleviate the stress and anxiety produced from it for example, your unwanted thought is that your hands are germ infected and therefore you never stop washing your  hands.  Whereas an addiction is something you actually get a pleasure out of doing and don't realize the negative affects of it.

In casual speech, the two are interchangeable.



In clinical definition, an addiction is physical. Once addicted to a substance, the body craves it without regard to thoughts or outside influences.



Obsession is mental/emotional. There is no physical need whatsoever for me to have this season's fashion update, but I feel like I will be inadequate without it. Gimme, gimme, gimme...

For example if we were to use children, and sample of kids the ones that are told they are stupid, no good, example will perform significantly less then their peers who are told how great they are. Same is true for all humanity. If a human being is told enough times they have such and such mental illness, they will begin to believe it and naturally mimic the symptoms. This is why labeling is dangerous.

If he is not ready, you are just wasting your time, the only way to move to the next level is to get him to get ready. In other words, your friends needs your help more than he thinks he does. If i was you I would first sit down and help him find a way to help him self. If he doesn't find himself you cannot help him.
Good luck

Keep at it. If he does not commit to spending more time with you then he will not commit to anything more serious. Tell him how you feel and ask if there is anything that you can do to ease the situation. If he loves you as much as you think than he should explain his behavior and try to devote more time to you. And as for the crazy ex it's called a restraining order.

You need to get rid of the ex first. Have him block her from his e-mails, phones (work, cell, everything) and if she comes stalking he needs to tell her he will call the police if she does not stop. It isn't natural, and you do need to worry about it. If your boyfriend isn't willing to do this, or says he can't or tries but says he just can't do it-break up. He may be trying to choose between the two of you or his will to be with you is breaking because of this crazy ex of his. I, personally would break up with someone like that but it's always good to give one last chance.

Fight fire with fire. Start to tell him the same things he is telling you. Act less interested, and you should be able to find out by his actions how he truly feels. I am a guy, and I know that sometimes we get scared if a girl seems too serious, but in all honesty we are often kidding ourselves because if she seems to lose interest often our interest increases.

just live alone for some days if possible at least for a week. Then you will come to know whether you really love him or it's just an attraction of young age towards opposite sex.  Even you will also come to know whether that guy loves you or not. Though it's very difficult to control our heart and emotions in the young age but we have to lose sth. in order to gain sth. in our real life.

HMM!  Sounds like he wants you on the level of sex without having the relationship.  Is that what you want?  If not, move on.  Completely.  Friendship is over.  Why? Because he does not even value you as a friend.  If he were a friend and saw you in this situation, he would tell you to bug out. Waiting is what mistresses do while the alpha gets all the time.  And the ex is still alpha?

You need to WANT to change first of all.



Yes - you do need to clean your room first.  Make it into something that reflects YOU.  Get rid of the clothes that you don't wear or that don't fit you anymore.  Rearrange your room - that's always a good way to look at things differently.  After you're done with your room, GET OUT AND ENJOY THE DAY.  If you're new in the neighborhood, go for a walk.  Do some volunteer work!  Get a job so that you can enjoy Christmas.  The key to your bad mood is YOU.

I believe that everything happens for a reason. So instead of being depressed and upset think to yourself I moved here for a reason. Who knows maybe you'll meat the man of your dreams or finally figure out what your going to do with the rest of your life. Be happy that your actually alive today and that you have friends (because believe it or not many people don't have friends). Your dad probably just wants you to get up and do something and be happy maybe he did it the wrong way but maybe thats the only way he knows how to do it. I would suggest you go out with your friends if you don't have fun well you didnt miss out on anything else besides crying and being sad and if you have fun than hey you gained some happiness. The best thing is seriously stop thinking about your past because that cant be changed and start thinking of now and the future. Even if your sad if you walk around acting like your happy one day you'll be happy!

Yes, of course it's normal. What you have to do to overcome it is find one thing you're good at - and do it. Play a sport, play an instrument, get out and hang out with people. You are always going to feel stupid and mad at yourself at one time or another, but you have to find a hobby and get out. Then, you will get your mind off of it.

The problem with low self esteem, if it's a life-long condition, is it causes you to make bad decisions because you don't think you can do any better. Healthy self esteem is knowing you are someone of value and deserving of the best, not settling for whatever you can get.



Everyone has low moments in life but you can't let them define who you are.

the way we look at ourselves stems from our experiences and on how we interpret those experiences.



having a low self-esteem is normal if the person experiences things that can cause him to see those things as self-degrading. in this case, if the person feels degraded (for example) most of the time then he is likely to develop low self-esteem.



feedbacks about ourselves from people (parents and teachers, for example) around us surely have great effects on how we see ourselves.

To dream that you are pregnant, symbolizes an aspect of yourself or some aspect of your personal life that is growing and developing. You may not be ready to talk about it or act on it.  This may also represent the birth of a new idea, direction, project or goal.



To dream of giving birth or see someone else giving birth, suggests that you are giving birth to a new idea or project. It also represents a new attitude, fresh beginnings or a major  upcoming event.  Alternatively, the dream may be calling attention to your inner child and the potential for your to grow. A more direct interpretation of this dream, may represent your desires/ anxieties of giving birth or the anticipation for such an event to occur.



To dream that you or others are adopting a child, indicates that you are taking on something new and different. Ask yourself what is missing in your life that would make you happy.

Please Help, I really need some Motivation!?



Please help, Over the past few months or so I have had this feeling in side of me that takes a big grip on me.



When ever I have a goal or a task I'd really love to accomplish, my brain feels suddenly frozen and I feel as if I'd never be able to accomplish it. I know that's not true and just my negative reminiscence speaking, I just can't seem to stop being felt frozen and to be feeling like I dont want to get off the couch and actually accomplish that goal/dream!.



Would it be a rather coincidence if it had anything to do with depression, lately I've been struggling alot with depression and social anxiety. I just thought it was a bit of a reclusive stage, though is it possible that depression is the reason to this?



I am only 15 and I would say I've been a bit of a mass depressor at the moment, though I'm not taking meds as I don't believe they'd have a better outcome.



thank you and take care

I don't think that smoking gives you any pleasure whatsoever. But I'm not all that sure because I don't smoke. As far as I know, people start smoking



because their friends might smoke and it's mostly the habit of holding the cigarette between two fingers and puffing out smoke. Also I noticed that whenever some people get frustrated or angry they feel that a cigarette is their comfort.

I am really depressed and on the verge of cutting again?



My dad is literally in charge of me and my boyfriends relationship. We can't even kiss. I'm really upset. He follows us on our dates and we can't get any privacy. He told me that if I kiss my boyfriend, he will end our relationship. What should I do? I feel like I can't control anything that's going on. I used to cut and my dad has told me not to. But I want to feel like I control one tiny aspect of my life.

That's really terrible I'm sorry to hear that your dad is that controlling over your life. :( I don't know your situation entirely, but you don't have to resort to cutting. A little bit of rebellion wouldn't hurt. Show him that you're your own person and you make your decisions and its your life. If your dad is really that bad maybe you should seek professional help. Sorry I can't be of much help, I hope it works out for you.

I use Yahoo answers.  I also use reading, talking to others I care about or am close to, doing special things for myself like shopping, keeping busy, working. journaling, thinking of questions on here and reading it, the Internet, planning my next day, working through it, going to the bookstore, driving, listening t the radio, doing a variety of things, music, a hot bath, writing, walks, whirlpool, exercise, drawing, anything to relieve the stress of it all, and you know, it does often depend on what the emptiness is from, but I also try to figure that out if it is not evident, also I use learning new things and oh, so much more.

I've found that Faith in God has filled the void for me. I remember i felt so alone and empty. I was at a neighbours place having coffee when his kid invited me to church it was a united pentecostal church. At first I taught they were all a bit nuts but the more I went the better I felt. I was struggling with my belief in no God and evolution and all that and then I was introduced to a book by Biochemist Michael Behe called DARWIN'S BLACK BOX  after carefully reading this I found that science dose not support evolution, many biological systems are "irreducibly complex", and Darwin himself admitted that if this was found then his theory of origins would absolutely fall apart. Even the most avid Atheistic Scientist  British biologist Richard Dawkins the very author of God Delusion admits that their has never been any tangible evidence of evolution and when Questioned by Ben Stein admits that the world could have come about by Intelligent process but remains insistent that it is not he God of the bible just because that is what he believes and for no other reason. So for this reason I am convinced True fulfilment in life is truly found within the pages of the Bible. enjoy the links.

Friends, family, fun movies, books, my religion, and sugar....it all depends on my mood, where I am, what's bothering me, and what's available.



All in all, there are those times that I feel like I am empty, but the best way I can think of right now to fill in the "emptiness" would be to find happiness within yourself.  It works the best for me...just staying busy and always finding a silver lining makes things seem more whole.

<question>



What's the proper way to respond & assert myself when someone tries to physically FORCE their opinions on me?



I'm 25 & have a college degree. Family or not, people always try to shove their opinions down my throat & try to control, manipulate, boss me around, tell me how to live my life, & they'll try to physically STOP me from doing what makes me content. If listening to a song I like makes me happy, why do people try to make it like I'm wrong for it? I have noise-cancelling headphones, & no one can hear my music. Even the SIMPLEST choices in my life, people try to stop me from doing it.



This frustrates me, & I feel defenseless & unable to stand up for myself, out of fear of the situation escalating. Here's an example:



Brother asks, "What are you listening to?" & I don't say, so he JERKS my CD player out of my hand & sees what album I'm playing, & then asks, "What I told u about listenin' 2 this? Huh!? Huh!?" & then smash & break my CD.



No one wants me to further my education, get married, have kids, make a family, get a job, etc. They want me to stay disabled & depend on THEM for the rest of my life, so they can feel more empowered. When I do things independently, they get upset, & they figure they need to monitor or observe me do certain things, & they treat me like a child, or even worse. They treat me like scum is worth more than me.



& those SAME people-family or not, tell me TO MY FACE that they don't give a DAMN about me!



Why can't I be free? Why don't people leave me the hell alone? & mental health case managers tell me I shouldn't stay locked up in my apt all day, every day. But I can't even leave my house without confrontation or someone harassing me.



How do I deal with this? I feel useless, hopeless, worthless, etc. I feel like I don't have any confidence or abilities. I feel like a nobody. People treat me like I don't have a right to live natural human life.



I suffer OCD, anxiety, Tourette's, & depression, & I had 2 strokes @ age 5. But I've accomplished quite a bit to have a disability & graduate high school with Honors (top 10%) & graduate college. People don't understand the symptoms of my disorders, & they just label me as crazy, & they treat me like a child They treat me like I'm too stupid to know left from right. I have to question the morality, logic, & coherence of everything I do, say, think, or feel.



Please give me some advice.

When people tell you what to do, simply smile and walk away.  You owe no one an explanation for your actions.  Just be yourself and listen to what others have to say, keep what you want and leave the rest.
It's really quite simple.

Do they try to harm you ? i hope no . But in this problem you have to tell your close friend if you have. Try to find your brave friend or lecturer that can talk with your parent. You couldn't do by your self. There will be something occured in your mental if you keep thinking. Here you have feel bad in your self and try to escap. So my advised your need other parties to help you.I almost cry read your question.. Keep strong and only God have a reason make you face it.

Best I can tell you, learn not to care, you'd be surprised just how freeing apathy can be. How you react to people is a choice you make. Why do you choose to give them the power (ability) to affect you on any level? As long as you allow them to affect you, the longer they will keep at you.



If you're happy with who and what you are, ignore them and get on with your life. Either that, or say something so totally offensive their ears will fall off (chances are, they will actually choose to be offended, most people that are that opinionated, that they believe their way is the best way for everyone, actually choose to give others the power to offend them. It can actually be quite amusing and usually very easy to do.). They (say they) do it because they "care" about you, when it's really all about them and being comfortable with you. And they can't be comfortable with you unless you are somewhat, if not completely, like them. Don't allow them to affect you...it's all a simple choice. The other option is patronize them, be so obviously condescending that they don't want to hazard speaking to you.



These methods have worked for me in the past, I have others, but these have rarely failed me.



But don't try any of them because I say so...they're only suggestions for you to consider...

Trying to give advice to who wants to commit suicide?



Ok so I am currently talking to someone online and I am trying to give them advice and stuff but I am at a lost for words at the moment. Here is their problem below



I have tried committing suicide before but the police found me before I was fully gone and brought me back. Im not writing this email because Im trying to stop myself because if I really want to again I will do it regardless of what Im told, but sometimes its harder than others not to do it. I have been taking care of my very ill father since I was 10 years old and a few months ago he finally passed away. I am now 18 years old and the grief is unbearable some nights. After he passed away the rest of my family seperated and no longer wants to speak to me and I have to work 5 days a week to pay my rent, plus I am still in high school. My friends have left for University and I hope to join them next year but nights like tonight make me feel like that day is never coming and Im so stressed all the time but can not do anything about it. I have to work as much as I do or I will not be able to afford rent and groceries and I have to attend school because I will not get into university if I dont attend. I have no friends or family left where I live and I have tried to talk to people that can help but it always makes me feel worse. Im just not sure what to do anymore because nothing I try is working and I feel like life just isnt worth living and even when I dont believe I will try it again I always have the want in the back of my head and it drives me insane.



CAN ANYONE HELP ME WITH ADVICE I CAN GIVE THEM

<additional details>



From the comments it sounds like some of you are thinking I am thinking about killing myself, which I am not...



I have given them the number to hotlines they say their school counselor has already tried that and the hotlines did not help them at all



Here's the situation the father was keeping everyone together. His mother and brother really did not help with the care of his father. Once his father died his mother said he was a mistake and she left, his brother said they were too different to stay in contact so he left.



I currently live in the US; he lives in Canada. (i've never met this kid in real life; I just happened to come across this while online)



But I am in the process to see if maybe I could get the funds together to go to Canada maybe the week of thanksgiving or see if I could fly them down where I live....Maybe it will give him something to look fwd too and thanksgiving is a terrible time to be alone (esp. in his situation)

okay idk it my answer is going to that diff from the others, but i myself have gone through things like this and still have that feeling of no self worth.



the more he stays busy the better, ask him if he has any other kids in high school that he could pal around with, or make new friends there?
by the way you are already helping him by just talking to him. some times if your just someones friend it is enough. he is someone he can talk to connect with make it through the day.
as for hotlines don't really work he could try sites on the web. you could do research and find some. unfortunately hotlines are usually a recording or they are ppl like you and me that don't have any real backgrounds to help.



keep reminding him of all the good things in his life. such as: work, high school, college, clothes, roof over his head, food on the table, he gets enjoy the beautiful weather, see ranibows, flower opening up, birds singing, and Earth. even though there is a lot of hate and destruction in the world., there is still a lot of good in the world. then talk about how good of person he is and what he brings to the world.
such as: he goes to work and does his job well (find out what he does first that would make this statement easier). make a scenerio if there was a puppy that needed some help would you help it. if he says yes than say see you are a good person and life w/o you would be unbearable.



if his family disowned him then so what, yes it is hard but that is there choice not have good in there life. he did a wonderful thing by caring for his ill father. i'm not much for religion myself, but if he believes in it pressure him to go to church. if he is not religious i would say walk around in a park and take in all the beauty, walk around your neighborhood look at all the different ppl, look at life as a whole not just what goes on his life.



it is very hard and overwhelming to live life by yourself at such a young age but he has made it this far and he will be able to longer. he has to so he can see all his friends in college again, and he has you his new online friend to chew that fat with.



i hope this helps, have a good day and your doing a good thing!

that's not for you, me, or anyone else untrained to handle



you need to notify someone who is trained or can find someone who is to take care of that



give them  1-800- SUICIDE or 1-800-273-TALK also



besides that, just be a good listener, a friend, like you probably have been. but SAY SOMETHING! trust me, you don't want to end up not being able to help and then blaming yourself if this person goes through with it...

I can see this person really needs help I mean big help.I think this person really need a friend more than anything now.That person is so young to have to go trough all this .What is wrong with the family not wanting to help? I think this person need to find somebody that he can stay with or help to pay the rent like half. At this point he doesnt have  choice try to put the shame away and talk to people at school. Like teacher or an adult that can be trust the most. Maybe they might refering an organization to help him with food . But just let him know that alot of people outhere who are in  the same boat as him.Life is hard you know.The world doesnt owe u dime u have to fight for it. And tell him to go to church am sure somebody will help him if he open his mouth to ask for help and  this the time for him to turn to God. Trust me.

That's a big problem but I'll tell you what I experience with people who tried to do the same thing and the advice given to them.



Life is a very precious thing it's too short most people make the most of it while they still have it so you shouldn't really waste it cause it's a gift we are just strangers and just like your father passed away it's because our life is only borrowed from god and we must return to him when the time is right you have to make the most of it happy,,joyful, glad.
Your problems don't bring the end of the world for you
you still have a future and good life ahead you are too concerned of what's what and what will be there's a saying yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift that's why it is called the present.



your life is worth living if you were not worth it then your parents would have thrown you in a trash can or on the river after you were born
sorry if I have offended you with that but it's true that's what my mother would always say to me
don't give up when you feel that nothing you do is working because you're a ***** when what you plan doesn't work just say it's just a try it's nothing just don't give to reach your goals you are worth to live in this world there is more good in it than bad it's not the end never give up in striding against the odds of problems evil and downsides for your life is worth!



This may not be the best answer but I hope that I helped.
GOODLUCK! ^_^

i think you need to give him little money, you know, like some social assistance, it's a must, he can't do well in school otherwise, it's beyond human to have to work full time and attend school full time. imagine for it yourself.
try get some burseries, look up government resources for fundings this person will die, otherwise. Rich ppl want to donate to someone like this, but often don't know anyone personally. So if all fails,I would suggest asking for help in this time of need for someone to pay/ loan (intrest-free) to this teenager.



2. try to look for cheaper rent.



3. MUST Insist him to go to councelling at school.They'll help, even give some money as scholarship.
4. get him to talk to other ppl.



5. suggest easygoing, not stressing out to death.



Life is meant to be fun, and if u think that day is not coming then it may never, so BELIEVE that it is this day, Today!

As a psychology major, I agree you should notify someone trained that can help. The suicide hotline (number given by the first answerer) is also good if the person wants to talk.
I will also say this: Don't say anything negative about it. Statements like "You're not thinking of killing yourself, are you?" and "Why would you want to do that?" are not good. It promotes a negative tone, which isn't a good thing when someone is considering suicide. I noticed they also said they're not writing the e-mail because they're trying to stop themselves. Something tells me that's not true. If someone truly wants to kill themselves, they're not likely to tell other people about it.

If you really want to commit suicide, set a date at least three months away. If in those three months you never have any doubts, then find a safe, effective way to end your life and do it.



It's you're life and you have the right to end it, but make sure you're not doing it because of a bad week. Death is permanent so make sure you're not making a rash decision.

You might like to think of it this way. There is Research Psychology and Applied Psychology. The research approaches are built upon assumptions about how we get to know things (epistemology) and typically much psychological research is based on a positivist approach that seeks hard facts about peoples behaviour. Commonly this is called the scientific approach. Alternative approaches include 'interpretative' approaches that enquire about people's meaning making. You will be unable to study psychology without some appreciation of the research that has been conducted and the theories that have resulted from that research.



There are also several 'flavours' of psychology - behaviorism (a bit passe now) focussing only on observed behaviour and things like conditioned learning, there is cognitive psychology which explores how the mind makes sense of the world, their is social psychology exploring the workings of relationships between people and groups.



Applied psychology draws from the Theoretical research and 'applies' it to a particular context. So psychology can be applied to mental health, extreme cases such as trauma, depression, psychosis ranging from extreme mental health work through to counselling, it can be applied to organisational life in areas like coaching and mentoring, it can apply to work such as negotiation, advertising, selling and so on, even pet psychology. Specific applications of psychology can be followed such Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).Transactional Analysis, Cognitive Affective Therapy (CAT) etc.



My suggestion would be have an idea of the context you would like to work. Theory development is very academic, the applied stuff relates to jobs.



I believe psychological understanding is very much worth it as it relates to how people learn and change, their motivations, their sense making, and how we socially influence. There is much written about attitudes, attitude change, persuasion, and resistance to persuasion too. So even working for a political party or a charity involves psychology

Without science there would be no theories.  There would only be numerous hypothesis.
Psychology is a very interesting profession but you have to decide what you want to do with it.  From a clinical aspect you don't have to deal with the science side of psychology but you do have to know and understand that part of it.  You can't just pick a theory and treat clients; you have to know the scientific details of what that theory means.  It would be like building a house without a foundation.
Start with your general psychology classes and proceed from there.

Just remember that it is more helpful to others if you remain strong and confident with your abilities. Don't worry if you make a mistake, only worry if you don't care about hurting others. I don't think you have anything to worry about. It could be from low self-esteem, if you feel uncomfortable with it then you should speak with your physician.

I think it's really not about pleasing others as it is just having high expectations of yourself. It could be a sign of low self esteem. try not to be so hard on yourself. Realize that not everyone in this messed up world is PERFECT!! No one is perfect. Are some people better at things then others??&gt;&gt;&gt;YES&gt;&gt;&gt; so find what your special at and focus on that. You can't be good at everything.

If you question the fact that you may be trying to please others and have low self esteem, it is most certainly true.  Trying to please others is a very difficult habit to break..and I have no advice there...sorry.



Try to make a list of all the things you've done well, dont write where you've screwed up.  Just write a list of all the things you've done well in your life, and compliment yourself.  Read it 20 times.  do this now, and each time you read it, pray for confidence in yourself.  It may just work, and if it doesn't which is likely also, don't get upset.  Sometimes God puts us thru these long periods of not getting what we want so we can later be much better.  instant gratification is a hard thing to be exposerd to and then deprived of.  Just know, I am going thru a HUGE self esteem faze, that and anxieties in social situations.  It is something many people face.  Focus on your talents.  Thank god you still have those.

Is it a matter of opinion or fact?



that rape victims NEVER get over their rape? No matter how much therapy counseling they go through.  No matter how many years past.



That's pretty depressing.



I disagree.  So is this a matter of opinion or cold hard fact?

this is just a matter of opinion..
many people have been over it.. especially if they won the case and were done justice or are happily married and the husband knows about it and has accepted her that way...



even the famous star oprah has been over it.. and another famous star has been over all of her date rapes when she was too naive to refuse!
people tend to get over it.. many do...  they start a new life... though it may take years for them to recover but they eventually do...

I think it is best not to stereotype about the recovery from a traumatic experience. Correct me if I am wrong, but when you state "I disagree" you are stating that the person shouldn't let that act run their life. People often get confused with the wording. I don't believe in rushing people, but I agree that all victims of rape should continue to have hope at recovering from the crime.

It's a cold hard fact only to the person who has experienced the rape. If they have gone on with their lives and never reliving the rape and they are fine, then it's a fact. If they haven't ever gotten past the rape, then thats a fact too. Depends on the person. And what their experience has been.

Ok I've never been raped, but I believe it would be like anything traumatic that happens to you, like a death in the family for example, in the sense that the memory will never go away, and it will change your life. Yet over time, the memory will not be so overwhelming, but become just part of your life story. Hopefully if you get good counselling and support, the healing process will give you deeper insights.  I have no doubt it's possible to be happy again, in time. Human beings can be extremely resilient. When people never seem to recover from traumatic events, it's usually because they block their recovery with other things like alcohol.

How can I improve my Speech/ The way I talk???? Please help.?



I've been noticing the reason why some people don't take me seriously whatsoever, its because of the way I talk! First and foremost, I am Tall, very Attractive, Smart, Intelligent, Positive person, I have a unique personality. BUT For as long as I can remember people never take me seriously and some people actually think i'm slow, dumb, incompetent or mentally crazy!!!!!! This really has gotten to my head and honestly my self esteem has gone down, I find myself questioning my own intelligence and my own self worth. I think people around me look at me this way because when I talk i sound "slow" and sound almost childish and naive, as if I'm new in this world. I think when I talk I sound childish and extremely naive, WHEN I'M NOT. When i speak I sometimes don't speak clearly, sometimes stutter (not badly). This is something I myself have recently noticed, no one has told me this. This is something that came to my awareness a couple months ago. I have noticed that when I do talk as clearly as i possibly can and speak with a loud crisp tone people treat me differently, as if they look at me in a different manner. Is there any way I can improve and strengthen my speech??? Speak with authority and confidence and not sound slow or mentally incompetent. (by the way do any of you think I'm mentally incompetent by reading this??, answer honestly) Thanks.



</question>



<additional details>



When I say childish and naive I mean the way I speak my words. This has nothing to do with my personality but with the way I speak my words.



This has nothing to do with my intelligence at all. I have a vocabulary for days. lol. It has to do with the way I speak and how I sound when I speak.



I sound mentally incompetent or "slow" when I speak.

I am confused.  You describe yourself glowingly and with great aplomb.. yet you are concerned about how you "sound"...?????
A little non-cohesive I'd say...
However, my Mom used to do this when I was a kid, and it's something I keep up to this day with friends and co-workers...learn a new word a week...(write it down on an index card)...by the end of the week, you should have made  this word part of your regular vocabulary.
This will increase your "appearance" of intelligence which seems to be important to you...next, I would employ a speech therapist to address any issues about how you "sound" and work on helping you to project the image you desire...how you "sound" to others is beyond the scope of help here, since we cannot "hear" you...

I think that what your counselor did is very special. How sweet to extend herself to you this way.  She obviously feels you are trustworthy to do that. I doubt that many would do that but there are many of us available to folk like you here too.



If I may help you with one line - you mentioned you can contact her when you get stressed and down.  When those times come refuse to get into a negative place.  You see I call that place the pit of negativity, self-pity and deception.  Always bear in mind that negative draws more negative to it, so when one goes in that direction, you are opening yourself to more negative things. Take for example hurt.  Someone says something that hurts you, so you either let it go due to the circumstance that promoted the action or you entertain it and next comes anger...how dare they!  Then comes remorse because you think about what was said and it upsets you and you start doubting yourself (doubt is next) and so the things get worse and worse until you go into a decline and want to commit suicide because of one stupid remark.  Do you see how the mountain begins to build itself until it is all that you see and blocks you from progress. So, always consider what you are going to do with your hurt or anything negative thrown your way. You are the only one who can choose. Immaturity always chooses negative, but maturity makes you stop and think and choose the right thing. Everything in life is about the choices we make and no one can be blamed for you making those choices but you.  The good news is that even if you have erred, there is always a way out. We just have to bear in mind that every choice has a consequence.  We only have one life and one huge race of time to run.  If I can encourage you to include God in that race, you wont regret it.  God roots for you all the way.  If you fall he picks you up .  If the road gets tough, God carries you and when he gets to where the road is smooth again he gives you the strength to carry on. When you reach the goal posts he is waiting for you with his arms open wide ready to catch you and say: "Well done my angel, I knew you would make it!" Take care and be happy for all the help you are getting from your therapist.  Shes making time for you and that is really special.

i never knew that such a thing existed. i must tell this to my psychology teacher who is also a counsellor. its a great thing to do.



though a common practice of many counsellors is to advise their patients to right down their thoughts in a diary or tape record it.



this goes a step forward.

YES! but i also found out it has something to do with how ou view yourself. Some could say a conceited person loves being watched because they feel others envy them, some say others dont mind being watched because they have nothing to hide. I just dont like it because i always worry I have something in my teeth/nose or someone is staring at a pimple or wondering "who te heck does THAT girl think she is!" but as i female i think i naturally sweat judgement. But now I have a job that kinda requires me to be the center of attention, but in a conservative way:) so i think its helping me get over my phobia

being as euthanasia is illegal, most of the cases i have heard about are on tv reality? shows like a&e and tru tv., but if the person who is ill makes peace with God, i can't see prolonging life that never is gonna improve. I had to do this with my dad a few years ago. he was unresponsive one morning in a nursing home where he was recovering from a fall. we had him transfered to the hospital all my brothers and sister were able to tell him how much they loved and admired him. late that night they had him in a pre death room where they said he was being given morphine and would i want to increase the flow rate? after some soul searching i said to raise it as i was the oldest son. anyway he passed about 15 minutes later and i could feel and sense that my siblings were already thinking of blaming me for what i chose . . anyway they don't talk to me much anymore but that's ok by me because i was able to get dad to reconsile with God after being mad at Him for a long time. so yeah it was all the above i felt on the drive home

Euthanasia shouldn't ever be advertised. It doesn't help the elderly to see other elderly people resorting to the most desperate measures. It is a poor example all around for the people who look forward to living comfortable senior years; many people look forward to retiring sometime in the future. In my opinion, it is a shame on the family to not take care of their parents(I know I am going a little off-topic, but it is important). A nurse(or doctor) should never be the one who has to decide whether to euthanize someone.

LOTS of exercise. Don't listen to, read or watch anything suggestive.

Unfortunately, masturbation is a very good way to take care of those sexual urges.  But since your religion forbids it, I would say that exercise is good.  Make sure you get some cardio in there.  If you don't focus on the idea of having sex then that helps, too.



Good luck!  This seems like a tough predicament to be in.

Other answers have suggested work or exercise. Those seem reasonable suggestions. Perhaps studying in depth a subject that interests you could also be useful. An education is always an advantage.



As for your concerns about something being wrong with you, it is perfectly normal and healthy to have sexual urges, and I would be wary of taking any substances in an attempt to supress them. How you act on any urge (sexual or otherwise) is your choice, and your personal beliefs can guide you.

Ouch hard subject.



Exercise is one good way to start. If you are tired enough you will not have the desire.  Next avoid sexual situations, movies, TV, books. Keep your mind away from the subject as best as you can.



If you are dating watch the roaming hands. While they might feel good you can quickly get carried away. And as strange as this sounds always keep your underwear on. If those come off it should sound alarm bells.  Basically if one or both of you still have your underwear on you've got one last barrier before sex that should help you to stop.



Masturbation (as one person mentioned) will reduce your sexual drive for a time but it is like a drug, you'll need to do it more often to reduce the urge.



As for waiting it is a good thing to due. I made the mistake of not waiting.  I met a girl in college and I thought she was the girl I was going to spend the rest of my life with. Things got carried away one night and we both stopped before all of the closes were off.  Unfortunately we kept pushing the boundaries until one of us was naked, then both, then the sex.



Long story short she was not the girl for me and we broke up about 4 months later.  When I did met the girl of my dreams (which I did marry) my x-girlfriend attempted to ruin it by telling my fiance that we had had sex.  It just about destroyed my relationship with my fiance and cost me the woman of my dreams.



Wait until you are married because you can only give away your virginity once. If you give it to the wrong person you can't ask for it back and it can destroy the relationship that you really want.



Some people also wear a promise ring. This is to remind them that they are waiting until they are married for sex. It is another physical reminder to wait and why they are waiting. So, create reminders to remind you to wait.

When we were first dating, my boyfriend worked nights and I was in school during the day, AND I worked weekends, so we didn't get as much 'face time' as I would've liked.  It was my first year of university, and I found the entire year really stressful.  I felt depressed and anxious a lot of the time, and my emotions were difficult to control.



Let me see...  My boyfriend eventually became my husband, so obviously we got through it.. ;-)  I think what helped me the most was staying in touch with my boyfriend through e-mail, and staying active in the other relationships in my life with family members and friends.  I also talked to a counselor a few times (I was covered through my part-time job) and that helped, too.  On days when I was feeling especially low, I avoided things that made me feel worse (for me it was being alone) and tried to keep my thoughts (and self-talk) positive.



Being busy also helped.  Feeling like I was contributing to something or accomplishing something did wonders to get my mind off of missing him, and helped me to feel better.

You have to find something to keep you occupied, something that can steer your attention.  Find a great job, or volunteer, I don't know if you are in school or not, but find your own niche.



One answerer was right that going out with friends is a great way to brighten your mood, reading a good book, etc.



Missing your boyfriend is normal, but do not let him define who you are.  Because he is taking care of his business and staying focused, you have to do your own thing too!

Yes, I think you are most definitely on to something here.



If you truly find it within yourself to love those who hate you, nothing they can do will have the same effect. If you believe in the afterlife, this even includes those who kill us. They may destroy your body, but you rob them of the power to defeat your soul.

"Love" and "hate" are feelings, and as such are (1) chosen, and (2) supported by thoughts. Neither is a "thing" in itself, separate from the lover or hater. Neither has any "power" in the sense of ability to do anything or change anything.



It may be nice and poetic to think of feelings as actual things, like a rock or a banana. And I know that, in the '60s, it was common in "sensitivity training" circles to speak of "feelings as facts," but the fact is they are chosen, they are passing, and they can be changed in the blink of an eye.



We say we "fall in love" or that "love lasts forever," but as we know from observing real life, we also "fall out of love" and know that love does NOT last...hence, we get married and then divorced, etc.

Am currently on a waiting list for grouptherapy at a place called St Andrews and am on incapacity until I have begun and completed the work involved. I have been on the waiting list for 10mths and am desperate to begin this work. I really want to know if there is anywhere else in York that could offer me an immediate start either one to one or group. I also approached the Tuke centre at the retreat which isnt NHS and was paying 6pound a time to spend an hour a week which the therapist said will b reduced not totally sure why but he expressed concern that I should do intensive therapy. My family and friends don't think I am disturbed and most people couldn't see anything wrong with me but I know I need it as does my therapist. Any help would be greatly appreciated. After all this time am very eager to do the work just need some place to do it!!

The only other place I can think of in York is The Old Chapel or Bootham Park hospital. However, I also know they were also overbooked and had a long waiting list, but it might be worth trying.

Is my life going in the right direction?



Some people say that I should be less cold, more spontaneous, etc...and maybe I should be...and less concerned about prestige, progress. ... and maybe i should be...but so far i don't see a path to be that way.  sure, i wish i had more close friends and wish my relationships went better, but is it better to be a failure than be alone?  sure, it's lonely on the top, but at least you can look down on everyone else!!



well, i don't really mean that.  i wish i could change that.



Pros:
-good-looking, athletic, free of debt (for now)
-graduated from good college with 3.2gpa
-working for nasa in my mid-20s
-starting masters program



Cons
-not a whole lot of close friends, could use a girlfriend (but not lacking one-night stands)
-low undergrad GPA might hurt future chance at PhD
-not the best human being (narcissistic, arrogant, dishonest)
-might decide to join the military in 3 years or so.

what work do you do?/ how do you cope with it.
Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



but don't all jobs require adapting to busy environment/multitasking...?
also I personally have problems with loosing focus and attention very easily if the task is not amazingly interesting (most tasks aren't)



there where two questions:
"what work do you do (as in: what job do you have)? and how do you cope with this job in the context of having ADD?"

From my understanding, people with ADD are no less qualified for most jobs than anyone else. The main suggestion I recommend is avoiding jobs which require a lot of multitasking or which have loud and/or busy environments.

In my country November 11 is "Remembrance Day." I remember my grandfather and all the suffering he and his friends went through just so that I could be what I am. I couldn't help myself, but I found myself crying for all those people that sacrificed their lives so that the rest of us could enjoy the freedoms that we have. I don't want to sound corny, but when I think of what those people did for me I start to think that there isn't enough for us to do to show our appreciation.



And you know what is the best thing about it is? I have never ONCE heard any of those people complain. Not ONCE. So I guess that they've learned a little bit about life. I've learned enough to realize that shedding a tear for those who didn't come back is the best way to honour them.



It makes me sad that in this day and age people still have to give their lives for an ideal that everyone accepted many years ago. We just haven't got it right yet...

Help me resolve my crisis...?



Im so scared. I love my boyfriend more than my life, but Im afraid one major difference we have will be a great obstacle. Im very intellectual, and need to talk about my ideas and feelings a lot or i will feel unhappy. Hes totally rational and calculated, and only talks about facts, and has no real emotions, or philosophical/intellectual thoughts. Im afraid that I will be unhappy for that. On the other hand im too intellectual, that Im becoming a daydreamer, and being like I am will not get me anywhere in my life. I hate that attribute of mine, and WANT to change it, and Im really uncomfortable with it. I need to start doing more instead of just talking. Now Im having serious anxiety attacks because im really confused. Were both 21. Together for over 2.5 yrs..

Ask yourself what started your anxiety in the first place. Are you different now than you were 2.5 years ago? Is he? If yes, what changed and why? Change isn't always bad - don't force it and don't fight it.
If you two haven't changed, then I'm guessing there was an event that made you think about this, or a series of events. Think about what it was and try and deal with that specific issue, rather than reanalyzing your entire relationship. Hope this helps.

This may sound harsh, and it may be hard, but if he does not appreciate who you are and what you are as a person, maybe he just isn't the right guy for you. You should talk to him about your feelings and ideas, it's the way of a healthy relationship. If you're unhappy you NEED to talk to him, or I guarantee your relationship will change from bad to worse.



Being intellectual is a good attribute, don't let that get to you. Don't change who you are, you are beautiful just the way you are. I don't understand the details, but I'm sure that's why your boyfriend chose you in the first place, because you were smart and caring, and sensitive.



And most of all, daydreaming is not bad. It's how we focus on our goals and fantasies. About the anxiety attacks, if you ever feel them coming, just stop whatever you're doing, talking or whatever, take a deep breath, and calm down. Close your eyes and just take a deep breath. It'll work. If not, drink some fluids (water is the best) to calm it down.



I hope it helped. :D

I believe that if you get some air, or some perspective by stepping back and watching your life. Don't get stressed, relax, breath and think about your life at the moment. Ask yourself, what do you want? What don't you want out of your life? Are you studying, are you working? Do you enjoy these things.



Everyone is different, that's maybe you are with your guy as you are different and so is but together the picture is complete. We are all going to have differences, its about how work together. But it is good that you are questioning if you can be with him because of that point of difference. If this difference is really bothering you then you have to either see past this difference and keep going or stop and really think if you want to be with him, if this difference really bothers you.



Your attribute of being an intellectual daydreamer is a good thing. Means you are creative, you are thinking of deeper things....these are all excellent things. Try and put these things to good use. You are still young at 21 and that is good that you want to start 'doing' more than talking. Being aware of this, like you are, is a good thing because you will be more aware of taking action more. Don't be confused, just slow down, write down things that mean a lot to you and what you would like to accomplish, even if it is the smallest thing. Write it down and start doing. Life is for living so keep going. Good luck.

maybe you picked each other for what you have that is 'different' and missing in your own life.
If your'e anxious see a counsellor to try to shine a light on what is happening here - or get couples counselling to sort out.



I have dreamy thinking too - but have other friends who give me what I want in this department my partner and I share love not necessarily our creative/logical processes.



See if you can get some of your needs met elsewhere - its healthy for a relationship to not put too much onto it but juts enjoy what is there.

Never love ANYONE more that you love yourself, that is your first mistake, and maybe once you start loving yourself and putting yourself first, all other things will fall into place.
Secondly, relationships are about compromise, your BF is not perfect as much as you are not perfect, Im sure there are other aspects in your relationship where you compliment one another, find those and make those work fore you.and get yourself a friend who is intellectually compatible that you can share you aspirations with.

Your cousin should never ignore his father. He should listen carefully to whatever his father says, and so try and be more thoughtful or brightly reflective about the admonitions from his own father.



His father may be all too concerned about the doings and the learnings and the future of his own off-spring, this cousin of yours.



By asking his son to go and study, the father may mean that your cousin should try and be more diligent, more carefully dedicated about whatever learning assignments there may be.



To study, and to study well, may be a proud working at building up some good glowing memories for the future.



Allow me to wish you and your cousin more chances of great laughs in your life and in your studies.

Yes and no. Losing my brother in a drowning accident and then losing my health to a skull fracture a few years later, means my health and happiness quotient has dropped, not to mention my income. I have no living relatives and I'm not healthy enough to support a family. I live like a pauper when I'm used to much better. A good education and life experiences doesn't guarantee a comfortable retirement. I'm looking forward to being reunited with my family in a few decades. I'm too young to be put out to pasture!

Do I have Multiple Personality Disorder?



A lot recently, I've been having blackouts. People will come to talk to me about things I have no recollection of, and people will ask me if I'm in "a better mood" than yesterday. I will have no idea what they're talking about and I'm so scared.



I'll find myself somewhere with no idea how I got there, or I'll "wake up" to find myself doing something I would never do, eg. Writing something nasty or saying something rude.



Recently I was told that someone has been sending a teacher of mine personal information about me. But then they said they think it was me because the person sending the emails knew too much about me.



I used to email this teacher until recently, and then I broke off contact. I had no idea what they were talking about.



Usually, the last thing I can remember before a blackout is either a) a thud in my head, like someones hit me, b) an extremely sharp pain somewhere in my head, or sometimes I'll get a huge wave of pain in my head. Sometimes I'll just black out.



I think I have multiple personality disorder, and I don't know what to do. Please help!

We have about two aspects of "normal" life, one of immediate almost no directly perceptible change, and another one of a deferred change giving dreams of perpetuity. But changes are ever urging. But we are not sure of what we will be changed into or be ending like. We have glowing hopes, intuitions.

Of course it's normal! Those who would disagree either believe they have nothing to change or they are in denial about who they are and who others are.



The person I am today is not the same person I was last week, and definitely not the same person I was last year. The only thing that stays the same is the list of people I truly love. It can grow, but it never does get lower. You think you love someone today, but next year you realize it wasn't real. When it's real, you always remember the people. Even if your's old and dying.

Yes. Your experiences shape you as a person into who you are, so yes, you would change.



Also, obviously, changes in your life can change how you are - you might meet a new person and fall in love, you might be much happier, you might go through hardships, become more mature, or maybe you just like marmite now.



Short answer; yes.

<question>



What kind of disorder do I have?



I'm not sure. I feel I have a little bit of everything.



-I can barely eat or relax my mind, just by simply not knowing who won best supporting actress the year of 1996.
-I have to remind myself over and over that I've seen a movie, even if I had seen it 100 times
-I set my alarm clock at 4 in the morning on school days, and I reset it ten minutes later every time it goes off until about 7.  On the weekends, I don't care I just sleep in till late.



-Whenever I'm hyper I try to organize the letters of any word I think about mentally on a wall
-I can remember most of the days in the past few years, give me a date and I'll tell you what I did on that day
-I have to check at least five times if I had put something in the mail, if not more, I always have to check everything multiple times



-One hour I can feel like the worst person on the world, so guilty, so depressed, so unwilling to enjoy life and wondering why I'm even on this planet and listen to a song that reflects this mood, and the next hour I can feel like the best person on earth, so happy and jumping up and down to a song I like even hyper (this happens multiple times during the day)
-I always count down the days and cannot stop thinking about the past, I am unwilling to accept the fact that any day in my past life is wasted and that I will make each following day perfect, I will be the best human being ever, then I find out this is never the case
-I feel that it is difficult for me to identify any human being as a friend, even with those I've hung out with for ten years,  I feel that it would be impossible for anyone to identify me as their friend.  I have a very difficult time separating friend and acquaintance
-I feel as if I don't have a natural right to be respected, as if I am a bad person, even though I can relate to a lot of other people with similar problems, I feel in some way I always have an exception, therefore unsure if I really deserve to be treated well
-I feel as if I am responsible for everything and am concerned highly about what others think, I am always worried if my friends or "friends" will discontinue their relationship with me if I said something wrong or what not



These are only some of them.  I'm just wondering if anyone have some of the same ideas, cause I feel I have every disorder in the book.

I think you may have OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) and probably some general anxiety as well. There is medicine that can help this, and it will improve your quality of life dramatically. but make sure you schedule an appo. with a psychiatrist, avoid family practitioners.

Personality disorders are not an exact science  they consist of loads of overlapping symptoms - It is almost a negotiation between your self and a psychologist and often they are not named - look up information here.

Ask to be referred to  a psychologist as aspergers could be in the mix.



I share a lot of your symptoms and have a disorder on the dissociative scale but as i said they are a jumble and you would need to take tests.

I have a lot of the same problems.



I am always counting down to a particular date or event, especially ones that make me nervous. It feels like everything after that date is on the other side of a wall that I'm afraid of reaching.



I also have to keep reminding myself I've done something, or I have to redo it over and over. I've sometimes spent minutes reading the same few words over and over again, or spelling the words in my head instead of reading them.
I've had people tell me I'm somewhat OC, and these things get worse when I'm stressed or upset about something.



Honestly the best way I've found to get over it is to just become indifferent. It's kind of hard, but if you can convince yourself that you really don't care, then it really doesn't matter.

Do I have Multiple Personality Disorder?



A lot recently, I've been having blackouts. People will come to talk to me about things I have no recollection of, and people will ask me if I'm in "a better mood" than yesterday. I will have no idea what they're talking about and I'm so scared.



I'll find myself somewhere with no idea how I got there, or I'll "wake up" to find myself doing something I would never do, eg. Writing something nasty or saying something rude.



Recently I was told that someone has been sending a teacher of mine personal information about me. But then they said they think it was me because the person sending the emails knew too much about me.



I used to email this teacher until recently, and then I broke off contact. I had no idea what they were talking about.



Usually, the last thing I can remember before a blackout is either a) a thud in my head, like someones hit me, b) an extremely sharp pain somewhere in my head, or sometimes I'll get a huge wave of pain in my head. Sometimes I'll just black out.



I think I have multiple personality disorder, and I don't know what to do. Please help!

If someone doesn't like you you just accept the fact that they do not want anything to do with you and just let them be respect their decision and move on with life.  Life is to short to worry about someone likeing you or not if they do great you will have great times together and if they dont well you'll have great times with someone else and they miss out....thats it

You just deal with it and remind yourself that it's life, and some things just aren't in your control. Bounce back and shrug it off. Not everybody will like you, that's the way the world is.



You can't make people like you, so it would be a waste of time being someone's doormat to get their approval. The best thing you could do is to be yourself, have confidence, and gain friends and colleagues who like you for the person you are already.

Above answer a good one.  I'm sure you must have met people you don't like.  You have no choice but to accept it.  If it's someone you have a lot of respect for maybe you can figure out what it is that turned them off; then again, maybe you won't.  But still, you just have to move on.  It happens to everyone.

Hey Shelly are you meaning as a person or as a potential date/partner?
Either way Im sure the person has their reasons, they may have heard a rumour about you they don't like, you might be friends with someone they don't like or have dated all kinds of things like that.
If your nice to people and don't lie about things people will like you so stick to that and you will be fine.
Just remember for every person who doesn't like you there is someone who does so in the long term it doesn't matter too much.
Good luck.

it doesn't bother me much, when on first meeting or first second i feel someone doesn't like me i just turn my back and ignore them same way they ignore me. i am not touch for such a kind of attitude, you cannot force someone to like you, it is just a question of education and getting use to it. its not an issue that you will make yourself sick from someone who has a bad education and impolite. the thing is you must not be friendly to no one. keep your distance from anybody the first moment you encounter someone, observe them first, study their manners then you launch your charms once you see that they are inoffensive otherwise just keep off the way, learn to concentrate just with your affairs, the rest you don't care. i taught myself on certain way that i am the best, like that you will stimulate yourself to be in a world of your own and you will have self confidence though it is the opposite you don't care.

I don't allow it to bother me, I realize that there are (can be) many reasons for a person not to "like" me, but it all comes down to a choice they make...regardless of the reason they make it. I just don't care who does, or doesn't, like me, or why. I'm unaffected.

There will always be people who'll like and and dislike you. You can't make someone like you, if they dont..it's simply their loss. The only ones that should matter are the ones that DO like you.  You can't expect everyone to like you. Thats how it is.

Help me resolve my crisis part 2?



I have just posted this question, and I would like to add some details. The question was:



Im so scared. I love my boyfriend more than my life, but Im afraid one major difference we have will be a great obstacle. Im very intellectual, and need to talk about my ideas and feelings a lot or i will feel unhappy. Hes totally rational and calculated, and only talks about facts, and has no real emotions, or philosophical/intellectual thoughts. Im afraid that I will be unhappy for that. On the other hand im too intellectual, that Im becoming a daydreamer, and being like I am will not get me anywhere in my life. I hate that attribute of mine, and WANT to change it, and Im really uncomfortable with it. I need to start doing more instead of just talking. Now Im having serious anxiety attacks because im really confused. Were both 21. Together for over 2.5 yrs..



I would like to add that we have a lot in common as well all the main values, goals in life, sense of humor, and were both laid back and relaxed. So we get along perfect. His rationality has helped me bring some order and structure into my before messed up life. But it also makes me realize all my flaws, and makes me feel bad for not being able to be like him. As well as that, sometimes i feel he is so distant and just cant understand me. Im a feeler hes a thinker. But all the other things we have ( he has changed for the better for me) make me feel awfull for thinking like theres something missing. I couldnt sleep all night since this idea popped into my head, and im obsessing and overanalyzing everything...Im seriously desperate

Should you have to convince someone to be your boyfriend/in a relationship or should they want it equally too?



I'm confused.



I've been "hanging out" with this boy I really like. I consider our outings as "dates".



But I guess it's not considered "dating" him because in order to be "dating" him we would have to be in a relationship as boyfriends right?



So I cant say I "dated" him but i can say we went out on a few dates?? right?



Anyways, I want to ask him to be my boyfriend and to be in a relationship because im in love with him.



i want us to be "together" and "official".



I want us to be dating.



i want us to exclusive.



i want to be a couple.



i want to go out with him.



Should I have to convince him to want all that stuff too, or shouldnt he naturaly want to be i na relationship with me also?



How should I ask him to be my boyfriend? What should I do if he says no?



Ive neevr had a boyfriend before and want him to be my first.



What reactions and typical responses should I expect?

Learn to be more open and communicative with him.  Don't be afraid to say exactly what you think.  If he doesn't like wtf you have to say, then get rid of him.  Tell him, I'd like you to be my boyfriend, than ask what he thinks.  If he's not sure, don't freak out and don't push him, just don't be to cozy w/ him and don't put out, (have sexual contact).  If he wants you as his bf, take things slow, you don't need to exchange passwords and read each others text messages right away, but don't assume he's telling you the truth.  Many guys will f*ck than disappear.  Not because they want to hurt you, just because they don't know how to handle relationships.  So be prepared for the worst and remember your the sh*t, not him.  Don't ever feel embarrassed.  Millions of gays out there.  If one doesn't work out, it's not the end of the world.



P.S.  ALWAYS USE CONDOMS!!! NO MATTER WHAT!!!  SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE STDS.  THEY LOOK NORMAL AND HEALTHY THEN WHEN IT BURNS FOR YOU TO PEE YOU WILL REGRET IT.

The mistakeS that humans make vary slighty from place to place but all share the same core concept,sins.  I am not a religious man but a spiritual one.  I believe that the whole concept of sins is a way to keep society in order.  Temptation is the downfall of man.  We will always have that monkey on our backs.

Would this be a symptom of OCD/OCPD?



About a year ago if I was doing something I would feel discontent unless I did this thing where I'd breath about 4 times then swallow 4 times then I'd have to sort of rub my wrists and press the tips of my fingers into my chin/arm or I'd like have to clench my teeth about 4 times and I'd have to do it or I'd kind of freak out and wouldn't continue what I was doing until I did it & if I didn't do it right I'd have to start allover again. I still do similar things today but the things that I have to do sort of change over time. Also I'll bite my fingers and I'll try to prevent myself from doing it but I can't help myself so if I don't I just don't feel right. Also each night before I go to bed I have to nudge each side of my bed with my knee to make sure it is pressed tightly against the wall or I just can't sleep. This isn't really a big issue because it doesn't affect the things I do each day in any way but I just have no explanation as to why I do it?



</question>

Also OCD is Obsessive-compulsive Disorder. Just incase you don't know what I mean by OCD.

no, i seriously doubt you are. I am the exact same way, even to the point where my ex girlfriend thought i had multiple personalities, but i'm just very moody. You might want to look into learning more about bipolar disorder (it's what i have) and depression (google), and possibly see a doctor if it is very bothersome. i'm taking wellbutrin, and even though i don't like the fact that i have to take anti depresents, its not that bad. but research it before you see a doctor, because a doctor will diagnose you with whatever you think you have, just to keep you coming back.

No. not at this time. You are normal in the sense that you have emotions which makes you a step above the primates. When we have a certain mood which takes center stage in all our everyday goings then we have a situation which calls for a "Doc." But that doesn't always mean a negative area either, there are unconscious reasons which must be analyzed in order to determine the severity.

Well the best way to wake up is always with your lover kissing you awake. But if that is not possible then what you can do is to set your alarm clock to a very up beat station but not to where it blasts you out of the bed lol.



And always have your coffee pot programmed the night before so it is ready when u wake up.



Then hit the shower and let the warm water wake u up, making you feel warm and cozy, it puts you in a good mood :)

I had twins three years ago - one died of SIDS - will this affect the surviving twin later in life?



On June 13th, 2005 I gave birth to twins, Kidia and Khauna. On June 16th, our son died of SIDS (what they're calling SIDS at least - Khauna stopped breathing and they weren't able to resuscitate him). I've spoken to both my daughters doctor and mine, and they've both said time will tell on this - so I need opinions from those who've been through it.



I've heard stories about one twin passing away and the other twin having a "withdrawal". Do you think my daughter will be effected by this at any point in her life? If you've lost one twin, but the other survived - did your child ever go through this? What age where they at? Does she still feel connected to him, even though he was only alive for a few days?



My husband and I have twin boys now as well, who are two, do you think having siblings so close to her age will help my daughter in any grief she may feel in the future.



This isn't an issue now - she's never said anything about or asked about Khauna - and we only have three or four pictures of him, all of which are in our bedroom. So I may just be worrying about something that will never happen. But I wanted help anyway.



Thank you.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



In the study of sibling relations and numerical position (you know, "first, second/middle, last, etc.") there is also the question of "psycho-social" influences on sibling position. A major influence is the sex of the siblings, another is how the parents compare them with each other, and so on.



Anyway, one influence is called the "ghost child," which happens a lot in families, in which a child dies (miscarriage, in infancy, etc.) and a parent, usually the mother, keeps that child "alive" by referring to it through the years. This often happens on the anniversary of the child's birthday. At such a time, the mother wonders what that child would have been like if he or she had lived. Often, this is seen (by the mother) as the "ideal child" (in contrast with the actual child who survived).



I don't mean to be so academic about this, but you are facing a future in which this could be how your daughter is influenced by the death of



your son, her brother.



I would say find someone to talk with about this, your best bet being someone trained in Adlerian psychology (since such a person best understands the ins and outs of siblings relationships).

Once she gets older, explain to her that everything happens for a reason, and Khauna going to heaven was something you couldn't control. Convince her that he's watching over her and keeping her safe, and that you are so grateful that she is a strong, healthy and growing up girl. Make sure you reassure her often and let her know that you love her. Good luck and sorry about your loss.

I'm sure with all the love and understanding your little girl will be fine.

i do. i have for many years. i just watched a movie today though, one that starts slow, then gradually builds in intensity and such. was a profound movie, and was centered on a very believable character. it was a movie based on a novel. if you havent seen the movie or read the book, and the answer you give to the first part of this is yes, then i /strongly/ encourage you to see (or read) it, all of it. Have you seen the movie Red? (or read the book?)

Yes to the first part of your question, havent heard of that movie or book but I love reading so will check it out. Have you actually read the book or just seen the movie? Sometimes I find the book better and other times the movie better than the book. If you have done both which would you say is better?

Animals, too, experience a profound feeling of sadness when their play/hunt/sex partner dies. Those studying the behavior of wild and domestic animals come with an increasing number of cases proving that animals are capable of pure sorrow when they lose someone close to them. Somehow, this behavior is linked to self-conscience, thus only "brainy" animals, like mammals and some birds, consciously commit suicide.



It is hard to say if animals commit suicide. An animal will not do this because of a sudden dread, or an excessive emotion. As they cannot ... speak, it's difficult to assess if there is a true suicide.



But when a dog or a cat, following the death of their master, refuse food dying of hunger, we can conclude that this is an unwitting consequence of the pain they feel. But when the animal throws itself from a height, it's hard to believe this is a casual act or the effect of its anxiety.

Do some idiots on Y!A annoy you?



List of annoying Y!A clowns.



1. The pathetic people who beg - "pplzz omg this sooo happened to me plzzzz pick my answer because i never get picked :(((("
2. Idiots that give you the thumbs down because they disagree with your opinion on a movie/book/something trivial - not because you were rude or ignorant etc.
3. People that pick the "best answer" purely based on what they WANT to hear, not what is logical or viable or probably correct. These people cant seem to stand anyone suggesting they may be wrong.



These people really annoy me. Do they annoy you? Are there other people that annoy you on Y!A?

Nope, and neither do imbeciles, morons or allegedly "normal" people. Getting annoyed with someone shows that you actually care about them, what they think and what they do. Personally, as long as they don't cause harm to me or mine, I don't care what they do and I refuse to give them the ability or power to upset me or control me in any other fashion.

most of america is caucasian, so that part is explained as that seems to be where most come from .(i am aware that they come from all countries, but there have been a lot of famous ones in the USA)
serial killers must be able bodied, therefore most will be young and fit
for the same reason, it is often a power thing, this is driven by hormones such as testosterone and adrenaline, which are both in the male body in larger concentrations.
and most are caught early, thats why they are still young, fred west was old but he had been killing for 30 years, since his 20's.
people dont decide to be serial killers, they are born to it and diseases like pschizophrenia do not show until early adulthood in most cases

I once read that when you dream of vehicles it's like representing a certain Direction in your life.
If you were in that motorcycle and it's in a stormy night then that may mean you should watch out on your decisions.



But if you were in it in a bright sunny day then that's a good sign that something good will come soon.



Dreams would often tell you something you haven't achieved while you were conscious. So might as well be careful in making any choices in your life=)

All dreams mean something from your past and take place, not in the conscious mind, but in the subliminal mind where these feelings lay dormant until needed. You do not state riding,or pillion, this can make a difference. Riding you are in charge. Passenger you are trying to get away from, or come to terms, with a situation that you are probably not aware of.  As you are only13 it will fall into a common dream that young people have and is nothing but an awakening to facts unknown to you. What you always called home was not your home, it is in fact your parents home. You have always had to ask for what you  wanted while watching your parents each doing exactly what they wanted without having to ask. This builds up a resentment even at a very early age. Now you know the dream will fade, or may not even occur again.

Jealousy, envy, and many other negative things is whats doing this, unless she has prior knowledge of the man you have chosen and after warning you about him, you have ignored her, she has decided to write you off. Either way - it is petty and childish on her part. She probably was no friend at all.  Maybe she wished he would choose her! Who knows, after all, do we have the right to judge anyone?

Ask her what is wrong. You never know it may be unrelated she may just be under alot of stress. Communication is the key to good friendships, if she is a really good friend just ask her what is wrong and she'll tell yo.

In all honesty a counselor is no real help unless you want them to be. if you tell your counselor these things he or she will intervene because there is apparent danger within the family. If you don't want this to happen don't mention it. They HAVE to intervene if you admit to them someone is in danger or breaking the law.



sooo think real hard if you want your family broken up or not because im pretty sure that is what might happen for awhile.

like a counselor as in your shrink? or like a school counseler? either way that something that you should tell them because it will cause stress. talking about it can make it better. i know it must be hard to deal with something like that but cutting isnt the answer. being self destructive just creates more stress and more hate. try to find other ways to let out your bottled up emotions by writing in a journal or doing artwork. good luck.

Hello,



(ANS) No.1 One of the most important aspects of a survival situation is to remain as calm as possible, & to think clearly and rationally. i.e. keep a cool head. Its good thinking skills that will ultimately save your life.



No.2 Try to find shelter i.e. get out of the wind, the rain, or the heat.



No.3 Try to stay dry as far as possible (or cool if in desert terrain).



No.4 Food sources (look for the most available food sources around you within the natural environment). Fish from rivers or the sea, berries, roots, edible plants if you know which they are. You might have to resort to eating insects or lizards or snakes or small birds if it would keep you alive.



No.5 Always use whats around you in the natural environment.

Just think about what you have to do to survive that situation.  Just take it one step at a time.  After it's all over, you can let go and cry.  That's what I did when we were locked in a room over the shop by a couple of robbers.  I just kept thinking, "what do I need to do to get out of this?"  I provided a solution, and we got out of there alive.  Then I broke down.

Firstly, you'd need a strong will to live. And I guess it depends on the situation for the rest...



Being able to navigate you way around is important, whether it be with the sun, a map, a compass etc. and you'd need to avoid or at least defend yourself against dangerous animals or plants or people.



In terms of mental preparation, you would need to have a brave personality to overcome the fear of being in a life threatening situation. If your too overwhelmed by fear you can't think straight. For example, I'm scarred of spiders, but if I was lost in the rain-forest I'd need to overcome that fear to survive.
You would also need to be able to remain calm and not get angry. In a situation where things are most likely to go wrong it is easy to imagine that tempers will flare. Getting angry can cause loss of energy and rationalisation, and (if in a group) can spark off arguments and break down team spirit. Teamwork is highly important in order to live, because as humans we are stronger working together.



Having said that another emotion you'd need to overcome would be guilt. Even though we are storngest as a team, it is still everyone for himself, if that makes any sence? For example, if your in a burning building and one screaming person trips up you cannot go back for them because it would endanger your own life, you cannot feel guilty about that and have too keep on surviving.This is called "survivor's guilt".
And lastly depression. In a desperate situation you'd have too keep pushing forward if you have any chance of surviving. To overcome this you would have to stay possitive and think happy thoughts because it is esay to give up hope. It seems that while humans are physically trying to improve their lives, by means of building a fire, making shelter, gathering water or food, there is less tendency to become depressed.

I would have to say to become more religious.  When one has had a brush with death it causes them to reevaluate their lives and to realize what they have.



Another tip would be to live life more fully.  Take the trip you wanted.  Tell loved ones that you love them everyday.  Visit an old friend.  Make amends to those we have wronged.  Go to confession.  Tidy up our lives so to speak.



Once you have been rescued from the edge of death, you also know the fragility of your body.  So, possibly we also are more careful and cautious.

Does a depressed person think like this?



For example a person doesnt do anything like everyday just day dreaming and all.. she knows she has a problem but probably its just too big to face and but whenever she thinks about Christmas the day that is very important to every one she feels like there's no time to waste she already gotta do something about her problem or else she will be spending that very important day feeling BLAH.. does a depressed think about that?

I'm not a doctor but a depressed person doesn't day dream. A depressed person is one who can't kickstart the day off. Feels overwhelmed by day to day activities. Has trouble deciding what to do first. Feels they can't do anything right. Hope this helps. If you are feeling this way or even questioned depression, seek professional help. Don't just get medicated. Get counseling. It works! Good Luck

yes, but!
it is like being in a big, really muddy hole that is almost impossible to get out of, you might get a foothold but then slip down again, most of the time we give up and sit on the bottom feeling sorry for ourselves. it is much easier than keep getting up and fighting our way out.
but i found the easiest way is to ggrab hold of the hand that is reaching out to you. it still takes effort to reach up and take that hand but not as much as doing it yourself.
sit, close your eyes, ask jesus to help you and put your hand into his.god bless

i use to feel abandoned, to feel alone. sometimes, when i see my friends were so happy, i started to feel lonely.



actually, i am not really sure how do you feel right know. but we cannot expect that friends will come to you most of the time. we, on the other hand, have to approach them ourselves. its like if you don't greet them, say hello to them, offer help to them (in various possible ways) & do not expect that they will come to you easily.



my point is, to be happy, we have to work for it. we have to socialize. we have to be active in community.



anyway, i wish all of us are happy. and i hope that my answer is helping. XOXO

Glad that you asked that question.  First, to set things straight, the world is not uncaring.  The reason you believe that is because you are listening to the headlines, the media, newspapers and television news. Once you drown yourself in those things, you will feel like you are isolated in an uncaring world.  First remedy, turn off all the news that you usually listen to.  Do not read the newspapers or listen to the daily news on tv.



Want to still be informed? Read these instead:  US News and World report magazine, Time Magazine, Readers Digest, Psychology Today, Psychologies, or other magazines like that.  By reading any of these or all of these, you will still be informed on the latest, yet these will not depress you as the tv news and radio news will.  (These magazines present the news but do not overwhelm your senses with gore, killing and disgusting details of news stories).



Second, know that you are not alone. Every single person in this world has a God, and if the God is a true God, that God is always with you.  If your God is not always with you, then try Jesus Christ who is all present, omnipresent and here to be with you.



Third, and this is a very important step, you need to get a volunteer job of some sort and that will help you be connected and help you see that the whole world is not uncaring. Individuals who are willing to work for free--for no money, are caring people. So be with caring people and you will see that the world is not uncaring.  Volunteer today.



Volunteer in these kinds of places and in these areas:



Be a television studio volunteer. Contact the nearest community access station and volunteer there.



Volunteer in the botanic gardens, zoos, or other natural settings and help save the planet.



Volunteer in a senior's organization or in a hospital.  Volunteer to help care for newborns in hospitals or nurseries.



Almost anywhere people work for money, usually accepts volunteers.



The first way you stop feeling isolated is by thinking of someone other than yourself.  So, go do it.  If you are under age, you need your parent's or guardian's permission to volunteer.  Go for it.



Source(s):



Having had many volunteer jobs in the past, I have learned that there are many caring people in this world.  You can learn that too. Just volunteer.

Trust me when i say  i have experience in this, first get up and start cleaning  stuff, cluster experts say to give away everything that u own longer than a year ,but never used it. than give all that valuable junk to people who really needs it. take a walk in the street greeting everyone  u see, forcing a smile would be good, and forcing people to greet u back even better., help people in need, without expecting something in return, its a process, but it works,100 percent.

I'm 19, but I don't *feel* 19!?



I only just turned 19 a few days ago, so it would make sense if it was just that I still felt 18. However, even when I was eighteen I still felt like I hadn't yet caught up to that age or something. I didn't feel a specific age younger but, are we supposed to feel officially older or something once we've reached adulthood? I still feel like I'm not there yet and I always felt this way growing up as a teenager, like, "how can we possibly be in grade 11 yet, we were only just in grade 8!?". I'm a chick, by the way, so I've finished growing.



Now that I spilled what's bothering me, has anyone got anything to say to that?
