Drop shipping means you deal with a company that supplies the goods.  You pay them a fee for the products.  You advertise for them, sell for them, and collect the money - but THEY do the shipping.  The profit is the difference between what you charge the customer and what they charged you.  They (the drop shipper) will do the shipping.  A couple of worries, one are they reputable (you know they are really going to send the product stated, not some defective one or lesser quality). Two, if time would be a concern to you, in drop shipping you have no control over the shipping time in some cases, for instance on eBay people expect their stuff within a certain time period, or you're the one that takes the hit for the delay.  OTOH, it can be great because you don't have to deal with any product. :)

My basic understanding of this is where you do the marketing, advertising and billing of the items ( after taking the order ) and then you simply pay the suppliers to send the item directly to the customer.  In a way, you are a 'middle man' without the customer having knowledge of that.

Drop Shipping &lt;sic&gt; - you buy from your supplier and sell to your customer - the supplier delivers directly to the customer - you never actually take physical possession of the goods.

Drop shipping is a supply chain management technique in which the retailer does not keep goods in stock, but instead transfers customer orders and shipment details to wholesalers, who then ship the goods directly to the customer. The retailers make their profit on the difference between the wholesale and retail price.

Its where you sell a product that your supplier has but you dont.
Im not a big fan of it myself as I have done this and the problem that you will regualrly find is that when your supplier runs out of product and then is waiting on the manufacturer you have to go back to your customer and either annoy them with an unreasonable wait time or refund the money.
Its best to have a few items in inventory or as a back up stock incase drop shipping fails.

WelI I actually take surveys for cash. And yes they do pay as long as you know the good ones. I have some free survey sites that are very reliable just check out my profile by clicking my name or email me for them. I only give sites that I've been paid by so you won't get scammed. They're all reliable and I've never had a problem with them. (I've been doing them for a year now) The best part is that anyone can do them and they're easy. You won't get rich but they definitely help with bills :)
