The pool is cleared and closed for 24 hours.
The feces is scooped out with a net.
The pool is disinfected (not necessarily super chlorinated) for 24 hours.

This is what happens if OSHA is followed.

Hope this helps.

Enjoy!

Your eyes sting because the water is slightly acidic. The water is acidic due to a number of factors. Both sweat and urine contribute to low pH (acidity) of the water.

Mio figlio ha passato la prima ora di lezione di nuoto a piangere, devo continuare?



Mio figlio di 5 anni voleva fare nuoto, ma la sua prima lezione (premetto che non è mai stato in piscina), l'ha passata con la pancia sul bordo della piscina a piangere mentre gli altri, che purtroppo erano un po' più esperti, facevano il giro aggrappandosi al bordo, ma lui proprio non voleva tanto andare più giù e aveva solo le gambe in acqua. Il ciclo dura 14 lezioni, secondo voi, dovrei continuare ancora, magari si abitua oppure lasciar perdere? Avete un'esperienza simile?? Grazie per le risposte.

(non ho mai imparato xkè nn volevo fare nuoto, ci andavo solo xkè ero costretta). magari potresti portarlo in piscina qualke volta solo voi 2 cosi si abitua un pokino e casomai riproporgli l'esercizio del bordo.

Ciao è un problema assai frequente nelle piscine, quindi non ti devi preoccupare.
Gli istruttori dovrebbero essere preparati a certe evenienze, e dovrebbero agire al meglio.

Certamente ti dico di continuare, e ti consiglio di parlare con l'istruttore di tuo figlio, in modo da informarlo su cosa piace fare a tuo figlio in questione di giochi.

Perchè tuo figlio starà facendo ambientamento, ed è una fase molto delicata, dove cmq i bimbi più che imparare a nuotare devono imparare a stare in acqua e convivere con essa.
Questo lo si può fare solo facendogli fare quello che gli piace fare di più fuori, ossia giocare.

Questo è il mio consiglio.

ciao,
come ti capisco.!!!io oltre che a essere una giovane ragazza che fa nuoto agonistico per 4 ore al giorno,sono un'istruttrice di nuoto ( dato che adoro i bimbi ho scelto di fare acquaticità e acqua baby..quindi guardo i bimbi fino a 6 anni)
spesso questi comportamenti sono normali,e con il tempo svaniscono.
se tuo figlio non ha mai avuto un'esperienza in piscina diciamo che è normale.sta nell'iustruttore a convincerlo,con le buone maniere i bimbi si ambientano e staranno in acqua volentieri.non credo che ci siano problemi con l'istruttrice/istruttore,ma a volte potrebbe succedere.nel caso in cui tuo figlio abbia proprio paura dell'acqua o se noti che nn va volentieri non mandarcelo piu.ma per ora ti consiglio di fargli provare questa esperienza per ancora un po'. e tranquilla,molti genitori si pongono questa domanda e per fortuna con me raramente piangono.sono stata piccola anche io e sin da piccola nuotavo (so come vanno presi i bambini alle prese con uno sport nuovo ma affascinante). vedrai che gli passera..spero di averti rassicurata e nello sstesso tempo averti dato una mano... buona fortuna e mi raccomando..fammi sapere...!!!bacio

Endurance (also called sufferance) is the ability for humans to exert themselves through aerobic or anaerobic exercise for relatively long periods of time. The definition of 'long' varies according to the type of exertion - minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity. Training for endurance can have a negative impact on the ability to exert strength unless an individual also undertakes resistance training to counteract this effect.



Endurance exercise: Endurance exercise or endurance training consists of performing low- to medium-intensity exercise for long periods of time. E.g., jogging or running several miles to hundreds of miles; cycling dozens of miles to thousands of miles; swimming hundreds of yards or meters to dozens of miles or kilometers.



Physical endurance is differentiated from other forms of physical stress in that in endurance exercise fatigue of the muscles and cardiovascular system do not force the effort to end. The need for sleep, the buildup of non-recyclable waste chemicals, the depletion of convertible energy stores and other needed chemicals (e.g., water, sodium), physical injury, psychological failure, or attainment of the goal will bring the effort to an end



In equestrian sport, endurance riding refers to long distance races (often 100 miles) by one horse-rider pair.

Any tips for competitive swimming?



I know how to swim, leisurely. But what things do I need to know to join a swim team and swim competitively?

ok well first of all join a local swim club that allows you to compete in competitions.



here is some tips which i got off my club website (some bits wont be relivant to you so just ignore them but it gives you a basic idea of what t expect when you compete):



A few tips that might come in handy when you attend your first competition.



1. Select a suitable event. Check the events calendar on this site. Encouragements are good to start with since they allow restarts for young swimmers if they fall in and help them if their goggles fall off etc. Short events only take two hours whereas longer events take 6 or more hours. More info on the expected length of the event is available from parents at the club who have attended that event in previous years. Most encouragements take 2 to 3 hours and State Qualifiers take anything up to 6-7 jours. Some events are split with juniors in the morning and seniors in the afternoon. Some events will have a DTASC coach in attendance. It is rather confusing for both the swimmer and parents attending their first event. If at all possible it is wise to go with other club members or a coach.



2. Entry times. Some comps require a green SV card (available from your coach) to be sent in. Sometimes you just fill in the form that is available from the competitions page or the events calendar on the Swimming Victoria Web Site .



3. What to take. Most events have some food available but little time is available between heats at some shorter events. It is suggested that you should take food, drink, spare bathers, spare gogles and cap. Some events require you to take chairs, for some it is optional and some do not allow private chairs. It is usually noted on the entry form.



4. On the day. Get there early to secure a seat. This also allows plenty of time for a warmup. Most competitions allow swimmers to warm up until 10 or 15 minutes before the event start. Make sure you get to the marshalling area 5 to 7 heats prior to your heat. If you miss marshalling you are likely to be disqualified. If you are in events 1, 2 or 3 you basically go straight to marshalling from warmup. Look for other swimmers in the same age group. The experienced ones know when to head to marshalling and watch the Marshalling board carefully.



5. Results are usually posted onto the wall of the pool several heats after each event finishes. Most events also publish their results on the club web site. One notible exception is Franskton.



6. A few events (Frankston) still run award/medal presentations. Medals are awarded to the fastest three swimmers in the event. Even if you come first in your heat and their are 4 heats after yours, it is unlikely you will receive a medal. Some events swim three age groups together and award medals to each age group. Check the event flyer and prgoram for details.



Suggested events for first timers:



Haileybury Waterlions always run a good event that starts on time and is well run. Results are availble and they normally provide medals for 1st 2nd and 3rd placegetters in each event. Haileybury is located down Springvale road about 45 minutes from Aquarena ( at 7:30 am on Sunday mornings).



Casey events are well organised and usually have a quality field of swimmers.



Moonee Valley Aquatic run great events at Footscray but the pool is cramped. Always sit near the toilets not near the windows. BYO chairs.



All Juniors is another good comp that starts with eliminations at Richmond pool. A coach usually attends and a wide variety of swimmers compete.



Metro North Encoragements at Richmond held in March each year.

It depends on how competitively you're looking to swim.  If it's just a summer team then you should know how to do fly, back, breast, free, and be able to swim at least 4 lengths of them.  But I am on a U.S.S swim team and we swim around 7,000 yards a day.  My high school team swims over 9,000 yards a day (since we do doubles).  You'll also need goggles, swim cap, and a racing suit!  Most teams supply you with pull buoy, kick board and other things so I would wait till you join to see if you need these things.



Good Luck!

I highly suggest running... especially for breastroke.  I started running a few miles  3-4 times a week, slowly adding distance, and breastroke went from being my worst stroke to my best by far in one season.  Also, the typical push ups and crunches are helpful and if you have a YMCA or gym then weights are fun (ha..ha)... idk if that helps but i hope it does!

Try running and lifting weights every day. But make sure to stick with it! In other words don't just do it for a week and stop; it's hell swimming with shin splints if you get them. Also, stick with a good diet to condition yourself and get you prepared for swim season.

You can't make them (it involves a lot of electronics). You should buy them. Also, this question shouldn't be in swimming and diving, because you can't take NV underwater. It's electronic.

It is so you kill little germs that don't make the pool green in 2 days.  The only negative thing is it feels wierd on your skin the second you are dry.  That is when you take a shower.

Chlorine is a chemical that disinfects the water and helps to remove debris. You should use a chlorine stabiliser to extend the chlorine's half-life. Generally, the longer your filtration cycle, the less chlorine you will need. Similarly, the more chlorine you use, the shorter your required filtration cycle. Remember that your chlorine requirements will be affected by a range of factors including your pump and filter system, water temperature, water level, amount of debris, and the number of swimmers in your pool

dont worry you will be fine. 12 feet is no big deal.



when you dive make sure you go head first, not feet, and keep chin tucked.
once you are under water flutter kick back up.
and you won't drown. some hot guy will save you lol.
once you come back up, just kick back to the wall.



good luck and have fun!

Just remember that the human body is less dense than water, especially when there is a lot of air in the lungs.  Thus if you remain calm in the water, you'll float right to the top in short order.

I am a certified lifeguard and a high school student also , I have been on swim team the past 5 years and taught swim lessons.



The first thing you have to relax! you are much more likely to freak out if you are nervous
when you jump into the water put your hands above your head and pull your hands down to get to the top really fast. then just pretend your in 5 foot water and swim or doggy pattle to the wall
you will be fine!



there should always be a lifeguard on duty if anything goes wrong



floaties are actually more dangerous because if you have water wings and your arms could get stuck above your head and sometimes you cant pull them apart and there have been several drowning incidents so now most pools ban them

Ok, before you dive make sure you fill your lungs with air all the way to the top.  Our school has a jumpy board so walk to the edge and fall in straight down but out so you don't hit your head on anything.



As soon as you go under water, kick up and paddle like a duck or watever to the side.  12 pools are dense so you won't go past 5 feet at all unless you let all the air out of your stomach and lungs.
stay safe

I found this site with some great muscle building exercises and tips for building muscle.  I learned so much from these articles.  I found out everything I've been doing all these years.

Push ups and pull ups, if there is a chinning bar nearby.  Just purchase Navy SEAL training vids; the SEALS train specifically for swimming, its what a lot of their cals are designed for and part of the reason SEAL cals are often so brutal.  I should know, way back when when attempting to get ready for the Marines I did nothing but SEAL cals 3 hours a day.  Morning; Navy Seal Workout Challenge.  After school, Navy Seal Burnout PT.  While in school, weight training.  I carved out quite a nice body, actually, perfectly geared for swimming even though I never went near a pool.



Let me tell you though, SEAL cals are a b*tch; it won't give you too much mass, however it does develop the upper body fairly evenly.



Myself, personally, NOW, I prefer a modified version of the Atlas system; instead of Atlas dips, I do 5 quick elevated push ups for warm up and emphasise dynamic tension pectoral exercises.  My reasons?  They seem to work better....



The Atlas system is very good for symetry and strength, and size gains depending largely on protein intake, however for swimming you will need endurance, and even done circuit style the Atlas system isn't all that great endurance wise done on its own.  Let me put it this way; the Charles Atlas Dynamic Tension system is the only strength training method I have done that is 100% muscle strength development.



Weight training is like, no matter what the approach (low, mid, or high reps) 60% strength and 40% cardio.  Cals are the opposite of that, and Bowflex power rod workouts are actually pretty good, the equipment works what felt like 80% of muscle fibers.  The total gym just looks like a cals station to me, so, its basically the same thing unless you add weight.



Atlas DT is the only thing I have done that trains the muscle fibers 100% and no, don't believe that full range of motion bullcrap; to muscle cells, tension is tension, and its resistance that matters.  If you simply flex, you only tense a part of the muscle.  If you lift something you tense a greater percentage of your muscle fibers but only for that split second where the weight is at the critical lifting point.  With Atlas DT, on the other hand, you tense more fibers, for longer, and the sheer intensity makes it so that doing it for more than just one set is dangerous.  In fact, I actually have a lot of damaged muscle tissue now; I'm seeing pink and red marks all over my body, likely torn muscle.



Case in point, for swimming, stay away from DT.  Its intense and brutal as hell.



For the time being for your swimming career cals are the way to go, especially SEAL cals.  You won't be dissapointed; track down the "Navy SEAL Workout Challenge" and the "Navy Seal Burnout PT Challenge."

How old are U and still schooling?  Body Building & weight lifting are professional training and if did it wrong will cause serious injury.



If in school, the teacher/instructor can help and if working, the gym instructor can help to put u right.



After the knowhow, the regular practices are very important practising schedule to tone up your needed muscles & chest built.



Food types are important elements for body development. Check with instructor and  reconfirm with your doctor for non-error practices.



Train hard & good luck........result will usually show in 3 to 6 months.

How hard is it to be on your hs swim team?



I'm a really athletic girl, I run cross country, and after regionals(hopefully state)I was thinking about swimming...I was wondering how expensive it is to buy a swimsuit and swim cap... and how hard is it to learn, I'm an okay swimmer but I'm afraid I won't be able to dive well or be able to swim a whole lap without stopping. tips?

since i swim all year round (including high school) i know the ropes. it usually depends on what suit you get for how expensive it'll be, but most practice suits are somewhere in the range of $20-60 (sorry that it's a big range.. but it's true). then usually high school team suits are somewhere near $50-60ish. caps and goggles and usually kind of cheap, usually under $25, unless you go hardcore and get some special goggles.



if you're worried about stopping a lot, when you have some extra time just swim some laps, and work on your breathing. i breath every 3 strokes, and coaches like that (something with the bilateral). as long as you're willing to learn other strokes, and are committed, the season will be a lot of fun, and you'll stay in great shape. best advice... work on your breathing and stamina/endurance. (but you should already be amazing at that since your a cross country runner)
ahha hope i helped and good luck!!!

well high school swimming in my area is very serious and tough. we have a harsh coach who tells us we arent allowed to get out of the pool during the three hour practice no matter what (pee in the pool, throw up in the gutter, etc.) you will deffinetly need to be able to swim at least 20 lengths at a time without stopping (often multiple times and in different strokes.) so think about all this and decide if you are ready. im not trying to scare you out of joining the team, i just dont know if you have thought about these things and are ready for them. if you feel like you are good enough, THEN GO FOR IT! swimming is a TON of fun, and veryy social which is why i like it.

Training suits range in the $30-$80 range.  Caps are inexpensive, only $2-$15.  Swimming is an AWESOME sport.  I absolutely love it!  It is challenging, but you will have the drive and determination to keep at it if you're a good runner.  Diving comes after learning your strokes.  If your school's team is taking new swimmers, and you keep at it (even though the first practices will be killers), you will see rapid improvement within a few weeks.  If you want to do it, don't ever give up during a set during practice.  It'll be hard, but just keep swimming!

its not too expensive to buy the swimsuit and cap. if your going to take lessons that will be an expense, im not sure how much though, but its worth it! it depends what division the team is, they might not accept you if you dont know those things, or they might take you and teach you. with most teams, im sure you know, you get much better by the end of the season than when you started. so youll probably do great! good luck.

being in shape is good but have to know the swimming technique otherwise being fit wont help you. and money wise it depends mostly on how bad you want this and how much you want to pay. my mom pays around $600 yearly for swimming. a good swimsuit is like 30 - 40 bucks, goggles are about 15 - 20 and a cap are like 5 - 10.
