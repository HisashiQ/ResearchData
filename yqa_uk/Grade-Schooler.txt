Try stripping him down to nothing but his undies with nothing else to cover him up. If that doesn't work, put him in a cold bath and just let him sit there for a while.

I think the help by all of us is only a guide and emergency like letting wear thin clothing and put wet towel on fore head and armpits and all joints legs and hands to reduce heat (very effective)

The next thing is you really nee dto bring him to doctor to check up. maybe he is allergy to certain pain killer or he is actually having sore throat and other viruis that his body is fighting with that cause the fever and painkiller will not cure solely

he may need antibiotic

Don't give him any more painkillers. They irritate the stomach lining epecially on an empty stomach. Give a flannel which has been under cold water and ring it out so it's just damp, and place it on his forehead. Take him to the doctors and they might be able to prescribe something to help him

ps DO NOT put him in a cold bath. It could send him into shock. Someone in our family died after their mother put them in a cold bath when he had a fever

Are you saying he throws up every time you try to give him medicine to lower his fever?  If that's the case, he probably needs a tylenol suppository.  I know it's not pleasant to do but you need to get his fever down.

maybe your giving him too much, is it a children's type one??

maybe a lower dose.

if that don't work, bucket, chuck a towel in there, ring it off as much as you can, and then wash him down, put a damp flannel on his head, re soaking and reapplying the damp flannel on his forehead, and occasional wiping down on chest and back with damp towel.

if his temp goes over a few degrees from normal, take him to hospital, high temps are quite serious.

(write down or take with you packets of what he has taken, or been sick taking)

also if you have any vapour rub lick Vick's, or can tell someone to get some, it would really help, on his chest, back forehead, and nose, and next to nose.

i wish people wouldnt have there profiles on private, who knows if you will read this edit know.

Call your Dr. for info. They might tell you to put him in a cool bath for a few minutes, or to put a cloth on his forehead and armpits.
You need to take him to see a pediatrician soon though, just to make sure it's just the flu or some other little virus.

Are you giving him Motrin for his fever? He could be allergic to ibuprofen, a really common pain killer.

When I was young, I had to be put in the hospital because my parents gave me children's motrin, and I got a lot. worse before I got better. They found out I was allergic when they took me into the hospital.

How high of a temp? Anything up to 101 is considered normal. NEVER place a child in a cold bath~~It's too much of a shock to their system. A cool compress on the forehead helps as well as dressing him as lightly as possible. One thing that sounds incredibly weird, but worked for me as a kid and a parent....Is rubbing Vicks vapo rub on the bottoms of the feet and then putting socks on. I know that's really odd, but for some reason it helps.



With a fever you are supposed to alternate between Tylenol and Motrin every 4 hours. What products are you using and what do you mean by sick? I'll check back later and edit if I see more info added.

Good luck!

Why does my 9 year old daughter misbehave so much?



My daughter just turned nine but lately she has been acting so rebellious, well actually she has pretty much always wanted to the opposite of what was told to her to do, but for some reason it seems to me like she's doing it more or maybe it's just me running out of patience with her.  My husband seems to think that there is something wrong with her, i don't know what to think, because she's good with my mother in law, she really doesn't give her a hard time but when she's home she misbehaves and she instigates fights with her older brother. They are only seventeen months apart. Help I need some advice.

When my children began acting like that, I spend one day, treating them as if they were in the military, literally, I don't make them do push ups or anything like that, but, I make them do chores, lots of chores, and I stand over them the whole time like a drill seargeant making sure they do it the right way, and as they do it, I remind them that this is what I do every day for them, and let them no I will not tolerate any whinning about it or else they will have to do it tommarrow to.  It seems to work well, discipline, that is how you get your kids to act right.  Also while they're doing the chores, I ask them, do you remember why you are being punished?  And I make them tell me why they are doing this chore, if they don't do it right, without alot of hassle, I keep adding on to the list.  By the time they are done, they are nice to me for while.  There is nothing wrong with a pop on the bottom with your hand now and then either.  If you love her, you will correct her, or else she will act like that her entire life and end up in trouble with the law when she gets older.

Beat her...nah I'm kidding

I know what you mean, my nephew (who's 6) is the naughtiest little kid I have ever met yet his sister (who's 9) is an angel. They've both been brought up exactly the same but they are polar opposites.

The only explanation is kids rebel and mess around and there sometimes, annoyingly enough, isn't a reason for it.

Unfortunately you're probably just gonna have to sit through it, don't lose your sanity and just keep reassuring her that you love her and always will.

I think its normal for a child her age to act as such. When she's doing such thing do you usually punish her? I learned that punishing a child makes him/her feel unwanted and unloved and therefore will do something bad she knew you don't like just to catch your attention. Don't scold or lay hands on her. go light. and as much as possible give her reward for her little good deeds.

You can always take her to a medical doctor to refer you to a psychiatrist.



Don't think it is ODD, but don't rule it out.



She could be going through a phase as well.

There probably isn't anything wrong with her medically if she behaves for your mother in law.  Kids know what they can get away with and who they can get away with it WITH.  Did that make sense?  In other words, sounds like your daughter knows her boundaries at her grandma's house.  Is your mother in law more consistent with what she says?  Children thrive on routine and consistency.  Not only negative reinforcement but positive reinforcement as well.  If she misbehaves, give her a warning "if you (talk back) again you will sit in time out for 9 mins."  If she talks back again, then you HAVE to put her in time out.  If you don't then she will walk all over you.  Then when she has sat in time out for her 9 mins hug her, ask her for an apology and move on.  Also, make her sit in time out.  Her time doesn't start until she is sitting there.  At first it might take an hour to get her to sit there.  That is ok, she is going to learn you mean business.  If she sits there but is talking to you, ignore her, she will stop.  On the other end, do things kids love, like one poster said, baking with her.  Little girls LOVE to make cookies, put frosting on them, etc.  It will bond you closer and you two will have a better relationship.  Also listen to her.  Kids need to know they are being heard and validated.  Let her know you understand how she is feeling, etc.

I'm not saying you are not doing these things.  I've just found these things have helped me become so close to my two daughters who are 11 and 14 and I have never had any behaviour problems with them

Good luck to you!

Help with my daughters school work ?



Hello All,

i have a 10 year old daughter she is very bright and active, however at school her literacy (english) is not very good. She sometimes lacks the ability to write what she thinks about i.e. stories etc, she can sit and make up a story and speak about it but doesnt seem to be able to write it down. Example her teacher will tell everyone to write a story, each pupil will write a page and a half or so in the given time she will only write a quarter of a page.



As i said she is more than capable, i think maybe lazy! does anyone have any suggestions that may help me get her motivated and do better. I only see her at the weekends so my time is limited (although her mum also wants to work on this with me)... I thought of gettign her to write a diary every day about what she has been doing in school and with friends etc??? Any other suggestions as i do not want to continually tell her off as it doesnt do anyone any good..

Thanks for your time and assistance

She might be having a problem trying to concentrate on one thing, which could easily be ADD. Have you ever had her tested? If not, I would talk to the school counselor and see what he/she tells you to do. 
"Telling her off" isn't the way to go at all. Most children do not respond well being yelled at. 
Getting a diary, and getting her to write about her day would be the same as telling her to write a story.

Maybe encourage her to write in a diary to help it seem more natural to write what she's thinking.

From the way you described it, it doesn't sound as if your daughter is lazy. Instead, it sounds like she is struggling. Is it just writing things down that takes her a long time, or does she struggle in other areas in school as well? I don't mean to scare you, but did your daughter ever get tested for dyslexia? A friend of mine went through something similar with his daughter when she was around the same age. He realized something was wrong when he would have her read stories aloud at home. He noticed she was mispronouncing words and skipping sentences without realizing it. However, her speaking skills were excellent, and she was very bright overall. When it came to reading and writing however, she struggled due to the dyslexia.

Have her tested by the school for learning disabilities and also take her to a doctor who can maybe diagnose the problem. Don't be embarrassed by this ether and get her help! My daughter is ADHD: inattentive type with a stress disorder to go along with it! If you are unsure of what that is it is ADD! They haven't called it ADD in the medical world since 1994. the school's often still call it ADD to so it can cause a problem when you say my child has ADHD. You may find you have to educate the teachers about the type of learning disorder she might have. I have had to deal with the schools denial of my daughter needing assistance for 3 years now. They finally this year are taking me seriously and are retesting her and I am bringing documents showing the diagnosis. Once you have a diagnosis it is less easy for them to denieh assistance. My daughter father is embarrassed by this and thinks we should hold back a grade instead! When I asked my daughter what she thinks about it? She said she would be more embarrassed by flunking a grade then having to go down to special needs for half an hour a day! She is actually excited at the prospect of getting assistance! The other thing to do is when doing homework at home help her as much as you can! Have her read at least 20 min every night out load! This way she can absorb the spelling and grammar better. All this in the end will help her in getting over this hurdle! Good luck!

Testing for a learning or language skills problem may be something about which her mum could talk to te school.



A diary could be good if she thinks she'd enjoy it. If it is one more hard thing it won't help.



. you can try exchanging emails with her if her mum lets her on net - ask specific questions about her day that take more than yes or no answers.  Perhaps let her email mom or a friend when she is with you. Let her write the shopping lists, write down directions for you,  Help her write a letter to go in Christmas cards. Her mind may think faster than her hand can write since you said she can tell stories verbally.



Have you asked her with out scolding what she thinks the problem is and them listened?



She may be able to tell you very specifically.



Then ask what she thinks would help.

Is she on the computer at home a lot? If so, I would limit that to saturdays only...she may be getting too used to a keyboard and find pens difficult.

omg!  my son is exactly like that!

he's 7-years old, extremely creative.  can talk up a storm on the spot, make up really good bedtime stories, voice out his opinion on the world, weather, everything!



but when you ask him to write them down...he sulks, tries, and doesn't get too far.  he's gotten all frustrated and his self-esteem was badly affected.

but here's the good news.  we found a developmental school that's just like a regular school but has individualised programs for your child's specific needs.  so he has regular grade 1 academics, with creative reading and writing tutorials on the side.  and behavioral sessions with the guidance counselor too, to regain self confidence.  they also have a catching up program if your child is lagging in writing and reading for his age level.

please, please, please look for a developmental school in your area.  it's doing a world of wonders for my son right now.



lots'a luck!

There are lots of different reasons why someone might have difficulty writing down what's in their heads, from difficulty with the mechanics of writing (which the school's occupational therapist could diagnose and help fix) to dysgraphia (which is to writing what dyslexia is to reading) to adhd, to distraction from the kid sitting next to her, to perfectionism or lack of confidence (some kids won't want to write at all if it's not perfect).  You may get clues as to what the problem is by considering how easy it is for her to express her ideas orally, how well she concentrates when doing other types of schoolwork (math, etc.), whether she has problems writing in other situations (is it difficult to write her name or something short and fun, or is the problem just putting something complex like a story on paper).

Start by talking to the teacher about what the teacher thinks the problem is.  Ask if an evaluation by the OT person or for ADD or some other type of learning disability might make sense.  Sit in on the class and see if there's some kind of distraction that's preventing her from getting the work done.  Is it possible she needs to write ideas in an outline form first to organize her thoughts enough to write a story? And then give her some fun ways to practice.  The journal is a great idea as long as it's fun.  You can encourage writing in other fun ways, too (she could write the menu for dinner, or make a treasure hunt for you or a sibling, making secret codes, etc.).

My son's like that - his problem is that he reads a lot, so his idea of "a story" is a fifty page book minimum! He knows he can't do that, so he never gets round to doing anything.

I think the diary is an excellent idea, and maybe also teach her to plan her stories out? A start, three things happening, and an end, and she'd have a page once she'd added a bit of dialogue.
