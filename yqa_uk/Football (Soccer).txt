Invite all the local youth clubs and their coaches to free coaching sessions at the clubs training facilities. Pick out the ones with potential but keep  in contact with the local youth coaches and hopefully young players will come through the system.
This has to be done as the smaller clubs will not be able to compete with the bigger clubs.

Firstly I think it is critical to work more closely with local communities and schools in the area near to the club. The focus should be homegrown, local, talent.



Then it is critical to try to make the 'working week' similar to that at top flight football - Let players feel the intensity and competition of regular youth league football. With actual recognition for the leading teams and players -By youth I define 16 onwards.



Prior to this and it would be expensive but a fruitful breeding ground for talent would be a football university/school, sponsored and paid for by the football clubs in partnership with corporate sponsors where the clubs, through scouting, and work with local schools and communities, find players they wish to nominate to the school, BUT crucially it is not 'their' player. Players then get unique football training from top flight coaches from the clubs (on rotation) and the FA. This would be combined with a proper education, perhaps vocational courses in case the football does not work out for them or is ended by injury.



At the end of the schooling period, 16 years of age, those leaving are put in to a draft type system where they are allocated a football club to work with on a random basis, and which they must stay with for at least 1 year, before being able to be traded out, unless on loan.



In this way the clubs all centralise the coaching and development of raw talent, are guaranteed to get a young player who has been trained to excellent levels, and who has played youth competitive football but also gives the smaller clubs the opportunity of landing a top talent for free. No transfer fees but instead a regular commitment from the clubs to fund the school to pay for it all, along with normal government funding as it would be a normal school.



Talented youth get top class football and normal education, clubs can let the development of talent be done by someone else, and a level playing field to ensure all clubs get to benefit rather than all the talent dissapearing in to one of the big clubs ( and better for the youth player to be at a club where they might get first team action sooner)
It also means the players get a focus on education and not just on football. Rather than having to choose between their studies and football they can have both, and if footie does not work out they have some qualification, academic or vocational to start adult life with.



It will work. And the cost to the clubs is offset by not having to invest quite so much on youth develpoment themselves. Corporates would love the once a year lottery for the top rated stars. And if the big clubs want to buy someone after a year, they can and the small clubs benefit. Genius!

What on earth is their bloody lust for me got to do with my son moving up the ladder in life?



he is good at what he does and he plays excellent football? why is he being given the wrong image of racist england since he is mixed of both black and white?



I divorced his racist dad but I expect a good future for my son because he is not responsible for who is dad is? yet the world he plays football for? seemed to pass him by in spite of his good skills.

On the whole, and under the circumstances, I think the youth system is probably as good as it could be. The Academy system is great, your local little boys and girls are picked out as being above average and invited into the Academy. They are pretty oblivious to the privilege and perform as normal. The problems can begin when they get older. They can become self conscious and loose confidence (due to the awkward age) and, due to the low proportion of successful English players at top level, probably lack some motivation. There are not many local role models around at the moment. Maybe if Academies could produce more 'local stars', it would have an impact and encourage others.

Personally the FA could team up with the Government to offer a lot more school based football competitions with lot's of local scouts coming to see the finals/semi's in order to spot the best player's on the best teams. This would be easy as it would only be one game to watch for scouts on different dates.



Another idea is that higher local clubs should be able to make contracts with lower local clubs which allow recommendations of the youth for lower clubs to go on a trail at higher clubs (Something like 5 per Season). If they like the player at the trial, then the higher local will pay a fixed price for up and coming talent from that club (e.g. so no matter how good they are, it wil always be like £1,000 or something like that. Then better, unscouted youth will have a chance to get higher up in the ladder and the lower down clubs will have more money to invest in youth.

they must have discipline within the ranks if young players see the older players getting away with misdemeanours they will also try it on .
i am not talking about when they are on the field the ref has to cope with that it is off the field where they are in the public eye this is where discipline counts. like any other job and it is a job! they should be made to toe the line or lose their position i suppose i am old fashioned but it worked when i was a kid  i remember having my ear clipped for making too big a hole in a gammon when i was boning it(taking the leg bone out of a pigs leg)and it hurt the manager was an old guy but he was too big for me to disrespect.

by a better coach, i mean a motivated and dedicated coach that has an idea which way his club is going. he needs to guide the players, and at the same time, pay attention to what the manager is doing. if the manager keeps buying foreign players without giving any chance for the youth players to show what they are capable of, he better do something about it.

As a FA certified coach, Charter Standard League Training Officer and age group coordinator my suggestion would be to invest in the local independent clubs, they have a far greater view of local talent and tend to have more time for all players. who knows the next big player may be slightly struggling with the game at present and may not be picked up straight away by an academy. with clubs helping independent clubs then only the game can benefit

I think more noticeable improvements can be seen in the performance of young players if the clubs place greater emphasis on the mental side of the game.  This way the players will develop a greater sense of determination, resilience and foresight.  One of the reasons for this is that they will learn how to play the game in their head, through visualisation and other self-help techniques.  These are powerful strategies that some of the world’s greatest sportsmen and women have used to propel themselves to the very top of their sport.



I am at the completion stage of putting together a series of personal and professional development books aimed specifically at 14-19 year old aspiring footballers. I have teamed up one of the most experienced ex-professional footballers in Europe to put this series together. This ex-player is now an academy manager.



I feel this project will encourage these players to look at the game and their involvement with it from various angles.  It can only help to better prepare them to bring some of the most impressive talents to game, and at the same time get the most out of it.

By understanding the philosophy and psychology of the top countries systems such as Spain, France and Brazil (too name a few). The FA should undertake this task and build this into their coach educators program, also providing workshops for existing coaches so everyone is on the same page. Development issues can easily be tracked this way. The winning mentality at young age has to stop and technique and creativity should be rewarded (meaning that clubs should advocate a development process not a team standing process).

The majority have respect for each other, as well as the usual banter. It's just the odd 'fans' that are more concerned with bagging the other team than supporting their own.
I'd like to say it's just the Man United fans, but there are some Liverpool supporters that are just as childish

omg - he's that much of a diver, you could only find TWO clips



The first one  -  are you just annoyed because we beat you at OT that day and HE scored the winner



The second one - we were 4-0 down and he was desperate, he gets booked because the dive was that bad, he doesn't practice enough to get it right, you know like RONALDO.

He is one of many divers in English Footie ... but the two You Tube clips you showed, ive checked with Arsenal and this is their comments (exclusive) regarding your clips ....



Arsenal News : Adebayor DID NOT dive, diving is cheating. the first clip, his boot lace was undone and the other player stepped on it. The second clip, the grass was very wet and slippery at that end of the pitch, Ade therefore slipped. thank you.

He's a puff just like the rest of the Arsenal players as i witnessed last Saturday when they came to Stoke.The best way to beat these sort of teams is get stuck in them.They don't like it one bit.And now Arsene Whinger is moaning his head off at the Stoke team saying we are a dirty team and Van Persie only deserved a yellow card for bargeing over Thomas Sorenson.If that happened to Almunia. Wenger would want the offender sent off.He does my head in moaning just because we beat them

As a Liverpool fan may I please admit?



That THAT penalty was LUCKY for Liverpool. We dominated the game, yet showed NO goal threat. We are lucky to get that penalty, it was 50-50 and we got it, lucky us.



We dont deserve a point, but I will take it. Sorry Atletico Madrid.

I also want to add to everyone who wants to jump on the "we hate Liverpool and Gerrard" bandwagon, remember corruption in football isnt simply "Have some cash" then the ref instantly throws the game. Gerrard went for the ball, clanged with another player, got a penalty, tough luck. He didnt go looking for a penalty. The ref is to blame for being a knob and NOT Liverpool or Gerrard.



Paying the ref is a very troll answer to why decisions go a certain teams way.

3 Thumbs down? Wow, If this was for YOUR teams, And you got a LUCKY penalty at the end, You wouldn't be saying you didn't deserve it. This guy is only saying we didn't deserve it to get him in with the United fans as some sort of honest football fan...

gotta agree with ya mate! we did play a little better in the second half but as you say,we showed no killer instinct when it came to shooting.our passing was atrocious and we kept getting caught in possession! hell,we played so bad for most of the game it made athletico look like a very good side! maybe if we had gotten that first penalty call it would have been a different story but i cannot see how it would have changed our play very much! i did breathe a huge sigh of relief to see the ref poi9nt at the spot but then i remembered what Stevie's shooting was like all night and immediatly had an anxiety attack! (ok i exaggerated that part...a little bit ! lol) and when the ball did hit the back of the net i found it hard to do anything other than heave another sigh of relief knowing that we did NOT deserve a point from this game from that penalty that should not have been!

If a manager of one of the top four teams sees his team lose a match it is always the ref's fault or the opposition's aggressive tactics, never his own players.



Wenger "I didn't zee it" is one of the worst for this and always looks for the excuse when his side come of second best. Funny how his side never put a foot wrong and are always on the receiving end don't you think?



I think you will see it even more from him this season because Arsenal are looking very shaky indeed and if they continue to trip up against smaller clubs his 11 year reign may begin to look a lot less secure very soon.

3 Arsenal players injured, and had to go off, bad luck or bad tackles - it dont take alot of working out does it. Stoke played dirty, no question about that.



He has every right to moan, thats part of a Managers job.



RVP - deserved the red card, in my opinion.

This is what I love about you supposed Chelsea "fans". So f**kin fickle. The sad thing is that you all claim to be lifelong "fans" and that you supported them back in the days when they really were sh*te, but i dont ever recall knowing so many "fans". You make me sick, f**king gloryhunters. If Chelsea were in League 1, you would all probably be Man Utd or Arsenal fans.

i really don't care about celtic, we will qualify with 3 points of Villarreal or Aalborg. It might do us some good to get beaten tonight so we are up for the arsenal game on saturday. i am going to predict a high scoring draw, possibly 3-3.

The only funny banter on here that isnt football related is Mrs Giggs and now Mrs Uranob. I am honoured to have your presence :P



You are all going on about an idiotic dive, funny cause Gerrard got his head to the ball before flying into the defender.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



There are lots of clean challenges that take a player down.  Why is it always considered a dive when a player falls down?  Maybe Gerrard was fouled, maybe not, but regardless there was little chance that any player would land on his feet after that challenge.  The game is just too fast for 1 referee and two line judges.  I don't think replay is the answer, but what about two box judges on the by-lines?



On behalf of the refs, they know that they can book players for diving.  If Gerrard dived, then the ref should have waved the yellow card.  He didn't, so now everyone is suggesting that Gerrard and the ref are cheating.  Sounds like sour grapes.  The only questionable part of the call was whether or not it was a foul.  I for one think that it would have been a free kick anywhere else on the pitch, so why not a penalty in the box?  But both players were in the air and both went down.  If both went down, then how is the one who was fouled accused of diving?  Jump ball headers are always considered fouls when one player gets to the ball first and the other player hits him and not the ball.  It just rarely happens in the box.  Case Closed.



I agree with Sir Angelo on the point he made about Ronaldo.  Ronaldo was brought down by a clean challenge from a Bolton player.  The player made contact with the ball BEFORE the player, which is clean.  But it inevitably brought down the player too, and the ref wrongfully awarded a penalty.  But just because Ronaldo went down doesn't mean he dived.  And I'm a Liverpool supporter.

Most non-LFC fans probably do.



That said, the ref was an absolute joke.  Two decisions that clearly should have been corners to Liverpool were given as  goal kicks (in Athletico's favour) and then one decision that should have been a goal kick to Athletico was given as a corner.  Then there was the handball by the Athletico player which should have been given as penalty but the one that was NOT a penalty was given as a penalty.



Basically the officials were real clowns today.

no way I hate Liverpool... I'm a true Liverpool fan and have sided with them for ages and don't even imagine siding with anyone else.



A true supporter should support the team in good and bad games...a person that sides with a team just because they win every single game isn't even close to understanding the true meaning of football.



Liverpool can lose every game there is there to play...I will still be supporting them cause every time I see them play I fall in love with football all over again!



And those people who side with a different team every season are complete and total morons cause football isn't about winning its about coming together as a team and win or lose together!

But I have lost a good deal of respect same for the people trying to justify that no justification they didn't deserve it. And Atléti tried so hard and played their jersey to have some crap like that happen. If people were Atléti fans They'd understand and they'd be just as pissed as me if not more. I actually liked Liverpool.

He is a timebomb wiht out a doubt. in his first game back since his suspension, he came on as a sub and went in with some scathing tackles with no intention to play the ball, instead just to injure the opposition. He has not gotten any better since then. There will be an incident this season that will errupt and it will be game over for this lad

A dive is seen at the swimming pool called Old Trafford every match. No need to find a achived video of their too-good-for-olympics diving team, just watch the match later today.



I'm betting my friend $50 that a Man Utd player 'betters' that dive today.

Not only did stevie g not want to stay on his feet, but he clattered into the madrid defender with the intention of hurting him. Should we now re-write the rules, so that as long as you play the ball and throw yourself down while shoulder charging your opponent its a fowl. I have seen keepers get better protection for a lot less, it was as blatent as i've ever seen and stevie g gets away with it on a regular basis. He should be punished by video ref.

Do you think that if you place a bet on a team....?



...to win but then the other teams scores with a controversial penalty that the bookies should pay up anyway?



I placed a bet on Athletic Madrid to win last night, and i don't think it's right that i didn't get my money. Of course the bookies would never pay up as they would love to keep their money but it's hard to not feel hard done by when you witness a decision like that ruin your chances of a bit of money.

No, because despite how much you may think the penalty wasn't deserved it was given and scored.  The result was a draw, the result you gambled on occurring did not occur - it's simple really, you lost the bet.  It's what happens sometimes, maybe the government could bail you out?  They seem to give money away to people who lose out on gambles.

<question>



Has anyone read Steven Gerrard's new book?



Here's some of the testimonials.



"Steve Gerrard's new book, The Cenotes of the Riviera Maya is a must buy for any diver. I keep a copy in the van I use for diving just to show my diving buddies and other divers that I meet, and I have yet to meet a diver who is not instantly taken by it." – Donn Ellerbrock



"Steve Gerrard shows off his consummate skills as a cave diver in a useful and entertaining format. This book is necessary for cave divers and will be treasured by anyone interested in discovering the most beautiful and mysterious place on earth." – Bradley A. Caudle



"Steve Gerrard has created a masterpiece with this book. His knowledge...(is) a blessing to the diving community!" – Angus and Joy Barnhart



Ironically, Steve Gerrard has a namesake in England who also wrote a book about diving.



Here are some of the extracts:



SG: "Players like Carvalho and Ronaldo are damaging football."



SG: "If I saw a team-mate doing it, I would definitely have a word."



SG: "I don't think there's anything worse than a player diving when no one's been anywhere near him. It does ruin the game."

liverpool fans like you and the drunken fool sanction stevie g's actions and excuse it by saying its part of the game, its not part of the game its quiye simply CHEATING and even your manager has blinkers, i feel sorry for the young kids who you influence on here to support cheaters, try turning round and being honest about the incident.



no typical scouser not an honest bone in your body.

Oh dear we have a bitter loser venting his vile Scallypool anger onto innocent Man United fans.



We don't care if you hate us, all that hatred pent up inside makes you lose the next game. We don't hate Scallypool or Chelski fans, we pity them.

Liverpool fans don't you feel a bit embarrassed after that dive from Gerrard ?



Sure you got a point but I would happily take a honest loss for my team in the right way but not like a dive like that which has CHEAT written all over it, its not the first time hes dived ...2005 anyone old enough to remember ? He has just made Ronaldo's dives look honest.

Yeah yeah this is the hundredth time this question has been asked. People should just move on, this type of thing happens in football. Gerrard went to head the ball, as did the defender, they clashed, he fell, wrongfully got a penalty. Life is **** like that, so we move on and not dwell.



And just think, "not the first time he dived, 2005" is much more different to Ronaldo "not the first time...first half?"

DID SUPER G "DIVE"....?



ok ok, i've been reading the comments on skysports and i'm beginning to think what i felt last night was true,which is his falling was "a bit" exaggerated that some of you would call "a dive". sorry, i cant even bring myself to say it. it pains me so!



i dunno, did he? but we did deserve something out of that game just a shame it was awarded to that last challenge and not the earlier hand ball which was clear.



people, what do you think?

I am a Liverpool supporter and my answer is yes. He did dive. Am I embarressed about it?... NO. Maybe he will get the European footballer of the year award. It worked for C Ronaldo.
I don't understand why people are mad at Stevie. With the way the ref was handling the game, I honestly was not suprised to see the penalty awarded. He missed two clear penalties when balls were handled in the box by Madrid players. So people should not be mad at Stevie. Blame the ref.

He dived,
i think the referee thought the A.M player went for Stevie instead of the ball but he definitely dived.



The referee was terrible for both side and there were more the 2 definite hand balls.



Its a pity the game was being refereed by such a terrible ref because it would have been a way more interesting match had the first handball been called.

<question>



Has anyone read Steven Gerrard's new book?



Here's some of the testimonials.



"Steve Gerrard's new book, The Cenotes of the Riviera Maya is a must buy for any diver. I keep a copy in the van I use for diving just to show my diving buddies and other divers that I meet, and I have yet to meet a diver who is not instantly taken by it." – Donn Ellerbrock



"Steve Gerrard shows off his consummate skills as a cave diver in a useful and entertaining format. This book is necessary for cave divers and will be treasured by anyone interested in discovering the most beautiful and mysterious place on earth." – Bradley A. Caudle



"Steve Gerrard has created a masterpiece with this book. His knowledge...(is) a blessing to the diving community!" – Angus and Joy Barnhart



Ironically, Steve Gerrard has a namesake in England who also wrote a book about diving.



Here are some of the extracts:



SG: "Players like Carvalho and Ronaldo are damaging football."



SG: "If I saw a team-mate doing it, I would definitely have a word."



SG: "I don't think there's anything worse than a player diving when no one's been anywhere near him. It does ruin the game."

Also:
"STEVIE: I'M NO FALL GUY
Gerrard gets all confused in The Daily Express, saying: "In my mind it was a penalty," before adding that "if it had happened at the other end, we would have been livid". "



LOL...i loved the way Gerrard gave Kuyt a high five after he won the penalty....did anyone see that? lmao

gerrard "wrote" a book. mmm, maybe put his name to a book written for him, otherwise it would be full of erms and you knows and likes.



but when you are diving you don't speak - oh sorry it wasn't diving apparently it was a collision an a penalty - must get my red coloured specs on
again the ref should have gone to specsavers.

Cristiano Ronaldo's exaggerated tumble was the feature of Manchester United's win over Middlesbrough in Dec 2006. Gareth Southgate described the winger as a serial diver, but when Sky's Geoff Shreeves approached Ferguson for his reaction the response was rather different:



Shreeves: Listen, are you going to do the interview in a professional manner or not? Do you want to do it or not?



Ferguson: You f------ be professional. You be professional. You're the one.



Shreeves: I'm entitled to ask... Cristiano gave the right answer.



Ferguson: F------ hell with your answers.



Shreeves: Don't talk to me like that. Go away. If you want to behave civilly, fine. Don't talk to me like that.



Ferguson: F--- off. (door slams)

gerrard hardly dives, and when he does its all over the news, its the next "big thing" but what about when ronaldo and drogba dive, nobody cares.



and gerrard did not dive, it was a collision. what would you do if you were a minute from losing and you had one chance to score, wouldn't you do anything to get the ball, thats what gerrard did, he moved his body to get the ball and pernia collided with him.

Since MJ's running rampant in the English footy section...?



I've seen this a few times in the Champions League and am sure others have too, you know the way when Barca are losing in a big game(usually in the knockout rounds) say by 2 or 3 goals with 10 minutes left, how come the Barca fans wave white handkerchiefs as if they surrender and are embarrassed by their team? I know they do it when they have seen great play by Barca but this was in surrender and calling for the manager to go

You're wrong, the white handkerchiefs are out when the fans are not satisfied with the president of the club, because of one simple reason... BARCA is PEOPLE'S club..... and those people are the OWNERS of the club.... it doesn't happen only at important games, it was happening at few last games in the last season..... it's not because they are ashamed or embarrassed but because their voice is actually heard and considered and that's why Barca is so unique and definitely More Than A Club!!!!



I'm actually very proud of the fact that people can make the difference and that the people are choosing the future of their club.... only in Barca!!!!!

Should the Stoke City style long throw-in be banned?



It may not be against the letter of the law but it is certainly against the spirit of the beautiful game. Football should be about keeping the ball on the ground as much as possible, creating opportunities through passing and moving. That is why it is called FOOTball! The ugly long thrown-in is all about brawn and no brains. The throw-in is itself an anomaly in football anyway and only derives from its roots in Rugby. It is the only time an outfield player is allowed to touch the ball with his hands and as such, it is about time it was removed. A few years ago FIFA were considering changing the law to allow the ball to be kicked back into play along the ground from the sideline when the ball went out. I think they should have enforced that change. Stoke exemplify everything that is ugly about the game - hoof the ball upfield to the big guy and muscle it into the net, fouling as many of the opposition as possible along the way. They should have shown more respect to Arsenal last week (and the other top teams when they play them) and watched and learnt how the game should be played. I feel the time to ban the thrown-in and, especially the long throw-in that the Stoke City Neanderthal specialises in, has come. It has no place in the modern game. I will be writing to FIFA about this as well. Opinions please!

Me thinks your bitter about this skill yes it is a skill there may be an element of brawn about it but there is accuracy as well if this is banned then so should long goal kicks free kicks that put a ball in the box from the half way line. Teams play to their strengths just because Arsenal can play with the big boys why should FIFA change things to make it easy for them.

While i agree that the throw in is ugly and unimaginative, it is part of the game. At the end of the day, Stoke lost to Man City a few weeks ago so it doesnt work on every team. Teams like Arsenal just do not have an answer to any team which closes them down too quickly or uses excess force to win the ball off them.

ooh my god.
there have always been throw ins, just cos stoke has someone who does it well, you don't like it.
a bit of practice and a few more could do it.
should david beckham have been banned for excellent curving shots?
or pele for being too good.?
maybe john terry shouldn't be such a good defender.?
NOT AT SCHOOL, its a physical sport.
as for arsenal, the football recently has not been attractive, and why should they show them any respect.?
my husband is a gooner and he agrees.
should fulham and hull have rolled over for them too.?
maybe they were tired from the long journey to hull ...?
oops fulham and spurs on the doorstep.
never heard anything so poor.

not all teams have world class players....



if the "smaller" teams played big teams, and these rule changes took place, then there would be no need to managers or tactics, matches would just be decided on ability, and the team with the worst players/least amount of money to buy players would lose....

No, not at all, the throw ins have been part of Football since it started, why change a rule?



The long throw ins that we saw from the Stoke player, will no doubt be being watched by many other teams and being practised by many players in training, and we will no doubt see alot more of them in the future.

No, it's been a tactic since the game began. Arsenal themselves used to use John Radford's long throws back in the 60's and 70's. To ban the long throw would be like banning curling free kicks, if a player has the skill and the defence can't deal with it - tough.

My favurite team is Man U. My favourite player is Vidic, because he is a good defender and he knows how to score with his head and feet. He doesn't use them as often as he should.



How can people bad-mouth Delap he set up most of Stoke's goals, so what if he uses his hands, theres no rule that says he cant. Bolton got loads of goals with Jay Jay Ochka's throw ins a couple of seasons ago and nothing was said.

Why am i always second i can't even be the best diver, that ronaldo gets everything its not fair?



playing for liverpool do you always have to accept second best or even sometimes 4th, and why did benitez buy robbie keane when dimitar berbatov was available, is it a statement of our intent. If you pay peanuts you get monkeys, and a pig with lipstick on is still a pig, robbie keane looked good in an honest team but now we are training him to cheat, but he doesn't seem to be able to grasp the concept.

Who is really to blame for Chelsea FC?



horrid loss



i blame Mikel i never liked that idiot and sure everyone played kinda like crap besides a few, Mikel played like a beginner and he really let his team down yesterday, because he in my book is not a very good holding midfielder i think they should have let Deco play that role instead of or along side Mikel because he was my loser of the match.

No true Chelsea fan would have wrote what you did.
Mikel has been immense for us and has been filling Essien's shoes nicely.



I didn't watch the games but from the articles I've read, it seems we conceded a  "soft" goal early on, tried attacking too much and got punished on the counter attack.



Also, Deco a holding mid?
Have you taken leave of your sense?

This is what I love about you supposed Chelsea "fans". So f**kin fickle. The sad thing is that you all claim to be lifelong "fans" and that you supported them back in the days when they really were sh*te, but i dont ever recall knowing so many "fans". You make me sick, f**king gloryhunters. If Chelsea were in League 1, you would all probably be Man Utd or Arsenal fans.

well i turned off the tv after that display



s.g ran into the back of the defender who was turning round to get ready to head the ball and then gets a penalty



what made it worse for me was in the interview after the match he said he DESERVED!!!  the penalty EVEN BENITEZ SAID THE SAME!!



BENITEZ also said if that was in the outfield then a freekick would be given YEAH FOR THE DEFENDER..!!



how they managed to do that with out laughing is beyond me !



but the look on Gerrards face when asked the question was a picture that will stay with me till the day i die..! HE NEARLY SAID NO I DIDNT DESERVE IT LOL BUT HAD TO THINK ABOUT THE ANSWER LOL



i even said to my missus that if that was a villa player i would be disgusted with the performance

No one would be able to cheat if they used a video ref like other high profile sports.



It appears to me as a football outsider that the football powers that be condone this type of behaviour behind the saying  - it all evens out in a season.



with the money involved in soccer today and the potential for fans violence following poor ref decisions VIDEO ref for certain things has got to be a MUST



Penalties goals and freekicks should be subject to video ref review with punishment for cheaters

Of course Roy keane never chased a referee across a pitch with a posse of United players in tow to berate a referee and cheat him into giving his next decision to Man U did he?



No United are not the devious to ever influence a referee, not like the young referee Ferguson berated and promised that he would never referee again after a League cup defeat several years ago.



That Referee has never been in charge of an important game since.



Get over it, I think it was a penalty, the third that should have been awarded to us last night, I wonder if you will be so critical when the ladyboy starts writhing on the ground on Saturday just like he did against Everton when the sensible Neville hit him with a fair tackle.

having watched it after chelsea's dismal display, i actually couldn't believe my eyes.
what was the ref thinking of?
ok they got the draw, but after all the slagging off from liverpool fans on here of ronaldo and drogba,none will really agree it was awful.
gerrard is a good player and its very sad to see him resorting to this level.
the ref really shouldn't officiate at this level again without a serious eye test.
embarassing for english football.
even worse than the display by spurs v udinese.

Thats too wide a question. A striker has different qualities from a defender who has different qualities from a midfielder. Narrow down your question.

i'm thinking Chelsea have a very good chance to win today



however, despite Roma poor form of late, mainly away, we usually play well at home.
on the other hand, Roma always seem to have a hard time against English opponents...



in my opinion, the outcome cannot be predicted with an educated guess... the match could go either way...

Because there are no decent Welsh football teams at all and Swansea and Cardiff play in the English leagues. Wrexham don't count because they're non-league, tinpot Scouse overspill rubbish.

Joey Barton should be kicked out of football he has had more than enough chances he is never going to change, as for Gerrard what can you do, the only thing they could realistically do would be to review incidents like this and give suspensions accordingly but then where do you stop and not all incidents of diving are as clear cut as most of Gerrards even when you see them a hundred time some people will say definite dive others will say differently (and i don't just mean people who are bias to the teams in question)



I like how Setanta have been really diplomatic with the question, why don't they just come out and say "does Gerrard dive"!?



@ ~VIII~ so your saying because one person dives it's alright for everyone else to? two wrongs don't make a right!



EDIT
@ 'me' - who are you trying to kid you are no Man Utd fan!

and how do you know we don't condemn our own, if you have seen any of my answers to any Ronaldo related question you will know i don't condone anything he does!

1) learn the basic terminology
2) become very skillful very quickly
3) obtain  a professional contract at a top premier league club (as you're good at diving you should be a shoe in at sold trafford)-this will allow you to ''earn'' an obscene amount of money in a very short time

Fitness and quick thinking is what you need.Fitness doesn't happen over night but quick thinking can,so instead of trying to run the ball,try and look for the easy way out and pass it quicker than the player against you.
Start a fitness test and take a long look ans see where you are lacking.It takes time to get back to full fitness,so don't worry just get started and try to be a bit quicker passing the ball and your confidence will return in time

Arsenal are in serious condition missing some pretty important players.with United in pretty good shape at the moment who do you think will win.Last year United only got 1 point with arsenal having a strong squad but not this year. So will SAF get 0, 1, 3 points

I think 1 point



Arsenal are obviously in a bit of a pickle at the moment, but at the end of the day they are a great team and when they get it right, they are magnificent.



If it was at Old Trafford I think United would win comfortably but being at the Emirates I can see Arsenal snatching a point, or maybe even a win.

Everyone, Stop Slating Wenger!!?



I know arsenal are on a very bad run of form losing to hull and stoke and drawing with tottenham, but nobody has anything good to say about them.



Everytime, i hear someone talking about them either on 'your on skysports' or soccer saturday or on the bbc, they say the same thing every time. 'theyre good to watch and play attractive football but they cant stand up and be counted in the more physical matches'.



Some of the time its true but even when they beat fenerbache 5-2, and beat porto 4-0 i think it was, nobody praised them and said how good they were!!



There was even one guy who said they should get rid of wenger and get allardyce, which mad me wee my pants. could stop laughing, wenger is one of the best managers in europe!!



No one in europe can play as good football as arsenal, so they have to kick them, you see it week in week out. - i wont be suprised if we see another incident like the one with eduardo. its a real shame because hes a quality footballer, and by the way who tackles someone from behind and being off the field like the one from shawcroft on adebayor.
disgusting!!



would really appreciate your thoughts!

yeah i agree. I dont care what the media say, its obvious some of them dont like arsenal. I dont really care what non arsenal fans say either, but it annoys me when arsenal fans start talking about getting rid of him. Dont they remember what Arsenal were like before he arrived...and if they dont then they should ask themselves are they only glory hunters. No team can win all the time...the invincible season was a off, never done before and not likely to be repeated.
He asked for more support last week, and that what we should give him. The season isnt over yet.



and yeah how does shawcross escape a red when the ball is out of play, and its a tackle from behind. RVP got a red for much less.



@CFC - what does beating teams by one goal only have to do with anything?? thats ridiculous.. So lets see, the league cup a few seasons ago where chelsea beat arsenal by 'only' one goal...so according to you that trophy probably shouldnt count right? Off the top of my head, i remember arsenal beating liverpool 6-3 in that same cup

Wenger is a great manager but I think what is frustrating Arsenal fans is it is obvious they need to get some experience in the squad Wenger was told in the summer he could spend a lot of money but chose not to. He is stubborn and probably won't change.



Playing pretty football is all good but its results and points that keep everyone happy in the end.



But I agree people need to remember what wenger has done for them and what he will probably do again once his players mature

If no one can't play as good as Arsenal....how come other teams won tonight and you didn't?



not a dig at Arsenal....just a point



and i afraid to say i do agree with that point...they DO play attractive football and good football...but when it comes to a hugely competitive match have they realy risen above and beyond?



i meen if you look at past results...most of there wins over Chelsea , United , Liverpool last season and seasons before have been by 1 goal...i say only them 3 teams as they are probly Arsenals most competitive opponents



i think Wenger just needs to organize his team better....buying a defensive midfielder would be a start.

I was defending him yesterday against an Arsenal fan!



Arsene is legend and does absolutely the best he can with what is at his disposal. He cannot compete with Chels, United, Liverpool and Man City in the transfer market. He has a team of very good boys who can play breathtaking football - but they are boys! and success is at least 2 years away. Gonners should appreciate his problems and support a man who has done so much for them. Any who don't are not true fans in my eyes.

Should Celtic abandon the game for fear of humiliation?



Being from a division that's on par with the latvian league, it's going to end in tears. My personal wish would be that fifth rate teams such as Celtic and Rangers shouldn't be entitled to enter any European competition.



I do feel sorry for them because they do try but they are out of their league in european competitions.



So what say you? I say they should abandon it and withdraw from next years competition as well to save more humiliation.

I hate Chris Foy!!!!?



I know this is a bit random, but i think he should be sacked with immediate effect. hes the worst referee ive ever seen.



going back to the game with man city earlier on in the season, one of the opposing player did 3 consecutive lunges on the man city player which should have been 3 red cards and they didnt ever get 1 free kick for it.



i think if someone were to dicappitate someone with a chainsaw he might about give a foul.

personally i think that teams whave just gone in harder against them because they know that is the only way to interupt they beautiful football, hence all they injuries - they dont just happen. - theyre bad challenges!



but i think its a bit too early in the season to be writing them off, and i think the game against man utd could be a turing point if they win and i have every confidence they will.



i know this isnt what most people think, but wenger has done miracles for arsenal and im keeping my faith.

Always going to be a mtter of opinion this....



3 choices for me....well one of thems more of a candidate.



Diego (Werder Breman) been brilliant most seasons , always scores when needed...gives the team that cutting edge which alot lack



Wayne Rooney: On fire at the moment with his goals for club and country...his temper and attitude on the pitch is still something that needs to be sorted.



Frank Lampard: Yet again...goals in CL and Premiership...always delivers 9/10 when needed....but this is just my opinionated one....

Peter Crouch! No contest!



He has, after all, scored the perfect hat trick when playing for Liverpool against Arsenal - ie 1 goal with left foot, 1 goal with right foot and 1 goal with his head!



Now how many out of the ususal contenders which will be answered (Kaka, Messi, Ronaldo, Lampard etc) can say they have equalled the feat of The Crouch?

I've got to go with Liverpool.  Under Benetiz they are one of the most feared teams in Europe.  You can't ignore the fact, even if your support Man U, Chelsea or Arsenal.  So, I would expect Liverpools good European form to continue, especially since they were beaten at the weekend.  The tops teams normally respond with a good win after a defeat.  Case in point, chelsea.  How good were they after Liverpool beat them last weekend??

It was definitely not a dive but a strong collision.  It was certainly not a penalty.  And I am honest enough to admit we were lucky and did not deserve a point after missing all those chances.



If you want to talk about fairness though then you have to admit the handball by the Athletic player was definitely a penalty.  The ball was hit against the ground by his hand.  "Fairness" is not a one way street and all those who hate Liverpool seem to think it is ONLY unfair if the other team get bad decisions.

Honestly, at game speed I thought it could go either way.  The ref missed 3 handballs total (2 by Atletico and 1 by Liverpool) and didn't call any.  Also, Agger was brought down in the box 2 minutes into the match.  Initially I thought the ref was just scared of calling a penalty that early in the game, but in retrospect, I think he just cowered from calling penalties at all.  Liverpool deserved a goal and were justly rewarded.



Supporters of other teams, be honest, YOU WOULD ALL HAVE CALLED THAT PENALTY A GOOD CALL IF IT WENT FOR YOUR TEAM!!



@Pai Kia



If the ref didn't want Liverpool to lose, why would he wait until the very last minute of stoppage time to call a penalty when he  had plenty of chances to call for [apparently] less controversial spot kicks?  He couldn't be sure that he would even have the opportunity to call a penalty at that point.  Refs don't throw the games, and saying otherwise is sour grapes.

Is Steven Gerrard a cheat ?



Last nights champions league match with Ath Madrid Liverpool were 1-0 down and chasing the game they never looked like they were going to score to be honest.
But when i seen Gerrard chasing that ball down and falling to the ground like he had been sniped i think in my opinion it was a free kick to the the opposing team as the defender had his eyes on the ball and not Gerrard.
So i ask you what you think of it

The Glazers have put no extra money into United. All they have done is added £666m of debt. How does that help to win the Champions League. We'd be better off (and debt-free) if they hadn't bought us.



Before Abramovich, Chelsea had nothing, before the Glazers, united were the most successful English Club of the Premier League era.

True Mack Daddy - when u say that if we say yes then its not true. i won't say yes but i wont say no. My team is AC Milan, they didnt make the champions league, but they are my favourite team. Currently i wont say that they are the best but overall i will - the most successful club in the world. I understand that some people are die hard passionate fans for teams like man u, chelsea, barcelona, but quite alot of them just choose these teams because they win all there game and are one of the best. Best player from this club - Kaka. Not sure if there is anyone better than him, i honestly think he is the best, even if i didnt go for ac milan.

Where would Liverpool and Chelsea be?



Honestly footy fans and particularly liverpool fans, where would Liverpool be right now if Chelsea won the transfer battle for Gerrard a few years back? I mean, would they have found a suitable replacement for Gerrard? And you think Chelsea would have won a quadruple having the most influential player in the world in their squad?



P.S. Gerrard for me is the best english player today. Terry is not that influential as Gerrard. You can see last night against Atletico.

No definitely not... the last straw should have been when he stubbed a lit cigar in a youth team players eye... or when he beat seven shades of **** out of his team mate... or when he beat the crap out someone in the street... i think you get the point, the c**t has had way too many chances and should be banned for life, if the Newcastle owner had any common decency he would have terminated he contract as soon as he was arrested instead of being worried about losing money, any normal person would have lost their job.



What pisses me off more is how many people there still are out there who defend him, they always say he should be given a chance, let him get on with his football, i'm sorry but thats b*****ks he has more chances than any of us would have got, even if Newcastle did fire him i'm sure someone else would sign him apparently a top 10 team wanted to buy him on deadline day it makes me sick get this thug out of football for good!



other than that he is a thoroughly nice chap!

Is Steven Gerrard a cheat ?



Last nights champions league match with Ath Madrid Liverpool were 1-0 down and chasing the game they never looked like they were going to score to be honest.
But when i seen Gerrard chasing that ball down and falling to the ground like he had been sniped i think in my opinion it was a free kick to the the opposing team as the defender had his eyes on the ball and not Gerrard.
So i ask you what you think of it

Although Gerrard has been known to dive many times in the past, on this occasion he did not it was just a collision of 2 players but it was in no way shape or form a penalty, the one thing that is annoying me is all the 'it makes up for the handball that wasn't given' comments by Liverpool fans because what about Mascherano's handball at the other end!

I'm not sure it was a dive, it was a desperate jump for the ball (in my humble opinion), but it certainly wasn't a foul and should not have been a penalty - if anything maybe a free kick to Atletico.



Diving and cheating seems to be more prevalent in the English game now, and I think the culprit is Alex Ferguson and the way he gets his team to harangue referees over every single decision.

terry ran his socks off last night.

we need a new striker or two who is a team player as well.
time for a big shake up.
and sorry but malouda can't hit a barn door , and his final ball is poor.

well my partner is mad with me as i have made him sell his ticket. he has a season ticket and went way over the top with his spending celebrating the wins against united and everton. so he had a choice between tonights game or an away day at the weekend!!! i think you are right about a 1-0 win though, we will do what we have to then go defensive!

Getting new blue 1 this weekend.

Level Headed Thinking...?



Now the main thing coming from Rangers fans so far this season, is that your team are fantastic, Mendes is the best thing since Maradonna (some think he is better), in fact this is the best Rangers team in years.



While you reckon Celtic are in fact the poorest they have been in years, shite in fact and we should wake up and realise this.



So, Rangers fans why are you getting so excited, if as you say, this is the best Rangers team in years, you are only 3 points ahead of (again by your own admission) the shitest and poorest Celtic team in years and also not in Europe, when the shitest, poorest Celtic team is, although admittedly not doing fantastically well.



</question>



<additional details>



It's the final paragraph!



i did say, WHILE YOU RECKON



Ah Strooth, I don't think you'll find too many instances of ME, rabbiting oan about 4IAR and last 8 o the Champs league, I'm quite realistic, when it comes to what a think Celtic are capable off, such as winning the SPL (which would mean 4IAR would it not), not saying we will, saying we are capable, and making the last 16 of Champs League, which we have done before, but is looking like an uphill struggle now, on a good day with a good draw, maybe and a big maybe last 8, but I'd imagine more likely a place in the UEFA cup.



a lot of you Rangers fans on the other hand

the reason i am looking forward to this season is that after a bad start with going out of europe rangers seem to have bucked up their ideas and made some good buys..i hope we win the spl and automatically go into the champions league..i think we can win the spl with the team we have got and that's what i;m hoping for..a title and champions league next season...i personally don't think celtic are too bad..its just that some celtic fans seem to think they are unbeatable..which as we know is not the case..that's all

I dont reckon we are unstoppable but even the greenest of celtic fans have gotta admit that the rangers team is a lot stronger this season, and that they are a bit worried that they may loose the title. what annoys me is the fact that we are both on par (personally i think rangers have a stronger squad) but some celtic fans wont admit that they are an average team and like rangers  have punched above their weight in recent seasons in europe

level-headed indeed....... like your goodself who not long ago were bumping your gums about how you were going to win 4iar and that you were going to reach the last 8 in the champions league.
a 4-2 leathering at celtic park followed by yet another glorious failure in the champions league  put you firmly in your box what you don`t realise is that rangers are on their way up and we waved goodbye to celtic on the way down..

Why do Rankers fans think if we slag them ......?



its only because we can't take defeat?



i  was pissed off we didn't get a point but im also not daft and know we put on a good performance against class opposition and away from home so i'm just happy to be in the championees league and hopeful of at least reaching the uefa......i'm sure the odds are better for us than for rankers



</question>



<additional details>



its fun having a dig at rankers



i dont even recognize who you are slapH so you'll need to ask yahoo about that one or make a point i might remember...i hardly ever use this site but i guess you must annoy some people



Mikettb: theres only 3-4 teams in the epl in a league just about double the size of the spl and in a country ten times the size of scotland........the spl is the most watched league per capita in europe without all the money down south...you see its about football up here, we're real fans, not like most of you english who just follow the money

Please somebody knock out these uncaring emotionless Manchester United Muppets asap in both PL and CL.?



Throughout the start of this season the rest of Europe continued the long footballing tradition of showing emotions and happiness after every goal. Ronadinho in the Milan Derby, Paval Nedved and Juventus in the Champions League Cesc, Torres. The list goes on. Yet the man utd muppets are the only guys that seem to not care. Cristiano's 'im too cool for all this look' is sickening and annoying. Berbatov's  'it was expected' look after his scoring against Allaborg is even more annoying. Even the typically hyper rooney this season has been dragged down by his surely teammates. Wat this team need is losing so they can actually care about winning again.

it was simple for united.
lets just say berbatov had a better second half than the first; his touch, awareness, passing and shooting was much better in the 2nd 45...
scholes' knee collided with another players knee (i think it is ligament damage)
rooney sprained his ankle in their box trying to reach a cross (no AaB player was involved)



Good luck to Liverpool tonight! ;)

yea it was good match, berbatov scored two goals in the second half, one was a pass from ronaldo, the other was just breaking off on his own, scholes got injured by another guy running into his knee but it seems he has just torn ligaments and should be fine, rooney got knocked down then got up again played for a few more minutes then got on the ground and limped off but it seems hes fine and should be playing for england next week, rooney scored the first goal in 22 minutes



everyone was pleased that the score ended 3-0 but alex thought they could have done a bit better if ronaldo had been on the ball more, also he said he was very pleased for berbartov and thinks these two goals will give him a lot of confidence!!



yea arsenal won 4-0 pretty impressive

good. Berba looked good. Scholes is likely to be out for a month or so. Rooney's status is unknown. You missed some brilliant play by our youngin Rafael Da Silva, very nice indeed.

I know they were quite poor but they still managed to get into the Champions League so they must have done something right when they qualified. Arsenal drew with Dynamo Kiev a couple of weeks ago and they were extremely lucky to qualify past Drogheda United in the Champ Lge preliminaries



Chig I watched both legs of Kiev Vs Drogheda and over the 2 legs it could have gone either way especially in the last 5 minutes of the second leg when Kiev collapsed and Drogs had 2 golden chances so don't think Aalborg is way behind Kiev just look at last season when United went to Kiev in the Champs Lge

They've not started well in the Danish Superliga, they're below my team, FC Nordsjaelland, who haven't got off to the greatest of starts either...



They won the Danish Superliga last season, so I think that's why they got the chance to qualify for Europe.



Current EPL team? They're probably more Championship quality.

Didn't they get into the champions league thru winning a lottery?



Doc - What do you mean 'extremely lucky to qualify past droghede'? We won both our preliminaries 6-0, how lucky is that? And Kiev is galaxies ahead of Aalborg
Oh I read you wrong I thought u were saying something like arsenal was lucky to qualify. Kiev has been a regular in the CL tho and they usually do hold off their English opponents at home.

They were terrible i think even Derby would have beaten them! that was such a frustrating match to watch, i'm assuming you didn't watch it as i'm sure you were watching your own team but we should have absolutely battered them the last time i saw the stats for how many shots we had it was on 23 with 9 on target they had had 7 with zero on target, we just couldn't finish for s**t, but i'm sure because it was a 3-0 win people won't remember the performance just like the press will probably focus on Berbatov's 2 goals rather than his unimpressive performance!

unfortunately gave away too many free-kicks away in the lead up too the goal, and the holy Goalie could have been better positioned with the wall at least jumping so he new where it was going...



but i can see both  records being done this year. with the home record being stopped with the draw with Aalborg at home and we will pick up a point or 4 between Old Trafford and the trip 2 Denmark

It's not about formation, it's about style of play, I was quite happy with ours last night.



At the end of the day though, I would rather play shite defensive fitba, if it meant getting to the UEFA cup final, like yous did, but a wid just have tried tae change it in the actual final itself.

Because Strachan set his team out in such away that he didnt want to lose, you cant make allowances for the free kick that was a piece of sheer genius. The difference between the old firm was, Rangers played almost the same way throughout their euro campaign last season one up front, Celtic have tended to play more positive at home and play with a degree of caution away.

bit of a difference?



Celtic were trying something for the first time in a competition that we just cant get a result away from home for over 5 year



the difference being rangers done it for the majority of last season including games with likes of Falkirk,Hearts,Aberdeen in fact all Spl teams including Partik Thistle and QoS in the cups

read a article the other day - the writer said he didn't used to like him, but since in italy he has really warmed to him. he is a character and his parting words were on the lines of come back to the premiership.
love him or hate him, people talk about him . he also makes the effort to learn the language of the country he's working in - as quickly as possible. he's passionate and controversial. what he said about el monaco was so funny. wish he would join in here. i would love love love
him to come back to chelsea.he knows his stuff



on a girlie one - omg he's gorgeous. everyone i know even men and people who don't really like him agrees on that.

Which shop would your club be?



Manchester United : - Sainsbury Superstore: Best option for Out of Towners



Chelsea :- Tesco: Making a desperate bid for world domination and hated for it



Liverpool:- Army & Navy Store: Two opposing forces permanently at war



Manchester City:- Harrods: Expensive , Fancy pretentions but a template to bad taste



Arsenal:- Calais Hypermarket: Cheap Duty free imports bundled through dover



West Ham:- Iceland: Kerry Kotona diet for a Jeremy Kyle crowd



Fulham:- Liberty: Quaint and Traditional but whiffs of old people



Hull:- Lidl : Cheap , no frills , delivers surprising value for money



Newcastle Utd:- Next : Next manager , Next Owner , Next Crisis



Aston Villa:- Morrisons : Never quite appealing as the advert promises



Portsmouth:- TK Maxx : Jumble shop full of old designer name castoffs



Tottenham : -Marks & Sparks : Looks good on the shelf but hideously overpriced



Everton :- Thomas Cook Travel : Threatening to go under in the credit crunch any day



LA Galaxy:- Victoria Wines : only explination for David Beckham going there

Arthur Davidson, of the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Corporation, died and went to heaven. At the gates, St. Peter told Arthur, "Since you've been such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is, you can hang out with anyone you want in Heaven."



Arthur thought about it for a minute, and said "I want to hang out with God."



St. Peter took Arthur to the Throne Room, and introduced him to God. Arthur then asked God, "Hey, aren't you the inventor of woman?" God said, "Ah, yes."



"Well," said Arthur, "You have some major design flaws in your invention.



1. There's too much inconsistency in the front end protrusion.
2. It chatters constantly at high speeds.



3. Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much.
4. The intake is placed way to close to the exhaust.



5. The maintenance costs are outrageous."



"Hmmmm, you may have some good points there," replied God, "hold on."
God went to his Celestial Supercomputer, typed in a few words, and waited for the results. The computer printed out a slip of paper and God read it.
"Well, it may be true that my invention is flawed," God said to Arthur,



"but according to these numbers, more people are riding my invention than yours."

Well we have got the usual idiots saying my clubs biggest, mine has won this that and the other when the question was which is most popular, can't you idiots read. Arsenal are the most popular because they play good quality attractive football and Man U are the least popular because apart from the glory hunters who claim to be supporters everybody else who likes football hates them because of their arrogance

To be honest, I did, in fact I had a dreaded premonition there might be 5 minutes injury time and they might actually win the game! Fortunately I was wrong! But I disagree with Strachan that they can forget the last 16.....he'll just have to eat humble pie and ask Walter how to win an away game.

Honestly Gers fans where you a little jealous last night or what?



Lets face it guys Celtic and Rangers in the Champions League 'Its all about being in it' Is it not. None of us will ever win it again but the buzz you get of seeing your team against Europes elite is fantastic. Ok we where well beaten last night but that was a team top of the Spanish championship so no shame there. Lets face it its not as if it was Kaunas or Partick Thistle. Roll on Man Utd.
P.S. How was Coneheads guys. Sorry couldnt resist it.

Jealous are you crazy man - I was F**KING LOVING IT !!!!!
When we went out to Kaunus youse all started your p**h about "are the Rangers fans going to enjoy watching Corrie, The Bill, etc on Champions League nights?"
When in fact what I have been doing - and I know Bluebell, Bluenose, & WeeGer have prob. been doing the same - is watching Septic failing miserably, and as I've already said, F**KING LOVING IT !!!!!!!
While obviously feeling sorry for youse at the same time. lol, as if !!!

Any team can beat any other team on a given day. Technically Celtic Park is hard to win at and they've beaten lots of big teams there, however as of right now I consider ManU favourites.

I am an avid fan of the game in general , the home grown players stay on their feet and stumble on if they can , if a foriegn player / team are having a hard time getting a goal ,then its play acting and theatrics ,Senna had a legitimate free kick a few minutes earlier , and put it wide purely because it was in the wrong position for a shot on goal ,however he made sure he hung about the right position til he "won a free kick"that he could do something with.Remember the Italian national anthem translated roughly goes like this(to the tune of lord of the dance )
Dive,dive where ever we shall play.
We roll around feigning in..ju..ry.

Spiting the dummy out now, it was no dive, there was quite clearly contact although he went down easy. But that sound familiar in Scotland, the term went down easy, and it applys to several players with-in the Celtic squad.



If a Celtic player comes out with such a statement, although its the Sun remember, a gutter press newspaper that exaggerates story's, they write what Celtic fans want to hear (it sells there paper) But my point is, if this is the mentality of the Celtic team that feel they were robbed from a dive, but they clearly do it every other SPL game, what hope have the rest of us got? If it is Ok for them to do it, but not the rest?

Not really, I'm mean listen to any manager after any game where theres been a penalty given against them or one they didn't get and their full of one sided bias and how hard done by they are.



Its in the heat of the moment and passion about football though that these things get said, doesn't everybody come out with things like this when they've been beaten?



Is it not natural to feel aggrieved after a defeat, your hardly going to way up the pros and cons, of people that have maybe dived in your team, against a recent desicion that has affect the game and go "well fairs fair, we have dived in the past, so this is only fair, that we will get it against us every now and again"

Was it wise for United to spend 30 million pounds on Berbatov....?



.. for 2 goals worth 15 million each against a plain Danish team?



If I was Ferguson, I would save at least one of the two 15 m goals for Liverpool..

yes it was, last season we didnot have a proper striker like ruud van nistorooy, rooney wanted to help the defence, tevez wanted to be everywhere so it was ronaldo who scored most of the goals for us



now that we have him we can have a striker at front all alone plus he scored 2 amazing goals yesterday

Keane is class. He was marvelous on Saturday. What a wonder flick.



It will take a Liverpool striker 3 consecutive hat tricks in one game before these Man United delusional idiots admit they might possibly be good.



Keane hasnt scored a goal, who cares, he sets up many and works hard.Berba doesnt run, he pounced on a FREE GOAL.



Keane is way better than what these idiots think

One day there was a player called Robbie Keane. He put on rose tinted glasses, and then hoodwinked a defender to cross a ball to Torres who slotted it home. Then, he saw a United fan who was blind amongst others saying Keane was a rubbish player.



His eye got itchy,so he scratched it, and didnt give a crap

You are being a bit harsh.



Everyone went on about Berbatov because of the Keane comments.



I kinda thought up a reason to me.



ME myself rates Liverpool players for that they do. Most United fans only feel better about their players when they are going on about how they are better than the Liverpool counterpart.



THIS IS COMPLETE RUBBISH. If it is the case, then Zaki is worth more than 30mil Berba!



Keane and Berba are such different players..I never compare them. I never justify Keanes goal drought as "well,ROONEY DIDNT SCORE EITHER"



Maybe it is because they played together but they arent the same style of player!

Yes i did, very good game, made up for Saturday's bad game.



Robin, in my opinion, goes through stages of good and bad, but last season was basically a big no no because of his injuries, so far so good this season, and RVP being 100% fit (fingers crossed he stays that way) is a striker that is one of the best in this Country.



Theo Walcott ... excellent game also, and Gael Clichy, super defending, very quick and saved a Porto goal that Almunia missed .. brilliant.

1; celtic
2; rangers
3; hearts
4;kilmarnock
5;aberdeen
6; hibernian or motherwell

It would really have to be Hearts, they've won the scottish cup twice in past 10 years (98,06) and been the only team to break Celtic and rangers from finishing 1st & 2nd since 1994.



Although saying that each season seems to see a new team finishing 3rd and looking the part, then the next season, they just fall away, motherwell, hibs, aberdeen have all managed this.

Agree with Krissy, we are never going to win the champs league, so why get so excited about getting out of the group to play 2 more games against Barcelona, Inter Milan etc in the last 16 and go out.



If we went into the UEFA Cup, we would stand a better chance of staying in Europe for a longer period, giving us more enjoyment from pro-longed envolment and help ours and Scotlands co-efficient points.



Who knows if a one dimensional 10 men behind the baw team can get to the final, whats to say we don't stand a good chance, mind you there was no AC Milan in the comp last year!

What makes you think it is looking 'likely'?



They could easily take little/no points before they travel to Denmark leaving them needing a win out there = Celtic winning away in Champions League! hmmmm



As tattie heed said, in terms of success, The UEFA Cup (as Rangers proved) would be the better option for Celtic because chances are, they would be humped out of Champions League in the last 16 anyway if they were to scrape through

Q2 : I doubt it, but you never know, in this weird game called Football.



Q3 : 75% - wow, didnt know that ... something for the training sessions i should hope. Height doesnt matter in my opinion, just the ability for the defenders to be quick to stop goals from the opposition team.

Some men will kick a ball. A few goals may be scored. One side or the other will win, or maybe they'll draw. A lot of meaningless waffle will be spouted by commentators before, during and after the event. Business as usual!

I would tell him to start coming off Torres,and be hungry for the ball in attacking manner,as that is when Keane is at his best.The more games with the way he's playing it will zap his motivation,once his 1st comes then you'll see a more predatory finisher in Liverpool folklore,as with Torres,Kuyt,Gerrard,Reira,Mascarano etc etc Liverpool have got a balance.



What the fuc am i saying am a City fan,i hope he dont score

No Arsenal does not always come up short. Arsenal has delivered the goods. An unbeatable season, something that I highly doubt will be accomplished for a long long time.



And would you not forgive your otherwise loving father for unfortunate mishaps(a bundle of injuries) and things not in his control(refs, like the Pool game in CL and other incidents) ?

A little bit.But I doubt a father who taught you all of that would forget your wedding or your birthday.He might forget to tell you girls would get pregnant on their periods,but most dads would forget to tell you as well.



Arsenal has risen up to the occasion in the past,but in recent years they've always failed when it mattered most.So I can see a little truth in that.

I'm disappointed in Bendtner he is a great player but sometimes he looks out of form his last touches kill him almost every time he did play a great ball to Ade but what else



Van persie what a player



people get excited about the 2 goals Berbatov scored against a weak team RVP scored two against a good Porto side see the difference



Vela is class he rarely makes mistakes- good touches -great movements =along with Walcott the future Barca player LOL much respect

there are a lot of angry spurs fans around at the mo (i wonder why) and they took a lot down to pompey. i heard they were going mental outside as well. they have always hated campbell and he got a bit of a roasting, it was not racial just questioning his sexuality. defoe was cheered all through by the spurs fans which did not get a mention.

Unlike man united fans, liverpool fans have the intelligence to realise that a player should not just be judged on their goal tally alone. We don't care who scores the goals, as long as the team wins. Keane played a huge part in our win against Everton, and luckily Liverpool fans aren't glory hunters with the attention span of a flea who only judge their players on how many they score (Yes, I'm talking about manure fans.)

Highly doubt it. Watched it with my cousins they complained the whole time and asked too many questions. Told them they were more than free to leave the room. I did get one cousin into both baseball and American football (my crowning achievement) Lots of Americans (as you all know) do not "get " football. That's fine it isn't for them, and obviously isn't for you. If they ban football you'll still have rugby and...cricket. I guess that's great.



I come from a west-indian family who would die for cricket, but I'll never understand that game. To each their own.

It`s cheaper to do what Man Utd do... just bribe the refs.. they can get a penalty for as little as £10k, or a free kick on the edge of the box for just £2k. It`s cheaper than buying expensive strikers.

All players in the premiership are over-priced.



Tottenham totally saw man utd and liverpool coming and stumped up the prices like what most clubs do when one of the top money men come calling.



Cut all them prices in half....thats what they are worth. Torres would be worth around £18m in a european market.

Apparently Chelsea put in a cheeky bid of £50 million at the end of last season but it was rejected without a thought so Liverpool think he's got to be worth a lot more than that.



It would be interesting to see if the owners with all their financial troubles can turn down a concrete offer from Man City of around £70 million plus in January.



We all know Rafa would say no but he hasn't got the purse strings!

Why some people doubt that Deco is the best MF in EPL...?



.... I didn't even watch the game against Portsmouth and I didn't know about his CRAAAZZZY goal until I posted a Q about him an hour ago BUT.... to be honest he doesn't have any competition there, Gerrard, Cesc and that's it.... Deco won CL with two different clubs and was La Liga Champion with Barca..... he was LA LIGA Champion, EPL will be a piece of cake for him.... Deco is too good for EPL, he should go to Serie A, like every great player before!!!

2. Lampard
3. Fabregas
4. Ronaldo[i hate him]
5. Gareth Barry

Deco is below all of them. What he has done with other clubs doesn't matter really, you can say that even Ryan Giggs is better than all of them lol

Well first of all soccer is called "football" almost everywhere in the world except for the US.. in which soccer is called well soccer.. and football is the well-known NFL. The rest of the world calls this sport "american football". Now soccer (football), is played mostly with player's feet, actually a hand contact with the ball in-play is penalized, only the goalkeeper is allowed to do this and only in certain parts of the field. On the contrary football (american football) is played mostly throwing the ball with player's hands, of course both have exceptions like a field goal (kicked) in football and



a side throw (handed) in soccer. Also in soccer a goal equals a +1 score, in football a field goal equals +3, a touchdown equals +6 plus a +1 or +2 depending on the play immediately performed after a touchdown.



Hope this gives you a clear perspective on the main differences.

Probably

McManus is solid without being world class and lacks a touch of pace

Caldwell is probably the 'weak link', can play really well but far too often makes silly mistakes which costs Celtic dear at times, appears clumsy and also nervous when under preasure.

Tamas would of been the ideal player to try alongside McManus, sadly for Celtic, this move seems dead in the water, haven't seen enough of Loovens to pass judgement on him yet...

I think the opposite, I think Caldwell on his day is a much better player than McManus. He plays the ball out of defence well and can also spray a good long distance pass upfield and cross relatively well. Yes he makes the odd mistake, which unfortunatley always seems to get highlighted, but Micks positional play often causes us the bloody problem in the first place.

McManus in my eyes is not Celtic captain material, medicore player, too quiet, lethargic, slow and clumsy.



Get Loovens in with Caldwell, aand make Caldwell captain, and git Mick tae feck.

we need one good player to make our club complete. we need silva and not barry! robbie keane is overpaid. and he is old. we could of brought a decent striker for half that amount maybe huntelaar or even david villa for £30million.

7-1 is very good odds. Whatever happens we are a top 4 club and capable of winning the title. However I don't think that this is our year.

They could be 700/1 and I still wouldn't back them.
As far as I'm concerned Liverpool are still a country mile behind Man Utd and Chelsea and have absolutely no chance of winning the prem.
I grew up watching great Liverpool teams, but that was over 2 decades ago and despite their great history, Liverpool have to finally realise that winning the title is not a right, but a privelage that has to be earned!

They are only 7/1 because 1980's glory hunters now have cash to burn. 12/1 would be fairer with Arsenal at 14/1.

I can't see beyond Chels and Man Utd and the former represents better value for money.

being a gambler i think the bet is liverpool +9 points 15/1 to win the league.

7/1 sounds generous but the draw has exactly been kind to them, and benitez will dabble again, keane is by no stretch of the immagination the messiah and it would appear that most fans have simply forgot about injuries.

7/1 seems reasonable to me. I doubt if we will win it this year, I would be happy if Liverpool stay in the title race for most of the season and finish three or four points behind the top spot. That will leave well placed for a serious assault on the title in 2009/10.

How can I now see EPL football in Indonesia as Astro TV don't have the rights?



This seems to be an annual problem here, with rival companies cutting each other's thoats for the rights, but this time it seems no-one has them. Astro didn't even have the decency to warn customers. Internet connections are slow and unreliable here too, so streamed games don't seem to be a viable option. If anyone can tell me any provider still operating here or a way to get satellite pictures from abroad, I will build a cathedral in your name (or maybe just be eternally grateful!) It is outrageous that the 4th most populous nation in the world can't watch the largest and best sport in the world. Thank you very, very much in advance for any help.

Yes, it should be.

All the players are frustrated at that point and can scream and swear at the referees.

The captain is chosen because he is calm in most situations and he has great communication skills. If he alone goes and talks to the referee he will be able to get the point across more easily and clearly, rather than all the players screaming.

Yes.  There is too much player intimidation.  i Think it was Mark Halsey that had a barrage of players from Chelsea surround him.  If this was any other 'job' players would be dismissed from employment due to bullying.  I am not saying that refs can't handle a situation but what i am saying is that why should they?  Would you if you were being harrassed at work take it - i doubt it very much It would be straight to a lawyer or your union official and compensation would be the minimum that you would expect from your employer.



If refs started to issue red cards for this it would soon stop.

Any player should be allowed to communicate with the referee just as long as they don't get in the ref's face and/or verbally assault him. If that happens the referee shouldn't hesitate on a yellow or red card.

Is this not being introduced this season?

It works perfectly well in rugby (union only I think); and there is no reason why it should not be implemented immediately.

The refereee has 22 overpaid wimps on the pitch who believe there way is the true way, and intimidate the refereee to follow their reasoning.

Not only should the refereee only have to speak to the captain, BUT if any other player tries to interefere with this process, they should be booked, no verbal caution, straight into the book. A few of these should stop the Drogbas, Gerrrrrrrrard (bad example he is captain) and similar from "trying it on".

Yes.

It helps prevent intimidation of the referee and makes the game a more civil occasion.  I have children, I do not want to see them watching loads of players swearing at a referee.

It also would prevent a disgraceful recurrence of the events when Gustavo Dezotti's red card was shown in the 1990 world cup final.  No referee should ever be treated like that, worse that it was in the world cup final.

yes i think so. i mean take a team like chelsea now when jonh terry, the captain, TRYS & talks to the ref ALONE some how ALL the chelsea come up to the ref & talking to him. why idk. but its not just them. i mean i think personally the captains TRY & just talk to the ref, but it turns out of hand cause then either the other team hear something that the captian said & doesnt like it so they but in. or their teammate hears something they ref said & doesnt like it so they but in. then it just turns nuts & yellows & reds fly out like theres no tomorrow. i think its hard for the captains to just talk to the refs alone cause both of the teams players are surrounding them. but i do think it would be a good idea to let the captain just talk to the ref, so that reds & yellows wont be flying out like crazy or worse fights...

Sure! It saves the game from degenerating to a free for all.  You can imagine if Rio's trying to lay a complain midly and 'badboy' Rooney isn't going to have much patience, we could end up with more abandoned games due to on-the-pitch violence... Get my drift?

No, what a daft idea. It's almost as daft as saying there should be two referees on the pitch.

EDIT:
____
Yeah bring on the thumbs down. Imagine having two referees on the pitch, twenty-two players on the pitch, but only one player - the one captain of each team - can to talk to TWO referees. Yeah makes perfect sense to ask these dumb theoretical questions. Yeah bring on the thumbs down.

In a perfect game, there should be no reason for communication to the referee by players. However we do not live in a perfect world.

There are requirements for clarification of referees' wishes and decisions. These should be adequately handled by the Team Captain. Rugby grasped this one by the horns many years ago and it works.

In Rugby backchat sees a penalty advanced by 10 metres, scrums changed to penalties and penalties reversed. In extremis it sees a player dispatched to the "sin bin". You NEVER see the ref getting harrassed!

The only surprise in Football is that the rule has not been brought in!

Nor do we yet see the sin bin, which would be a much more appropriate punishment than the current Yellow Card. A prompt punishment, commensurate with the offence, gives the offender time to reflect and cool down, while removing the fear of accumulated demerits, leading to bans.

This is desperately needed in football.

It works perfectly well in rugby and of course the captain must also refer to the referee as "sir". If other players have something to raise with the referee they do so via their captain. A perfectly sensible chain of command.

It would return some respect and order to the game. The way some players behave like thugs and yobs rushing into and getting in the face of the referee is a disgrace to football.

It should be limited to both captains of both the teams cos as we all know a story always has two sides to tell, so based on both comments of the captains and what the ref has witnessed, he should be able to make a clear judemental decision.
But for example the incident when drogba slapped vidic and all chaos broke out, how can only the captain of either team try and talk to the ref when there is chaos on the pitch?

Nobody should. In my many years of watching football I have never once seen a player getting a ref to change his mind, not once. Only an Assistant ref has managed that. So why are the players wasting their bloody time. It will make no difference. The only result of communication with a ref from a player that I have seen is a booking.

Only a footballer could be so stupid and ignorant to not realise that all his mouthing off will make no difference. Just get on with the game. it is the people who pay to watch that makes the money to pay them, so get on the friggin game and stop wasting time you stupid ignorant little ball kickers

No - because if the ref wants to book a player, then would he have to do this through the captain?

Footballers are very passionate about the game (albeit over paid in many cases) and communication should be with all 11 players and not just one.

Being a Pompey supporter i hope obviously we'll win this. And we have a bigge chance of beating them on Sunday then we do when we meet them in the league early on.... Both teams will worry about injury so it wont be a full on affair i doubt, but we'll see. Also you have to rememebr Man UTD put out a B/C team against us in Nigeria and beat us easily... which is slightly worrying

because entertainment makes money, and they are the entertainers for the 3.5 billion people that watch football, especially during the WC, but if you equate there earning to other sports stars they really don't make that much. The max earner in football makes less then an above average baseball player. Almost all american sports, the players make more then footballers do

Well to answer your question. it's because its the most popular sport in the world. so many people are interested in it so it brings in more revenue and since there is so much money all they can do with it is pay the people that actually make it worth while. That's why they are paid so much!

They have a special skill (well, some do) and their careers are potentially short lived, And face it when Shrek, I mean Rooney is too old, hes not going to be able to become anything else is he. I would be surprised if him or his ditzy twat missus can even spell their names. God help any offspring, Her looks his brains, kids stuffed. His looks, her brains, kid stuffed! The Premiership players are paid too much and the amateurs, far too little. They need to spread the wealth around the entire game, not just the popular clubs.

It is immoral how much many footballers are paid. Wages in excess of £100,000 per week are ridiculous at any time but especially so during a period of financial strife.However, the laws of supply and demand allow for this to happen for you only have to compare footballers such as Ronaldo, Rooney. Terry etc with film stars and you can appreciate why it happens. Of course some people in our society deserve higher wages than footballers but we have allowed it to happen by supporting teams by paying huge entrance fees and watching them on TV. If gates fall appreciably and people stop watching football on TV then  possibly things may change.

You've paid a ridiculous sum for carlos,now your going to get mr Berbatov for another silly sum.They should sell old ronald as the same thing will keep cropping up again at the next window.If his form deserts him as well then MU will have to sell him for quarter of todays valuation

That's what i think every blooming day, but we have technically completed the signing of Tevez on a permanent contract, and we also got that Italian youngster from Roma David Pettruci who was supposed to be their best youth player. I hope we sign a proven goalscorer before the deadline though, i am getting impatient. However, having said that i think we have got some fine young players and good backup but the extra firepower would come in handy.

Season has just started its good to be in front but celtic should watch out the team is in dissaray the now like rangers not playing well hopefully it gets better a good title run is better than winning by a mass of points but the champions league for celtic is a no brainer unless they get a favourable draw the away games will be good for nothing but sightseeing if the giros can stretch that far

It wasn't just down to Manchester United's inabilities. Newcastle stopped them from playing and were always dangerous on the counter attack.
Oh and Newcastle had Owen and Viduka out, and Enrique had a slight knock.
Manchester United also scored their goal when we only had 10 men.
Us Newcastle fans don't expect titles or champions league. All we want is decent attacking football. In the end we pay our money to go and be entertained. Could you imagine paying x ammounts to watch Bolton, Wigan, Hull, Stoke, Chelsea last year? It would be boring, that is why Allardyce and Souness were gone so quick.

Means nothing Man Utd are notoriously slow starters these days plus they proved last season that without Ronaldo they struggle. Newcastle fans shouldn't get their hopes up...

Great point for KK and the Geordies, i certainly did`nt see that coming, but a long hard season still lies ahead for them. Bad start for Man Utd but just look at what happened last season .

You want to get good boots, but they're not everything, so they won't help with your skills, but total 90 shoot are really good and they're relatively cheap, but if price isn't a problem I'd go with the total 90 laser's because they're the same series but just better, but they are more expensive!

Some good boots are the adidas predator series, the total 90's and the mercurial vapors. The most important thing is comfort and that really is determined by the shape of your foot compared to the boot. Try lots of boots on and pick the most comfortable one. If you buy kangaroo leather (used by most boots over $150) by half a size small or really snug. It will expand to fit the shape of your foot. Always go for real leather shoes, they are more durable and have better ball feel. Control, Power, speed, shooting is really up the the player. All that technology doesn't really help you that much, though it is to run in lighter shoes. If you don't mind being traditional, the air legends and adipures are great boots.

Is £30 million Cheap in Football now?



Many players in recent years have been touted as potential transfers exceeding $£30 such as Adebeyour, Shevchenko, Henry etc. During the mid-late 90's youd never hear of much exceeding 20 million (except in the case of Ronaldo or Vieri) which is todays equivalent of 50 mil. So is 30mil a bit run of the mil now?

No it it is definitely not cheap.Not many clubs can afford that type of price tag and those that can wont give it up easily.There has been a downturn in prices in the last couple of years and most clubs are watching their purse strings.It seems to be on the rise again but new owners especially in the english clubs will baulk at spending that type of money.There will be exceptions of course for exceptional players but £30 million is a lot of cash and if i was running a club i would have to look long and hard before spending that kind of money.

Now a days Clubs want to know to what other club they are selling to... Once they know how potential you are then they will try to get rich through your budget.

There is no way any of the named players can be sold over that price if the the club requesting their service is Birmingham or Sunderland.

An alternative view of Utd vs Celtic?



My dad and mum got hospitality at tannadice for this one on account that my mother works in the chemo ward at Ninewells it wasna until later she told me there were extra places that i could've had. Anyway the first have both teams as CL says canceled one and other out! ...... lets cut the cr@p there is only one talking point that matters even the "pundits" including the celtic "pundits" on the radio after the game were trying to remember the last time another team had a controversial decision in there favor against either of the old firm do they need to bring out a mallet and bluget a United player for us to get a pen I'd go aff to if i was the match ref after that howler! Even the old firm fans are starting to admit there's a problem for christ sake and these people want a wage increase!

even Dougie Fordice would have given that pen today (for Dundoinians only)



Utd though were played alot better this week i think Dods days are numbered I dont see CL ever dropping Kenneth again, flood had a poor game by his standards the two front men look like will grow well together but when Sandaza is fit I'm sure he will start good to see conway back init.



If we played with a quarter of that passion today on monday night we would have beat hamilton who are proving no mugs.

All teams should start believing they can beat the two teams from Glasgow, even if they do have to beat the referee as well. Then they WILL be beaten more often and another team or teams could win the league.

£50 million pounds....

I would buy Luton Town for about £5 (those stadium seats have some value), then sale the stadium to Tesco's for £10 million.

Then I would buy Setanta Sports and only show Women's soccer matches 24/7 covering all levels of the pyramid.

I would love to land Messi at Old Trafford, but he would cost way more than 50m pounds. So I guess, with 50m I would go for Berbatov and Fabregas. That would add more flare to Man United.

Croatia just beat Germany 2-1 to take first place in the group and pretty much put them into the next round.  Assuming they win or tie the their next game against Poland they would take on the Czech Republic (2nd from Group A).  If they get past the Czechs then I think they have a real excellent shot of winning it all.

Croatia certainly suprised me with their energy against Germany. I think if they keep up their momentum we might see them into the semi-finals..I'm not sure about the finals though. I would be really pleasantly suprised though. They fought for the win today and it was impressive.

Theo Walcott.....The new Theo-ry Henry ?



Do you think Walcott can be the next Henry ? Or even come close ? lol I see hes got his hair-cut like him, and the way of taking on defenders is a bit like the way Henry did when he was 21 and 22. Theo is only 19, and has about 15 years of football left in him. I can see him becoming one of the most feared players in the Premiership, bit more of ball control & strength to muscle out defenders and he can be a great player. From what he did last season at Anfield, like a bullet beating 6 defenders, one after the other to set up Adebayor.... he has already shown what hes all about. I'm not comparing him to Henry or anything because he got the #14 shirt [I am against that]..Do you agree with me ? Will Theo Walcott be one of the, if not the most feared player in the Premiership in a few years ?



Thanks for any answers :D

your comparison is really interesting, but I think he is very far from henry (emphasis on henry's outstanding days in arsenal) at the moment,  and theo's potential doesn't let him be a superstar.

As a Tottenham fan, I think Ramos should let him go. 
He is causing a problem in the dressing room, and I think that Bent can do the job this season.  We will definately need a new striker though as injury cover, and I think that is why tottenham are stalling. 
I am not sure where he will go to, but on yesterdays performance of united, they need him bad, but also I would want him to leave the Prem, as it is not ideal to sell your best players to the opposition you are trying to beat for a CL spot this season.

Probably because they keep abusing other members and get barred so have to open up other accounts.
This truly is a place where the narrow minded hide behind a screen and attack other members because they were probably the victims of bully's when they were younger and only know how to lash out at others rather than discuss it like ADULTS

Hmmm , well im not sure how to convert your money exchange but I do know some cleats that fit your description. Well first of all do you have a wide foot? If you do you will be looking for DIadora or Joma. But if you dont and your foot can fit into nike/adidas and anyother shoe then I would recommend : T 90 Laser II, for accuracy they opened up expensive but I would believe they might be a little cheaper now. Mesh (to breathe), expandable, and a increased sweet spot. The Adidas Predator is built for speed and ball control. WIth comfort. The ultimate power boot around is the Adidas Predator PS TRX FG. You can go online for all of this, because Adidas has a good boot period. They design specific ones for specific things so listing them all would be pointless. But i would go with some kind of Adidas predator.  And let me just inform you that (this is factual) NIKE leather is the best. You may of known this already but the nike leather is better then kangaroo. It doesnt hold water (so you dont get weighed down), and it is supposed to give you a better touch. The top  nike boot would be the Nike Air Legend II (2), again I dont knwo your price range. This boot has a good control, and a powerfull shot. If your looking for comfort try the Tiempo Mystic from Nike. I also have to agree that any boot from nike that is comfortable for you will probably work out. Well thats all I have for now. I have a Diadora pair right now and I am more then satisfied, mainly because i have a very wide foot. But remember its not about the boot its about the player wearing them.

Some current ones:- David Batty - Paul Dickov - Marcus Bent - Olivier De **** (c o c k)

But best of all without any doubt is Kaka

Then you also have:Danny Shittu
Ally Dick
Rod Fanni
Jack C.ck
Arthur Bottom

And let's not forget best of all another Brazillian: Argelico F.cks.
 Yes it is spelt like that with a u in it but this system will censor it even though it is someones real name.

WHY THUMBS DOWN. JUST GOOGLE ANY OF THEM AND SEE FOR YOURSELF, FOR EXAMPLE FANNI WAS A FRENCH FOOTBALLER. GO ON GOOGLE IT INSTEAD OF PROVING YOUR IGNORANCE, YOU D.CK HEADS

There's a lot of great athletes whose names mean the wrong thing in the country in which they play.  A lot of Japanese players have names like Yamashita (Yah-mah-SHEE-tah) or Fukudome (Foo-koo-DOH-may) that don't work well in U.S. baseball.  Then there's the Slovak hockey player Miroslav Satan (Sha-TAN), who, ironically, not only hasn't played for the New Jersey Devils but usually plays very well against them.  (To my dismay: I'm a Devils fan.) Then there's Bob Owchinko, who pitched for the San Diego Padres, then washed out, and signed with a team in Japan, unaware that "Owchinko" sounded like their word for, how shall I put this... insufficient equipment.

But Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite, alias Kaka (Kuh-KAH), a man of deep faith, should thank God he plays in Brazil (national team) and Italy (AC Milan), and not in the U.S. where commentators can make snide remarks about his name sounding like a slang term for crap.  Which is too bad, because he's a fantastic player.

Help for college soccer... how can i gain exposure even though i dont play school ball?



I'm going into my senior year of high school and im really interested in playing or at least trying to play in college. The only issue is i dont play for my school team because of the politics involved.  To get an idea of my skill level i played 2 years of freshmen in 8th and 9th grade (starter the second) and 1 year of jv in 10th grade (also started) before i became fed up with the unfair treatment by the coaches.



Right now i am playing for a local club team and wil lbe playing in a u21 winter league with college players.  I was wondering if there are any other things i can do to gain some exposure to college scouts or coaches even though i'm not playing for a school team which puts me at a disadvantage.
any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

Well with all due respect it's pretty obvious you're not going to get a full scholarship to a division I program or anything like that. Find out if there is any Division III/NAIA college programs in or near your area, visit their website, contact their coach, send him your resume, and try to get him to come out and watch you play. Also, try going to college soccer camps to gain exposure. Best of luck mate

Depending on which chart you use, in the U.S. it was either "Hanky Panky" by Tommy James & the Shondells or "Wild Thing" by the Troggs (a British group).  Either way, a better song than either of those British chart-toppers.

Athough if that happens Levein will probobly be taken by a club down south or even by the team that finshed 3rd

Rafael was immense, and Fergie said he was sensational(he must have been really good to get that compliment). Fabio took a while to settle in, but he was good as well. I wish he'd have played 90minutes like Rafael, so we'd have gotten a better comparison, but both are really good, looking forward to seeing them play more. I'd say with O'Shea, Silvestre, The twins, Jonny Evans, our defense is well covered.

I watched last night game for free at http://asiaplatetv.com. You can get it there.



You just need to download some p2p programs to watch or you can choose no plug-in to watch it directly. P2P programs will give you clearer picture but no plug-in will buffer faster. However either way will let you watch the match.

you sure have a point but being rated as one of the best players or the best player on current form would result in alot of folks talking about your every move on and off the pitch but if you ask me it's really annoying now.

This weekends league matches?



Chelsea v Portsmouth. Nearing the end of the second half, the ball went off the feild, last touched by a Portsmouth player.. and they had the throw in. Did anyone else see this? Im not complaining as it wasnt a big deal, im sure it happend though. Then, in the United Newcastle match, Evra touched the ball last and United got the throw in. Just something I noticed lol

sometimes it did happen even the ball was out but the linesman failed to see it and it just let the play goes on, if the referee didn't see it or not signalled by the linesmen, the referee will just anyhow gives a corner or throw in, it always happen

the most certain thing is that you shouldnt change teams
one thing is for sure,you must remain loyal to your team no matter what.
noone can force you to do something which is against your will just because they support another team
you just stick with your team and let the other guys do the worrying

I would have thought building up your leg muscle strength would have been the best idea, do some squats, squat thrusts etc, build up your hamstrings, quad-draceps.  Practice kicking your football, I used to just belt it as hard as I could against a wall, loads of times, until i was nackered.
Just train and discipline, thats what you need!!

a lot of footballers throw their body into the shot,acting like its the last one they'll ever make.take a deep breath in and breathe out heavily when striking the ball,this kinda works phsychologically and physically,and it's also helpful in cricket when bowling.other than that,just practice a lot..you will gain more skill and find it becomes slightly easier to put more force into the ball,some people even find it becomes their bodies natural instinct to kinda kick the ball really hard...but you know,whichever method works for you.

Strong muscles are one answer
My power came when I learned to lock my ankle down and kick through the ball at the laces and meet the median of the ball (instep drive).  Accuracy went to heck, but if its power you want, that's the ticket.

i have  developed a pretty hard shot that also dips/knuckles/has lots of movement. my trick is that i "snap' my knee as i am going to kick the ball. go to kick the ball as you usually would but instead of kicking it normally you should strike the ball with your laces and accelerate your foot through the ball. it is tought to explain exactly how i do it but i hope you are able to understand what i am trying to say. when i kick the ball i usually get quite a bit of pace on the ball along with some movement. this really throws keepers off. also when shooting it is not always about kicking the hardest. you have to remember to place the ball where the keeper cannot save it. when you try to kick the ball as hard as you can you lose much of your ability to aim where you kick it

hit the ball with your foot square on and use as much follow through as possible....keep your knee over the ball and don't lean back. Your leg and foot are your equipment in the same way a golf club or tennis racket is... follow through is everything...even if it's not power you're going for just accuracy. How well does a golf club, tennis racket, snooker cue etc etc work without follow through????

if you know the basic technique then practise is the only thing left, planting your standing foot correctly and getting your kicking legs, knee over the ball is for basic raw power, obviously using the laces as your sweet spot, the only problem is you have very little control over the direction.

Yes, better chance than last season. New signings Carlos Vela, Samir Nasri, Ramsey, Amaury Bischoff all are young players, once again Arsene chose not to buy a few experienced players into the squad but he said he will before the start of the new season. Its gotta be a defender, surely someone good enough to cover Toure/Gallas Center back position. Arsenal have a much better and a stronger squad than last season, Chelsea may have Drogba, Lampard, Deco etc, Liverpool have Torres, Gerrard, Keane, etc but its how do perform as a team on a pitch, that Arsenal did and I'm sure will again. It wasn't the lack of quality in our squad last season, just the lack of quantity & depth.

we will be better this season-thats inevitable
we have a lot of good players in our squad,many of whom are youngsters which means they can run fast ,make the  game more interesting and they seem to have a 10-year experience in football the way they play on the field
it depends though on the midlielders wenger will arrange to have play in the main squad
we need somke very skilled midfielders to promote the ball in front or in the box and a good striker, arshavin-like or david villa-like so that there wont be any chances to goal gone wasted and i think nasri can make that happen
we just need to strenghten our midfield area.our young players can make a difference this season eg.vela,wilshire,theo walcott,ramsey

Yes. They do.
Think back to last season. They played attractive football, and were brilliant in the first half of the year. Arsenal have strengthened slightly since last year, and the POSSIBLE but probably unlikely (until late in the season) return of Eduardo da Silva, Arsenal will have a very competitive squad.

I bet you had plenty to say when Goram wore the armband and Gazza played the flute.  Which makes you a hypocrite, as well as a bigot.  Are you Jimmyhillsapoof, or THAS in 'disguise' ?  Pr1ck.

shouty dad, a forum is a message board people post comments and opinions on.

yahoo answers is just a forum which has a voting system for best post, rating system for them, points system that replaces post counts, higher priviledges for longer serving members and a semi automated moderating system, and thats it.  and a few new things like spell checker etc.

you could modify any forum software to make a similar site.  so yes, its a forum.  just a slightly unusual and very large one.

There will never be a great Britain team in the Olympics (the "great Britain" team in 2012 will be made up of English players only) - if Scotland , Ireland and wales agreed to such a thing that would be the end , there would be no more international teams from those nations only a great Britain team in the world cup , euro championships etc.

The Olympics happen once every 4 years whereas the European and World Championships alternate every 2 years... The Olympics themselves have very little impact in the football world in comparison to the other competitions.

The reason why there is a lack of British footballing talent is mainly due to cost. A top team can buy several top quality players from abroad for 8 to 9 million pounds but a home grown player tends to demand much more.



Consider the case of Darren Bent, an OK English player but bought for the same price as Thierry Henry... I know who i'd prefer in my squad.

Once English players become less greedy you'll see a change in the attitude of the premiership

Out of the big four (Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal, Man U), I think there is no arguing Chelsea will be first.



John Terry, for starters. He's by far one of the best defenders in the world, let alone the premier league. You also have newcomer Jose Bosingwa from FC Porto, a great defender who can attack on the flanks as well. Ricardo Carvalho and Ashley Cole are also very solid defenders. While Petr Cech had a poor Euro, he is still one of the best keepers.

Next comes Man U, Nemanja Vidic and Rio are one of the best duo's in defending in the premier league. Wings include the vicious attacker Evra and either Gary Neville, Wes Brown, and occasionally Owen Hargreaves (this is their weak point). Van der Saar performed admirably at the Euros as well as in the Champs League, and I think Kuszczak is going to be one of the best in a couple of years.

Coming in third in my view is Liverpool. While all are very experienced and solid at the back, they're getting old. I'm pretty sure Jamie Carragher has been around since football was invented and Sami Hyypia is slooooooowwww. I like youngster Martin Skrtel, but it'll take time before he makes a real impact. Agger, Arbeloa, Aurelio, and Finnan are also decent defenders. Pepe Reina is a great keeper, he provides a wall for the goal and can also use his accurate kicking skills to start a strong counter.

Arsenal unfortunately comes last... While I think they have a GREAT defense, I don't think they'll be able to work well together. Gallas and Toure are very very good, but OLD. Sagna, Clichy, and Eboue are also very good defending, but they don't know how to work with the rest of the defense and they tend to do a little too much attacking. I really like Almunia at GK, it took a lot of balls to steal the spotlight from Lehmann!

you need to try on the shoes. Make sure there is extra room for your toes. It explains why you get one size more than your actual size. But every brand name shoes designs different. You can't trust on size. Try on before you buy is the best way to buy the shoes you like.

I have never heard of anyone getting cleats a size large except for maybe toddlers who will grow. cleats should fit quite snug so you have maximum control over your movement and to avoid blisters on your feet. Soccer socks are not thick enough to fill and entire size difference compared to normal socks and some brands (admiral in particular) have thinner than normal socks. Socker socks also tend to get thinner the more you use them and the extra space in front of the toe can mess with your shooting (on a full shot, you will not be able to hit the ball with the ideal part of the top of your foot without snagging the ground). Since leather, especially kangaroo leather has a tendency to expand after use, I would suggest buying shoes half a size or a size smaller than your normal size and let it expand to the shape of your foot. Some players like Cristiano Ronaldo wear 3 sizes smaller, but that is a bit extreme. A Snug fit is better than an oversize fit, so I would go with a size 4.5 or 5.

He'll be Arsene's first choice ahead of Rosicky who i think will be out till mid November, Van Persie can't stay fit, Vela can play on the left side striker role(CF) like Eduardo. Hope he does all what he did at Osasuna back here, crosses, long range shooting, etc hes good in all of that.

Very good attacking options. But you need to change the goalkeeper, and get a few more quality defenders. You may need to sacrifice one of your big attacking players for a solid defender.

If you mean tricks while juggling, these are the ones I first learned.
1)back stall-practice by throwing the ball up and catching it one your back by pushing your shoulders back and bending down at the right time to absorb the bounce.
2)atw-practice by dropping the ball and putting your leg around the ball before hitting it the second time.
3)heel/butt stall-catching the ball between your heel and your butt. You have to get your leg into the right shape and squeeze softly when you get the ball
4)rabona juggle-put one leg over the ball while its dropping and hit it with the other foot that you must jump off of.
5)head stall-just takes practice balancing the ball on your hairline. Really good party trick.

if you're looking for jukes,
try the bicycle, a simple fake to either side
even a simple change of speed can fool defenders
try searching videos

as far as juggling the ball goes.
you should first start off just getting used to the ball, juggle as much as possible everyday and practice. once you get a feel for it then the tricks will come naturally. like the around the world trick

if not try youtubing or googling and look at videos of experienced players breakdown the tricks it helps me a lot with my training.

hope this helped and good luck

I dont agree with teams like chelsea bidding 80mill for players like kaka and then you get teams where there club isnt worth that !

there should be a set ammount of what your aloud to spend on players and players wages its getting out of control.



I also think that would lighten up the game with more clubs in with a shout of big trophys.

Well thats my opinion.

Yes transfer prices should be capped so should players wages, footballers earning £150,000 a week is absurd,  teams like Man. Utd. and Arsenal's weekly wage bill must be close to £2,000,000 a week and that is money from television not from gate receipts what would happen if the TV companies decided to pull out of football what would happen to those clubs who depend on income from TV.?

Who cares about the Prices as long as people will pay anything to watch a good game........Though its unfair to see a players' price go up & reach sky high overnight.........Players like Zidane only costed around 10million euros but after his 2 goals in the WC final his price is godly. 
Don't let me get started on Rooney, how much he cost before Euro 2004 now look at him his price is way over talent........Just because he scored some goals in Euro 2004 doesn't mean he becomes expensive player in a night........The price of a player should be tagged according to the the stats of the whole year not few matches.

FIFA would be far better place if they would pick a President, who has played football in its highest form.

The problem in the English league is the over inflated prices that you have to pay for home grown players.  Capping will not solve the problem.  You will still be able to buy a 'better' quality player for less from abroad.  That does not help English clubs, and does not help the development of English players (along with Welsh and Scots).

As for clubs abroad, they will find ways round a cap.  Look at how things were subverted when there was a wage cap in England.

No they should not the more the clubs pay then the more the genuine supporter has to pay to watch and so they cant afford it.

if transfer fees were capped, it might give the lesser known teams a chance of glory, but then again if transfer fees were capped, the bigger known clubs will just offer higher wages to try and get the player, so i think that both transfer fees and wages should be capped so that every team has a chance in their respective leagues and hopefully teams from lesser known leagues a chance in the champions league/uefa cup or the equivelant for the other clubs around the world

Addenda:

Any father with a son going into football will want to see him earning has much as he can.  Wouldn't you now, with respect, take the best offer going?

However; like in all businesse's, contracts should be honoured, unless of illness, or shame being brought on a club:  Like Mutu did with Chelsea.  And I don't support them.

Contract's should be fair both ways.  If so, no one can stop the market; other than the market!

Football, won't go bust, despite prophecies to the opposite.  Local fan's often support their club, and a bigger one.  That's their perogative.

As long as fans accept this then it wont change as most clubs are just plain greedy now more so with merchandise charges, players wages and transfer fees should have a ceiling put on them and give something back to the fans as the football is 2nd  or even 3rd rate

Can player transfer prices go up indefinitely?



The answer is most likely yes, money makes the world go round, none more so than in Football. It is just the way it is. However this money should be used in a better way. The huge transfer fees should be taxed by the governing bodies and the money should be put back into grass roots football of the country that the team is from. This way the bigger clubs give something back, and the national team will stand a chance in the future.



Should they be capped?

In a moral, ideal world, of course. But football is now a toy town.

If anything needs capping it is the price of tickets, especially as we move forward or the regular fan will simply not be able to watch his/her team.

No.

Because quite simply clubs will just ask for the capped transfer amount and then proceed to ask for additional clauses.
So many payments of £ per players appearance or match wins. The clubs will find ways around it and still end up with the same amount of money they intended to have in the first place.
So really even if the transfer prices are capped, the value of the transfer wont be.

It's uncontrollable.

Hey Stefan …. In my words ‘The German Roy Keane’!!! (I find it difficult to understand when I read some say they have never heard of you….. obviously their knowledge of football does not go past last couple of years) …. I DON’T believe transfer prices should be capped.  This would give players even more power then already what exists in world football.

If a player wants it to be capped to a valuation then he should keep a CLAUSE while signing a contract which would allow them to leave for a transfer fee.  For example if C. Ronaldo has a CLAUSE when signing contract saying any club who bids £80 million for him the bid will be accepted then that’s fine he had it in the contract and hence he is allowed to talk with the club for a possible move.  BUT if there is NO CLAUSE then its his clubs right weather to accept any bid or not no matter how big it is.

Great to have a genuine football player on here and one who won so many tittles.

In the free market that we live in I think it would be very hard to cap transfers at the moment. Michel Platini is implementing some pretty radical ideas as president of UEFA so I guess he could raise the idea.



I would like to see a player wage cap however or a draft system like they do in American sport where the teams who haven’t done so well the previous year get first pick on the up and coming players, so you don’t just get the big clubs winning everything year in year out.

A few times actually and I'm not proud to admit... Especially when it comes to Red Star, I wanted to show everyone, several times, that Zehman isn't worthy of a single sh*t & that we can't win anything with him coaching. The new coach is like that too and I wanted them to lose so I can prove to everyone around me that just changing a coach won't affect anything. But deep down I always knew I wanted us to win lol and still was disappointed when I saw the result and that we really did play worse than ever.

Gerrard is perhaps d only reason why rafa is still in charge - der was speculation a couple of seasons ago bt gerrard's possible move 2 spain or italy but havin held on 2 him n got his signatures on a long term contract rafa can breathe a lil easy . Many ppl believe rafa is at anfield only coz he signed torres but i say thats bullshit - torres in an interview expressed his love for d club n regardless of who was manager he was comin here anyway

Back 2 gerrard , he is d heart n soul of liverpool n he's d reason why i'm still supportin liverpool - i swear , if gerrard sometime later in his career , mayb in d twilight goes 2 hull or derby , i'll support dat club !!

Gerrard is a jerk in the Liverpool dressing room and will pester Rafa to put anyone whom Gerrard likes in the first team and omit any player from the first team who stands in his way.That's why the careers of the likes of Baros,Smicer,Finnan,Kewell and Bellamy have been ruined by Gerrard's politics.

Will you raise your glass in memory?



To the people who perished in the 2 Ibrox disasters.....

The Ibrox Disaster

New Year Bells had been ringing,
All of Scotland was singing,
The old year had died,
And the new had been born.
As the news of disaster
From Ibrox came spreading,
The news that would cause
A whole nation to mourn

Two great goals had been scored,
In the last dying moments.
Jimmy Johnson for Celtic,
For Rangers’ young Stein.
Their supporters all cheered them,
With voices of thunder,
Unknowing what waited on staircase 13

66 people died
Some in flower of their manhood,
When the fences gave way
And the barriers bent,
Seasoned Glasgow policemen their faces all tearstained,
With brave efforts, endeavoured far worse to prevent.
All of Glasgow enjoined,
For the first time in history.
In the Glasgow cathedral no Billy’s, no Dan’s
But the Old Firm united to pray for their victims,
Of a tragedy set in the memory of man.

New Year Bells had been ringing,
All of Scotland was singing,
The old year had died,
And the new had been born.
As the news of disaster
From Ibrox came spreading,
The news that would cause
A whole nation to mourn.

I wasnt born actually when it happened, but it sounds dreadful. I am so sorry for those who had relatives pass away  that day in tragic events. It taught clubs many lessons in safety, sadly too late for some. I agree it would have united the old firm and the divisions were all broken and crossed in an effort to do 1st aid and help those little children who lost a father that day etc.



I knew a girl Caroline ,  whose uncle died that day, and she was born that year, her middle name was actually Ibrox.



Can only visualise in my head  how devastating an event like this is and the trauma the witnesses feel forever.



That poem was touching. We are indeed all made of flesh and blood and we are united when it is life or death.

Yeah ok dude. Kaka gets hit by dirty defenders left and right in Italy. Gilardino has scored better goals for Milan than the two headers today. He was hardly marked and the crosses to him had to be perfect. If he can't get one of those on target he shouldn't be on Fiorentina. He'll never be as good and have the vision like Filippo Inzaghi. Gourcuff learned a lot from his time at Milan and even tries to copy Kaka's moves. He was always overrated. By the way Gilardino was top scorer for Milan in the Serie A one season. He just didn't produce enough in important games and Milan can do better. Milan played him as a lone striker which is what Parma did.  If it weren't for Milan Gilardino would never have a Champions League winners medal. Do you know how many times Milan set Gilardino up for perfect goal scoring opportunities? He fucked most of them up. Enjoy some goals.

No Gilardino was given many chances at milan. Every year he was there he scored less and less goals. There was too much pressure on him at milan to produce the goods, but at fiorentina, there is less pressure on him so he can relax abit more. in my opinion, Milan was right to sell him.

Agreed and disagreed. Milan produced talents:
Kaka was bought for a mere 10 Million Euros as an unknown. Won CL, League title, League Cup, World Club Championship, European Supercup, Balon D'Or and FIFA World PLayer of the Year.
He NEVER showed his true potential? Sorry I disagree with that. What else was he supposed to win to show his potential, the Intergalactic Cup?

As for Gilardino it has happened in many other teams that players that excelled in other as youngsters when going to bigger teams flopped. Pirlo flopped in Inter and became who he is at Milan. Henry flopped at Juve, became huge with Arsenal, Weah was an unknown in the full European scene before he came to Milan, your own Modric "bright star of the future" is sucking right now in Tottenham.

Some teams with some coaches operate different ways and are built to highlight the work of a specific player like Gilardino's was at Parma, or not. People like Inzaghi kept scoring at Milan despite age, idk why Gila didnt, except by Gila's own words, he just didnt feel special enough in Milan as he was not regarded as in Parma and Fiorentina as the one world class player there.

So whereas I agree there needs to be more talent realize Gilardino has scored 5 goals this season but Fiorentina is at 1 point in the League and Gourcuff is playing "ok" with a Bordeux just beaten 4-0 by Chelsea. He was not "big talent" before coming to Milan.
On Kaka I disagree completely and on Pato he is overrated and needs maturity and experience. He has not been in Milan a full playing year and has scored "only" 12 goals so far. Crap record eh?

Then again Gila did win a CL, a World Club Championship, a European Supercup, etc, all won in the last yr and a half. So much for a crap record in a team.

defense(excluding Abidal) and midfield are fine we need no improvements there, its our damn forwards that I'm worried about they are too wasteful, Henry is crap at his position and should be benched, coming in as a sub when Eto'o gets tired. But i don't know what we need up front to solve our problems.  Maybe we should buy Aguero to help us out there

Yes totally satisfied. He got Hleb and Alves in to help the attack. Their game so much more simple and pretty the way they play now. Ronaldinho slowed the whole game down and couldn't move for 6 months before the trade to Milan. Hleb can attack at speed all day and 
Alves is the best attacking outside back in the game today. Overall Pep made the right adjustments and Barca will get a championship in La Liga and possibly the European Championship depending on injuries and how the mix. Also, Eto'o is playing incredible up top for the Catalans.

Slipiner, if you are looking for Nazi connections, look no further than your nation of choice, the Republic of Ireland.  They collaborated with the Nazi's, despite being made fully aware of the holocaust.  But you won't see anything wrong with that.  As long as the victims weren't of your faith, whatever you pretend that to be.

Lawwell is a business man first and a football man second  Strachan knows who carries the can for failure on the park. , so he's protecting his own reputation, as Murray has been doing for years now by issuing half hearted warnings about sectarian chanting at Ipox ... while trying to offload the dump complete with all it's antiquated contents and scum fan base.. all 52,000 of them on a good day .. 5,000 football fans.. 45,000 IRISH orangemen and a sprinkling of Nazis and Bnp filth peddlers. . Oh.. and a rabbied dug called Gnasher and a  porn drug selling perv' who probably hangs around school gates.. . apt' names I must say

Synopsis – After finishing only four points behind champions Manchester United last season and with the youngest team in the league there would appear to be a good case to be made for Arsenal taking that extra couple of steps up the table.



Particularly when you consider that they finished with eleven draws and only took six points from a possible 18 available against Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea.



A few draws become wins, or losses to United and Chelsea become draws or wins and the complexion of the top three changes very quickly. However, although Arsenal played some great football last season the gap between Arsenal and the top two was not accurately reflected by the final points differential.



Arsenal only conceded 31 goals last season (an improvement of four on the previous) but nowadays that is too many for a side with title aspirations. Last season United conceded 22, the year before 27, Chelsea’s championship seasons were 22 and 15, and Arsenal unbeaten season was 26.



When the chips were down the Arsenal defense was found wanting and with no changes it is doubtful that we will see an improvement in their league position this season.



In attack the drop off in goals from Adebayor (24) to the next highest highest Fabregas (8) was too great and such an over reliance on one player for goals means leans times when a dip in form hits. Nonetheless Adebayor is a solid bet for at least 15-20 Premiership goals again this season but Arsenal also needs a full season out of Van Persie, and more goals from the wide midfield positions.



They also need solid defensive cover in the centre of midfield. If Wenger can find the right player to team with Fabregas it might pay off not only in goals scored but in the goals against column as well. 
SHORT ANSWER IS NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

No I don't think so.  They lack strength in depth in the squad, they develop perfect-goal syndrome too often, they don't beat fellow top 4 teams often enough, and you won't win leagues with Almunia in goal.  He is good, let's not get that one wrong, but not great a la Cech, Shilton, Schmeichel or Seaman.  Those fellas were consistent week in, week out.

showing all the matches ( 5.5 hrs ahead) , goans love premier league -so due to cheap alcohol sometimes difficult to remember the next day wot the score was. evenworse for european matches that kick off at 20.00.

Man U fans, do you still like Cristiano Ronaldo even though he tried to get transfered to Real Madrid?



I think eventually he will play for Real Madrid (his preferred club).

I often wonder where they would have been
If we hadn't have taken them in
Fed them and washed them
Thousands in Glasgow alone
From Ireland they came
Brought us nothing but trouble and shame
Well the famine is over
Why don't they go home?

Now Athenry Mike was a thief
And Large John he was fully briefed
And that wee traitor from Castlemilk
Turned his back on his own
They've all their Papists in Rome
They have U2 and Bono
Well the famine is over
Why don't they go home?

Now they raped and fondled their kids
That's what those perverts from the darkside did
And they swept it under the carpet
and Large John he hid
Their evils seeds have been sown
Cause they're not of our own
Well the famine is over
Why don't you go home?

Now Timmy don't take it from me
Cause if you know your history
You've persecuted thousands of people
In Ireland alone
You turned on the lights
Fuelled U boats by night
That's how you repay us
It's time to go home.

How can any Rangers fan seriously criticise Celtic tonight, they were playing the team which beat (4-0) the diddy team which put Rangers out in the 2nd qualifiying round.

If Rangers had not bottled their huge lead in the league with a few games to play then they wouldn't even of had to face the mighty Kaunas.

Celtic are in the competition (for a wee while), Rangers are not, get over it.

Depends on how Benitez plays him, if it's out wide like Kuyt then he'll end up with 7-10, if he gets more opportunities to be fed the ball up front with Torres he'll probably get 10-15.

BIGOT.....you really know how to show your fellow supporters UP.....typical SCUM......FTP

The Ibrox Disaster

New Year Bells had been ringing,
All of Scotland was singing,
The old year had died,
And the new had been born.
As the news of disaster
From Ibrox came spreading,
The news that would cause
A whole nation to mourn

Two great goals had been scored,
In the last dying moments.
Jimmy Johnson for Celtic,
For Rangers’ young Stein.
Their supporters all cheered them,
With voices of thunder,
Unknowing what waited on staircase 13

66 people died
Some in flower of their manhood,
When the fences gave way
And the barriers bent,
Seasoned Glasgow policemen their faces all tearstained,
With brave efforts, endeavoured far worse to prevent.
All of Glasgow enjoined,
For the first time in history.
In the Glasgow cathedral no Billy’s, no Dan’s
But the Old Firm united to pray for their victims,
Of a tragedy set in the memory of man.

New Year Bells had been ringing,
All of Scotland was singing,
The old year had died,
And the new had been born.
As the news of disaster
From Ibrox came spreading,
The news that would cause
A whole nation to mourn.

Good point. I never understood why the ibrox disaster was off limits for jokes. We have jokes about 911, princess di and even myra hindley. What makes them so special ? Got them biting though eh ? lol Was worth the mention. Look at fudgie...ftp lol and he calls you a bigot ! That other fanny with the bjk, is ok to score points about child abuse but shhhh dont mention the stadiums fallin apart. You can even take a jump off the top tier at Parkhead and live to tell the tail. lol big blue on about the orcs coming over as well. The tattie bits the fun part of that song man, read the rest of the words, your a sick bunch and you deserve no respect. Crack as many jokes as you like. Fk 'em.

Overall, it wasn't a bad performance, it just isn't what we've grown to expect from the team. The starting lineup today definitely wasn't the strongest and yet we still had the better of the game. Villareal was making sure they dropped lots of people behind the ball, and United just couldn't find that final ball. I think performances in the upcoming games will improve.

The Chelsea match will be tough, I have a feeling it will end 1-1 or 0-0.

Ankit,since Berbatov was injured,Rooney and Tevez were paired as strikers yesterday.Yes,our finishing was pathetic again,with Tevez the no.1 culprit.Why on earth did Man United have to waste their time taking a simple shot on goal?Man United should also have been awarded a penalty in the first half when Fletcher was brought down.

Is this the best way to stop racism?



the club who is racist should be fined, relegated, have points deducted and forced to give free season tickets to the black community.

i think that would stop the racism. but i think the game is still run by white people who have never experienced it and so don,t now how ghurtful it can be and don,t really care. racism destroys lives. lets end it,.

Saying its run by white people is a racist comment too.

Racism can only be blamed on a small group of people,proper supporters would condemn it.

Why not just start your own club?  I never understood why anyone would want to insist on being in places where they feel they are not welcome.  You cannot force people to get along with people whom they don't like, for whatever reason.

The club isn't racist or they wouldn't have employed black players in the first place.  They can't possibly be held responsible for every supporter in the crowd or every club would be relegated and have points deducted every week and if they gave away season tickets to the black community, they would cease to exist because they would go bankrupt.

There will always be racism. Because man cannot accept differences.
With that said, it sounds like you're throwing the race card though, what about all the other people who are "discriminated"? This just sounds like you want something for nothing, you have to work to buy things. Not just throw the race card for when you can't afford something. Why do you feel they are discriminating, besides the fact you said most are white, that doesn't make a club racist but could make you sound ignorant, so stereotypical.

I agree that racism should be stopped but I don't think fining people etc will work.  The only thing that will work is changing people's attitudes.



In my experience racism works both ways.  I'm white but I have a few "Black" friends and I can't get over how racist they are at times.  One of my best friends didn't realise how racist he was until I lost my temper with him one night and told him a few things.  Once he got over the shock of me losing my temper, he realised that in actual fact he was being racist and was mortified.

Why is Zlatan Ibrahimovic so underrated...?



... the guy is one of the best attackers in Europe (if not THE best) but for some reason he doesn't get the respect he deserves, he is the main reason for Inter's success in the last couple of seasons, he is like C.Ronalda for Man U, Gerrard for Liverpool, Messi for Barca etc etc, almost every important goal was his or at least he did most of the job for others to score (like Mancini's and Adriano's goal last night for example), maybe the reason is that he can't win trophies at International level because Sweden is not strong as Italy, Brazil, Germany etc etc.... it's true that he disappears at big games but that's only because he plays in Inter, he can't do everything by himself, the rest of the team is not on his level (except for Mancini now and Adriano if he gets his form back)..... he is better than every EPL attacker, only Drogba is good or maybe a little better than him but somehow people forget about him every time when they talk about great strikers..... he is great and if Inter didn't make him the highest payed Serie A player he would sign for real Madrid and maybe then people would finally gave him the respect he deserves, but unfortunately he stayed at Inter!!!!

@Freshy... hehehe.... well one thing is for sure, there is no way that YOU would knock me out... hehe... and I doubt anyone would get in a fight with me only because of football, I make fun of my friends and their fave clubs EVERY DAY and we never had any problems because of that, I even fight with people I meet first time in my life and all they do is laugh (well that's only when I'm drunk)...... you're a loser man, you're calling me gambler like that's something bad, I earn at least 750$ every month on poker and maybe you should go out and drink more too, like every normal person...

Underrated?? Where the hell have you been?  He's a freaking overrated arrogant bastard.  I would be happy if he left Inter, but obviously he's not as long as Mourinho stays as coach, because he's Mourinho's pet.....and maybe something more in the bedroom who knows?
And he's not that great, he's absent in the big games.  And you're an idiot too.  The rest of Inter are not on his level??  Inter has the best squad in all of Europe, so i don't know what the hell you're talking about.  But then again you're always talking out of your ***.

LMAO who's the one acting tough??  You're the one hiding behind the internet because you certainly would've been knocked out by like 50 different people if you said even half the crap you say on here to their faces.

Zlatan is not under-rated. He is one of the most feared attackers in europe. He is strong, fast, techncally brilliant and has a dangerous shot. Sometimes he can hog the ball and fall out of games, but dont all good players do that (C RONALDO  is a prime example) The only bad thing is that he players for INTER!

You've obviously no clue. He is the top payed played in Serie A MJ. 11 Million Euros a year. 
If I earned that and was the one player Mourinho loved above everyone, and was called underrated, then whoo hoo for being underrated lmao

Erm in Sweden Im not surprised he hasnt won much but even there he is considered their best player. In Italy he is all over TV and radio and newspapers.

He has won 3 League titles in a row and erm Real has won as many CLs as Inter in the last 3 years so I have no clue why the comparison there.

Freshy will ALWAYS remain a better person than you MJ. I doubt im the only thinking that. Then again Im a gay Italian right? You deluded racist Croat.



You're the one thinking that Barca and Croatia are omnipotent. I can even admit my own team sucks right now LMAO. We are a total of 1 pt below what Barca has so far in the League. Barca is doing about as bad.

If you think he's underrated you must have been living on Mars in the past year or so. Hey you could have sent a postcard or something...
He's an outstanding player, he's got loads of talent and potential and he's using it well. I love the way he plays and how he functions with Inter. The only thing I absolutely deteste and can not stand and which p*sses me off like nothing is the fact that he is so smug and arrogant. I swear when I hear him talking I'm tempted to break the TV screen.

I don't suck up as you put it.... there are some really great fans on here from both sides... the idiots tend to get ignored..people who mention the Ibrox disaster for instance as it is embarassing to us true fans...death is not a point score... 
if people want to use Child abuse as a way of upsettting the opposition then it is their sick minds that are the problem

I have the utmost respect for Bluebell, Bluenose, Wee Ger, Billy Mr Struth, Radiotab  and may I even say Blue/52.. passionate about their team and if I do have my arguments with them it's about fottball.

yes Blue..I have respect for you!!

I used to read the funny patter in here, but I have read a couple of  messages today that are 100% vile, violating people, insulting the dead, harrasment and  very vindictive swear words, it makes me wonder what drives someone to spend ages concocting racist /sectarian questions and  antagonising folk ,I am embarrassed as this segment  is displayed all over the world.



The answerers are a bit over reactionary too cant you sensible guys just agree to hit 'report abuse' button, as a reaction is also the wrong response, i would just click to the next question, see if I know the answer. The funny ones the ones where people are nice make me feel humble and happy to come from Glasgow, but this is like why I am glad I am non Catholic non Protestant by choice, am admittedly just a  Christian just at Christmas!



It sickens me to think Id assume I was a better person than someone cos I wore an image, colour or had  a particular belief. and so far, am glad my sons show not a jot of interest in any football team. I hope that everyone would edit and delete their replies and stick to jovial football matters, we are Scotland, and all the same, we bleed when cut and cry when sore.

Children can and do read, do you want your kids to see this, I know I wouldn't. My son recently marched happily with mixed schools in an anti sectarian march I would appreciate seeing the back of this nonsense !

Gonnae just try and think of your children and how you are setting the example .cheers everyone have a good day and happy chats and footie related ones less the hate chat are wished your way.

RACIAL INTOLERANCE AND "HATE SPEECH" - 
INTERNATIONAL AND CROATIAN STANDARDS AND PRACTICE

A report prepared for the round table talks of experts entitled 
«How to combat 'hate speech' and violence motivated by race»



24 March 2004-10-11
(Prepared by: Tena Erceg, Human Rights Centre, Zagreb, 2004.

"HATE SPEECH” IN CROATIA



“Hate speech” is present at all levels of the Croatian society. At the political level, state officials and government representatives tend to use insulting words and negative stereotypes when they speak about the members of national and sexual minorities and women. In the sphere of entertainment and show business, there is an extreme nationalistic trend personified as Marko Perković Thompson. In the private, individual sphere, “hate speech” has been publicly used and approved for years at higher levels of  society without any sanctions and has resulted in racist prejudice with the “common” people, particularly those of a younger age.

It's quite fair to say that is has been crap. Man U seem to be scared of doing anything, even though they should have had a penalty. Villarreal are doing the exact same, so both are just waiting for the other to do something

DontTread, have you been keeping up with the results lately, Liverpool is higher on the premier league ladder and also doing better in the champions league( Man U couldn't even score a goal)



so when man u is doing better than liverpool, then you can start talking crap ok

and the answer to the question, yes they can win the EPL, they don't need big names to win unlike chelsea and man u

How can Livershyte win the EPL... Fire their coach, fire almost all of their players accept for Torres and Gerrard. Than come to think of it Gerrard is really starting to suck it up so transfer Gerrard for a crap load of money. Sign some big name players and invest in some big name prospects.

No. He is an important player in the Arsenal line-up and he needs to help the other players and defenders. Also, he needs to keep the competition going for the central-defensive role in Arsenal. He just scored last night in Dynamo Kiev. That shows he is important.

i think he is a soccer player who doesn't respect anyone beside him.

in juventus, he said that del piero is not even close to his level, he should only work with Trézéguet for the rest of the season.

in ajax, he said similiar things before he leaves the team



overall, he is a skilled player, with bad temper and bad respecting skills.

English Premier League is the best in my opinion (but that could be because I am an Arsenal super fan). I actually do believe that the talent and playing style inthe EPL is much higher than in the other leagues listed.

that's right folks take your Ulster ( Cúige Uladh) flags with you so the orcs can single you out and tell you to go home to your country Éire and be proud of your nationality.

then all the orcs go see if they will be accepted down in (Sasana.)

The first one... Man United, because that would be much better than Man Divided.

The second one is harder. Initially I thought Kiev, because chicken Kiev is delicious. But in the end I chose Arsenal, because they have the word "****" in their name.

Do you think Man UTD. could win this weekend in the Chelsea V Man UTD game.?



It is played at Chelsea.
I can get back £38.50 (Total amount to collect) for a £10 bet on Man utd to win. 
Is it worth a tenner or am I wasting my cash. 
Thank you for your answers.

I agree ONLY 100% WILL DO anything less and Man utd will lose. Good answer thanks.

Absolutely! Manchester is going to start Berbatov, plus the return of Cristiano Ronaldo! They better have ice ready for Petr Chech because he's going to be burned.

do you think MANchester UTD could this week end in the Chelsea game, well they didn't do well playing Liverpool did they, but every football team plays differently  don't they so i think it could be a draw 1-1.
As for betting £10, i would rather put my money on the latest football magazines giving news views ratings the turf accountant always wins.

Man United have little chance against Chelsea,considering Man United's poor start and Chelsea's excellent start capped by beautiful football.Moreover Chelsea have yet to lose at Stamford Bridge,stretching 88 games.But I hope Man United wins this game and shuts the mouths of Man United haters for good.I also hope that Berbatov comes back from injury and scores for Man United.

I would bet on another fixture. Here is why: Chelsea's last home defeat came under the stewardship of Claudio Ranieri over four and a half years ago. That was a 2-1 loss to Arsenal in February 2004... 2004! They are a much better team now and are always favored at home. When betting you have to be neutral and exercise good judgment. Maybe if United were on form they'd have a good chance of winning.

Benni McCarthy and Didier Drogba, last season's top scorers, will miss some of the season tho play in the African Nations Cup. I think this will provide an opportunity for Van Persie, Bent, Berbatov, Owen, Torres or Eduardo to get ahead of them.

i think it is rico mate,
Aalborg are easily one of the weakest sides in the competition. And with Villareal coming in via pot B, its a good group for Celtic. There was some right hairy mary teams in pot B and pot D that could have had Celtic mathematically out of europe by christmas.Villareal are not a fantastic side, but if Celtic keep playing the way they are, in europe and domestically, the spanish side will walk all over them.
tonights result is made worse by Man Utd sharing points with Villareal, had Man Utd taken the points then it might have been a let off for Celtic.



Taking into consideration that Celtic will get nothing at Old Trafford, possibly nowt in spain and with thier performance tonight and away history no doubt nothing in Demark.

id be wondering if Aalborg can get a point at Parkhead, what in the heavens will Man Utd and Villareal get

No, not all bad, just means the Tims will have to win at least one away game (probably two) and that will be no easy task given Strachan's record and the jinx over his team. Better hope your wee leprechauns are ready for a lot of overtime picking lucky shamrocks and counting their beads in the weeks ahead.

Good luck....well....maybe not so much of the 'good'!

Careful now, Struth, you will get reported to parliment.

Or maybe the Celtic fans will be too busy trying to dig dirt that doesn't exist on the ref, he MUST be a hun/orc/whatever.....despite the red for the Dane and a gift of a penalty.............

drawing against Aalborg is a bit pish though and i think Celtic fans will need to take the slagging. This has been quite a kind group as some real good sides were missed from pot b, albeit Villareal are a decent side, but definatly one of the weaker teams from that pot.
Aalborg are pish and no doubt one of the weakest teams in the competition, Celtic have went and blew it right good tonight

but yeah, violating is daft, i lost my account for nothing because someone took a wee dislike to me and my job. but hey, take it on the chin, it is only the internet

5 more chances to right that result but poor you, no chance of forgetting the Kaunas games every time we play in the worlds best club football tournament.

Del Piero's was my favourite of the first round that's for sure. Plus he's Del Piero. One of my favourite players so I'm bias. Typical from him though. He's one of the better free kick takers.



Imagine Kaka scoring this and then rate it. Haha. It's a great first time finish.

Just seen that David O'Leary is in contention for Newcastle job. Who do you think should be the next manager?



O'Leary seem like an act of desperation but I can't think of anyone who would want to come to Newcastle in their current mess.

Who do you want?



</question>



<additional details>



Tim S - Why on earth would Martin O'Neill want to go to Newcastle? I would class Villa and Newcastle on the same level (2nd tier premiership - potentially 5th to 8th in the table). But Villa are much more stable now and showing more potential than Newcastle. He would get nothing out of that move. It's not going to happen.



Gary Mac - Kevin Keegan is a loser and a quitter, why do you want him back? He's thrown his toys out of the pram and walked off for the second time. But I do agree with you, in the short term 'no change in manager will bring the success the fans want'. Your comment about what they 'deserve' is wrong though. The fans deserve nothing at the moment, they are acting like spoilt children.

O'Leary will not have a 10th of the money he spunked at Leeds - he's a selfish bastard who looks after himself instead of fighting his teams corner (remember the timing of his autobiography?) he has no man management skills what so ever the only reason I see Newcastle going for him is because there is no one else - on the plus side he might get Alan Smith and Viduka playing again if that possible, bloody hell if he does that he should get manager of the year!

Haha This is a complete Piss take by Mike Ashley.

It wouldnt suprise me if the vicious tosser put O'leary or cubishley in charge before he left Revenge.

He can go ahead and do that if he wants but the price of the managers contract will be duducted from the value of the club by the new owners as the first thing they would do is offer him a scouting position and tell him to get on his bike.

No new owner is going to buy someone like o'learys contract with the club.

Its just speculation to piss off the Newcastle fans and its probably a stunt by the media to get us worked up even more.

I really dont think ashley would be that stupid, Appointing o'leary or curbishley would be the gravest mistake of his life i can assure you that lol.

Man i think o'leary has to be the worst manager i can think of par bring kenny dalglish back.

i agree with you
i like david o'leary
i like his methods
he has been made to look like a tw@ by the media after his depature from leeds
and i think he can be successfull given the right club

the problem is
that right club is not a premiership club, he is not that good !
and i dont think he knows that himself
plus your right in saying 'who wants the newcastle job anyway'
its a poison chalice where it always goes wrong
it always shatters a 'citys dreams' (sky sports news quote)
yeah right !
and its always the managers fault at that club
its never the underachieving players who blatantly dont bother half the time
the only players on the newcastle squad right now who are actually quality players are...
shay given
obafemi martins
michael owen
charles nzogbia
jonas gutierrez
and geremi

everyone else
and yes thats including mark viduka
are not pulling their weight, and i just dont see how o'leary would sort that out

i think the best thing for newcastle is too find a new investor, get rid of ashley, bring back keegan and get rid of half the squad and buy some new talented hard working players who will play well for at least 35 of the 38 games every season

Hi, this as been an issue for many years now and would be great if it could be forced but it is unlikely to happen due to the media coverage that now exist. It is time the game was brought back to the fans like it was in the 60's and 70's, when you could go along to a game without any problem of expense. The genuine fans have now been priced out of the game.

Yes, I think there should. It's immoral that footballers can earn more in one WEEK than a doctor earns in 1 YEAR,  or a teacher in 4 YEARS or a nurse in 8 YEARS.
I agree, a cap of £20,000 a week or £1,000,000 + a year should be enough for anyone...anything more is sheer greed and immoral.
I realise that (eg)a clerk should not earn as much as a brain surgeon but for footballers to earn 400x as much as a nurse, 200x as much as a teacher and 50x as much as a doctor can't be right.

probably the amount would be played for playesrs during 80s.

football has changed a lot.

talking about the wage tructure,everyone talks about arsenal.

arsene wenger is third highest paid manager.

and he refused to pay his best player last season[adebaor]even 3 million euros per year.

probably arsene gets something around 4.6 million euros per year.

what a shame?they couldnt win anything for four years.

talk about chelsea wage structure...they paid 42 million euros more than manutd last season for wages.

and phil scolari is the highest paid manager.
this is the guy who advised ronaldo to go to real madrid for money.

With the current state of the EPL in regards to foreign investment, why don't the fans buy their clubs?



even if it's a league 2 club wouldn't it be more special to own part of your club? rather than lining the pockets of some faceless bankers dream?

This has already been done, as Ebbsfleet was bought by a website and all subscribers have a say in transfers and team selection. As to buying a higher league club it would have to be a fair sized investment (£1000 would be a lot to the man on the street,including me!) and you may well not have as much say on your money as you would like.

They would want to much cash from each investor. I support WBA, we get gates of 26/28000. The club is actually worth around 40M and thats without giving any further investment, something which is vital in todays football world. If each one of our 28000 was to put up and equal amount of money to purchase WBA it would equal out to £1428.57 Per Person. I just don't have that sort of cash available and even if i did I wouldn't invest it in a company of which i'd own 1/28000. See the problem!!

Its too early to tell..but even though they last season they were like 6 points ahead in the league,i tipped them them to lose out to either MU or Chelsea. Its purely beacuse their squad is not big enough.

I thought last season they wud win this season but with the departure of some players I dont think so. Arsenal style of football is a team game,they all like to pass and receive the ball,team work is needed. You have to remember Wenger has built a squad for the future,but with the team broken up with Flamini,Senderos,Hleb and Gilberto all left. Its just that,Wenger has a built a good team but now the team has broken up and he needs to rebuild it again.



They could win the Carling or FA cup. I doubt it for League and Champions League.

i think arsenal wont win anything this year because the most of their players are pretty young so they dont have the experience enough to beat liverpool, man utd or neader chelsea who its really tough or even tottenham with giovani luca modric jenas and pavlyuchenko

Has anyone ever seen Dean Ashton's birth certificate?



The man cannot survive falling over, he looks like he is 50 when he is warming up, as stiff as a board. The slightest touch and he is off the pitch, he is going bald.
Now he has got a touch on his ankle so a month off for him!
He has got to be 40 if he is a day!

It's disgusting and I hope the true and decent minded fans are ashamed.
In saying that though we can't class them all the same.Rangers fans get pissed off when some celtic fans class us all the same when we're not and they aren't either.I just can't wait for the celtic fans in here who have the attitude that all their fans are saints to comment on this one.

lol....two options...just do it and see what happens (the worst is someone comes and says you can't) or ask your town/council at the risk of being denied right there and then. Then again if you ask they might say yes and if you do it without asking they might think you were arrogant and deny you and say they would have  let you if you just asked. Either way it's a gamble. Really no big deal though.

Better check with local authorities.  Elf & safety would have a 'view' about possible danger to toddlers - park-keeper a view about wear & tear if not moved everyday - all the usual meddling.  But if you're responsible enough to go through the proper channels they ought to agree.  There are appeals procedures so don't take any initial refusal as final.
Good luck.

Fergies overrated even i could win us trophies with the budget Fergies had over the years. Cantona a legend but he's wrong. Now Arsene Wenger he's a great manager who finds unknown players and turns them into stars. How many years did it take Fergie to find a replacement for Schmeichel. Some of Fergies signings have been pathetic like Taibi, Bellion, Djemba, Kleberson, Goram. And it took him about 5 years to realise Phil Neville and Nicky Butt are actually pub team players before selling them

LMAO you only want him to quit so you can win something!!
But in all seriousness I dont know who could there is no-one at the moment good enough. Maybe Cantona should be involved in some way as he obviously has the right philosophy and mentality that would ensure the club doesn't stray down the wrong path.

If I'm honest, he wasn't that committed the last time he was at Watford. He's a multi-millionaire, and one of the ritchest musicians in the world at the moment. Last time he was at the club, yeah he invested a bit, and he brought a lot of publicity to the club, but then he left!



From an outsider's perspective though, I can see why you're not happy with the current board. I can't remember a single big-money signing you've made since leaving the Premiership. Then you see the likes of King and Shittu leaving.



It does seem as if Watford have a lack of ambition, and that's reflected in your mediocre results since Christmas.

What can be done to level the EPL playing field?



Aston Villa said this week that they will struggle to pay Gareth Barry's wage demands unless they can break into the CL places this season.



The 'big' clubs are the only clubs who can afford the top quality players because they qualify for the CL regularly and they only do that because they can afford the top quality players.



So what can be done to introduce a bit of competition back into the EPL rather than have Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool playing their own league and everyone else playing theirs? Home grown player quotas? Collective salary capping? More stringent rules on clubs being bought against debt?

That's a shocker.  Keane's Liverpool city-centre penthouse was burgled.  How could burglary ever happened in ?



Liverpool?



Temperatures in the northwest of England are rising as we build up towards this weekend’s derby clash between Manchester United and Liverpool.



Sir Alex Ferguson kicked off his customary mind games with a comment about Robbie Keane, but the Irishman has no plans of taking it lying down despite having endured a difficult week.



Earlier this week, his city-centre penthouse was burgled, with a number of expensive items being taken, and he then had to endure Ferguson’s outburst.

no decent fans contribute to this bile..but I don't expect you to believe that as you have a pre concieved idea of me already because of the team I support.
my home is England...part of the Britain that you love so much..so technically I am "home"
do us all a favour, before you go on about the badness in Celtic fans remove the BJK from the end of your answers..play football on the field not in the past.. you are 3 points clear, why do you need to try to score more with CA?

hmmm, im not quite sure how many rangers fans would agree with you...i have never met a rangers fan who would Deny his/her scottish heritage.



many rangers fans are protestants and thats maybe where you are getting confused as they have a strong connection with william of orange who fought in the battle of the boyne.  this is where protestants and in turn rangers fans perhaps would pay allegiance to the queen, england and britian.



you say piss off home to england??since when did scottish football its fans have anything to do with coming from england?? fair point, they named their team after an english rugby teamafter seeing the name in a book.



rangers football team started up as an alternative team to celtic when the irish came over to scotland.  Rangers have nothing to do with england.

Beckham, McManaman, possibly Owen, errr ...



You could include players like Gary Lineker, David Platt or Mark Hughes but you've specified the EPL which only started in 1992.



I'm assuming we're talking English players here (or people who learned their trade in the English leagues)? Otherwise, you could include Henry, Pires, a host of others.

Scotland v Argentina?



the last time we heard of this proposal Gordon Smith was having to pay out £1million to the Argentines, and  to pay it he was going to raise the ticket prices, fans went ape, the idea was scrapped



now the game is back on at Hampden, but without the added £1million and the ticket prices are not rising, however..



am i alone in thinking Gordon Smith and the FA actually ARE shelling out this high fee to have Argentina here, and not letting on?



also, what implications is this going to have on our domestic game as money is already tight?

This is a friendly, right? So what's the point?



Argentina will send their B team over, Scotland will be hit by players withdrawing from the squad. I can't see much interest in it really.



If they're secretly diverting excessive funds from the SFA for this match, I'd be appalled. Friendlies can be good for blooding new players or trying out tactics, and do cost money to organise, but shouldn't be at the expense of the proper games.

They said they had negotiated a new few but I agree with you that it doesn't all add up. Also quoted as saying that ticket prices would be up to £35 which is still high in my opinion for a bounce match.



If it is true then it will have an affect on the domestic game as money is tight as it is. Also seen a report the other day about some youth football and women's youth football having to be funded from the proceeds of crime act. Something wrong there.

CR7 scored 42 goals last season and won many titles, but he performed poorly at EURO, why is that?



I mean, only one goal and quarter finalist after a great season, why is that? He sucks so bad!

He played in Man U and his country are 2 different things, maybe the style of playing he couldn't adapt during Euro 2008, in the premier league, he can coordinate well with his colleagues but not in his country, or the opponents he's facing is much stronger than premier league.

Berbs is a plonker you cant even begin to compare him with Bergs



Berbetov = legendary sulk
Bergkamp = legend.
Bruce Rioch was in charge of Arsenal just long enough that his feet did'nt touch the floor when he went. He did buy Bergkamp though our best player in the last 20 years.

I can see it. Both instinctive players who can/could drop off and bring others into the game or deliver a marvellous piece of skill on their own. Berbatov will get more TV time now he's at United and people will begin to see what a quality all round player he is.



I'm just waiting to see how Ferguson plays Berbatov. Obviously, Bergkamp was best with someone in front of him. Berbatov might not have that option.

<question>



What can be done to level the EPL playing field?



Aston Villa said this week that they will struggle to pay Gareth Barry's wage demands unless they can break into the CL places this season.



The 'big' clubs are the only clubs who can afford the top quality players because they qualify for the CL regularly and they only do that because they can afford the top quality players.



So what can be done to introduce a bit of competition back into the EPL rather than have Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool playing their own league and everyone else playing theirs? Home grown player quotas? Collective salary capping? More stringent rules on clubs being bought against debt?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



A salary cap. A club being what the name implies - a CLUB. No purchase against debt. Local player quotas - and by local I don't just mean England, think Sunderland for Sunderland, Fulham for Fulham and so on.



Maybe bite the bullet and follow Rugby - a ten minute sin bin instead of a yellow to get rid of overpriced foreign divers.



Also maybe just like the worlds banks the EPL economy is falsely inflated. Look at the money being thrown around. The clubs have became toys for rich boys and have some pretty astounding debts to banks and creditors. The banks go broke and want their money back to pay their creditors, where does that leave the clubs? Flat on their collective ar*es. Think the millionaire players will have a whip around and say to Liverpool "...never mind the yanks we've had a whip around at the pub and here's some dosh to keep the club going and never mind our salaries for the next year!" Newcastle could at least get Barton to go out and mug someone for some dosh!

Do you think the strictness of the work permit regulations has a negative affect on Scottish Football?



or would you prefer your team to bring through youth players? I watched some of the Motherwell game and the Everton game last night and both British teams were outplayed by AS Nancy and Standard Liege respectively. Both of these teams were full of players from Congo, Senegal and Cameroon which are countries were the level of player is good and value for money. Do you think the regulations should be weakened to help our clubs be more competivite in Europe or do you think things are ok as they just now?

Foreign players in English Football....are there too many?....?



Would English fans like to see a rule (for example... 5 homegrown players in starting eleven) for teams in Premier league?



Surely this would help the English National team and give promising youngsters a better chance to break through domestically?

i really hope so - its started off a great season - with hull beating arsenal, liverpool beating man utd, chelsea dropping a few points early also,



As a baggie id like to think we can stay up - fingers crossed
Hull look to have the confidence and will be mid table
Stoke are physical and can score - unpredictable



as from the midlands i like WBA & Stoke to stay with Wolves n Blues to return - see if we can beat the londoners !! lol

People just hate it when others disagree with there option, they will either report, or insult you,another reason it just simply pure envy I'm not perfect my-self, and it is easy to get involved more so when people abuse me for no apparent reason..



I have said this before, its yahoo's fault and they way this place is run, its a perfect set-up forum for the trolls to exploit, you are a better person than them, they are the bitter ones who live there life's in fear and rejection..



My best advice that's if you stick around, is to back up your normal account, all your e-mails, messenger etc, because you will lose the lot if the violators get there way..its all wrong.

No, not 'hate' - that's too strong by several orders of magnitude. I suppose it's like us talking about the sport that you call football and we call American football - how does that go down in America? It's just usage of an unfamiliar term for something that's spoken about as a matter of course.



Having said which, the word 'soccer' is a contraction of 'association', which is what football/soccer was known as to distinguish it from rugby...



Mark Twain had it right I think - he described England and America as two countries divided by a common language.

Soccer is just to differentiate it from "local" football sports, like Australian Football or American Football (which is why it's called soccer in these countries as soccer is less popular than the local football). In Britain, football is THE sport. Therefore, soccer has no place in the British dictionary.



But, strictly speaking, it should be called Football since you're playing with your feett.
Australian Football, you play it with your feet as well all the time.
American Football, not so much.. but I heard that it was because, long long time ago, sports were played by riding a horse, and then when American Football was invented, it was played on foot instead of on horse.



My opinion, yes, I do hate the word Soccer. I think other "footballs" should make a new word for themselves instead of changing the name of the most popular sports in the world to become "soccer"

As an Englishman who now lives in Canada i can say that i hear the word (soccer) all the time. I find myself trying to explain to my North American friends that soccer is a slang word for Association Football. I have noticed that the MLS team in Toronto call them selves Toronto f.c. (football club) so maybe North Americans will eventually refer to the sport by its correct name.

It can be a little annoying, but it's understandable when you have more than one game with the name football to use another word for one, soccer only stands for association football anyway so it makes sense.



What makes less sense to me is why you call a game you play mainly with your hands football.

I think it has more to do with the fact that you call "football" football, when you clearly never use your feet, except for kicks at goal. I dont think Brits hate it as such.



Also, there is some confusion as rugby union is actually officially Rugby Football Union, and the same more or less applies to the use of feet.

No I don't hate it - it's just not called soccer, it's football. But that tends to confuse Americans because they think of American Football - completely different game!



The one that always gets me laughing is when I hear American's say 'pants' for trousers. Pants are underwear! like 'panties'



Oh and 'fanny' is another good one - I believe Amercian's mean bottom, but in the UK fanny is another word for a woman's private parts! lol!

Spurs and Newcastle. Are they going down?



Neither have a divine right to stay in the Premiership and their squads should be good enough to stay up, but do you think they will stay up.



I know Arsenal and Sunderland fans (and the rest) will want them to go down, but do you actually believe they will be relegated?

i am chelsea and feel sorry for both sets of fans.
i watched the uefa match yesterday and in the first half spurs were abysmal. 2nd half better. but there seems to be no leadership on the pitch.
i think one will go but don't know who.
you are right no team has the divine right to be in the premiership.

Newcastle has been damaged so much and team morale is so low.  Their best players will leave in the transfer season and it is unlikely they'll be able to recover from where they sit now so yes, they will go down.  Real shame and many lessons to be learnt here by all clubs.



Tottenham?  I bet Ramos is gutted he's not with Sevilla still given how well they're doing.  They are really poor at the moment although they can turn things around enough to avoid relegation if they really want to.  They are in the Uefa still at the moment too so a lot to be positive about.

i hope they go down !! at least the albion will have more chance of staying up then



football is about a team, not only the 11 players, but manager, coaching staff to chairman and the fans, if some part of this isnt working then success cant happen. nobody has the right to stay cause they have the money or the quality cause there are 18 other teams wanting to be staying there also

I think no team has a divine right to stay up and too good to go down. What will help these two clubs, as long as they are not too badly adrift the board will spend according amounts of monies to help them stay up with the manager's help. Newcastle are more at danger than Tottenham as there are no real foundation in the managers role at the moment.

Celtic/Rangers to the EPL?



Would Celtic or Rangers fans welcome a move to the EPL? Would it be good or bad for Scottish football?



I've read a comment this week from the English FA that the question is pointless as the EPL is only open to English teams but, if Cardiff got promoted, that would all go out the window surely. Does that mean the Gers and the Bhoys could get to the EPL via a season in the Championship?

to be honest i wouldn't want rangers in the epl anyway..the money would be more than welcome right enough..and before anyone starts about us not being good enough..once rangers and celtic got the same sponsorship deals as the english clubs we would more than be able to compete..we also have the support to carry us through..but no matter what some like to think rangers are a scottish club.

I would suggest it would make it more competitive at the business end with many teams in with a shout of honours but without the added income which the Old Firm bring, the quality would go down and Scottish football domestically would end up like Ireland or Wales, so , not so good in my opinion.



Not going to happen anyway, for a whole host of reasons

Sooner the better as Scottish football is awful and gets progressively worse year after year-Celtic will never break through the glass ceiling to Europe's elite until they rid themselves of the shackles of all the other Scottish clubs.They are big enough in brand and infrastructure to equip themselves well at the top table of U.K. Football-bring it on is what I think!!

Consider this. Wouldn't you like to see a United Kingdom league? With transport links so much better these days, I can't see why a UK league is not possible to run. It would give the LoW and IFA teams the chance to have a higher income through sponsorship and television rights.  The divisions should be divided up so the majority of the top division in the first season are English, due to their higher quality, and place the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish teams in the lower divisions. The top 3 or 4 divisions should be mixed, then any lower divided in sections, as the lower teams may not be able to afford to travel all the time. These sections would be titled Division 4-England, Division 4-Scotland and so forth. Also, in the places for Europe, the Champions League and UEFA Cup places in the current "smaller" leagues (Wales, NI) should be played for in a 8-team mini tournament involving the teams of their country only or something like that.
Now the international teams, they would remain separate, as players are from their own country, simple as that, however, a United Kingdom team would be good for the Olympic Games.



I don't know if that answered your question, but I'm actually going to list this as a question of my own!

(as much as i hate saying this, its the truth)
chelsea is a more complete/balanced club than man.u, but honestly i dont know who is better. they are almost the same, apart from the fact that man u is more agressive on offense, and chelsea is better at defense.

Show some f*ckin respect, just because they are not a 'big' name team, they deserve to be there, they beat Roma in Italy and since you didn't watch game (some fan you are), Chelsea done well to get a draw anyway. Muppet

Patronising sod! As with Manchester City right now, money only solves 50% of a teams' victories...the rest depends on the actions of the manager, coach and players. Why are FC Cluj a 'crap' team - if they can hold Chelsea with a draw, obviously they're a team with determination.

That rule was already suggested by Blatter and Platini.And not only does the EPL have foreigners,but also Serie A and La Liga have foreigners as well.Inter Milan are in Serie A but there isn't a single Italian in the first team,unless you count Materazzi,who's been playing whenever Walter Samuel was injured.AC Milan are also a mini-Brazil,with 7 Brazilians in the team.

OH that old chestnut.
few years back teams were only allowed a certain number of foreign players including irish welsh and scottish. therefore vast majority of players were english. what did we win nothing since 66!
you not only have to have the talent but the grit determination and will
power to want to be a good player. lots of our kids are just too mollycoddled and babied. they grow into weak demanding adults.
they want the best boots, but play footie rarely. i know its not all of them. a lot of the foreign players come from poorer countries and know no-one is going to help them but themselves.
also kids here play competitively too young - at six it should be 5 aside max. this would hone their talent and stop boredom
no let anyone good enough play wherever they are from

depends.  sometimes a workplace gets an envelope and passes it around, people are free to add what they want, and someone organises getting a gift with it or gives them cash and a card.  depends on the number of people in the workplace and how much you can afford - i once worked in a place with 400 staff so each member of staff who knew them put in £2 or £3, it soon mounted up.



in my current job there is only 8 of us, we put £5 in each.

I think Celtic supporters ('myself included) get carried away a bit when something like this breaks as we're more used to Scottish rags like the  Daily Rectum or Scottish currant Bun covering Rankers shame and misbehaviour up!! , while the slightest misdemenour at Celtic Park seems to make front Page news.. there were more reporters in Villarreal waiting for a sectarian chant or song than there was to report on the actual game...

Celtic/Rangers to the EPL?



Would Celtic or Rangers fans welcome a move to the EPL? Would it be good or bad for Scottish football?



I've read a comment this week from the English FA that the question is pointless as the EPL is only open to English teams but, if Cardiff got promoted, that would all go out the window surely. Does that mean the Gers and the Bhoys could get to the EPL via a season in the Championship?

to be honest i wouldn't want rangers in the epl anyway..the money would be more than welcome right enough..and before anyone starts about us not being good enough..once rangers and celtic got the same sponsorship deals as the english clubs we would more than be able to compete..we also have the support to carry us through..but no matter what some like to think rangers are a scottish club.

I can't comment as a 'Celtic or Rangers fan' but good or bad for Scottish Football? I would suggest it would make it more competitive at the business end with many teams in with a shout of honours but without the added income which the Old Firm bring, the quality would go down and Scottish football domestically would end up like Ireland or Wales, so , not so good in my opinion.

Sooner the better as Scottish football is awful and gets progressively worse year after year-Celtic will never break through the glass ceiling to Europe's elite until they rid themselves of the shackles of all the other Scottish clubs.They are big enough in brand and infrastructure to equip themselves well at the top table of U.K. Football-bring it on is what I think!!

Consider this. Wouldn't you like to see a United Kingdom league? With transport links so much better these days, I can't see why a UK league is not possible to run. It would give the LoW and IFA teams the chance to have a higher income through sponsorship and television rights.  The divisions should be divided up so the majority of the top division in the first season are English, due to their higher quality, and place the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish teams in the lower divisions. The top 3 or 4 divisions should be mixed, then any lower divided in sections, as the lower teams may not be able to afford to travel all the time. These sections would be titled Division 4-England, Division 4-Scotland and so forth. Also, in the places for Europe, the Champions League and UEFA Cup places in the current "smaller" leagues (Wales, NI) should be played for in a 8-team mini tournament involving the teams of their country only or something like that.
Now the international teams, they would remain separate, as players are from their own country, simple as that, however, a United Kingdom team would be good for the Olympic Games.

FIFA would not allow a United Kingdom team enter the Olympics and individual nations in the world cup !



Transport has improved, but Yeovil v Inverness Cally Thistle would still be an awful journey.  In fact there is talk currently about re-regionalising Leagues 1 and 2 - to make League 1 South and League 1 North.  I for one, would hate this idea - as I live in the south, but support Scunthorpe - as some teams have complained about the distances they have to travel.



A UK league would be fine for the teams, but would be rubbish for the fans.  Secondly Welsh teams are allowed in the English league already.

As for Berbitov he is shite and regarding Keane he's a team player who assists and now scores so he is the better buy.

Better than under Rafa's ridiculous rotation policy (rotate for no reason). He's now playing his best players where possible unless they're injured or there's a big European match midweek and he wants to rest the best players for that. e.g. leaving Torres and Gerrard out of the starting line-up against Man U as there was a match against Marseille coming up.



Definitely think in with a shout for the Premiership but there's a long way to go yet.

I'm not going to lie to you. I am an Arsenal fan, and I was brought up in an environment where I grew to hate Liverpool with a passion. But, I believe that now the rotation policy has gone, that this is Liverpool's chance to win their first EPL. As far as I remember, this is Liverpool's most talented squad since the EPL came into force, so if Liverpool win the title, I will gracefully say "Well done, you really earned it".

Whether there is no rotating policy or not, the most important thing is consistency, if sometimes they played attacking football, sometimes defensive, then it's hard for them to win, Rafa always on mind games, let's wait and see if they can do the double over Man U, beat Chelsea and Arsenal at home, drew away at Stamford Bridge and Emirates stadium, then they have a slight chance.

I think the introduction of Sammy Lee (a born and bread fanatical Scouser) has helped because he knows exactly what the fans want.
Every Liverpool fan was frustrated with Rafa's rotation and I think he's finally got the message....Play the best 11 unless there's an obvious loss of form or injuries.
LFC have got their best chance of finally winning the EPL this year as long as they are consistance throughout the season, something they haven't managed to do in previous seasons.

Do you think the strictness of the work permit regulations has a negative affect on Scottish Football?



or would you prefer your team to bring through youth players? I watched some of the Motherwell game and the Everton game last night and both British teams were outplayed by AS Nancy and Standard Liege respectively. Both of these teams were full of players from Congo, Senegal and Cameroon which are countries were the level of player is good and value for money. Do you think the regulations should be weakened to help our clubs be more competivite in Europe or do you think things are ok as they just now?



</question>



<additional details>



CC, I understood you and I agree with you to an extent. Think it comes down to are you happy with your club being oh so unlucky in Europe or actually being competitive but as you rightly say this will then have a detriment to the national side. Tough balance to keep.

Where are (the once formidable) Belgium on the World Footballing map these days?



France has always had an easy 'route' into Europe for African footballers but with a population of 70million is never going to suffer in the same way we (5mil) Belgium (10mil) or even England are/will, should our homegrown talent struggle to break through thanks to cheap foreign imports.



Your options ...."Do you think the regulations should be weakened to help our clubs be more competivite in Europe or do you think things are ok as they just now?".... don't include the opinion that there are too many foreign players, which I believe to be the case (certainly in England if not here 'yet')



Obviously, making it easier for foreigners to play in our league would make the football better but would be detrimental in the long term for our game as a whole.



F***, I'm confusing myself now, hope you can understand roughly what I am on about!?

Deary me Anne Marie, this just isnt the type of question we get on here. No knuckle dragging orcs,Scotlands shame,  tattie famines or BJK ? lol Its far too serious a question.



I am not even sure what the rules are regarding the foreigners allowed to play here. Is it all depending on caps for country ? I do love to see players advance from the youth though and if we slacken the rules and allow more imports I think we would lose even more chances for the youngsters. Think possibly the national team would suffer as well, the way the English team has.

I would prefer that we reared and played our own, but you will never see that again. because the richer clubs will always buy foreign talent its a quick fix solution and a gurantee of succsess, you only have to look at the Arsenal, with the exception of Walcott where are the rest of the home grown talent, its just not gonna happen now. add to that the european work regs, means that pandoras box is well and truly open.

Only Celtic have really made any lasting impression in Europe Anne Marie, but if smaller clubs like Rankers..M/well..Hibs..etc could hold onto their youngsters longer then they might be able to form a decent knit working team that could compete for honours, look at some of the youngsters M/well have had to release over the years?  till then I'm afraid Scottish football with the exception of Celtic will always trail behing the rest of Europe "if they can qualify at all????? .....  and the bloody weather doesn't help attract top names..Brrrrrrr'

Scotland v Argentina?



the last time we heard of this proposal Gordon Smith was having to pay out £1million to the Argentines, and  to pay it he was going to raise the ticket prices, fans went ape, the idea was scrapped



now the game is back on at Hampden, but without the added £1million and the ticket prices are not rising, however..



am i alone in thinking Gordon Smith and the FA actually ARE shelling out this high fee to have Argentina here, and not letting on?



also, what implications is this going to have on our domestic game as money is already tight?

This is a friendly, right? So what's the point?



Argentina will send their B team over, Scotland will be hit by players withdrawing from the squad. I can't see much interest in it really.



If they're secretly diverting excessive funds from the SFA for this match, I'd be appalled. Friendlies can be good for blooding new players or trying out tactics, and do cost money to organise, but shouldn't be at the expense of the proper games.

They said they had negotiated a new deal but I agree with you that it doesn't all add up. Also quoted as saying that ticket prices would be up to £35 which is still high in my opinion for a bounce match.



If it is true then it will have an affect on the domestic game as money is tight as it is. Also seen a report the other day about some youth football and women's youth football having to be funded from the proceeds of crime act. Something wrong there.

I'm with Anne Marie, 35quid for a friendly is still too much and I won't be going anyway cause when you add travel and 'refreshment' cost to this, I'm paying £100 to see what is essentially a wee meaningless kick-about.



Doubt we are shelling out the 1million which was quoted originally but wouldn't surprise me if it isn't a kick in the balls off it.



I will be interested to see the crowd figure, I would predict (with many through here in the east or up north having the same view as myself) that it will struggle to rise above 25/30,000...



*Haha Davie ...sh it...how do I get out of this one?



Okay, I dinnae drive so it's the choo-choo (19 quid return)



35 + 19 = 54....  You can't go to Glasgow without paying their inflated prices to sample the fine ales (Tennents) then you throw in a few quid for a bite to eat and you are at 100quid nae probs.

The first number is what you win and the second number is how much you have to stake, or gamble to win it.



So 4/9 Chelsea means you must risk 9 to win 4, or 18 to win 8, or 2.25 to win 1 etc.



3/1 Draw means that for each pound you bet you will win 3 if it is a draw. The thing to remember is that you get your stake back too, so in this example if you bet 5 pounds on the draw and it is a draw you get back 5 x 3 = 15 plus your 5 stake = 20 total and a profit of 15.

Hull will be relegated this season, they don't have the class Reading had.  Reading got promoted from the Championship with a record number of points, Hull went up through the play-offs.



Despite a good start, I can't see them finishing higher than bottom.  WBA are the best of the three promoted sides, Stoke will fight to get a few points, Hull will disapppear without a whimper.

<question>



Who is the best manager and player outside the premier league?



I think Gordon Chisholm and Steven Dobbie are by far, and they'll be taking Queens to promotion this season!



Who do you think are the best outside the top flight?



</question>



<additional details>



Scotland only please!



McCall nearly ruined queens, big overrated fat t*ss*r! Chisholm has turned the club around completely.



The only thing McCall taught chisholm was how not to manage a football team, How did McCall get on at Dundee United??



Scottish leagues only please, don't know this Bob Ronaldo or Jimmy Ronaldinho do they play for Annan and Cowdenbeath!

Maybe I will agree with you so I can maybe be awarded top answer.... then again, maybe not



Stop talking pish.



Chisholm is a decent manager, no more no less at this time, what does his CV say? Poor with Dundee Utd then sacked, doing well with QOS (1 year)



Dobbie - Struggled at Hibs, could barely get a game at St Johnstone, decent at QOS



Don't know the answer but Ian McCall has achieved far more in the game and actually taught Chisholm a lot about managing a football club.



As for player... I could fire a list of about 40 or 50 who I believe to be a better player than Stephen Dobbie outside the SPL in Scotland.



Which, now I think about it, you spelt the boys name wrong too.



**McCall worked wonders at Clydebank, Airdrie (getting them to SPL) Got Falkirk where they are today and has slowly impoved Thistle, He done okay at Utd compared to the likes of Chisholm, Brewster etc.. When in charge of QoS, McCall was working with a part time team in a league of full time opponents, Chisholm now has a squad of full time players which gives him a huge advantage which McCall never had.

Do you remember what your team were up to in 2001?



Google have released a version of one of their first ever search engines.



http://www.google.com/search2001.html



Some guy called O'neill was about to take Celtic into their first adventure in the Champions League to play Ajax. Celtic were stunned as youngster Mark Burchill handed in a transfer request (lmao) and John Hartson said he had no intention of coming to Scotland.



Over Ibrox way, Rangers were closely tracking the progress of a certain Jan Vennegoor of Hesslink and were close to placing a £10m bid in for him (whatever did happen to this guy?!? lol)



Also the word Ipod did not exist. How times changes. Can you find anything interesting about your club that you had forgotten about?

Van Persie is a good player but not a top player, he will score more goals than Walcott so that's why Walcott has been used in midfield and not up front, Adebayor simply will score more goals than Van Persie and that's why he is the top Arsenal striker.

graceful, elegant, clinical, FRAGILE



He is a great player, and the one and only reason he isn't regarded as he deserves to be is because he has been consistently getting injured and his service has only been ever available for 1/4 of the season. This season, all Arsenal fans will admit he has been lasting pretty long so far, 5 out of 6 games may be a new record for him. But we all bite our fingernails when watching him play because we fear he may get injured at some point. Which he did in that game he could have well gotten his first hat trick for the club. Instead he had to come off and Adebayor got the hat trick. He could have also gotten one against Porto, but injury awareness led Wenger to take him off early and Adebayor took the penalty he would have taken instead.
If van Persie played a full season, he would be competing for premier league golden boot, possibly even UEFA. His goals/game record is unmatched. But he only gets 15-20 goals per season because he only plays 15-20 games per season or maybe less.



Both are good jersey choices. van Persie is already established as a great player and Theo is still in the process of making his name.

He has played for Leeds, Inter Milan and Spurs and been VERY successful at all these clubs. That is not to mention his exploits at international level. What is he... the best irish striker of all time? And he is what... overrated????



You couldnt be more out of touch with the guy.



He has arrived a new club, he is settling in, getting used to his new teammates and the style of play. He could have got man of the match against Everton but he got it against PSV. He is on the same pitch as Gerrard, Torres, Riera and Alonso and he clearly stood out.

Do you love it or hate it?



A little man who loved the circus was delighted when it came to town for 2 weeks.He booked front row tickets for every performance.On the first night it started with the clowns and everyone was laughing at the little clown.The clown went up to the little man and pointed and shouted,what are you laughing at me for look at this guy his eyes are like dinner plates.The wee man was so embarrassed he got up and went home.On the second night the same thing happened what are you doing laughing at me,he's got eyes like LP's.So the wee guy left and was very upset and told his pal he couldn't go back.His pal said wait a minute have you heard of Simon Dupree' , the wee man says no.So he hands him a card and says he'll sort it for you.The wee man reads the card Simon Dupree' the master of sarcasm and wit,Anyone giving you trouble give me a call and i'll sort it,my sarcasm and wit is an art to me that i've practised for many years,and I can use it in any given situation to tear anyone to pieces,So he called the number and Mr Dupree's secretary made an appointment for the next day because he had a space due to cancellation.So the wee man goes to his home and it's a big mansion he has to speak through an intercom to get through the gate,He had to walk through acres of grounds to get to the house.Outside the house was a fleet of cars. Limo's Rolls,Royces Bentleys etc.He rang the bell and the butler answered.The wee man states his business and is shown to Mr Dupree's study.
He walks in the door and is dazzled by this man,he is six feet four with a boxers build,his clothes are immaculate.it is the most impressive sight the wee man has ever seen.The wee man tells his story.Simon Dupree' says yes,I take great pleasure in jobs like this,that clown sounds like a nasty piece of work.He said my fee is one thousand pounds.The wee man said i've only got 300 it's my life savings.Mr Dupree' says Hmmm I really want this one, so i'll do a deal with you,wash all my cars and i'll do it for 300.So the wee man washes all the cars he knocks his pan in for 8 hours.Then Mr Dupree' says, get into my Bentley,we're going to the circus.They get to the circus the clowns come on the wee man is laughing along with everyone else,the clown goes to the wee man,points and says look at this joker if you want a laugh his eyes are like dustbin lids.The wee man smiles and looks at Mr Dupree'.He stands up the arena is silent.He says to the clown allow me to introduce myself my name is Simon Dupree'  this man beside me is a dear friend of mine and if you don't stop slagging him i'll punch your head in.

Consistent bad performers should be stripped of their license and retrained.  And after 3 months trial in the lower leagues should they be allowed back into tthe top divisions.



As for video technology .... I am against it .... the odd referee mistake like the handball missed orr the offside goal ..... are what makes football the most talked about subject in hiomes, streets and pubs across the world.

Demoting them is unfair on the lower league sides that would end up suffering eg Rochdale, Bury, my team Crewe and further down the line teams like Witton Albion and Gainsborough.



Take away their licences and consider an application made. If accepted make them relearn all the laws in a clasroom based environment.



Or if they were called Jeff Winter make them listen to ABBA for a few months.

Do not use them, simple as that, or limit them (if there are not enough referees) to lower league games or use them as linesmen (sorry, referees assistants).

if they make mistakes regularly re train them and make them sit exams again - if it carries on then sack them. i think video evidence for disputed goals and red cards is inevitable. it works in rugby and tennis.

They should have a point deduction system... If they accumulate a number of points, then they will be out of the industry. At least with the point system, still can give them some chance to improve on their composure, I think sometimes when they made a mistake, mostly is because they are feeling the heat and couldn't composed themselves.

After checking on video replays, the FA should give them a yellow card for two mistakes, and a red card (three match ban) for three + mistakes in a game.

Considering the vast amounts of money involved in today's game, all referees should have the benefit of electronic assistance to help with their decisions.
It works in other sports - it would work in soccer.
It's ludicrous that, under certain conditions, one dubious decision by a referee, can affect a club to the tune of many millions of pounds.

If they're making consistently bad decisions they should be investigated. Especially if it's in favour or against the same teams over and over. They should possibly be fired. We don't need bad refs. The less the better.

Hi



Just like in any other profession, if not already, all referees should be addressed by a senior person/official and de-brief the decisions they have made on their games (good or bad) on a weekly or monthly basis.  They should be praised where they have refereed well such as high profile matches where the players can be a bit of a handful and also highlight and address any exceptional levels of bad decision/refereeing.  In the case of the latter, a plan could be set with realistic goals to ensure that the error levels drop within  a specific time period and if this doesn't happen then the referee would be issued with a formal warning upon the next meeting.  If matters still didn't improve then the referee would be made redundant.  I really don't see why this management style which is used in so many occupations can't be applied to Sport.

The draw for the group stage of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup will be held at UEFA Headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, at 12:00CET on 7 October 2008. The 40 teams in the draw will be divided into five pots based on their UEFA coefficients. The eight teams with the highest UEFA coefficient will be allocated to Pot 1, the next eight teams to Pot 2, and so on. One team from each pot will be drawn for each group, with the restriction that no team may be drawn with one from the same country.



ac milan are in pot 1.

For dark horse, I'd say Cluj. If they get out of their group they'll far exceed everyone's expectations.

Manchester United will win the UEFA Champions League this season because of their strike force with Ronaldo, Tevez, Rooney and Berbatov.  It's hard to score against them too, with Vidic, Ferdinand, Neville, Evra and Van der Sar all along the back line too.

i think they have more of a chance than many of the other teams in the competition.



in the last 4 years, liverpool have won the competition, got to another final, and went out in the semi's, a record any of the other clubs in europe would want.



they also seem to 'know how to play' in europe, where, even when they are out matched on paper, they seem to come through.



here's hoping they do!!!

This Liverpool team is definitely superior to the Liverpool team that won in 2005, so it's possible.  And no matter who is better, they only have to beat them over 2 legs, not an entire season.  Plus some of the other teams will knock each other out.  After the group stage there will be 16 teams left, but you only gotta beat 3 (not the other 15) to get to the final.

<question>



Liverpool fans, was yesterdays game another sign of how much better we are this season?



Last night we played half a team of players who would usually be either on the bench or not involved at all...Hyypia, Pennant, Lucas and Babel obviously aren't first team players. Skrtel, Agger, Mascherano and Torres didn't play. Riera and Keane didn't start. This is the sort of fixture we would have drawn last season, and right now we would probably be grumbling about Rafa and his rotation. But this season we're coming back from European fixtures & big league games and still winning. Last season every time we played in the CL you just knew we would play poorly in the next league game and usually draw. The result against Stoke is the exception, but the game itself was completely one sided and should have ended 3 or 4 - nil. This to me shows real DEPTH in the squad.



See where I'm coming from?



</question>



<additional details>



Duke Lucas: That's exactly my point. We scrapped and went on to win a game we would have drawn last season. But we won. And by the way, didn't you also say you really believed Spurs would finish 3rd this season? Ha ha, how's that working out for ya? ;-)



Stu: Yup, that's what I'm getting at...Lucas is shite compared to most of our players but we still dominated the game!

I see where your coming from but we didn't play well last night!
I don't like Pennant at all he needs to be sold, and i don't see what Lucas brings to the party he's not that good!
We were all huff and puff last night and should of finished them off as it was always one way traffic.
But 3 pts are 3pts so just take em and move on to next game!
It makes me laugh though people saying "lucky" penalty!
Could that have been more nailed on?

all you can do is beat the teams put in front of you



people said liverpool dont beat the top teams.  we beat chelsea and man utd - without a full-strength side - and we deserved to beat them



now theyre saying we'll drop points against lesser teams.  we've only dropped points twice this season, and in one of those games (stoke) i reckon we wouldve won by 3 or 4 goals if gerrard's free kick had been allowed (stoke's manager said he couldnt see anything wrong with it)



apart from being top, the best thing about this season so far is the fact that liverpool have the best 2nd half record in the prem



by mid-november liverpool will have played 9 games in less than a month, so you can see why benitez made so many changes last night...

Have you not realised were rubbish we are lucky to win eight games and be the only undefeated club in the premiership and beat the two previous champions (while out playing them)



I think were getting better and better we can use our lesser players to better effect as they believe we can win. We are dominating a lot of games just not finding the net as many times as we maybe should (torres should sort that though)

you wouldn't think so as he is an excellent talent as you said
i remember seeing him play in a youth competition in northern ireland called the milk cup. he was still playing for barcelona but was unbelievable and reminded many in the stands (including myself) of Ronaldhinio. I think he won player of the tournament as well so it shows he has had good talent since he was 16/17. Even when he was at barca he was very good and even scored a hat-trick in the last day of what was a disappointing season for them so it also proves he can still play well even if he is surrounded by poor players
anyway i think he still has to beat off players like bentley and modric (who are playing quite well now) before he can get anywhere near the first team (and his favoured position as an attacking threat) but he definitely has the talent to be great for spurs and i still think he was a great buy for them

I'm sure the lottery over-ran. Also for those saying "why don't you just turn your TV on when it's time", the national lottery is on like 10 minutes before. They used to just give a summary, instead now they have some lame pop singer and turn it into a proper event like anyone cares at that time!

can't you just buy a TV guide, and turn the tv on when the match ACTUALLY starts, instead of expecting it to be there just for you when you want it....



anyway theres more interesting things to do than watch football, why can't you just tape it then watch it later? then you won't have to wait.

It is about the same level of annoying as when a football match drags on and over-runs when I am waiting for a decent programme to come on the TV. There is more than just you and football in the world you know.

Victimised? God that's hilarious. There is a large section of the gers support who deliberately want to push the boundaries and chuck their dummies out of the pram if they are not allowed to say what they want. John Reid was correct  when he said this is a vile vicious and racist song which has no place in Scottish Football. Action should have been taken when it was first sang last season. Now due to the lack of action from the SFA, SPL, Rangers and the police until hopefully now, you will maybe get one or 2 token arrests to just to prove they are doing something then creating a powderkeg at most games. I felt really sorry for the racist guy who posted on Follow Follow, saying how he won't be back as he cant sing the racist song or the billy boys anymore. He said that Minty is to blame for ruining what is his "kulture" when following The Rangers. It's 2008 for crying out loud, why dont they do something novel and make up a couple of new songs about their own club instead of deflecting away from the issue.

Interesting reply Anne Marie, I have often said recently that Rangers fans should be looking to put some new songs instead of harping on about the 'Billy Boys' getting binned. I still get embarrassed when our fans sing the likes of 'Boys of the old Brigade' etc at away games. 2008 time 2 move on. x

i think the whole thing has been blown so big compared to similar - if not more offensive - happenings at other games.  why are Rangers being victimised?



Why are we the only club to be getting this stick?



every celtic away game this season has had sectarian singing.  the aberdeen fans still sing about ibrox disasters.  hearts have their songs too.  im not point scoring against celtic here but common sense must prevail - the SFA, the SPL, Celtic, the Daily Record, The Sun, the rest of Murdoch's media empire, Irish Government, heads of the Catholic church... what does it have to do with the last two?  Nothing.  Ireland can stay out of Scotland, and the religious people (any religious people) should stay out of football - or the problem WONT go away.



yet not one thing about other songs (and no punishment or investigation whatsoever).  When Celtic sang in Inverness, there was a column about an inch wide in the Sun.  When Rangers sing the famine song...  theres a ten page pull out.



so why just the famine song?

Yes afraid so The teams doing well in the league and Co-op Cup



Good chance of winning the League possibly the treble so the press and media put the spotlight on the supporters.



There was a campaign to stop the fans singing the billy boys because it refer-ed to a certain Blood group That song was banned The famine song is next



No doubt if we started singing Hyms at matches they would be banned as an insult to another god or we would be picking on or insulting the roman catholic church



It s time to lighten up it s only through this harassment that the song has taken on a greater importance to the fans

why does having a 60,000 seater have anything to do with being on par with arsenal??? if you take a look at this link you will see that we also have a huge fan base... and would fill it every week just as you do...  we may not be quite as good as arsenal but we do still have a huge fan base

<question>



If i pay for my ticket can i have an opinion?



Since David Seaman us Arsenal fans have not been in full confidence of our goalkeepers, now i admit that isn't helping them but i remember once i sat behind the goal and shouted support for Jens Lehmann and he had a good game now i felt that i maybe have helped him a little. When Lehmann made mistakes he paid for it yet we still loved him and i thank him for everything he did for the club.



Now Almunia when he changed his hair colour he didn't fool anyone he was still the same keeper, he makes good saves but he also makes a lot of mistakes and i bet Gallas and Toure would like a solid keeper behind them which would make their lives easier. All keepers make mistakes but when keepers like Cech make mistakes i bet John Terry knows its a one off but with Almunia he will let it effect him. I will not abuse Almunia and i will shout support while hes an Arsenal keeper but surely Wenger has to realise that we cannot win the league with someone like him in goal.



So to complain i come on places like these to voice my opinions.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Since Cech's won Golden Glove Award and KOTY (Keeper Of The Year)



3 times...when he makes a mistake...he makes about 3 a season ;)



I think Wenger has to realise than Almunia is still young for a Goalkeeper , and Lehmann should still be at Arsenal..Almunia wasn't his understudy as he was always ahead of Lehmann for a time



Wenger needs to buy a keeper who's ATLEAST 30 as they are always in there prime round about that age , except the very exceptional ones , even if he bought Dida from A.C Milan..he would bring so much experience to Arsenal...he would keep the back 4 in check...and Almunia would learn a lifes worth with him..or anyone like that

Poll: Match of the Day or Football First?



I like to watch Football First when it's an important game for Liverpool but most of the time I'll choose Match of the Day so I can see how every team in the Prem played. I also enjoy hearing Alan Hansen heaping praise on Liverpool ;-)



What about you? Which do you prefer and why?

In EPL, the last time Arsenal conceded 4 goals at home was against Man Utd on 1 Feb 2005.



The Score was 2-4.



Giggs, Ronaldo(2) and O'Shea scored for ManUtd.



Viera and Bergkamp was the scorers for Arsenal

"No the four goals could decide the premier league winner as in goal difference be positive."



But you conceded 4, making the GD 0.  Scoring more means nothing if you concede just as much.  You can score 100 but if you let in 100 your GD is still 0.

For how long can Abramovich keep Chelsea FC ?



I hear he's lost around 20 billion dollars with the stock market turmoil....



With all the expensive wages and burden of new contracts and maintenance that comes with owning an extravagant club like Chelsea, can Abramovich stay at the helm for the future seasons?



Or is he going to sell his share and get lost?

Show all national games on  T.V for Free.
Live Club Games should be paid for to bring in that extra cash for those clubs. But the highlights, should be shown on normal T.V on the night of the game at a reasonable time.



Glasgow Rangers should be never shown on t.v again becuase they are 'Scotlands Shame'

They should get it off Setanta straight away, It's about 15 quid a month and their is only one game on a week, the rest is just a bunch of Yanks playing Rounders.



They should show it all for free, you guys get enough money as it is.



BTW, does it do you're head in when Ruud Gullit call's you Samuel  8-2-0?  because it does mine in!

international games should be on free channels, whilst most premier league matches could be on paid channels. So while games like england vs france and urfa cup matches could be on the bbc or itv, the premier league, coca cola leagues ad other world leagues could be on sky or setanta. So football is split fairly equally between free and paid channels.

International games should be on free channels, more views.
But they put it on PPV becuase its more money for them.
For the people, they want free-to-air television.
But the FIFA people choose PPV since its the money some of them are there for.

I think the freedom of watching football matches should be spread in between those who can afford spending money for them and those who cannot. Many viewers in this era cannot afford paid channels... and admittedly paid channels can sometimes prove dissapointing as their features are no different to free channels. I think there's plenty of other methods a football team can profit. I spend over £200 a year on Futbol Club Barcelona's membership fees, Barca TV online and products. Barca TV online proves very VERY upsetting to me as I wish to watch every match they play live through there and they rarely do. I doubt I would pay for Barca TV online again. So I would consider most matches to always be free to view. I can't envisage why football clubs or subscription channels want further profits from these. They're rich enough to feed the masses of the Third World which I am sure of all people you can understand from Samuel.



Anyways thanks for your opinions and wish you all the best at Barca once again :D.

Hi Sammy.



Technically there is no such thing as Free-to-air TV in the UK as there is the TV licence and even for basic sattelite tv/cable TV packages there is a subscription fee before adding any Sports channels.



Therefore, as idealistic as it may sound I personally think all sport should be free to all formats of TV as it will help get more people into sport and hopefully living healthier lifestyles.



The broadcasters will still make their money through the advertisers who want their product to be seen in the breaks between coverage of the big teams and clubs will arguably make more money as more people will then be able to watch the games and therefore be more likely to "buy in" to a certain club and spend their money on that club's kits and merchandise.



Best wishes to you and all at Barca.

In the UK they have come to a compromise. Sky and Sentanta have invested a lot of money into showing football on their networks. Without their input of money we would not have the standard of football we have today. Some Champions league matches , FA Cup , League Cup games are shown live on free to air TV already and there are highlights of all English games to. If there was free to air TV all the time then the Crowds would not go to the games and the attendances will fall and what little revenue they would get from free-to-air would set back English football  years and make are National team worse.
If its not Broke do not fix it - Things are all right as they are at this moment of time.

All away games should be free and live through your own clubs broadcasting, the fans pay enough at home games and in web subscriptions, but because of the transmission laws seemingly I can't watch Celtic till after midnight on Celtic t ' v ' yet if Setanta screen it I can watch it live if I'm a subscriber I feel I'm paying twice so why do Celtic not have sole rights to show the game live on the day on Celtic television? why call it Celtic television when Setanta have the rights? ... greed!!  selling the rights through the Sfa to Setanta, which shows very little regard for the fans. it's disgusting how big clubs milk the fans. Greed is killing the game. they want paid twice for one service. Celtic do anyway I can't speak for other clubs.

All national matches should be on free-to-air channels is my personal view.  I like the system in the UK where the BBC has access to highlights on Match of the Day, while subscription channels squabble over live matches.  The only problem is that international matches are on subscription channels as well.
But really, the choice should be up to the various football associations.  If they want people to follow football, they should ensure that certain games are free.  I do not see many people paying to watch matches with the current credit crunch, especially if it means having to subscribe to different TV channels.



Cricket made a mistake in the UK when they sold out to Sky, especially as being on free-to-air television enabled loads of people to watch the Ashes winning series, and increased the popularity of Cricket.  Since the swtich to channel five with its limited coverage, the number of the general population following the game has dropped, and that will mean less people being interested in it in the future, which means less players and less fans.



Both clubs and the national assoication in the UK needs to bear that in mind, especially with the way the finances dropped out in Serie A, as this can happen in the UK.  Too many clubs in the Premier League play to grounds that are not full to capacity, even when they are playing the big teams.  When the premier league is ridden with debt, decreasing coverage will mean less interest in the game.  And that will be bad for clubs saddled with debt as well as the interests of the national game.

A few years ago it was muted around by top EPL clubs to show their own game's on their dedicated channels and Scudamore and his cronies said no because it would be damging to the sport BLAH BLAH BLAH! but I think this could be a way forward! Clubs could decide price, when to watch etc and make their own revenue throught this way! This would men Sky if they choose could dedicate themselves to the lower leagues and distribute the money to the clubs that actually need it! And we seem to be the only nation in the world now that has to pay for International Sport which is a disgrace! This should be all on free to watch channels and enable everyone to watch!!!!!!

well i dont know about you
but here in the uk you cannot watch any premier league match for free at all, you have to pay for all of them, as well as some scottish matches as well



you can only watch 2 of every 32 champions league group matches for free, and 2 of every knockout match up to the final as well as the final



and only our national teams home matches for free
all of englands away games you have to pay for...



and to be honest its a disgrace



i understand that the champions league should have to be paid for
but our national teams matches should all be free, including the away ones



and i also understand the big matches from the league should have to be paid for but at least a handfull should be free to watch, i mean it could even promote the league to people who dont pay, and in turn have never watched the league ?

Well we all paid for sports packages on sky to get sport!  Then the greedy pigs brought in extra channels for which you had to pay more -  very annoying!, now we have Setanta.  No one wants to subscribe to setanta or pay for extra channels as we already pay a fortune for Sky sports.which were described as the full sports package.  I think the games should be split between Terrestrial TV and the sky sports channels.  This is only fair and this is what we paid for.  At the moment we are all watching live streaming of the games - why the hell would we want to pay again - its not fair.

I caught a glimpse of them last Saturday, when they allowed a late goal to lose to Napoli.  This proud old program is currently 12th in Serie A.  Yet at the moment, they're beating Real Madrid... Perhaps I spoke too soon, RVN just scored to make it 2-1 Juve.  But to hear some tell it, RM is "the best team in the world." How can Juventus be struggling so in their league and leading such a team in the Champions League?

So the Old Lady still has some teeth! What makes football so interesting is you never know for sure what will happen and on a given day just about any team can beat another. For Juve to beat Real Madrid in no big shock really. I am sure Claudio will soon have them improving in Serie A. Spanish dominance of European football is now history.

Not happy about giving a Chelsea fan a Best Answer, but it's the most reasonable explanation, and I hope you're right.  I saw RM play Arsenal in the Emirates Cup (on TV in New York), and they looked like a bunch of thugs no one would accept.  (Arsenal won 1-0 on an Adebayor penalty kick.)

His right foot isn't too strong.  He is brilliant and goes balls out for every ball that comes near him.  He puts forth more effort than any player on the pitch and is typical for Argentine forwards - esp. Tevez.  He does tend to over exert himself and be drained by about the 75th minute - with good reason.

Messi is an excellent player for sure.  As far as flaws go, the most prominent one is his reluctance to use his right foot.  Fortunately, his outrageously quick cuts and ball retention skills overshadow this flaw.  I've also seen him get frustrated whilst losing.  This frustration tends to manifest in the form of selfishness. While trailing, I've seen him repeatedly look to force the ball through himself.

Considering a lot of things from different point of views it will be difficult for him. I can't say he won't fit coz he is a player of high personality and inelligence. He can work hard and better himself to the level of a player in italian top leage. But he has passed 30 (he can only regain his performance,can not add to his talent) He has been playing for LA galaxy, such a small club. His chance of playing for England is slim... I don't think AC Milan will be looking for his top class football. I think they want him to get more attention and the money behind it. It might be heart breaking if u are his fan but it is simply the reality.

ME, like almost everyone, think Bojan is currently the best. He is fast, he has great technique and great shots. Future Messi i should say. Don't count out Pato though because he showed the world that he can start for AC Milan despite world's best strikers such as Inzaghi and Shevchenko whom were in bench.

Yes they were 2 offside goals and it wasn't the "ref" who's fault it was. The linesman was the one who made the decisions. Oh and you left the fact that Wayne Rooney had a perfectly legitimate goal disallowed by the linesman aswell. Another thing, it shocks you that Rooney scored? He has scored 8 goals in his last 6 games and as for Ronaldo he is still not 100% fit from his ankle injury layoff but still worked his socks off last night.



To finish up United would have won the game regardless of the two offside goals, not because they would have had Rooney's goal left over but they would of kicked into a higher gear and pummeled Celtic. As it was we were in Cruise Control all night.

of course it's crystal clear offside, just because at Old Traffold, referees wouldn't give damn whether offsides or not. that's why with the help of stupid referees, Man U always win.

It depends.



How well known is your school team, top of state?
Second, are you on travel?
Third, college! Use that to make your name well known and to get drafted, send your applications to major soccer nut schools.  Send in a video with your essay and stuff, prove how committed you are.
And remember, only a small portion of athletes play in college and a smaller portion in the majors so weigh your options in other fields.  Not to discourage you! Just saying.
Good luck!

The perfect goal requires a lot of factors



i) Timing in the game : a winning goal in the last minute will always be better than the same goal scored in a 5-0 demolition.



ii) Who scores it : we all have our own particular teams/players and their goals will always be better



iii) Who did you score past : again we have teams we dislike, and to see them concede is always better



iv) Importance : Scoring in a final, at wembley beats a 1st round Johnstone's Paint Trophy away game at Halifax



Then you get into the technicality of the goal, and for me it would involve beating a couple of players (not just running quicker than them, but actually using skill to get past), shot from outside the box, and wide from the goal, curling (rather than sheer power) past the keeper into the top corner, preferably going in off the post/crossbar.



Having said that, for me the perfect goal was just a simple header scored by Alex Calvo-Garcia in the play-off final at wembley (1-0 final score) against Leyton Orient (who I don't dislike) for Scunthorpe United (my team).



Whereas technically I'd go for Jermaine Beckford's goal for Scunthorpe v Rotherham two seasons ago.

the perfect goal is one that when it hits the back of the net the place goes nuts but a 25-35 dead straight shot is worth it's weight in gold.

Referees normally favour the home team. If the ref isn't sure on a discision then he will award it to the home team as he doesn't want the fans shouting abuse. When fans shout abuse refs normally make silly mistakes due to the amount of pressure they have.

Not only get affected by home fans also home team players, one good example is at Old Trafford, the least penalties being awarded to away teams, just because referees were scared of receiving death threats from fans.

2. Will you marry me ? ;-P



Your question ... it shouldnt affect a refs decision in the slightest, they (supposedly) know the rules and should therefore ignore whatever the fans may be saying/shouting ... the refs decision is final, and if it is found that a decision was made by a ref because of fan pressure then he should be kicked out of the job, because that isnt being neutral is it!

I think it often has the adverse effect. Referees are mindful of the perceived bias towards the home team and react too strongly often waving away legitimate penalty calls because they are put off by the noise from the crowd. Then again sometimes slight or petty offences like moving forward a few yards to take a throw in are brought to the referee's attention by the crowd. In these instances the "pressure" from the crowd may be the only matter that alerts the referee to cheating. So its a mixed bag.

I dont think so - they are assessed on each performance and would soon lose their Prem Status if they gave in to fan pressure.
What gets on my nerves is the players chasing after the referee after a penalty or similar is given and hounding him. I have never seen a Ref change his mind becuse of player pressure - it doesnt happen in Rugby so why should the FA tolerate it??
They WILL change their mind if their Linesman points out something NOT the players.

Dear Mr Mourinho,
Here and there and for ages soccer fans have said a lot about refereeing decisions affected by pressure from ... fans of the competing team. It may be true - as for cases revealed, and may not be true - as for cases undetected. Things getting worse as referees are kings with absolute rights; hence, it is just a waste of time to meditate on whether such affecting exists or how it makes refereeing decisions distorted. There is only one way to overwhelm all these eternal headaches: to score as many as possible the net of the opponent's side. You train your players in whatever best way you can to make them make score of say over ten for every match, and let those referees do their job as they can never whistle a NO to all the ten scores of your team within a match. This is both positive and proactive, I dare say.
Regards,

Psychological studies have proved many times that group pressure works. Many studies show that a single person tested in a group of "stooges" will begin to agree with the group even when they know that they are saying something wrong.



Refs are professionals but they are human beings and their decisions will be affected by tens of thousands of people screaming for blood. It's human nature.



Most refs do a great job. We watch TV or see the screen at a match and see an incident over and over and think we are experts because we see something after the third replay.

to answer your question...i do think fans do have a influence on refs in certain big games i.e man utd v arsenal etc...because where normally a ref would blow for a free kick or penalty in games like that the peer pressure of the fans shouting at the ref does influence the desision as it tends to go more for the home team..where as if i was a ref i would give the desision regardless of the fans and also players who surround the ref constantly would get a yellow or red card without question

Hi Jose
Nice to have you back!!  I am a Liverpool fan - we loved your banter!
In answer to your question:-



Maybe they do not want to look bad or even worse stupid, the shouting from the fans makes them doubt their decisions.  Possibly if they are simply having a bad day the fans make them want to give decisions against.  Who knows have you tried asking the referees?  If the players stopped diving on the floor like a load of nancy boys- the referees job would not be so difficult.

Managers affect the referees a whole lot more than the fans do.
Thats why the fourth offical is employed in keeping the managers calm and deflecting the flak away from the guy in the middle.



Players also have a big effect in the way they manipulate the referee by diving and over complaining about decisions. Its about time some players got punished for it.



Fans have very little power when it comes to pulling up referees on bad decisions, all they can do is whinge about it, so really they don't matter.



Lets see some respect for the referees from the players and managers.



Then they can lecture the fans once they have changed their ways.

I think if enough people shout 'offside!' or 'handball!' it's usually good enough to at least make ref's have a think about a possible decision.

This thing about refs getting more respect,refs get a lot of respect when a player starts a match he"s not thinking about giving the ref a hard time the player wants to play football when the match gets under way and your in the middle of the action you want to do the best for you and your team but sometimes there migth be a late tackle the player is ok and the rest of the players know he is ok but for some unknown reason the ref sends the player off ,everyone knows it is not a sending off but this ref suppose to be sensible ruins the game then players get annoyed and ask the ref why he sent the player off ,the refs then won"t talk to anyone and it gets frustrating and thats why a player gets annoyed with the ref.but if refs talk to players then players show respect back to refs so the game is played and everyone is happy."Simple"! Refs talk to players the respect is there.

Maria,Beckham's best position is either on the right wing or at right-back,where he can provide the best pin-point crosses.We all know what would happen if Beckham is played in midfield.As for your question,Marco,Seedorf, Ronaldinho,Pato,Shevchenko,Inzaghi,Luiz Ronaldo and Borriello better beware.The moment Beckham goes to Milan,he'll automatically seal his place in the right wing and combine with Zambrotta on the right flank,with Kaka and Jankulovski on the left.Hence it's up to Seedorf and Ronaldinho to wrestle for a place on either the left wing or support striker and Pato,Ronaldo,Shevchenko, Inzaghi and Borriello to wrestle for a spot at chief striker.Pato could also play as support striker if Milan decide to pair Pato with an out-and-out striker.There's also a possibility of Ronaldinho and Kaka playing together up front if Ancelotti decides to play both Beckham and Seedorf on the flanks,or play Pirlo in midfield,Kaka,Ronaldinho,Pato and Ronaldo,Shevchenko,Inzaghi or Borriello as strikers with Beckham at right-back.If Ancelotti decides not to play Pirlo or Seedorf,Ronaldinho can partner Gattuso in midfield,with Beckham and Kaka on the flanks and Pato partnering Ronaldo,Shevchenko,Inzaghi or Borriello up front.If Ancelotti decides not to play Ronaldinho either,Kaka can also move to central midfield,with Pato on the left wing and Shevchenko,Ronaldo,Inzaghi or Borriello wrestling for a place up front.Overall if Beckham arrives to Milan,Ancelotti has many options on how to play Beckham,Kaka,Ronaldinho,Pirlo,Pato,Ronal... Shevchenko,Inzaghi,Borriello,Gattuso,Zam... and Seedorf.But Ancelotti should remember what happened to Real Madrid during the Galacticos era when Beckham and Owen arrived at Real Madrid and what happened to Barcelona last season when Thierry Henry arrived and Krcic and dos Santos started to blossom at Barcelona.Even now Pep Guardiola is still facing a dilemma on how to play Henry,Krcic, Eto'o,Hleb,Keita,Iniesta,Gudjohnsen and Pedrito alongside Messi in Barcelona's 4-3-3 formation.Similarly Ancelotti is still facing a dilemma on how to play Flamini,Gattuso,Pirlo,Ambrosini,Kaka,Ron... Shevchenko,Pato,Ronaldo,Inzaghi or Borriello in the same team in Milan's 4-4-2 formation.

If he can learn to play well with Pirlo, Kaka, and Ronaldinho, he will be useful for this season. But then again I dont really think that Pirlo and Beckham could share the same pitch together. Still he can play as Pirlo's sub and as a deep lying playmaker



I know that he can't be as good as he used to be but that doesnt mean that he cant do well with Rossoneri. I just hope he will fit well...



Also agree that Beckham signing will help Milan with marketing and all. Some say Milan only want him for that reason :P

Arsenal are brilliant! there technical abilities greatly surpass their opponents whether it be in the CL or in the EPL. their movement on and off the ball make them so dangerous. I will concede that their defence needs some depth. at the moment. Toure gallas and sagna are all out with injury but even with their 2nd string in  consisting of silvestre, song and eboue (who is a great right back/ winger) however in terms of attack, with the likes of ade, robin cesc, theo, nasri, bendtner, denilson as well as clichy and sagna, they are a massive force to contend with.



also to mr. man utd you say that arsenal dont play exciting football and that man u does however when united are up a tough team they will with out a doubt condense into a shell and pack it in and play soley defence with the chance of couter-attacking football. you say that in the EPL arsenal are struggling? i do believe man u are further down in the table than arsenal. last yr arsenal won in CL agaisnt AC milan who were the current champions. and they did it in style. during the group phase they also wre able to defeat slavia 7-0

Did you watch the Man Utd v Celtic match, now that's something to talk about, United are the team who plays sexy exciting football, i bet you arsenal couldn't beat Celtic 3-0.

I vividly remember going home as a child and telling my dad that I was going to support Manchester United because my friend John did. He replied "Oh no you're not!" and handed me an Arsenal history book, telling me how he had been there when they won the double in 1971, how my granddad had been to all their matches in the 40s & 50s, and how my great-granddad was at the first ever match at Highbury.



I'm very glad he did - I feel a real attachment to Arsenal knowing my family have been supporting them for almost 100 years. I'll definitely be making sure my kids follow Arsenal too! :)

It's a game, it's supposed to be for enjoyment but people take it far too seriously. Why shouldn't children (or anyone else) be allowed to support whoever they choose? It doesn't matter it's only a game, a stupid one played by ridiculously overpaid idiots, but it's a game. It isn't going to influence the fate of the planet if someone doesn't support the "right" team.

I'm an oddity, in that I'm a Gillingham fan first and foremost, but West Ham are my local team - and I live round there now, so I see more of their games than I do Gillingham games.  My first child's due in January and by that time I'll be living in Crawley.  We'll be attending Crawley FC games together.  Will I make him support Crawley?  No.  But he can't support Chelsea, Millwall, Crystal Palace or Fulham.  These clubs are rivals of Gills and West Ham, so I'm afraid it'll have to be someone else.  But I don't mind who!

as he has more knowledge about football then most football fans , and unbiased knowledge at that ,  i love to hear his stories and opinions .



dad has been supporting his team since his first trip to see them play in 1942 or there abouts .  my dad was born in manchester and all our family over there Support the same team .  guess what it is ?manchester united .  i can at least do my bit in exploding the myth that no mancunians support united , i have a family of them that do  !



teams go in and out of fashion a couple of years down the line it could be real madrid or liverpool or god knows who else in fashion  .  i would rather people support a team ( what ever team that might be ) because they want to not because they are fashionable .

As for the beckham boys it might just be a case of not really supporting any team just liking football I knew a lad once who had, Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton, Chelsea and Manure kits didn't support any of them but just liked watching football.  Or as the article says a hint that David would like to join the Chavs, though doubt they'd have him.

Does this annoy you or am i wrong?



i had a soccer game today and i got my first ever red card in 11 years of playing. i play defense and wat happened was my teammate and the opponents striker were fighting for the ball. my teammate won with a little shoulder shove, but then the striker fell down in "pain" and started crying about his ankle. i was about 10 feet away and i was like wow ok get up flop, if they call a foul...so the referee, who had been cheap the whole game, primarily because he was white and the other team was half white, called a PENALTY kick when it was clearly outside the box. my friend and i were both really, really mad, so my friend just kicked the ball a little and the ref gave him a yellow card. that just ignited my temper and i went up to the ref and said "what the ****(f-bomb) he didnt do anything, so the ref gave me a yellow and then i said thank you, and he gave me a red...now my parents and my coach are all pissed cause i got a red for the first time in 11 years. the game really didnt matter then because it was almost over, we had lost, but honestly, is that fair? If you had seen and played with this referee, you would be super mad if he was against your team the entire game. two of my teammates got yellow cards as well...was it right for me to be that mad, i usually can control my anger and temper issues very easily...ive had plently of bad calls but that specific one completely ignited me into a higher state of anger than i have ever been...i kinda just wanted to share my story today cause i have no one to talk to right now.  any thoughts?

At soccer training, our coach made us run around naked. Should I complain?



I'm part of a amateur soccer league and recently at the end of a training session, he split us up into two teams randomly to play each other and the losers had to run around the oval butt naked a couple of times. The other team had a riot watching us run in the buff and I guess it's all in good fun but I'm still a bit uncomfortable. Should I take it up with the coach or just play along? I don't know if it's gonna become a regular thing or not.

I think that American fans are just different in the fact that they are more like armchair supporters. The reason i say that is because in England people go to home games and away games. Thousands of people will even fly to Spain, Germany or Russia to watch their team play. Please correct me if i'm wrong but i don't hear of thousands of people flying up from L.A. to watch a game in Toronto.
I think that there is a difference between a fan and a supporter.
I do understand what you are talking about when it comes to supporting your country. It makes no sense for a person born and raised in America supporting Brazil or Italy even if their great grandfather was an Italian or a Brazilian.

<asker's comment>



nice answer but look at the size of america compared to england. I mean here in LA we have the largest fan base but only maybe less than 20 will travel to an away but if its closer we can get maybe 300. But mls just doesnt have a large enough fan base to travel.

Here's my opinion.



The premise of showing support to the nearest team to where you live just because your in a certain area is a bit silly to me because people will gravitate to what they see on TV and want to see the highest level of competition. Not to mention all the non-MLS and MLS haters that ride bandwagons a bit too much. But for me I fell in love with football when i started watching Liverpool FC in 2002. From that I also began watching MLS and after some time started supporting the US MNT and Chivas USA as my MLS team.( I live in Phoenix we have no MLS team, yet).



It is hard for people to see what they are missing when ESPN will barley televise an MLS match which makes me sick. I mean for god sakes they'll show me food eating contests and world series of poker ALL DAY but not nearly enough MLS or US MNT support. It's like you have to work hard to get enough real football matches seen. Now if they showed more MLS games and dedicated some time and marketing into it, you would see more supporters coming out of the woodworks. This is why people support european teams and UEFA is all over TV.



As far as the US team is concerned? I think people like to cheer for winning teams. For some reason people are not aware (or care) how far the team has gotten in recent years. I keep telling people to watch and spread the world about it because there isn't nearly enough exposure. When people I know do watch, for the most part they enjoy and root for the US. We just need more time and exposure and if we do well in the world cup people will start to get excited, you'll see.

are u kidding me...lol...look, the truth is that true soccer  fans, no matter which country they are in or not, must have a knowledge of soccer teams and clubs, and a true soccer fan, must know the best countries, and clubs dat are good in soccer and unfortunately, the mls is no where near that at all and clubs like manchester united(my favorite), chelsea, bacelona and other top clubs play very good and entertaining soccer and dat is what attracts fans. now, there is nothing wrong in supporting ur mls club if u really like them and not just like them because it is a club in ur country because dat to me is just a disgrace to soccer fans....i have heared lots of ppl in the U.S call them selves soccer fans but when i asked them who ronaldo or messi was, they did not know...now dats a disgrace to a real soccer fan
and dont even be bothered about fans in the united states because it will take time for the U.S team and mls clubs to attract fans and to get better because u have, football, baseball, golf, hockey and all those sports come before soccer in this country and that will be a very hard step for soccer to overcome in this country.
so yeah...americans can definately be soccer fans if they go for teams in europe because it shows that they have a real knowledge and passion for soccer and honestly, europeans have more passion than U.s when it comes to soccer because it is their number one sport and nearly everyone else in the world ranks soccer as their number one dat is the difference...if U.S.A could apply the same passion  they have in football and basketball, the face of soccer would change in this country but it is very important that as a soccer fan, in the U.S, u must know the european clubs because i mean...come on..the best soccer is played there and u cant blame one for loving it

both celtic and rangers would both be mid-table sides. plus every week an away side have to go up to glasgow, think about portsmouth doing that. i'm not at all convinced.

bobby moore...don't you kid yourself my friend. Give Celtic and Rangers the millions our teams down here get as opposed to the paltry sum the Glasgow clubs get at present...am I right when I say £2 million per year?...and they would be right up there in 2-3 years or sooner. The only doubt I have is that it probably won't happen.

Just goes to show Alex when you march with O'Neil you never go too far off the path of truth. Perfectly put, and this echoes what i've been saying on here and in the English section. They can't handle it, however, once Celtics' worldwide fan base kicked in we WOULD be the biggest club in the world. Think of all those Irish immigrants and catholics the world over. Come on, we know for certain this is how it would be. You should post your clip on the English section. It has a bit more weight to it when O'Neil speaks it!

Yip spot on as ever but sadly cant see it happening. Advocaat said something similar in May when he said they were close to talking about moving to the EPL but the EPL want to protect themselves and are scared of the impact on the league. If Celtic got the kind of money thrown about down there we would be major contenders after a few years.

I too believe that Celtic and Rangers for that matter, are huge clubs. I have no doubt in my mind they would grow stronger if they played in England, But for the hundredth time they are not wanted south of the border, the Championship and first div would not allow that to happen. but supposing the FA said ok you can start at the bottom league and try to get to the premiership that way there is no way the Our big two would ever leave Scotland and no guarantee they could win the championship. It will never happen because of red tape. add to that do England  want Thousands of Scottish fans traipsing around their country every week, i don't think so.

If they are he's lucky they want the payment in goals rather than actual money ;)



i think Liverpool made a big mistake paying what they did for him...he's good..but he's feeling to much pressure to score...he's more of a work horse than a prolific goal scorer.



i'm going to be ambitious and say he'l score every other game

KINDA
He is good and scores but hes got gerrard, reina and babel next to him, who cant score. Did you not see him in the euro cup, not impressive. He will score and get past ur Hulll City, Portsmouth and Villa etc. backs ALL DAY LONG. When he was against REAL class such as Chiellini in italy in the euro cup match, he had to be taken off. He is a necessity for Liverpool, hell score 2 of 3 goals against weak defence of half the english teams. In the broader europe, send him to Italy and ssee how long he lasts. Cannavaro, Cameoranasi, Nesta and the lot. He may get around the Tottenham or whoever they are english teams, he will have a chalenge against ASCOLI!!!! or Citadella! NECESSITY FOR LIVERPool however as long as Reina and babel are fed by gerrard, ur ok!

Like i asked in a previous question earlyer



Why haven't Spurs used Cesar Sanchez in nets?



i don't think they should buy another keeper since they have one who they haven't yet used..



as for a striker , i still don't think Darren Bent and Pavkyuchenko can work together...i could be prooved wrong though



maybe Heskey? he wants a Liverpool move..but who know's

I don't think ol Benny is Liverpool standard , quality player but look at Harry Kewell , 5 goals in 8 games for Galatasaray



i don't think i actualy dislike anyone at the moment



at the time Adrian Mutu for drugs...as there's just no need for it in daily life let alone football



last season Mikel..although i felt he was very harshly done by at times , but his tackling was reckless aswel to say the least , but huge improvement on him

The move to Milan is a loan move which will be official on Jan 6.Meanwhile Beckham will be training with Milan.If the second half of Serie A starts,Beckham will be in the right wing,with Gattuso and Pirlo on the centre,Kaka on the left and Ronaldinho and Shevchenko up front,with Seedorf,Pato and Inzaghi coming off the bench.

Beckham will be a great second line for Milan.
For him will be impossible to play in first team, bocouse of three world's champions as Pirlo,Gattuso and Ambrosini,becouse of the three best tecnique players in the world (toghether with c.ronaldo) as Ronaldinho,Kakà and Seedorf (the recordman with 4 Champions League into 3 different teams).
But he will be very indispensable for Italian Cup and Uefa Cup.

Just goes to show Alex when you march with O'Neil you never go too far off the path of truth. Perfectly put, and this echoes what i've been saying on here and in the English section. They can't handle it, however, once Celtics' worldwide fan base kicked in we WOULD be the biggest club in the world. Think of all those Irish immigrants and catholics the world over. Come on, we know for certain this is how it would be. You should post your clip on the English section. It has a bit more weight to it when O'Neil speaks it!

Yip spot on as ever but sadly cant see it happening. Advocaat said something similar in May when he said they were close to talking about moving to the EPL but the EPL want to protect themselves and are scared of the impact on the league. If Celtic got the kind of money thrown about down there we would be major contenders after a few years.

I too believe that Celtic and Rangers for that matter, are huge clubs. I have no doubt in my mind they would grow stronger if they played in England, But for the hundredth time they are not wanted south of the border, the Championship and first div would not allow that to happen. but supposing the FA said ok you can start at the bottom league and try to get to the premiership that way there is no way the Our big two would ever leave Scotland and no guarantee they could win the championship. It will never happen because of red tape. add to that do England  want Thousands of Scottish fans traipsing around their country every week, i don't think so.

Are Hammers a cheaper team!?



Spurs,whose virtue will never be tarnished in the history,giving the gooners a suffering of losing another two points in the competition with chealsea.(just neglect MU,and liverpool ,these two countryside team).



oh.my god,some hammers now are geting more ridiculous,they had claimed that ;SPURS will 'fight for championship league'.



when your hammers in the edge of down to championship years ago,our kindness and mercy spurs fAns never laugh at you,and hold our hand wiht you in games. now ,you forget it,you forget the atomosphere in derby game. i am so proud of you,hammmers,you are truely cheap.



and now,i can say that our spurs players all with talent skills,will have a vigorous performance in other games. HAMMERS,when you are keening for our MERCY TO help your struggle to retain in the premier ,we will never anger, never laugh and continue saving you,because we are not cheap!  Because we are the TOTTENHAM HOTSPURS! AND WE ARE HAVE A CULTURE ,IT IS NAMED"MERCY AND GOODNESS VIRTUE" WE SPURS FAN ARE THE WORLDEST MOST LOVELY PEOPLE,WE HAVE A CULTULE OF SOCCer。WE ARE LOOK THE CULTURE AS OUR HIGHEST VALUE. NOT THE CHEAP VICTORY.



yeah，YOU ARE A BIT OF worthing respect than GOONERS.somethimes,they are not equal to the yorkcity.because they are cheating team.



best hope for gooners to win a cheating premier champion,and if you want,the eur champion is worth cheating too. hammers,wait,we will show what is mecy!

Yeah - he was a great keeper but also a bit of a nutter as I recall.  I'm not a Liverpool fan so I may have this wrong but wasn't there an incident when they played Coventry in the FA cup final and he said he was going to run the full length of the pitch to the other keeper and back again for a bet?

<question>



Does anyone remember the 3-3 draw between Man Utd and Liverpool.....?



....where Grobbelaar was Man Utd best striker..?



well.. he was until he messed up (got caught up in the moment) and made a save that cost him around 125,000 pounds...



what year was that ...?



(at the time I thought it was a great game)...



CERTAINLY WASN"T THE REF THAT WAS BRIBED/PAID OFF THAT GAME.. ☺lol



</question>



<additional details>



KTS: have you not seen my questions about Arsenal ??



just answer the question..



Was a brilliant save too ☺



Deano... NOPE.. don't agree... if anyone can do it on their own.. its a keeper.. all they need is for the other team to shoot...



I must say though ..its hilarious how the liverpool fans (as Heccy has today) talk/ask so many questions about cheating and bribing refs..



then get so upset (like KTS) and start crying into their comfort blankets when they get it back....



i'm awaiting my violations from the liverpool MAFIA on here... and YOU know that that last statement IS true



look.. 8 TU's so far .. for basically saying nothing... lol ☺, maybe they should answer the question instead of TU nonsense

i know grobbelaar had a lot of stick for this game ... but i doubt the match was fixed .. we went 3 v 0 up in that game if there was match fixing it wouldnt of been just grobbelaar .. there must of been players from both teams involved ?? think about it ..

Because some people are f u ckin stupid and take things too far, like the a r seholes in Larkhall. Get a life ya sad f u cks.



It's simple really, I have a wee thing about blue, like when I buy a clipper lighter wi ma fags, and the boy gees me a blue or an orange one, I'll usually go, eh, "kin a git a green or yellow one, instead".



but, I dinny smash up my mates car or ask him tae change the colour because it is blue, am no gonny smash up a train because it is painted Red, white and blue or ask the train company tae change the colours.

Funny you should say that, I avoid the blue an orange, because the never seem tae work or light whin a buy them, must be the fact that crap doesnay burn lol

This is the equivalent of not putting up christmas decorations in case non christians are offended.



I think its offensive patronising that they think Celtic fans will be offended and Rangers fans in Larkhall will be offended by Asda's colours.



There is an Asda store near Ibrox - has it been damaged?.

HAPPY REFORMATION DAY

Erra It is the reformation of the Church that broke away from Rome.



And also with you Tim (don't know the Latin)



Caine - Sunday



Mr s I don't know how to respond to a fool



Jan - I hope you remember where you parked your broomstick



Brilliant geezer you know the game well my friend.



Tatty good yin.



Wow freelance how did you know I sneezed there......spooky



Caine I became a Christian 20 years ago. I go to church every week if I can make it.



Abracadabra have I hit a nerve? ...yer da wiz a priest .....am ah right?



I know all about it Eddie through my wife ironically an ex Roman Catholic.



If you haven't already guessed it this is just a wee joke.



It is Reformation day though.



I have no problem with Roman Catholics
But I do agree with the reformation.
I believe in only one way to God through faith in Jesus Christ alone.
Salvation comes through faith not by doing good.I know that I am the worst of all sinners on here and if it meant that being a good person got you into heaven I would have no hope.
I can only strive to change I will never be happy with sin in my life.
And I do have love for my Roman Catholic brothers and sisters.



Caine I may have been in Chappel more than you have.

And a happy Reformation day to you too .



On this day in 1517, Martin Luther posted a proposal to debate the doctrine and practice of indulgences, popularly known as the 95 Theses. This event created a controversy between Luther and those allied with the Pope over a variety of doctrines and practices. When Luther and his allies were excommunicated in 1520, the Lutheran, Reformed and Anabaptist traditions were born.

Should I participate in the FIFA VS UK BATTLE?



I have mixed feelings about this and need your opinion. As royalty and the official organizer/sponsor I don't think I should, yet I'm dying to give glory to the FIFA section.



A few people yesterday said that I should participate, but I'm not sure yet - I need everyone's opinions and sensible arguments on this?

Not funny(Yes I'm a gooner)



How bout these ?



1. What does THFC stand for? Tottenham Heading For the Championship.



2. A little boy gets £10 for his birthday and rushes down to the sports shop to buy the new football he has been desperate for. He gives the ball to the shopkeeper, who says, "Sorry, son, this ball is £20. You only have £10". The boy says, "OK, if you blindfold me and I can guess the name of the club on any ball, will you give it to me for £10?" He agrees and gives the boy an Arsenal ball. "I can hear cannons blasting, so it's an Arsenal ball." Next he gives him a Millwall ball: "I hear lions, so it's Millwall." Amazed, the shopkeeper says, "Get this and you can have it for nothing." The boy listens and says Spurs. The man asks if he's heard a cockerel. "No," says the boy. "It's going down."



More ?



3. When a groggy Vedran Corluka regained consciousness in the ambulance leaving the Britannia Stadium on Sunday he asked medical staff who he was. On being told he played football for Tottenham Hotspur he lapsed into a coma.



4. A man was found dead floating in the Thames, wearing a blond wig, full make-up, bra, knickers, suspenders and a Spurs shirt. Before informing the next of kin the police removed the Spurs shirt to save the family embarrassment.

I admit it's quite funny (I'm an Arsenal supporter), I presume that you may be a Spurs or Chelsea supporter? I must admit, the Guardian published 25 hilarious jokes at the expense of Spurs the other day.



My personal favourite;
A man and his dog, a little jack russell, go into a pub and sky sports is showing on a big screen. The score reads Spurs 0-1 Hull. The little dog jumps up and shouts "for gods sake!" The man behind the bar looks at the dog, obviously gobsmacked, and says, "that's amazing! your dog can talk?!" The dog-owner says "well yeah, he says that every time Spurs lose, he's a massive Spurs fan you see". The Bartender says "well what does he say when Spurs win?!" The owner says "I don't know, I've only had him 6 months!"

Smith seems to think that playing friendlies against top 10 teams will make up for the fact that we haven't qualified for a major finals in over 10 years. Watching Scotland is overpriced for qualifiers. If he thinks im going to fork out between £20 and £40 to watch Argentina led by a drug addict in a friendly then he can f**k off.

I think certainly the queen will be aware because of the coverage it gets in this country.embarrassed....no  but wouldn't touch it with a barge pole.
The popes yes to a lesser extent embarrassed.....no but distanced from it..



I do believe it will go away eventually it is no where near as bad as it was when I was young.Here's hoping.

Firstly, you are a Sun reader so that shows your level of connection to the world of news and journalism - a level which is only above the Daily Sport and on par with the Daily Star, spoonfed sensationalist "news" from a newspaper who daily produce apologies for the innacuracy of their content.



Enough said.



Secondly, we are Rangers FC.  Not Glasgow Rangers.

I would say like in here, certain people and elements of Larkhall are like as they are portrayed, all things green including traffic bollards have to be changed or they get vandalised or painted by locals.



When football clubs pander to this type nonsense it only makes the people of these areas think what they are doing is acceptable.



The painting of curb stones has been inherited by idiots who have attended walks or parades in Northern Ireland and thought it would be a good way to identify their area.



Their problem is they have been brought up that way, by parent(s), guardian or institutions who aren't much better than low life planet polluting scum who wreck their own area in the name of defence, identity and tradition (used loosely here).

Well i support them so i spose what I think of them is they have the potential to be a great team but we need to understand that it is possible for anyone to get relegated and if we wan to stay in the premiership then we need to get our act together . Now ramos has been sacked it seems were on our way foreword.

Great potential, but probably one of the worst run clubs in England. Get rid of the board, stick with redknapp and spend your money wisely.



Also, your keeper Gomes is a clown. And your strikers are powderpuff. You will struggle until January i think.



Tottenham need to stick with the same manager for a few years and let him build a team that can compete. I also think to challenge the big 4 you need to increase the stadium capacity, or get an arab billionaire to take you over!

They are going to be a team to watch out for with Redknapp in charge. I`m a city fan and i was looking forward to an easy three points next weekend but now you`ll probably turn us over again or it could end up five all.



To all the people who are saying they are a poor team, you are wrong, they have good players who had no confidence. Now that Harry is there you`ll see how good modric, bentley, woodgate and bent are.

I think they are a big club and have a fair amount of good players but with the wrong manager they are poor. Redknapp will take them up out of relegation and at the end of the season they will be about mid-table.By the way I'm a Man United Supporter.

<question>



How important is November going to be for Rangers?



With 7 matches and 21 points up for grabs in November how important must it be for us to pick up maximum points. Barry Ferguson will be back against ICT on Saturday but will almost certainly not play all 7 matches in a row. We have a pretty much fully fit squad now with the exceptions of Hemdani and Naismith as players like Burke, Whittaker and Mcculloch have all successfully played reserve games. Young spaniard Aaron Niguez is also up to match sharpness so will also surely figure in the next few games.



Do you not agree it is imperative that Walter gets the correct balance of players on the pitch in each and every game while he has most of his resources at his disposal and not leave ANYBODY waiting in the shadows of the first team??



Whats your views my friends??

Finally we will see the strongest squad in Scottish football battling to get into the first team.  Most will get their chance.  But every one of them will be raring to go.



Personally i can see a cricket score against caley this week.  Take 21 points and we will be back on top.  I also see Celtic slipping up before we take our game in hand.



Ferguson back will give the team a lift, no matter who has to make way for him.  Id like to see Aaron get a game tomorrow too, but introducing Barry to the midfield might be enough of a change to the most solid midfield in the country.



Boyd and Lafferty will be banging in goals for fun over the coming weeks.



We are the people.

If you look through the archives you'll see that November has always been a bad month for us.
I think things will be different this time.
Rangers to win every game they play in November and December.

Kilmarnock v Rangers



Motherwell v Rangers
Rangers v St Mirren
Rangers v Aberdeen



Hearts v Rangers



Well i can't see where you are going to drop points there, you should be expecting to win all those, maybe the Hearts game a draw, but I doubt it.



Hearts v Celtic
Celtic v Motherwell
Celtic v Kilmarnock
Hamilton Academical v Celtic
St Mirren v Celtic
Celtic v Inverness Caledonian Thistle



The only potential pitfall there is the same as you lot Hearts away, so to say we'll slip up and lose points, seems more like wishful thinking than anything.



November look particularly easy for both of us, you would expect 21 and 18 points respectively, would you not?

What is it that these wee teams have over Arsenal this season?
Is it our central defence that really needs looked at?

Your defense might need improving but not as much as yourself personally. I really think you hardly know what your talking about when you call them teams wee teams.



Fulham was founded in 1879 and are still going  strong today. Theyve risen up from third division to Premiership in a matter of seasons and are still going through and increasing their support base. Also they have none other than Mohammed Al Fayed as a chairman. Wee team? i dont think so?



Hull City have just come into the Premiership and have no high profile players except maybe their record £2.5 million signing Gardner. Their position considers them premiership contenders even though theyve just got up and are currently above Man City, Everton, Portsmouth and even the almight Man Utd. I dont see how anyone can call this team a wee team.



Sunderland have arguably the best manager in the Premiership there. They are not a wee team at all.Even Man Utd are thinking about getting Roy Keane as their next manager which means its likely that in his career he will win every major competition. The players hes got are very underated too. Theres a lot of players in that first team who have tasted success.



Spurs have been favourites to be the most likely team to break the top 4. I know this season they havent been brilliant but I still think tottenham are the most likely to make the top 4 the top 5. With the players and attitude they got, they are probably the most entertaining team in the Premiership.



You are female so you knowledge about football is very limited. Stick with baking cakes sweetheart.

I sometimes wonder what exactly my violation was for, why does it offend timmys? Do they immediately take their hand out their nephews trousers to click report? If that's the case maybe I should make more report me...I'm helping the kids!



^ That's almost a cert for a violation . Although, I find a lot of what is offensive doesn't get reported & the stuff that isn't does.

You'll find that Celtic are a club built on charity and their work in the community can be seen today still. Don't get me wrong i think every club, including Celtic, should do more, however i think you'd be hard pushed to find a club in the present day that does more than Celtic, not only for charity but in the realm of winning trophies.

I think that they have just found the balls to report the truth Fudgie. It's not hard for the media to take penalties against the Rangers supporters because they give them 'carte blanche' to write all the damning stuff about them.
Rangers fans must have realised after all the warnings they have had, that it is detrimental to the club's image, to continue down that bigoted route, you've only yourselves to blame not the media.
They only report the news, they don't make it.

messi (because he is more dangerous as a goal threat than ronaldo)
kaka (because he has been playing at a high standard of football for the last couple of seasons compared to ronaldhinio)
walcott (although tevez is a good player too, walcott is unbelievable for his age)
vidic (better than clichy because he does very little wrong in defence and can be just as dangerous offensively)
gallas (although he hasn't played well this season, i still think he will always be a fantastic centre back)
torres (because he can score goals from nothing. a true match winner)
gerrard (because he too is a true match winner and a better team player than lampard)
nasri ( a lot more dangerous going forward than anderson and has scored more goals too)
rooney (he is in the form of his life. so good to watch him as you know he could score at any moment or set someone up)

it's not all about how well you defend and play , even thought it should be , in one of the speaches when they give the awards they said something about Attitude , Commitment , blah blah



But i think Terry's better anyway , Rio took drugs (yes a mistake) but if a Chelsea player had , he wouldn't have been alloud back in the Premiership

Official awards don't change my views what-so-ever. I form my own opinions and go on them alone. And my own opinion is "What have either John Terry or Rio Ferdinand done to be nominated for anything ahead of Jamie Carragher?".



If you think Ferdinand deserves it more than Terry, there you go, who cares about what other people say.

<question>



Who are the best and worst players at your club?



The best at Arsenal for me at the moment based on his display last night is Robin van Persie, he has a left foot to die for. It caused so much destruction last night and he can whip a ball in or he can fire it in really hard. Then he goes and scored with his right foot.
Fabregas, Adebayor and Toure get honourable mentions.



The worst has to be Almunia because even a reject like Bentley thought he could score from 40 yards out against him. Plus if we had a better keeper Gallas and Toure wouldnt feel under so much pressure and then the confidence would spread through the team!
Even though hes out on loan, the worst promising player ever...Phillipe Senderos, he started off quite well but then he just started to tackle himself on the pitch and that was when it had to be called a day, why Miilan wanted him i do not know.



</question>

Come on with Almunia its not about the mistakes its about the vibe he gives out, hes not world class but he does have good moments



What Clichy is God in my eyes because he replaced that traitor Cashley Cole.

I really doubt if you watch Arsenal games , one day all praise Almunia for making wonderful saves against fenerbache , Everton , west ham and then  wham  curses ..bull $hit..



Do you know how important Clichy is to this team or even Sagna ,if we have fans like you such players would leave the club for a better and faithful fan following clubs.



Edited: Do you know before this game Arsenal conceded 5 goals from 8 games!!! of which 3 were from set pieces .We let in just 1 more than liverpool and chelsea.

for arsenal:



best players would have to be cesc, clichy and van persie. cesc is an amazing talent and can spread the ball all over the park and through the tiniest pin holes. amazing passes and can really open up a defense. Robin has a wicked left boot and his foot skills are amazing. he has great movement and a killer instinct infront of goal. lets just hope he continues to stay healthy. clichy is the MAN. he knows how to defend well and attack. he is constantly up and down the flank. he has great technical ability and know when and where to be. creates lots of scoring opportunities and covers well on D. just a great player.



worst. ... a lot of people ave been bagging on almunia lately but i dont tihnk he is all that bad. he has had some remarkable saves especially against the hammers. but bentley's goal definitely could have been saved. that being said, i dont think he is as bad as everyone else is making him out to be. on the other hand, a lot of people have been praising denilson. i recall a game where, no lie, everytime he touched the ball he gave it directly away to the opposing team 8 times in a row. his role is to get teh ball back from them not recieve a pass from your mate and then give it to the opposition. i know he is still young but i think he is by far the weak link in the starting XI at the moment. i definitely rate song higher but last night after the two of them completely turned off in the dyign minutes of the match, i just dotn know who i rate higher.

My favourite Arsenal player by a country mile is CLICHY. I don't care if his concentration laps costs us the game yesterday. Hes so loyal and runs all game gives 101% all the time. NO QUESTION. Sagna also deserves a Special mention again always gives 101% and is very loyal to Arsenal FC



My worst isdisagreem Gallas. Many people may disgree. no captain qualities and he don't love the club like a captain is spose to. he shows no leadership skills sometimes but he can be a great defender.

In a small village near where i spent a few years they beat up badly a man who was a paedatrician.. this just shows how ignorance can become a disease.

He is just like every other player, good days and bad.
This season he has not lit the heather as much as he did last season, but he is being marked more closely, and the rotation of the squad have not helped his cause, but he still is a great player, one of the best in scottish football.

Old Firm players become old firm players because of there ability to step it up a level for the big games just like all the other SPL teams do like Hibs, Aberdeen, Dundee Utd etc when they face the old firm.

i think its very funny that there is so much hype about a team getting to the top of the league. leeds, newcastle and aston villa or was it norwich have finished second in the premiership, which is still better than liverpoo's record.

Currently, Liverpool. They have a fantastic squad and are undefeated in the past 16 games, two of which have been against rivals Manchester United and Chelsea. They are in the top of the league table (up by three, Chelsea in second), top of their Champions League group (which has challenging teams such as Atletico Madrid), and their potential is limitless.
Of all time? Liverpool. They have the most European titles and domestic titles.

Am i being fair to liverpoo, are they very lucky this season, do they play exciting football and do their fans?



all know their mummies and daddies.
my humble opinion is they play a brand of football that would turn milk sour, that combined with their lucky start to the season and their deluded blinkered fans makes them so easy to make fun of, and please don't start me on robbie keane, i thought crotch was an idiot but robbie rotten takes the biscuit, i mean why do the fans worship that prick benitez when he buys players like that ? i just don't get it, please help, all views welcome.

How old are you? 10?
I think it's clear that you dislike Liverpool, but your strong attack is both laughable and stupid.



Of course they have been lucky, but their brand of football can't be that bad if they are on top of the league.



Yes it is early days, but you look stupid bagging a time when they are doing well.



Robbie Keane is a quality player, and although his Liverpool career has yet to take off, he is a proven goalscorer that will be given team.
It's a given that other fans will be quick to jump on his back, but the rational fans will know that when given time, he will eventually start scoring on a more regular basis

I think they have yet to develop mentally, if they are capable of it ever.  It is sad that people are dropping to this level.



There is subject matter that is addressed in here that upsets people all the time, it just depends who said it and who it is directed at, that's what makes it acceptable or not.



Big Jock Stein, for instance, I am sure any right minded person would tell you what a great man he was, and what he did for football and this country, they certainly wouldn't imply anything shady, yet in here it's all you get, is slagging him.  Famine song, I wont start on, but you know where I am at now..

some people don't think logically
they seem to think it is fine to abuse people on the site personally even although they have never met them. I got quite upset when i first started when one guy started singling me out for abuse pretending he knew me, and recently he did it again but my skin is thicker now and I didn't rise to the bait.....although the offending question disappeared , but i didn't report it .
peoples families are attacked, mothers , even children,
child abuse is used as a points scorer, but really it is just some sad people hiding behind a funny name on the computer.
Really sad people who usually claim to support the old firm, WE don't need them .

Glad you have seen the light Maggie as Im surprised at the praise you give the likes of Fudgie and PSDB then said to me the other day its just banter. There is no banter at all in this. Its a vile and disgusting lie which certain fans use as a wind up and have nothing to do with Scottish football or this forum.

Maggie,The people who make these disgusting statements do so because they have complete anonimity on here. They do so because they like to wind up other users in the hope of a reaction, That's where they get their kicks. The very fact that they have those thoughts and are able to post such filth turns my stomache. They may not act on what they say, but the fact that they even think that way makes them just as bad. In my book they are nothing more than spineless cowards!! if they believe what they are posting to be true, then post with their true identity, instead of adopting one of their many accounts to do so. YOU KNOW THEY WONT.

They're not, I have not heard of any Liverpool supporter saying they have won the league.
They are talking up their team, but any team would when they are top.

It's the same as Hull fans thinking they'll qualify for Europe simply because they are in the top 4 at the moment.



Liverpool have had a fantastic start but it remains to be seen if they have the strength in depth that Chelski and Man U have when you get to Christmas and the injuries start to have an effect on the squad.



I personally think it'd be great for the game to see someone other than Chelsea or Man U win the premiership but as a Torquay United fan I don't really care!

The people who think the season's over in October tend to be youngsters who've had little experience of watching football.  The same people will think Hull City are one of the best sides in England.  They are also likely to change the team they support if their current team goes on a bad run.

They always dreamt of winning it more than anyone else, so that they can find an excuse to boast their team that they won the 19th league title, it's still too early to tell now even they are 1st, last year Arsenal were 1st around this time then they started to slip around March, wonder the voodoo will come to haunt liverpond this time.

We have cause for optimism in that we are in a good position without really hitting top form yet. But it's  long haul to May and if we think the trophy has our name on it already, some of the best teams in the world will have other ideas.



But a four horse race has got to be better than the two horse race we have had for a few years. I think we are in for a roller coaster with no team holding the top position for more than three or four weeks.

WEll it might just be better for them...Gallas is an irresponsible and an unsensible captain..



instead of comforting his team mates and asking more of them in a nice way, he starts crying and shouting at them which infact demoralizes them..



i think he should act better in future..

Typical Gallas! On Sky Sports they're saying he's got a hamstring injury ..... this strengthens my belief even more so, William Gallas should NOT be Captain of Arsenal, i can understand Arsene being annoyed at the result, and as Captain Gallas should take some of the blame, his mumblings to himself as he walked off the pitch and now his "hamstring injury" (yeah yeah) ...... get rid of him, i respect him as a player, but not as Captain.



rest of the players .... hopefully it will  give them a kick up their butts against Stoke.

It's all part and parcel of top, level football.  If it was Gallas that slipped and allowed Spurs to get their third goal, well these things happen.  Remember Fergie throwing a boot at Beckham? As a Spurs fan I think that the final score was more down to Spurs wanting to prove their doubters wrong, rather than Gallas making a mistake.



Also, in North London derbies, form goes out the window (as someone else said on QA recently).

I think because the MAJORITY of Arsenals players are French to anything else (Spanish , Dutch etc )



that's why people class them as a foreign team just due to the fact the majority of them are French.



If they played most of there reserves though theres about 16 British players for Arsenal...reserves and U18's



i'm not sure about Liverpool...i know they bought alot of French , Spanish youngsters in the Summer...



EDIT



True aswell that alot of the Liverpool starters are Spanish....BUT...im trying not to take sides on the teams here....but i must say Liverpool do mix up there transfers...like they buy a mixture of players , English (if they got Barry but they got Keane) French , Spanish , Italian etc etc



Most of Arsenals transfer targets are French....not that theres a single thing bad with that...look at Thierry Henry

Have you just left out Pennant and Carragher to support your theory? And I would also include Keane, as although he is Irish, the Irish have always played in the English league, as theirs isn't good enough. Looks slightly different if you include these players. Furthermore Walcott has only recently become a 1st team regular, prior to that Arsenal regularly fielded 11 foriegn players.

Doesn't Carreghar start? Yeah I get where you are coming from hey? Liverpool hardly have English players. But lets face it they do play more English players than Arsenal hey.The reason why they go after Arsenal all the time was because they where the first team in English Football history to field a starting lineup and bench without a english player. Thats horrid if you ask me hey? And Wenger has openly said that he prefers Continental players against English players because they are more Techincally gifted and they suit his style of play. But this isn't a excuse for Wenger cause there are some techically gifted english players Rooney, Lampard, Gerrad, Beckham, Bentley and Joe Cole are all top quality. It comes down to the fact that these guiys aren't English so they don't really care about building Talent for the Nation. All they care about is there club and THERE home nation. Thats why there are Spaniards at Liverpool and Frenchmen at Arsenal. But, to be fair to Arsenal thy have given us good english players, Bentley and Cole, only problem is they sold them.

I have no problem with it - it is up to them. Personally I subscribe to the SAF, Jose, Big Fil idea that you need to balance imports with local talent. Why? Because you need players with some grit to win our league, players for whom it really means something. Players who are going to role their sleeves up and do their work on a cold February night away to Bolton. And usually these types will be British rather than journeyman imports who may only be "up for" the big occasions.  .



Just my view.

Well in the modern day, player transfers have gone up significantly.



If Keane is worth 20mil, Berbatov 30mil and Robinho 32mil then I'd have to say Gerrard is worth around 40mil



But I think a more fair price would be around 25mil



People will say he isn't worth that much but I guarantee any top club in the world would be willing to pay it

Beckham has gone on loan to Ac Milan so i don't think there any chane of him to go anywhere else. But think about it wouldn't you want to play with kaka, ronaldino, pato, seedorf, pirlo, emerson and zambrotta.

The ONLY reason that he's in the squad is to sell an extra few shirts around the world.

I'm sure we'l find out



Beckham has achieved more Caps than them at International level
may not have achieved much as there individual countrys respectively



but still has the most caps....along with Maldini....Nesta....he's a good leader figure for them if anything...also...good role model for the youngsters

It can at times



if your a big team or the big four supporter



example



FA Cup , if Liverpool , United , Chels , Arsenal , drew 1-1 with HAvant And Waterloo....i think you would be laughed off the pitch



</answer>



<asker's comment>



And sometimes a 1-0 defeat (Chelsea on last sunday) means something more painful then a defeat.

i think last nights game feels exactly like a defeat. when you don't win against your rivals, it always feels like a loss even though you did get a share of the points. and to go level after leading 4-2 with only minutes to spare... its quite a downer. i was in utter shock when lennon completed the turn around. we should have gotten a 5th or 6th but instead we allowed spurs to draw level and honestly loss two points last night.

truth is YES



we deserved to win and it was a shame that we had to screw up in the last 5 minutes



wenger shouldnt have taken nasri and walcott off
they were setting the pace and moving the ball forward



almunia wasnt at his best at all and clichy made that terrible mistake

I am looking at the bright side dude , I am pretty much covinced that last nights proceedings will encourage us cuz we really dont have much choice other than to be motivated and realise that game is not over until the last minute.
Did we lose like this before ? I dont think so..
We have less injuries now and with eduardo and hopefully Rosicky back  we can minimise such errors.
Edited:If you see there goals 3 have been long rangers!!! wtf are you complaining about? Almunia had a bad day and so did Gomes / spurs defenders who gifted us a couple of goals..

Well as they say



"Great Teams bounce back from a bad result"



now Wenger has to proove it
he's already shown Arsenal are a good team..but are they great?



we seen what happend last season..16 points clear...then they had the biggest decline most people had seen



it was like Newcastle all over again.



I think Wengers giving the next manager of Arsenal whom ever it may be a very easy start as most of the players now will be in there prime when Wenger retires



but he needs some experience to guide the youth im sure one player who's 25 + in each section midfield/upfront etc wouldn't go a miss

i know



i was pissed off too with the way we played in the last 5 minutes



we just sat back and watched spurs score
our players thought that since we were leading 2 goals,we didnt need to continue to attack
basically,what we did was again underestimate our opponents and played crap.
our defense was very bad



wenger HAS to do something regarding this aspect and SOON before the really tough matches come along (next month we are facing Chelsea,Man.utd and Man.city for god's sake!!)
otherwise i wont be surprised if we get thrashed by either of them

Motivate us? not me you must be having a laugh .. to dominate a game with so much possession and and to drop two points because of bad substitutions to me is not motivating me in the least... if they drew but out played us fair enough I would hold my hands up and say fair play.. but we were far the better team and blew it is all you can say..

i agree with CFC Arsene and Arsenal need to prove that we are still a great club because we havent won anything for a while, you can say that we are young but that can only take you so far.



Arsene should have at least got in a new defensive midfielder since we lost Flamini and Gilberto but he was too afraid because it would have pushed Diaby or Denilson out of the door, but maybe thats something for January.

Old Firm players become old firm players because of there ability to step it up a level for the big games just like all the other SPL teams do like Hibs, Aberdeen, Dundee Utd etc when they face the old firm.



McGeady just can't seem to do that.

He is just like every other player, good days and bad.
This season he has not lit the heather as much as he did last season, but he is being marked more closely, and the rotation of the squad have not helped his cause, but he still is a great player, one of the best in scottish football.

I dont hear celtic singing ira and sectarian stuff but then again i dont listen for it and wouldn't know what to listen for to be honest.  I'm quite happy to say that i dont know any words to any filth that celtic fans sing and i'm proud NOT to be a part of it.  When i watch an away games, i only hear :  you'll never walk alone, fields of athenry, over and over, hail hail, celtic way etc, because that's all i want to hear!
But then when i hear Rangers singing at away games it's all it seems to be.  Not that i'm criticising, i'm only being honest.
It doesn't bother me in the slightest what fans sing to each other, sticks and stones and all that

Well you see gers always get pointed out all the time - you never ever hear about the tic getting pointed out for sectarian singing and like you said they do it to and am sure alot of other teams do it to but once again Rangers are the ones who get the stick and the bad name as usual!!



But anyway i think this is the way its going to stay - you cant stop all 50,00 fans in a stadium now can you, so the sining will stay and everyone will continue to report each other.



So i say to everyone - get over it why does it bother people so much, dont lower yourself that low to get bothered by a few silly songs, stop taking everything so seriously you only live once - enjoy it!!

some folk are more broad minded than others ive said before if its only for the grounds then sing like fek but its doesn't stay there it follows on to schools and youth clubs the kids then think they need to hate each other  so the hatred gets stronger,I can see the Scottish leaders seriously seeking help from the politicians over here loyalist and republicans together, it took a long time to work here but believe me it does work and its great here now. ok we still have the parades thing but one step at a time they are scaled way down now. but the people of Scotland don't know what damage they are doing and the eyes of the world will soon be focused on Scotland as they used to be with us.

I do think things have improved at both Celtic and Rangers.
I can honestly say I have travelled in Europe and at Celtic Park recently and heard no sectarian singing.yet some Irish Politican has said he can't go to celtic park because of the bile!
I was at an away game in Inverness recently and admit there was a spattering of rebel songs (the soldier song et al) but all of the stand was being filmed by police on a wee video camera and I did hear some start up Nacho novo but was proud when it was shussed by the crowd.
Rangers fans need to start singing about Rangers as well to get away from the bjk, and the famine song as it just makes for ill feeling.
Celtic fans need to take stps to weed out the folk who insist on spouting vile songs at matches too, but even without green specs, I do think Celtic are a wee bit furtheralong the road of stamping out bigotry and racism at the ground

I can't help but go back to my feelings that censorship is wrong. In a free country a man should be able to sing and say what they want. For example i might personally despise fascists but i'd still grant them their view. For me, the minute we say that, ' in our perfect society we will not tolerate this or that groups opinions', for me that is the end of democracy. Don't get me wrong i'm a commie/republican (not a stalinist) if that makes any sense!, but at no time can we appreciate the ideal of freedom unless we also accept that other people will differ from us to varying degrees. I personally despise fascism, but without the fascists to gauge our differences against, how could we categorise what the left wing actually means. Yin Yang for me.

Well i'm actualy going to back Gallas up here



Wenger is basicly saying that them 3 are the entire reason for the 4-4?
no man is bigger than the team...
a team plays as ONE



and he's just singled them out for a few mistakes....i didn't see Almunia mentioned in there..which is a surprise if im honest



Gallas and Ada and Silvestre all scored...and Wenger has a go at them for it?



would have been 4-1 otherwise if they hadn't...i think Wenger needs to realise mistakes are apart of the game...and if he can't deal with that as a manager then....



and i'm not saying he's a bad manager incase any Arsenal fans get the wrong idea here...i'm just saying accepting mistakes goes with the job..

I said about this earlier .... Hamstring Injury ... yeah sure!



Of course Gallas should take some of the blame, he's the Captain. In my opinion, and ive said this since he was made Captain last season, he shouldnt be, he has shown on numerous occassions he's not up to the job, the sooner Arsene gives the Captains Armband to someone else the better.



I admire and respect Gallas as a playr but NOT as Captain.



Arsene is not only blaming the 3 players you mentioned, he's blaming the whole team, these 3 have been the ones mentioned in the gutter press. i would have loved to have been a fly on the wall of the dressing room after the game!!

well, when brian dean scored a last minute header against wigan to put us in the play-offs it felt like it then but we didn't come up that season anyway, so no.

Not really



When your a fan of the top 4 clubs a draw can either be best all round or a disappointment



if you support someone out of the top 4 or a championship side and you got a draw then i imagine it would

In 1991 Red Star Belgrade played 2:2 with Bayern Munich at home.
Since Red star won 2:1 in Munich, they advanced to the final of the Champions leauge, which they later won.



What made it even more exciting is that Bayern was leading 2:1 in Belgrade, but Red star somehow managed to score the goal in the overtime. Just imagine 100,000 fotball fans going wild after this goal.



I was only two at the time, so although I do not remember it, I was at the game with my dad.



I get goosebumps when I watch that second goal even today...

He's not being smart, he's being truthful and kind. Lampard is my favourite player and always has been but I still think Ronaldo should get it. They're both amazing players but Lampard knows because there is more focus on Ronaldo he will probably not get it. I gotta say, he doesn't look delighted on that photo.

I knew you couldnt go a day without mentioning Toure in one of your Q's !!! LMAO!



Yes Toure would make an excellent Captain, he's been at Arsenal the longest, i was quite surprised he wasnt picked when Arsene chose Gallas actually, which in my opinion shouldnt have happened, and he has gone on to prove my sentiments.



You think it would be a good thing?  ..... youve definitely got a soft spot for KT, havent you!

Even if people don't agree with Gallas as captain..everone has an opinion if he should or shouldn't be so i'm not going to go into that



but even if he's Good or Bad the team are used to HIM as captain...changeing captains even if it's for the better in the short run can be a move for the worse as the player's won't be used to him...so it's a gamble..a one that you don't want to make early into the season...end of the season or pre-season then it should be done

Do you think Man Utd will need to pay the ref tomorrow against Hull or do you think they will lose fairly?



Hull are currently above Man Utd and have already beaten **** nal away.



We all know the dodgy decisions the mancs get at old toilet but will they need to cheat against the newbies, we will see

And then I heard from you saying,"I'm a glory-hunting Liverpool supporter."So let me tell you this,Man United don't need to pay the ref unlike a certain club who's name is Liverpool.And no,Man United will beat Hull fair and square,and Liverpool will lose badly at Tottenham.Robbie Keane will be marked so badly that he'll make Healy the best EPL striker.And Bugger Lugs,I live in Singapore,and watch your racist comments.And I've been a Man United supporter for 16 years.

Can't wait to see the Tigers wipe that smug smirk off ronaldos face.I hope he goes round town after the game,so I can fill him in,but he'll probably be too busy with a rent boy.As for that bloke saying "glory glory manurenited",he's probably never been to see manure in his life,and he lives in South Africa.COME ON THE TIGERS,let's have the manure scum.

Well the other person is correct this is not the right category to be asking this question,  It should be under entertainment and music.
And there are 5 not 4 of them.  Ireland is at peace right now and their beliefs are their own and nothing to do with their great music.  I wil be seeing them next week.

Where have ye been all this time? Why did ye not write to us, not even a line? Why didn't ye call? Can ye not understand what ye put yer old mum thru?

"Ye what!!? Out of here, ye shameless harlot! Sinner! You're a disgrace to this family."



"OK, dad-- as ye wish. I just came back to give mum this luxurious fur coat, title deed to a ten bedroom mansion plus a savings certificate for £5 million."



"For me little brother, this gold Rolex and for ye daddy, the sparkling new Mercedes limited edition convertible that's parked outside plus a membership to the country club....(takes a breath)....and an invitation for ye all to spend New Years' Eve on board my new yacht in the Riviera, and...."



Now what was it ye said ye had become?" says dad.



Girl, crying again, "Sniff, sniff....a prostitute dad! Sniff, sniff.

this site is easy to be nasty in as it goes live soon as it is typed life will always have  elements of hate, ,jealousy, hurt, and negativity from someone, be it at a football game, at a wedding or even at a  funeral where ppl feel left out, ignored, hurt, and have held beliefs for years but didnt voice them. i feel sorry for ppl who enjoy football and dont want trouble. but if there IS trouble all you hear is 'it was THOSE animals' and people are blinkered as its rife in every club. ppl are strange .

It can change here, I have no doubt, especially if people ignore and don't answer question or comments made by them.



I noticed someone has set up a profile called Bobby Sands, I have a fair idea who it is because he has me blocked in his real account, so I am blocked his B Sands, what gets me is people go in and answer questions set by some one who is trying to stir it up and play their game.



I think in the wider world bigotry and senseless comment will always exist, especially if money is to be made from it, and believe me some people make a lot of money and misery.

Let's face it mate, we always knew he was a diver, it's the Liverpool fans who seem to avoid this issue like the plague because they can't take the truth. Us United fans admit Ronaldo has dived in the past, it's something we don't deny, but Gerrard seems to get away with it all the time. This wasn't a conventional "dive" but he times it so it would seem like the defender pushed him from behind when in fact Gerrard went into the defender. It was a case of bad decision making from the officials and Gerrard taking advantage of them. He should know better, but being down by one goal with a few minutes to go is one reason he didn't know any better. You can tell when he starts acting because he scowls his face....people don't really do that do they? It's not like a footballer would be scared of falling to the ground seeing as they've done it so many times before, he has perfected that act and it's very disappointing, he even seemed like he was acting in the post match interview too.

i don't think they actually understood what he wanted them to do.
if you saw the spurs/udinese match, they were all looking clueless as was the manager.
wrong choice for the wrong team.
but slightly agree they should have played better, just think they had all lost their confidence with the management and board.

a football boot is not a fashion statement or a type of footware. Its a piece of equipment. If your boyfriend is lucky enough to have EXACTLY the same dimensions as the professional footballer that a particlar set of boots are designed brilliant. Otherwise he needs to be there to pick them himself, i borrowed a pair of boots of iain dowie for a charity match, i would have been better playing in my trainers !
