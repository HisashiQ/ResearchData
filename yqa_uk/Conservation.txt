Obama is going off about saving oil with tire pressure?



What about the other things that require oil, like plastics, and make up? Will you give those up? And all this talk about wind energy, well guess what? The internal workings of the windmills need a special component in order to work and it's, you guessed it, oil! Drill Here Drill Now, Dump Obama

You are right in some areas, and we do need to drill now but that is not likely to happen when the speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi is making so much money off from her stock in alternative energy.
no wonder she will not allow any discussion of off shore drilling on the floor of Congress.
How ever it is proven that Emu oil is sperm whale quality, and a better lubricant that petroleum based oil.



FOX NEWS revealed (Weds 8/12) that Nancy Pe'lousy' -  Speaker of the House of Representatives owns stock in  Clean Energy Fuels Corporation.  At the end of  2007 she reported $250,000 in stock growth/profits ( Clean Energy is owned by T. Boone Pickens, Texas Billionaire).

I think it's great when they bring in an animal where they've saved it, and then keep it with them because they couldn't go back in the wild etc.  But then, you have zoo's where they don't look after the  animals properly.
That's all I'm saying on this, becasue I think this might turn into a HUGE debate !

I went to a zoo a while ago and I was not impressed. I know that they care for the animals, but if you really look at them they dont look happy at all. The elephants were standing there as though they would have rather died... their enclosure was way too small, and they seperated the mother from the child. I dont see how people can love to go to zoos, dont they see the pain in the animals eyes. I am not a big animal person but the look in that animals eyes was so sad, and helpless. (yes, I know many people disagree) I am not against rescuing animals from the wild and then taking them into zoos to keep them alive, but I dont think that these animals should be put into cages like that... anyway- that is my opinion.

Our local zoo - Colchester, Essex is quite brilliant.  They participate in all sorts of conservation projects - preservation of species at risk - and their elephant rhino giraffe roam parks are huge.
An urangatan occupies a place larger than my house and hugely amuses 1,000s of visitors - he's bit of a show-off - and would probably punch your lights out if you tried to transport him 
back to the jungle.
By which I mean - a well run zoo is a credit or advantage to all species - including humans.

What's Wrong with Windmills Generators?



http://edition.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayof...

The only issue I see with windmills are safety of birds.
Otherwise, I think they are beautiful.

Are people who hate wills prejudiced and being superfluous because:
1. Would they hate to visit the Netherlands in the earlier century?
2. Would they like the modern windmills to have an old windmill facade?
3. Would they like the modern windmill to play creaking sloshing sound recordings so they sound like old windmills?
4. Are they too gigantic to be pleasing to the eye?

I remember the old days when compact disk digital music first came out and there was similar superfluous critism from old vinyl lovers about the sound quality. So, we embedded circuitry into the players to reproduce the imperfections and defects of vinyl recording. I read about a study in which a group of vinyl lovers chose their beloved vinyl recording behind a wall which turned out to be a digital player. Today we also read of electric car makers having to put in a hi-fi system so that the car could reproduce a superfluous combustion engine revving sound.

Are windmill haters being superfluous?

I bet you that in coming generations, their children would be writing stories about childhood memories like "the reassuring sounds of the blades swishing as my childhood sweetheart and I sat and dipped our toes in the gentle flow of the gleaming stream and the trouts ..."

Aren't you people being plain superfluous?

I see nothing 'wrong' with them, though there are much more reliable energy sources.  Windmills only produce electricity while the wind is blowing.  For reliability, I am a big fan of geothermal energy and I strongly support GW Bush's push on geothermal/hydrogen for our energy future.

Geothermal is constant, won't run out for millions of years, carbon-free, abundant...

I don't know why that 'environmentalist' Ted Kennedy won't allow windmills to be constructed where they will be in his Martha's Vineyard mansion view.  He should love the sight of them and what they represent, don't you think?

Windmills are a great source of renewable energy, but they do pose a problem by killing birds and bats.  I don't think the problem with birds and bats has been properly studied yet, and the AGW crowd will embrace any form of energy that is not hydro-carbon based.  Killing birds and bats may be worse for the environment that burning fossil fuels by upsetting the ecosystem near wind farms (or farther away in the case of migratory birds).

I agree, i have always enjoyed the vision that windmill gave, while driving through the California Desert.
I believe that the ones that don't want some windmill spoiling their view, are the same ones that cut down trees for the same reason.
The biggest problem with our current windmills is not the view, or even that birds fly into their blades.
The biggest problem is their low window of operation, they need enough wind to make them word, and yet have to shut down if the wind is too strong.
The new vertical windmills have solved both of these problems, and at the same time do not need the hight that the horizonal ones do.

For the comment on geothermal, there are two definitions.  The first is using the magma or thermal gradient that starts at 8,000 feet deep.  this is not abundant nor easy to do.  The other is the use of a heat pump system that is readily available and easy to use.  But instead of a air cooled condenser/evaporator, you use the heat of the earth only 5 to 30 feet below grade.

The most common complaint is the ultrasonic and harmonic noise (buzzing and or humming sounds) given off by several running within a mile or more from human residences.
There have also been frequent bird kills but the birds do seem to be adjusting their routes and over time fewer bird collisions occur.
In reality, vertical wind towers are much better all around but are more expensive.

A European friend tells me that there is a significant loss of birds where wind turbines are used, as in Germany. If we could solve this problem we could have clean, safe energy to store for when the wind dies down, at least in areas with reliable winds. It could make a significant contribution along with other forms of energy.

</answer from>



<answer>



I am for hunting for meat.

Hunting provides cash for wildlife agencies that help wildlife this comes from; duck stamps, hunting licenses, permits and other hunter expenditures.

Hunting controlled State and Federal agencies based on wildlife biologist’s recommendations, help reduce over population of animals in a given are. This reduces auto/deer accidents, winter starvation, crop damage, and attacks on humans by predators, reduces pets being killed by animals, reduces property damage and saves insurance companies billions. It also saves the tax payer billions by hunters doing the work government hunter would otherwise have to do.

Hunting provides meat for hunter’s families and the meat donated to the poor by hunter’s ads up to millions of pounds.

Hunting is also a tradition that dates back to the dawn of man. It is a very important part of many cultures.

Unlike animal slaughter houses that produce meat for the masses. Game taken by hunters has no injected hormones of anti-biotic’s. It has less fat and is far more healthy to eat. Also the animal had freedom before its death unlike livestock. Its death is much more humane and hunters do have compassion and respect for game animals.

Hunters are the first to find diseased animals in the wild, adding game management quick response to deal with such, saving many from death.
Data from hunters helps wildlife biologists greatly in their research.

Dangerous predators such as Grizzly bears, mountain lions and wolves can not be introduced to populated areas to control animal numbers. Hunters take their place with out placing many in eminent danger from large predators.



All animals eat living things to survive, even the vegan eats a living plant that was grown on a farm. The farm equipment inadvertently kills millions of small animals, such as rabbits, moles, gophers, mice and ground bird nests. Hunters are just on top of the food chain but contribute to nature in many ways.

The first conservationists were hunters; Teddy Roosevelt who set aside the first state parks was a hunter.

Hope this helped you understand hunting better.

I assume you mean hunting as a sport?

Either way, I am against it.

It is not a sport. Sport implies the idea of rules, regulations, an unbiased judge and equality between the competitors. In sport, both sides should know they're playing.



By hunting animals, we disrupt the delicate balance of the ecosystem that ensure the survival of our animals. Natural predators kill the slowest, weakest, loudest or sickest animal, to ensure the hunted species continues to say strong - think Darwin's Natural Selection. Hunters, however, kill any animal they like—including large, healthy animals who are needed to keep the population strong.

We do not need to hunt. Okay, fair enough we did back in the days of the cave men when we needed food to survive. But in this modern age, we can go down to the supermarket and grab whatever animal we decide we want to eat. We don't hunt because we need to, we hunt because we want to prove our superiority over a defenseless animal, so we can hang their heads on the wall.



So yes. I'm against it, definitely.

I think bow hunting is good. It gives the animal a chance and is a challenge. I don't hunt personally, but think it's ok. We have soooo many deer in my area; they eat up everyone's gardens and have become an annoyance since hunting isn't allowed here. They need to be thinned out in some other way than people hitting them in their cars. If there are lots of a certain type of animal in a particular area, it makes sense to me...go ahead and hunt them. Of course, use the meat or give it to someone who would appreciate it, too.

I am definitely pro hunting.  Hunting is part of our history and a sport enjoyed responsibly by millions of people every year, and a lot do it for survival.  It is a responsible way to enjoy the outdoors and keep wildlife populations under check, such as deer herds in heavy farming communities.



Also, hunters have done much more for wildlife and the environment than groups such as greenpeace or the sierra club ever will.
And to those who say that hunting is not humane.  I'm sorry to break it to you but all of that meat on supermarket shelves come from somewhere.  It is much more humane to take an animal from the wild than to keep them penned up like sardines, fattening them up for slaughter.  not that i'm against that either.

We have a choice. We can reduce the populations of deer by hunting or we can let them outbreed the habitat's carrying capacity and starve to death (after eating your garden). No herbivore can be allowed to breed unchecked by predators. At the same time, hunters spend money that both fuels the local economy and supports wildlife conservation efforts.

When evaluating hunting, I think it's important to compare and contrast the Indians' (Native Americans') approach with that of the so-called "civilized" white hunters who came over from Europe.  The Indians hunted buffalo for food, clothing and shelter.  They used virtually every part of the animal and almost nothing went to waste.  The Indians hunted only what they needed to survive.  They lived in harmony and balance with the buffalo, just as other animals do.

When the European settlers came and saw the vast herds, they hunted them for trophies, for sport, or just because they had guns and too much time on their hands.  They hunted them nearly to extinction, and if they hadn't been one of the first endangered species to be protected by law, they would be long gone.  By the way, I'm not an Indian; I'm white, and I'm ashamed of what our ancestors did.

If you plan to eat what you hunt and you do it legally, it's no worse than getting your meat from a slaughterhouse, and perhaps more humane in some cases, so I can't say there's anything wrong with that.  I eat meat too, so I would be a hypocrite if I said it was wrong.



If you hunt just for bragging rights or a trophy to put on your living room wall, I'm not so impressed.



Poachers who hunt endangered species should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and never allowed to hunt again.

FOR IT!!!

It keeps the animal population in check. If you don't do it, the animals will over-populate, run out of food, and starve to death. It is called the food-chain. Humans have been hunting since they were created, and meat is important for everyone's diet. I don't care what a Vegan/Vegetarian  says about it.



Remember, animals kill people too, do you want to put little children and others at risk for possible attacks?

Animals are also used for making products such as fur that is very valuble.

I am for. I am for the practical and useful method of hunting that "most" hunter use. The number of natural predators is decreasing, i.e. habitat, management,etc. The most widely hunted animal in the US is te white tailed deer. I don't know where you live but in most places in the US they are grossly over populated. While i think that we cannot be god in this matter and control populations we can begin to decrease the populations via hunting. I do not support the kind of hunting that is destructive and usually beer induced. I use every part of anything I kill and think that unless your going to eat it, you shouldn't kill it.

Many different types of paper can be recycled. Some paper is more complicated to recycle because it blends several elements. For example, envelopes with plastic windows may not be recyclable. Paper with plastic coatings also may prove a challenge. Your normal, ordinary household paper can be recycled, but you should always check with your local recycling company about exclusions.

The following types of paper can be recycled with ease:



* Cardboard,



* Construction paper



* Newspaper



* Magazines (remove staples)



* Circular advertisements in magazines



* Computer paper



* Copy paper

Other types of paper can be recycled with a little work. For instance, if you have envelopes with plastic windows, you can cut the windows out, and then recycle the envelopes. Be wary of junk mail, especially if you shred it. Much of its paper can be recycled, but you may need to pull out things like blank plastic credit cards or plastic coated paper.

check your local company. I notice the Prince says you have to cut out plastic windows in envelopes. here, we don't have to. The only paper I don't recycle is wax coated.

You can recycle in other ways that don't cost any energy. Your compost pile will take the paper from your shredder. You can also put it down as a week block, shredded or not.  It will decompose in a year or so and enrich the soil.
For unshredded newspaper, soak first and cover with bark or something so it doesn't blow away.

Use the backs of envelopes for notes and lists, the back of single-side printed paper to a kid for artistic creation.

Best rule of thumb: before you put it into a container, think of other possible uses.

It depends on the end use. Each time you recycle paper, the fibres are shortened, weakening the paper. Bond paper can be recycled into newsprint but it can't go the other way. Some products that can take the shorter fibres are household paper products (napkins, paper towels, TP), book-board, attic insulation, and game boards. Usually, the paper is pulped in water, so metal objects such as clips and staples drop out automatically.

One warning about composting: paper tends to mat horrendously. Only a small amount of paper can be put into the compost pile and that is best when shredded. However, that makes paper good for use as mulch.

South-East Queensland remains in the "most dire water situation" of any major metropolitan area in Australia, despite days of rain and steadily rising dam levels.

The Queensland Water Commission has again ruled out easing water restrictions, saying it would be premature to act when combined water storages are still just 26 per cent.

"Our largest dam, Wivenhoe, is still only 17 per cent (full)," a QWC spokesperson said.

"Bear in mind, Wivenhoe Dam holds three times as much water as Somerset Dam and around seven times as much as the Hinze and Little Nerang Dams combined."

Dam levels are at their healthiest since this time last year.

Combined storages across the three major dams have risen 6.6 per cent since New Year's Eve, which adds about six months' extra supply.

However, the QWC spokesperson said it would wait until the wet season was over before reassessing restrictions and look at more than dam levels.

"Despite the recent rain, South-East Queensland remains in the most dire water situation of any major metropolitan area in Australia," he said.

Other factors that would come into play included:

* Business compliance with water efficiency measures;

* Residential performance against Target 140;

* Weather forecasts; and

* Water infrastructure project progress

"Like the rest of the community, we're concerned to minimise the impact of the restrictions, however we must also ensure the security of our water supply before making any changes," the spokesperson said.

"Having had so much rain, there's really no need for anyone to be outside watering, so the focus is on keeping up all the little habits to save water inside the house, like having a four minute shower."

Styrofoam does not bio-degrade, it will never go away, you cannot burn it without releasing hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere.  Washing dishes by hand, not only prevents waste in landfills, but over time, will prove to be more effective in helping the environment.  Fresh water can replenish itself, not over night, but it can, due to rainfall and melting ice and snow.

Washing dishes by hand is far better. The product only has to be manufacturered, packaged, and shipped once. The water and energy used to wash dishes in minimal. The raw material, power, and water to make and transport disposables for each use + the waste factor are huge.

"throwing away paper/plastic/styrofoam plates" is definitely worse. styrofoam and plastics are made from fossil fuels, and paper plates that are thrown away go into a landfill. Water and the scraps you rinse down the drain along with soap and cleaners goes into the ground. While soap and cleaners aren't nessecarily good, most are designed not to persist in the septic system or sewerage. And if you recycle grey water like some people are attempting to do it is even better to wash you dishes.

Gardening can be.  My garden is about 70% percent natives and relatively near protected open space, so it serves as a buffer zone for mobile species, and allows me, a naturalist, a chance to observe species such as birds, insects, reptiles and amphibians, and mammals, as well as the plants themselves.



Photography is much more environmentally friendly than it was, due to the awesome array of digital cameras now available.  I've captured some incredible images with a decent camera.



Several respondants mentioned hiking.  I'll add backpacking to the mix.  Pack it in, pack it out, you use only what's in your back and you work to get to enjoy some of the most beautiful places on the planet.  What a reward for your efforts!  Economical, too, depending on what kind of equipment you invest in.

As for the jabs at fishing.  I don't know what percentage of fishermen (fisherpeople?) do catch and release, but it is an option.  The fees generated from licenses go a long way toward protecting habitat that is valuable to many other species, too.  I'm a vegetarian and I don't fish, but I know many if not most fishermen are responsible and would consider themselves to be environmentalists.  You have to learn a lot about various kinds of waterways and fish to be successful.  And you have  alot of time to observe what's around you before, after, and even during.



Birding is very eco-friendly, unless you're generating a huge carbon footprint flying all over the globe to add species to your life list.  But you can bird in your backyard, or at a local park, where you can walk or bike to it without even getting in your car.

Which is the most environmentally friendly? That's a tough question, and a good one.  But all of the above activities afford people an opportunity to think about the big picture, while pursuing low impact areas of interests.

"EVEN when they tiptoe discreetly through the undergrowth, nature lovers and ecotourists may be having an unexpectedly damaging impact on wildlife. A study of protected Californian forest has shown that hiking, wildlife-watching and similar low-impact activities are linked to a sharp drop in numbers of carnivores such as bobcats and coyotes.

"We saw dramatic, fivefold reductions in the native species," says Adina Merenlender of the University of California, Berkeley, who ran the study with Sarah Reed of the San Francisco-based Wilderness Society. "

I think it depends on the person. I can canoe, or kayak, without disturbing the environment, as much, because I don't fish and love currents. If I see garbage, I take it with me.

If I hike, there's a trail and I stepped someplace a plant cannot grow. I used to trail blaze, to see new things. It never occurred to me I might kill something, until I was older.

I prefer to run rivers and pick up garbage. I bike and pick up garbage.

Overall, my time spent in Southern waters has been beneficial. I did my best to teach others to clean up, as well.

I think taking people in canoes for miles, makes a difference. When they see the water and what's in it, they change. I've had non-campers, non-green people react on the good side.

Tell them this is your water and you have to drink it, after it passes other people. How do you want to get it? For me, it's the rivers.

No. They are not only different species but different genera. There is color variation in some squirrels, which could lead non-biologists to think that they were hybrids but only fishes have fertile intergeneric crosses, so far as I know.

In situ conservation= on site conservation. Its more like a archeology term. One can decide to leave a valuable dinosaur bone in the ground, and preserve it that way. Of course most nature conservation is in situ, you want to save the entire ecosystem.

ex situ conservation = the opposite, conservation by bringing it to somewhere else. Maybe by taking the last turtle away from the beach, and hoping that you make it have babies while in captivity.

I used weedkillers containing glyphosate, i.e., Roundup and Tumbleweed. These seemed to be effective. They're systemic and kill the plant down to its roots; they're also safe as far as animals are concerned. The downside is that they are not cheap!

Because JKW propagates by ryhzomes (root shoots), you are forbidden to dig the roots up.  If you do you have to double bag them and treat them as "hazardous waste" and special regulation apply.

The general method is:

Apply weedkiller every year until the plant is dead.  Upper foliage can be cut but it must be burned on site.

I'm having this dealt with myself at the moment.As some people have said,it is illegal to dig it up and throw it away as it is very prolific and will grow through concrete quite easily. I'm having an enviroment registered company deal with mine.They have been spraying it on a monthly basis for three months and although the leaves etc have shrivelled and discoloured,they reckon about another three visits should remove it completely.

With great difficulty but it is urgent and you must get rid of it.  The roots can grow to around 40 metres and can be more than a foot thick.  Even the tiniest amount of root can regenerate into a whole plant so you will have to use a combination of digging and (unfortuantely) something to poison it.  Ask at your local garden centre for advice.

It depends on where it is and how much of a problem it is. I have been told that the young shoots can be cooked like asparagus. If you like them, you might want to leave them be. I wouldn't encourage the stuff though, any more than I would encourage kudzu for its edible tubers.

You can't ban a section on hunting anymore than you can stop people hunting unfortunately. Hunting should only ever be done humanely and selectively so as not to affect the natural balance between species if it is to be done at all.

It's an integral part of our society.
Hunting licenses pay for conservation, parks and help manage animal populations while providing supplemental meat on a family's table.
Venison is regularly donated to the poor and to homeless shelters.
Hunting is often portrayed in a bad light while most hunters are very conservation minded and keenly aware of the status of wildlife and environments they live in.

It depends on where you live @ the location.  It's not taboo here in Maine Hunting UP here is very common every season each year. Although, some environmentally concerned people want it banned ENTIRELY, claiming we're driven them towards extinction  in our Maine woods. I, for 1, think they're using scare tactics to put a stop to our American seasonal tradition. So far, there's NO evidence of plummeting animal populations, that I know of, to back them up. So, you're okay to ask it.



I hope this answers your question.

I'm not a hunter -- in fact, I'm a vegetarian -- but my first question is: why?

Each to their own, and if they obtain a license and hunt responsibly -- if there is sport involved, a reliance on skill rather than technology  -- I don't see a huge problem with hunting, much less a site dedicated to it.

No.  If I saw a frog in front of me I wouldn't drive over it, and I might get out and move it to one side of the road if it didn't move, but I wouldn't devote time to moving them, if that's what you mean.  Just put some sort of tunnel there and encourage them to it.

Make sure you use all packaging at least twice like using jars and plastic lidded to-go containers for packing lunches, freezing food & sending guests home with leftovers.

I reuse the very rare plastic bag i end up with by disposing of cat litter in it or storing something. The reusable green produce bags that can be bought at health food stores and Bed Bath and Beyond can be washed and reused many times. I take them shopping with me and thereby avoid using the plastic produce bags. Most of the produce i use comes from a weekly farmer's market and i take a big wicker basket and load all my purchases into it. My eggs also come from the same open air market and i return the egg carton when i work through the dozen.

Lush makes great products like bar deodorant and solid shampoos and hair conditioners that have no packaging at all.



You can take your own container to the market and fill it with bulk honey, freshly ground nut butters and liquid soaps.



Lunch boxes or baskets eliminate disposable carrying methods like paper bags.

Re-use big 'economy' tubs that hold detergent, cat litter, concrete, etc.... as storage & packing for camping. When camping you can them use these as stools and also to pack garbage out.

Buy just the amounts you need at the deli counter rather than pre-packaged cheeses, sliced meats, olives, sausage, pickles, etc... Once again bring your own containers or have the items simply wrapped in a small piece of biodegradable paper. Ask your butcher to carry plain paper without printing.

Buy dry goods in bulk as well: rice, flours, pasta, falafel mix, dried beans. I find that i can get almost anything i need this way.

Order from a co-op in a group to further save packaging.

The list goes on as far as your imagination can take it. This is fairly rudimentary stuff but useful and easily implimented.

Wine bottles become pretty containers for homemade flavored oils, vinegars and liquors.

This is an excellent question. It inspired me to see what i can do beyond how i currently avoid/reuse packaging. I love it.

Make sure to recycle anything you can no longer use.

For the most part, you can't minimize food packaging. I once worked in packaging research and we spent most of our time trying figure out how to use less of it. Cutting a gram of plastic out of each package may not sound like much but those grams add up. If you reduce food packaging too far, you pay for it in damage and spoilage.

Pretty much all you can do is figure out ways to re-use the packages. This was also part of our research. Most of what we produced was designed to be useful for storage of this and that. I still have buckets and boxes and assorted different containers that I used to test. It is said that when your only tool is a hammer, you tend to treat every problem is a nail. The positive corollary is that when you have a huge supply of something, you discover many potential uses for it. Live with an item of packaging for awhile and jot down ideas for potential uses. You will be surprised how many things you can think of.

I was making a point with my question. If ,we(US) were to produce all the oil under our territory, we could go from producing 3 percent of the worlds oil to maybe 5? It's just another bad direction. It won't help in the long run. Can you say "windfall profits tax"? Invest in alternative energy, NOW!

Your point is a good one.  Say you had ownership of proven reserves, and you see oil prices going up fast.  You might be tempted to wait and pump that crude later.  That may happen some.  Some but not much.

Here is the issue.  You will be pumping oil for three to five decades.  Over that time frame, you dont know how prices will fluctuate, but the constant stream of income will be nice.  With that money you might buy more oil fields, for example. If the well were a more short-term investment, then it would be different, of course.

First off, America use 25% of the world's oil. It owns 3%. Drilling will take 7-10 to produce a drop. And then it will all be sold to Japan and countries that are developing, like India. By 2015, we will have hydrogen away. We already have the technology for natural gas powered cars and soon hydrogen. If we used wind, solar, plasma waste incineration, and nuclear power we could use electric. We could be much, much, more efficient if we used electric and invested in the expensive technology. It would pay for itself really quickly. We could sell natural gas to India and other countries and put America on the export part of the world economy, for once we would sell more than corn and wheat. Th oil we would drill would do nothing to help the prices, and any company interested in it would go for profits, not American. There European and Asian companies anyway.

We estimate reserves of offshore oil will last 100 years or more.  They go up every year with new technology.

You'll here stuff like the AWR will only produce enough oil for 5 years, but that's if you pumped it and it supplied all of the US and you shut off all the other wells.

If you take the attitude of, why drill, it'll take 10 years to get to market, then why research any fuel, electric cars, solar, anything.  That is being just plain ol pig headed, the ol, my way or nothing attitude.

As for hydrogen, it will NEVER EVER BE a fuel.  H2 is man made, there is no H2 gas anywhere on this planet.  There are two ways to make, from oil/gas or from electricity.  If you use electricity to make H2, that would be sinful.  You see, for every kilowatt of electricity you put into making H2, you only get .6 kilowatts out, that means you just wasted 40% of the power of that plant making electricity.  If I went out and left my lights on in my house and wasted the power and that meant you didn't get any, would you be very happy?

Stop listening to just one side, think about, vote with your brain and common sense, not because of others that will not compromise.  Build solar, wind, whatever, but think about the cost and the real technology.

IFFFF.....we figured out,funded and got on the conservation band wagon; developed safer ways to get that oil from the ground,were using many other alternitive fuesl, by 2020, we (the US) would no longer be dependant on oil from people that want us dead. The things that must be concidered are more complicated then just to drill or not to drill. The reality of the number of people living on this earth will tripple in the next 30 years. The greenhouse gasses omitted by the use of dirty fuels MUST stop and must stop very soon. Every year we do not get going on the ECO trail the farther behind our country becomes  on the global playing field. I do not have the exact figures, but I have heard quoted there is more then enough oil on earth to support evryone for many many years if we stop using it as our primary source.

Yes some garbage will end up being fuel, either to fuel cars or to heat houses.

Some garbage, like grass clippings should have gone back to the farms to grow more food for people, but we can not bother feeding ourselves. One kg of grass clippings can produce a kg of food for someone if it gets into a garden or farm.

Well my neighbor works at a landfill where this stuff is actually transported to. In the area that I live in , after the garbage trucks dump this stuff in a area known as a transfer station , it is then pushed into large 18 wheelers and carried off into a large pit or landfill where it is then covered with layers of dirt. The whole cycle is then repeated over and over. It obviously has government regulations to protect the environment. More larger sanitation departments like Waste Man. recycle alot of there bottles and such,also alot of the methane gas that is produced from the garbage is actually used to fuel most of the garbage trucks .Hope this helps

It often goes to a transfer station then into landfills and/or incinerators in some cases.  Sometimes the landfills are in other states or countries and the trash is shipped out.  There are some landfills that reclaim the methane they produce to power nearby factories and such.  In some cases the trash is sorted and recyclables are pulled out but this is still pretty rare and inefficient.

I agree, the water we save today wont directly affect our grandchildren but we can do little things that can help and certainly save:



- dont run the shower 15min b4 you plan on getting in, dont have the water running the whole time you are brushing your teeth,
- dont turn the kitchen tap on to do dishes and then come back 30 min later after you have taken the laundry out of the dryer and taken out the garbage
- dont water your lawn if the forecast has rain coming soon, and when you do water your lawn do for an appropriate amount of time, its not necessary to leave your sprinkler on for 4 days straight, this is common sense.... timed sprinklers are best...
- and always check and  turn off taps when you are finished, a dripping tap can add up to gallons of water wasted but simply making sure valve is turned all the way off. Hope this helped.

Yeah it is. But the conservation status of a species will vary from country to country, or state to state. There is a global system listing the conservation status of a species known as the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. There are also national systems. In Australia there is the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

It's very important because in many parts of the world, farms are some of the only open lands left. Mixing agricultural uses with conservation is a really important way to help many wildlife species who otherwise would have nowhere else to go.



Maintaining high levels of biodiversity on farms is also important because it helps keep the ecological balance on the farm healthy. When a farm is planted in monoculture, it is very vulnerable to pests and diseases and requires large inputs of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to stay healthy. When it has diverse crops and habitats, the danger posed by any one disease or pest is going to be much less, both because there are diverse income streams and because diversity breeds diversity. The more habitats you have, the more types of birds, beneficial insects, and other species you have hanging around to eat the insect pests, and the less likely a disease will be to spread across an entire farm. This is one of the principles behind organic farming techniques like farmscaping and permaculture.

The gray wolf population in the Northern Rocky Mountains is thriving and no longer requires the protection of the Endangered Species Act, Deputy Secretary of the Interior Lynn Scarlett has announced. As a result, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will remove the species from the federal list of threatened and endangered species.



Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne announced the removal of the bald eagle for the list of threatened and endangered species at a ceremony June 28 at the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. After nearly disappearing from most of the United States decades ago, the bald eagle is now flourishing across the nation and no longer needs the protection of the Endangered Species Act.



SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The world's fastest bird, the peregrine falcon, is officially flying off the endangered species list, marking a dramatic recovery that was aided largely by Santa Cruz biologists.



Friday's announcement caps a painstaking, 30-year effort to save a crow-sized raptor that had teetered on the brink of extinction. Their numbers decimated by pesticide poisoning, the falcons numbered as few as 39 nesting pairs in the continental United States in the early 70s. Scientists across the country, including a team at the University of California-Santa Cruz, literally went ...

Why are sifakas endangered?



The Madagascar natives do not kill Sifakas for meat, yet Sifakas are an endangered species. Why then, are they endangered?



can you answer all the questions?? Real thoughtful questions with backup please.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



There are three species of sifaka: Coquerel's sifaka, the diademed sifaka, and the golden-crowned sifaka. The golden-crowned sifaka wasn't photographed until 1982 and wasn't known to be a separate species until 1988. They are the smallest of the sifakas and among the most endangered. There may be less than 10,000 living in the wild.



All sifakas are threatened by the destruction of their forest habitats. Some species are hunted for meat, though others are protected by Malagasy tradition that forbids eating their flesh.

every structure has impacts basically from the clearing of the land up to the finishing touches. every digging for footing and support every material incorporated, every method of construction used has impacts in our nevironment. even in the operation stage the impacts of the users from trash, sound pollution, air pollution(cars they park) and equating all of these there is actually IMPACTS and so I leave the effects to your mind.



JUST IMAGINE. and this is only a single stadium multiply it ot every structure built every single day around the world and you can see how man has owned the planet.

Years - I don't have a shower, only a bath.



I've regularly gone 7-10 days without a bath. It is hard to do that if you have a job though, because you will upset people! I think that people who shower/bathe every day are over the top, you can always freshen up by just standing at a sink and washing your top half with a sponge + soap.

Why is china so cruel?



the reason why I hate China is the way they treat animals..unlike humans animals do not have a voice, they cannot stand up to their killers whilst they having their throats slit or their skins torn from their body whilst being alive...



Why do the people of China have no COMPASSION towards animals or even to their own neighbours as  people are also being exploited...



In farms they eat monkey brains whilst the monkey is still alive by pouring hot water on them...WHERE IS THE COMPASSION TOWARDS ANIMALS...



In the west we have so many shops having cheap made in china toys, clothes etc..., but there are people working 15 hours every day with no breaks, being exploited to deliver goods for the WEST's demand for cheap goods..., In some clothes factories workers are even chained to the machinery...that is slavery of the 21st century...



But Bob Marley did say "what comes around goes around", and Hindu's scriptures mention Karma and so did Sharon Stone...

I think stereotyping China as cruel because of their animal treatment is kind of hypocritical.  Im pretty sure there is a good amount of crap in your home that was made by people in China.  Basicly they work hard, dont get paid as much and there stuff is shipped here because our capitalist system does not want to pay american workers decent wages to make products.  Look at people in the USA and them fighting their pitbulls....Look at the roadkill.... we eat meat, butcher animals for food.  Where is the animal compassion in the USA, dont you just hate the USA, we pretty much are China, we do owe them over a trillion dollars anyway.  If you are going to criticize the Chinese and their treatment of Animals, do some research on Panda conservation.....

I think it ties in with the HUGE population in China, I mean, if you lived in a country with something like 4 billion people you might be fighting for survival too, eating anything to keep yourself alive and working long hours in order to keep from getting wiped out by some evil communist leader as happened in Russia with Stalin or with Hitler in Germany. I just wish there were a better way to control world population so that it wasn't such a "dog eat dog" world, but people have instincts for survival and that includes procreation as a form of self aggrandizement. See what I mean? Humans just haven't ever learned to control their animal instincts- sorry if that sounds like a pun.

That type of stuff happens in other countries too. Japan, Norway (whales, etc), France, countries in Africa, other Asian countries, etc.



Look, not to sound like I don't have compassion here, but China's still a developing country. The US and other developed countries had their turn being cruel (15 hr work days, etc), and I'd argue that they helped make the US into what it is today. Industrialized.

They ALWAYS leave the lights on?



My boyfriend, his friend, and I just moved into an apartment together. Everything is just fine between us but they ALWAYS leave the lights on when they are not home or sleeping. I wake up every morning and the living room tv is on, the bathroom lights, the hall lights, some closet lights, the kitchen lights, and two lights in the living room. The electricity is included in our rent so they don't see why it matters. It really bothers me...really. What can I tell them to convince them to turn everything off when not in use?

Tell them that they do still pay the bills, it's just factored into the rent.  If the bill goes up for the owner, the bill goes up for you.  The property owner sure isn't going to take it out of THEIR share so it'll get passed along to you, eventually.

At least use CFL light bulbs to reduce the cost of electricity and extend the life of the bulbs.  An easy fix, but the electronics on a power strip so that you just have to turn off a strip every night to turn off the computer, TV, ETC...If the electricity bill becomes an  issue for the landlord, they will raise your rent.

You could be a zoologist or wildlife biologist. They actually don't get paid very much so you have to like what you're doing instead of wanting to get rich. Your pay range can vary it depends who you work and what kind of degree you get. Bachelors get paid the least, masters is in the middle, and phd is the highest. The average is about $50,000 a year. If you want to do it then you would have to take lots of science and math classes in high school. You would also need to have experience working with animals. Here is a list of some branch of zoology:
Arachnology (study of spiders)
Cetology (study of marine mammals)
Ornithology (study of birds)
Mammalogy (study of mammals)
Herpetology (study of reptiles)
Primatology (study of primate)
Ethology (study of insects)
Wildlife biologists works in the field studying animals.Your job varies in zoology. Here is another list of jobs you can do that works with nature/wildlife or animals.

There are a lot of energy saving methods you can consider.



First, figure out what appliances take the most energy.  Usually the freezer,  fridge, dishwasher, washer/dryer.  Here are just a few simple ways you can cut down your energy bill.



- You can probably turn down your freezer and fridge and still keep your food cold enough.
- You can wash your dishes rather than using a dishwasher.
- Hang dry some clothes that dry easily (like dri-fit, linens, etc.)
- Wear more layers instead of turning on the heaters around the house
- If you use a wireless lan, you can shut that off when you're not using your computer (which you should turn off as well)
- Get into the habit of turning off lights around the house if you're not in that room
- Charge some smaller objects at the office instead of at home (hehe...)
- Some places have different electricity rates at different hours of the day.  Find out when the cheaper hours are (probably during non-business hours)

- Turn off unneeded lights even when leaving a room for a short time.



- Set your refrigerator temperature at 36 to 38 and your freezer at 0 to 5 .



- Unplug seldom used appliances.
- Use a microwave whenever you can instead of a conventional oven or stove.



- Turn off lights, computers and other appliances when not in use.



- Only use electric appliances when you need them.



- Use compact fluorescent light bulbs to save money and energy.



Also there is this new Search Engine, Envirogle.com that helps save energy because of its unique black background, this will reduce electricity usage of your monitor. Which will inturn cut down your electricity bill slightly. Also it will reduce emmisions of greenhouse gasses.

Hi.,



You can change the set up of the power consumption of your computer -  go to control Panel look for Power Option folder then set it to energy savings.



You can change your bulb into energy savings, the bulb is a bit costly than normal bulb but you can save 80% of energy consumption in electricity.



Leave your window open to have fresh air  so you can save on airconditioner consumption you can put screen on your window to make sure the bugs will not come in & you will have an extra sunlight from the sun.



You can use electric fan too but set the timer.



You can use gas on cooking than electric cooking range.  Gas cost less or you can cook outside using coal just like in the camp fire and the food taste better too.  Use Thermos for hotwater so you don't have to boil the kettle everytime you need coffee.



You can wash your clothes by hand so save on washing machine. hang the clothes outside to dry so no more dryer.



Once in a while use candle light in you dinner, it looks romantic too.



Lastly,  Turn off the power supply switches if not in use , Example if the microwave power supply switch is On even the Microwave  switch is Off - the electricity is still running on  power supply because it is On.



I know someone that once a month he totally turn off  the electricity for a day, he use candles as a light and have an early sleep to rejuvinate his body as well.



Gee.. I wish this will help.

How much water is saved with the "if its pee, let it be" way of life?



A friend told me that one way they save water is by only flushing the toilet when needed.  I am wondering how much water is actually saved each time you don't flush?

My husband doesn't even do this for conservation, but it disgusts me to walk into the bathroom and smell old pee.



It's not worth the water saving to walk into that stench.

Every time you don't flush the toilet you are saving however many gallons it takes to flush. Some older toilets use as much as 6 gallons per flush.
A newer low flow toilet could be 1.6 gallons per flush.

Toilets all use different amounts of water.  It often says it right on the porcelain somewhere (lpf=litres per flush, gpf=gallons per flush).  Usually new toilets are around a gallon.  So each time you do not flush you save a gallon of water.  That adds up real quick.

It does save a lot of water, but it's gross.  If you live with men, tell them to pee outside, that helps.  My husband and I live in the mountains so he can go out on the back deck and let it rip whenever he wants too.  Saves water, but if you are a toxic mess from taking pharmaceuticals that isn't a good solution because your urine will pollute the ground water.

It depends on your toilet.  Older toilets used quite a lot of water, usually somewhere around 5 gallons per flush.  Maybe 3 gallons if you're lucky.  New low-flow toilets usually use 1.6 gallons per flush.  Mine uses 1.28 gallons per flush.



So really the "if it's yellow, let it mellow" philosophy can add up to quite a bit of water savings, depending on your toilet and how often you pee.

What are potential solutions to these environmental problems?



(1) We fish from the ponds and we often eat the fish we catch. [Reducing fish population.]



(2) Humans pollute the waters. Fishes and other water living organisms have suffered mainly from pollution. [ dead fishes]



(3) Run off containing fertilizer and other wastes, and industrial factories dumplings enter into rivers, ponds, and lakes tend to promote abnormally rapid algae growth. When the algae's die, dead organic matter ends up in the water and makes the water unusable, then killing many of the living organisms in the habitat. [ more dead fishes plus some other significant water habituating organisms die.]

(1) make fish farms just for eating, and replace some in the oceans too



(2) Place your trash in the trash can, not on the floor in the street near a storm drain which leads to the sea



(3) Suggest to make a designated area (which is closed off to the organisms) to put their wastes. It should not be killing innocent organisms
