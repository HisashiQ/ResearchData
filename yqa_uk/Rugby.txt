Why not see what others on his team are wearing and get something similar?

If he's still young, soccer cleats are fine.

I'm sure his friends won't laugh or anything; you barely notice what someone is wearing on their feet when it comes to rugby ;)

im not sure if ur british or american, but if ur british try www.prodirectrugby.com thats were i have been getting my last few pairs from. as an 18yr old i think i can be helpful, i didnt start spending £100 a pair till i was 14, but most depends on position. front row and second row i would sujest a pair of kooga's or Canterbury's. look for boots with 8, large rugby studs in, giving a good secure grip. all other positions generaly get lighter boots, my faverates at the moment are the Adidas'. they provide greate comfort, are light ish. and have great studs. i would recoment getting some of last season's Predators. they were my last pair of boots, and were my best ever. should be able to get some for £40 - £50



sorry if u live in the US, i dont have a clue were to look, but as long as there not some horrid colour, or do anything crazy ur lad will be fine.

Rugby clubs in, or near Watford (Herts) that train all year round?



Looking for a rugby club for my boyfriends 11 (soon to be 12) year old son. He was playing at school but because the rugby season has ended, cricket has taken over. This means no games and no training until the season starts again. He is really disappointed, which is a shame as he loves it and is also very good at it.



Does anybody know of an after school/weekend club where he can still train and where he can still develop himself?

Get him down to St.Albans Centurions Rugby league team we have winter & summer rugby/training.
We have junior teams and are based at Colney heath FC. The senior team are the Rugby League NATIONAL conference champions and we have several development lads coming through to play first team rugby even at 17 so there is opportunity to make it up the ladder.
The club is very family orientated and everyone is welcome.

The main difference is what happens when the play stops. In league, when there's a tackle, the game is stopped and restarted, in union they play on. In league, they don't have line outs or scrums, the attacking team gets the possession, whereas in union both teams can compete for the ball.
Basically the difference is with the forwards, in union they are there to gain possession of the ball, in league, they are just bigger versions of the backs.

There really was a huge difference between the two games. But since the League players started passing and putting in tactical kicks, I see no reason that the two codes cannot be merged. The compromises both codes would have to make wouldn't be that painful.
Although the contested scrum could still be a huge sticking point.

Yes.

In so far as I can see the major differences are in tackling and in the scrums.

In league, the attacking team are allowed 6 attempts to score a try.  If they are tackled 6 times, then the ball is turned over to the opposition and they then have six attempts.  In union, play continues until there is a try or until a foul is conceded by either time.

Scrums in union are a much more convoluted affair that I don't fully understand, while in league the scrums involve the forwards scruming against each other and the ball being put in.  It is very rare that the team who have the put in lose the ball.  Losing the ball is much more common in union.

As well as this there are 2 extra players on a union side, 15 instead of 13, and in league once the referee shouts 'held' the tackling player must get off the tackled player.  In union, it is the attacker who must release the ball within a given amount of time (4 seconds I believe) or concede a foul.

For further information I would look at the 2 BBC websites I mention below.

Yes there is lots of differences.

League split from union in 1895 and since then I feel the RFL (governing body for rugby league) has been allot more open to changes and developments in the sport than the RFU(rugby union). and now the two sports are very different and i dare say they will get further and further apart as the years go on

Of course there is. They're too completely different sports and the differences are too much to name but here are the main ones.

In League there are no rucks, mauls lineouts and the scrums are uncontested. There are 13 players and they attacking team has 5/6 chances to score otherwise it's turned over. Also 'tackles' can be just shoulder charges.

In Union there are rucks, mauls lineouts and scrums are a competition. There are 15 players and the team holds on to the ball until they score, are turned over, make a mistake or kick it away. Shoulder charges are illegal.

Also I do not think that there will be a merger of the codes. If there is going to be one code it will be Union. League fans do not take this the wrong way but Union is more popular globally whereas League is (extremely) popular in just Australia and a bit popular in England. Also Union teams now have more money and the likelihood is that lot's of league stars like Sonny Bill will join Union. I hope it doesn't happen btw because I wouldn't like to see the demise of another sport but there is a small chance that this could happen.

The real differences are felt when you play both codes , a rugby leaguer tries to run through you or over you to break the tackle but if stopped keeps the ball to replay the ball in a second play of the ball.A union player tries to break the tackle but not as hard in my opinion as he has the option to go to ground and recycle it back through his forwards who should be close behind.The consequesces are felt the following day when you attempt to get out of bed and do so in stages as your body has stiffened up due to the impacts

looking at the six nations, the Italian national team can now go into tournaments looking at winning two or three games. A few years ago, they'd just be happy to get close in a game so the national team has improved. The club teams are still the weekest ones in the european cup though. They can get the occasional home win but people look at a group with an Italian team in it as an easy group. The problem with this is that most of Italy's best players play in either England or France.

I love the no nonsense hard style of forward play from Italy.

I saw them in the 2003 World Cup in Canberra.  Their number 8, was world class.  I thought he was a better player than Taine Randall who was considered to be the premier number 8 at the time

well, it will would all depend on what reason you are setting up this team. To compete at a high standard? or trying to get young kids interested in Rugby?

depending on the reasons you are wanting to set up this team then this will be influential in where you set it up,

Obviously, Australia, NZ, SA and the UK (England, Scotland and Wales) are already well established Rugby nations and so setting up teams here will be hard as there is a lot of competition with every town probably having numerous clubs with every school probably fielding various teams.

However, if you were to go to North America to the U.S and Canada (contrary to the above poster who seems to believe Canada are world beaters at Rugby, which they really are not) where the game is not as well established and there are not as many clubs or registered players, competition isnt going to be as hotly contested, and it would be a good way of introducing people to a great new sport and to improve the coverage of Rugby in these areas.

as an example, my Rugby Club sent us on a tour to Kenya to play some of the clubs over there as a sort of fundraiser for the Kenyan clubs. When you see kids playing Rugby with a coconut on the beach and see what enthusiasm they have and how much they love the game and how they are not as privliged as the kids playing in the club sides, it makes me think how great it would be if someone could put some money into setting up more clubs for them over there.

Of course the Wallas are a good team and organization.  One-eyed support for the home side is pretty well universal in Rugby Union (and thank goodness), but the preparation and commitment of the Blacks to Bledisloe competition says it all about the respect they have for AUS.

The AB substitutions were a critical factor in the win, for sure.  But player management and preparation of the substitutes is one of the keys to good coaching, and in this the ABs, and Graham Henry and his staff particularly, showed their overwhelming superiority last weekend.

The substitutions made by Henry were without a doubt the factor that swung the momentum. The difference between the 2 countries is the depth of talent that NZ constantly churns out over the years. NZ also doesn't need to "buy" league so called talent to boost their teams.

Personally i believe the difference is the club level competition, NPC/Air NZ cup is the reason why NZ has a very strong level of talent but also the depth of players to be able to make subtle changes into a line but still produce a winning result like we saw on the weekend.

As has been commented, they move to NZ with their familes as this is where work can be obtained.



It can be a problem with many aspiring Islanders getting a run in the NZ 7s. Unfortunately once they have been picked in a game they are then only eligible for the ABs. One could be cynical and look at it as a way to stop the Islanders playing against them.

Of course it is. It is the game played in Heaven. Of course being an old rugby boy I may be biased (but have also played league and Aussie rules-rugby is best).

Edit: Jamez, league used to be a good game to watch, now it is 5 hitups and a kick. Every now and then a team will actually use the ball but this doesn't happen very often.

Union is far better to play & watch. I played & watched both.
I sometimes put a league match on the TV bu usually give up after about 10 minutes.
I only ever pay to watch a Union game.
I'm sorry I even bothered to play any League.

I agree, just look at World Cups for example. The Rugby League world cup is a complete farce, the gap between the top 3 teams (Aus, NZ and UK) and the rest is ridiculous. At least the Rugby World cup is competitive amongst the top 8-10 countries.

Union is the best game ever played. League became watchable after they started passing and making tactical kicks, Aussie Rules is for the dimwitted machomen, and Gaelic's only there for the tradition. NFL's a joke.

But that's the order of superiority where an oval ball is concerned.

Not a chance. It is inferior in every respect. Speed, skill, strength. And Union is as boring as hell to watch
The only time it beats league is in crowd participation. They spend more time catching the ball than the players

I agree totaly with nic b. League is superior in every aspect. I once went to a union game and it is more of a social event for the crowd! They stand there talking not even watching the game becasue there is a scrum at the other end of the field which is having it's 6th attempt of getting it right!!

It's all a matter of opinion. I personally think Union is the greatest game ever played due to the tactical play involved, the inclusion of many different builds of players.



Though I can understand why people would prefer League. It's faster (generally) and there are some big hits in the form of shoulder charges which are illegal in Union.

I love union. It's strategic, it's hard-hitting, it has a beautiful ebb and flow to it.

From this American's perspective, league seems like the lesser of either rugby union or gridiron football. League seems like a watered-down version of union, with no rucks, mauls, lineouts, or contested scrums -- all those things that make rugby such a wonderful game. But on the other hand, league doesn't compare to American football, because it just seems like gridiron without the forward passes. I love our American football, but league just leaves me cold. Five tackles, punt, five tackles, punt, five tackles, punt. Zzzzzzz.

Union is the only one. It was first, its the best and even with all the fiddling that's going on with the rules its still the best. League was always supposed to be an abbreviated version of Union. When people say that Union is so stop and start I do have to wonder if they have ever watched a league game.

There is nowhere cheapish in Cardiff to stay I am sorry to say, not on an international day anyway!
Booked up by now anyway I would guess!

As for celebrating, the place will be buzzing, so most pubs will have a good atmosphere but a few  venue's do not allow people in with rugby jerseys on!
So be aware of that!

Try Swansea, less than an hours train ride away  which has a better night life and cheaper accommodation!

We're going to watch SA vs Wales in November.  After trawling the net for cheap accommodation we found the cheapest option (and available with rooms) was to stay in a Travel Lodge a bit outside the centre of Cardiff.  We're paying £50 a night for the room (£25 each).  It works out cheaper than the hostels as they make you take the room/bed for the whole weekend.  The other places closer to the stadium wanted significantly more so we figured staying a bit outside the main area and catching a taxi home (its only about 7 miles away) was the most affordable option.

Not sure on where the best parties will be.  We're going to hang around the stadium and then follow the crowd.

What kind of weightlifting do I need to do to strengthen my arms for rugby?



I have never played rugby before, so until now I have been blissfully unaware of how weak my arms are.
I am a big girl so I play in the scrum and I have been told that I will be one of the ones lifting people during line-outs.
I have access to a pretty good gym at my university and I need to get strong fast seeing as the season has already started. Any tips on optimum weightlifting would help.
I need to know what exercises, the percentage of my max I need to lift, how many reps/sets, and tips on technique. 
Thanks!
