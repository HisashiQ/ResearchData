Should I Buy Powerisers??



I've watched videos of powerisers and they look good. But iv'e also seen other videos where they look really crappy. Like they jump about an inch off the ground. But other vids ive seen people jumping metres.



Do you have to really jump hard for a good bounce?
Is there certain ones I should buy. I want these
