Who thinks we should drop the Electoral voting process and go by individual voting?



It was established long ago when more citizens lived in the cities and had larger populations. I think the US has changed and is more widespread throughout country and city. So do you think this is an outdated process we use today, and now we should push to have all our counts working as a personal choice?

A les drastic solution would be to allow states to divide Electoral College votes proportionally, instead of having a winner-takes-all system.  Two states do this now -- Maine and Nebraska, I believe.

No.  I like the electoral college.  People in small rural areas would never had their voices heard if it wasnt for the electoral college.  Do you honestly beleive without the electoral college, any candidate would ever campaign in a place like Kansas?  The people of Kansas and their issues have a voice due to the electoral college.  Without the electoral college, no politician would make any promises to rural americans because of the low number of population.  the electoral college balances this out

I think popular vote should win. A lot more people could win because it could all hinge on one vote. For some reasons most people do win the popular vote but lose the electoral college vote...which doesn't make it fair because if the majority wants a certain person, they should have that.

Yes I think you should change. Results are extremely inaccurate and a waste of time.



For example, lets say there are 10 million people in Florida. If Obama got 6 million and McCain got 4 million, they count the 6 million as majority which is then classed as 10 million.



So the 4 million doesnt even count.



Obama did not win the the MOST votes, he just won the MAJORITY in the "Important" states. What about all the other states that McCain won? Doesnt count as it is not a major state.



Not exactly accurate is it?

If we did that small states would be out of the loop and would not have any say. The way the electoral system works it still gives some say to small state.



You are wrong more people live in big cities today than they did 50, 100 or 200 years ago. Then we were a nation of farms not cities as we are today.

This is the funny part, my friends:  All we heard from His Excellency was "change, change, change."  But his policies are near carbon-copies of Carter's.

YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.



For me it is a sad day in American History as I do not believe the new president and the Democratic Party will unite or fix America’s problems. If you look into it deep it was from way back the sub prime mortgage came out of the Bill Clinton time. On National Health. Take look at Canada’s (national healthcare), people are waiting YEARS to see a DOCTER! Do you want to wait a year to see a doctor if you have lets say, cancer? And it is not free it comes out of tax payers money and Government run.
As for McCain God bless him. The cards where stacked against him. What where they?
Age , not good looking, not a sweet talker, Republican Bush History, the worst economy since the great depression of the 1930s,and the on going war, so he had very little chance to win.



If you think Obama will take from the rich and give it to the poor you are living in fantasy land. The rich will move there money and investments out of America along with big business and jobs. More government means more TAX to pay for everyone.
Sorry I am just complaining , but I do care about America and I did vote.
What ever happens it will not affect me much as I have moved out of the USA .And over here. The weather is good ,food is fresh and plentiful and life style is on the take it side.
On the plus side with the new president. Should be able to get more free money from the new Democratic government.

He said that this Presidency should be and he does - accept it humility and graciousness.  He said that we need to RID THE PARTISANSHIP that has TORN this Country APART and DIVIDED the NATION.



HE WANTS UNIFICATION AND THE PARTISANSHIP TO END!!



Will you follow his most gracious and humble comments and follow his lead?  Or will you continue to drive a wedge into the Nation and divide it?



Did you vote him in for this VERY REASON?  Or did you vote for less important reasons with no substance so you continue to do what he is against?



I ask because I see many posts with sarcasm and meanness.



Will we get past this - or are we going to continue that wrong path?

To an arab who owned a small Business here in metro detroit.

What's the point in our voting?



We were all raised to believe our vote counted and we could make a difference. Yet our polls just closed and within an hour Obama is making his victory speech.
I'm not implying he won't win the popular vote anyway, but why should we go to the trouble of going to the polls if the electoral vote gives it to him before they even start counting in our state? If they're going to declare the victor before our votes are tabulated, why should we be paying all these people to count votes?

There are a few different factors involved here.  In a lot of the states, they do exit polls.  These are just polls basically finding out who the people voted for.  In the states that are turning out to be landslide victories they use these polls.  Nothing is set in stone yet but all indicators lead to an Obama victory.  It has pretty much always been this way.



As far as our vote actually counting, I think are votes have plenty of weight.  For example, I vote in Virginia and that was a huge swing state.  With out votes like mine, the popular vote goes down for my candidate and the opposition gets the upper hand (thus taking 13 electoral votes).  The popular vote is more important to individual states than anything else because they determine who gets the electoral votes.

I am not racist, I am not uneducated about what is going on in the world, I have acknowledged that many Americans want our troops home, Bush sent our troops into iraq (I do not agree with this) But now that we are there, how can we leave so fast, we will be leaving an unfinished job, We will be leaving Iraq an open country to do as they please, the Iraqis will not forgive us for what Bush has done, No matter who is president, and to inform you, Barack Hussein Obama is from Kenya, not Hawaii. If we leave Iraq with them hating us, do you think that they will just get over it, or do something about it. Many troops want to finish the war, not set it aside for the war to come into our land. When I made that vote for McCain, It was not a selfish thought, I voted for him because he will resolve the issues with the war instead of bringing our troops home in hope of Iraq giving up. Iraq will not give up. We will see a war inside our country, not because the Americans want it, but because they didnt take this outlook into consideration.

No smears, I never had any, but in a few months he'll either sink or swim.

He'll be known as a legend either way.....doing great things for this country or being the inexperienced weasel that came in and took us from a recession to a depression. His experience is telling me the latter is more probable.

Agreed...I just wish people would have taken the time to actually research the candidates instead of voting on emotions.  Neither candidate really had the qualifications, but I took McCain because he was the less of two evils.  One good thing that should come out of this is that the whites can no longer be considered racist.

Both candidates sucked, I voted for the lesser of two evils (again).  I am an independant voter, and for the past 4 elections, I have voted for the lesser, and I apparently voted with the majority 2 of those 3 times.  I just hope that the general public voted for the right reasons, our country, and not the color of his skin.  I personally feel that when the country is ready to stop pointing out his race, color, religion, etc, that we are ready for him.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



1) You chose a very unqualified vice president.  I figure you and Obama are both at equal risk of dying (you're old, he might get assassinated because of race), but his VP is significantly more qualified than yours.



2) Your economic plan didn't cut it for me.  It seemed like nothing would really change, and your healthcare plan definitely didn't help.



$5000 is great, but it won't be enough for complete coverage, it's ridiculous to tax health benefits, and if you're cutting taxes, where was this $5000 going to come from?



3) I don't like being hated.  Obama made it clear that while he doesn't approve of gay marriage, he wasn't going to ban it.  You want to write that into the constitution, and you've made it clear that you don't believe in gay adoption or hate crime protection.  I feared if you were elected that I would become a second class citizen, all because my love is different.



4) You wanted to ban abortion.  Am I pro-life?  Yes.  But women are going to get abortions anyways and I'd rather see it done under safe conditions.  Also I think that a woman should have a chance to chose (even if I don't agree) and that if the mother's life is at risk, she should have a choice about abortion.

I would say there is nothing else he really could have done.  So many people at the beginning of 9/11 supported us going into Iraq and now everyone has turned on the idea and blamming Bush for it.  Plus, they dont like how much the stock market has dropped, inflation rising, and gas prices soaring higher earlier this year.  People decided to get the Democrats a try and see if they can fix things.

Anyone else feel this way?



I'm soo excited - yet a little scared all the same.



While I voted for Obama on his thoughts and ideas (of course as with any president we're waiting to see if he will follow through)... there are many souls out there who voted for him because he's black. And there are many people out there whole will judge everything he does as what out "black president" did....



That thought concerns me... same as if Clinton had won. It would have been what that woman president did. The first bad decisison he makes (and there will be one/some - as we are all human - don't tell me you've never made a mistake?) the world will conclude that black people shouldn't be in charge...



there is so much at stake!! Are you praying?!?! Don't be iggnorant and say you're only going to pray because McCain lost... pray anyone and without stopping!!

Of course he's going to make some mistakes, especially his first year. You get those out of the way fast. But if Obama assembles the advisors and cabinet the way I think he will, the mistakes will be lessened.



You are so right about him about to be blamed for race. It's like being the first black coach, the old "See I told you!" It took Tony Dungy winning the Super Bowl to put that to rest.

I voted for him as well and although I am happy he won, I am a bit worried. I think he is a very good man, and has the right ideas for helping America get back on track, but what bothers me is the whole race card. If he had lost it would have been racist, but many many people voted for him just because he is black. That seems racist to me.

Certainly, as the first African-American president, there is some chance that Obama's decisions will be held not only against him, but against his race.  To me, its as silly as voting for someone (or not doing so) simply because of the color of their skin.



I take solace in the fact, though, that while JFK was held up as a Catholic president, and not just a president, a few short decades later we don't even really think of this as an issue, and his successes and errors aren't held against any Catholic candidate, but left as the legacy of his own presidency.



In other words, don't be too afraid, Obama will develop a personality in his own presidency that will go beyond race, and make it impossible to reduce him to such a narrow category.



At least, that's the hope.

That's definitely true. He will be judged because he's black, he's young, and because he's coming into the White House at one of the most horrible points in American history.



I'm confident he's going to do whole lot more good than he will mess up, though, and that should keep everyone from judging too harshly.

I've been a strong McCain supporter from day one, lost a bit of luster with Sarah Palin at first but regained the confidence and stuck with them all the way to the polls.



He lost, Obama won and as McCain said it's time to no longer be blue or red but join together as Americans and support and work together.



That's my plan, he'll need all the help he can get and is smart enough to know that, he said it in his Grant Park speech last night.  My bumper stickers are already off my car and hope everyone will discard there bloody campaign signs and replace them with a simple sign, not blue, not red but purple "UNITED".

Is he going to flop back to the ultra left now? I have absolutly no problem if he is the first type of president. I weep for us if he flops back.

Ur right.Alot of blacks voted obama just because he was black.I was supporting Mccain because of what he stands for NOT what color he is or because hes a republician.It might turn out Obama doesnt do such a bad job we never know till we try.If Obama had stood for the same thing as Mccain and Mccain stand for what Obama does then i would be an Obama supporter.

Why do you give soo little credit to your people???



Nobody voted for him just because he's black!!!



If he was a black guy from the hoods, thuglike, cheating on his wife, finishing last in his class, I would have been ashamed that he would be the one representing my race and i would never vote for him!



But Barack is anything but that! He is what we could all be. Well educated, articulate, a strong man. So heck yeah! I'm proud that it is a black man who is the better candidate! It made me proud to vote for him. A vote he would have never gotten from me if it wasn't for those qualities!



remember,
It is not racist to be proud of a black candidate who so clearly is the better one. Just like women didn't massively go for Palin because we found it a shame she represented us, just like that blacks wouldn't vote for Obama if he wasn't one we would feel could represent us in the best way possible!

Yes I pray and believe what you say is true. A lot people vote for Obama because we don't want McCain to continue Bush failed eocmonic policies.  We are in this messed because of the Repbulcians. Yes. I am so proud of Obama because he's black but that wasn't the only reason I voted for him. I voted against Bush. I am tired of greed and republicans don't give a dayum about the middle or lower class. We as black people deal with that on a daily basis.  Most of the time I am the only black person at my job.  Anything bad happen in the world or if a black person gets in trouble.  Whites think I know that person.  Blacks are look at as a group and not as individuals like whites, latino, Asians etc.  Unknown to popular belief we all don't think alike.  No. Obama will not be able to change all the ill of the world in one day, one year or whatever.  It's time to turn the page.  We are either going to one American or millions different America.  We are all human beings regardless what race we are.  I am so happy and glad I got to witness this historic event.  No. I do not think Obama is God as the right think. &gt;&lt;

I voted for McCain so of course disapointed, but of course will Pray for Obama to do a good job.



Im a little concerned over such flip in power though. A dem congress, and Senate, and white house I think is too much power in one's hands.



I think a balance of power is necessary so you dont piss off the other half of the country. So we could see a flip in the next elections Im sure.



Im not to worried about a lot of his social agendas as he doesn't have money to work with. he has a debt. SO I wouldn't expect him to deliver on anything except domestic laws at first.



Like on abortion, Stem Cell,  I do expect him to raise taxes, as well as I thought McCain would have too. We will see how the stock market reacts today.



I myself am not against social programs to help the people on the bottom, but he is just promising everything.



So I think he will fail at half of his promises. Does not mean he will be a bad president.



When I saw Jessie Jackson crying. Who I can't agree with on anything. It kind of told me this is good, and it is good now. If Obama did not win some of these suppressed elder black people may not have seen this.
This can be good for the country, but it can also turn bad.



So I just pray he keeps uniting people, and can stop this divide no matter what.

I am not racist, I am not uneducated about what is going on in the world, I have acknowledged that many Americans want our troops home, Bush sent our troops into iraq (I do not agree with this) But now that we are there, how can we leave so fast, we will be leaving an unfinished job, We will be leaving Iraq an open country to do as they please, the Iraqis will not forgive us for what Bush has done, No matter who is president, and to inform you, Barack Hussein Obama is from Kenya, not Hawaii. If we leave Iraq with them hating us, do you think that they will just get over it, or do something about it. Many troops want to finish the war, not set it aside for the war to come into our land. When I made that vote for McCain, It was not a selfish thought, I voted for him because he will resolve the issues with the war instead of bringing our troops home in hope of Iraq giving up. Iraq will not give up. We will see a war inside our country, not because the Americans want it, but because they didnt take this outlook into consideration.

Yesterday will forever be a black day in my book. (pardon the pun)  Obama will never get the words "my president" or "the president" out of my mouth.  He will forever be "that guy".  It's a sad time in our country right now.

There will be NO change, only business as usual. It will take at least 2 years for Obama to impose his will upon the country. There is already whispers of another war. I do hope no one thinks that electing a different party will change things in this country.......Reality is it is a 2 party monopoly, and we will still be headed in the same general direction. Think of it as drinking pepsi or coke, in the end you have still consumed the same basic beverage. The country needs a third party option before any change will happen.

If the Obama from the campaign is in office, then I don't think there is too much to worry about. He had to move to the middle of the road to win. I heard on the news that only 22% of the people who voted for him declared themselves as liberal, with 36% saying they were moderate.



Obama may be many things but he is not stupid. He will realize that he was elected as the more middle of the road Obama, and that if he flops back to the ultra left, many will be extremly po'd, and I think he will lose the support of many of the more moderate democrats, especially from the south.



I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt until we see if he will be the Obama we saw on the campaign trail, or the Obama whos phylosiphy and voting record is ultra liberal.

<question>



Why are African Americans groundlessly celebrating change?



Minorities, Barack Obama is not going to resolve your financial problems and be your caregiver because he is black. You will still be 2nd rate citizens, every President declares change, you just think his declaration is different because he is black, the stupidity of that concept is truly beyond human comprehension.



</question>



<additional details>



No, I don't support either John McCain or Barack Obama, I am just honest and not ignorant like all Black Obama supporters who believe Barack Obama is the "Messiah of Great Change". because he is black.



I think Barack Obama should win an award for the most baseless thesis statements made by a presidential candidate.



Some people are incredibly stupid, this question does not imply that all Barack Obama supporters were black.



Yo! It's Ro™ - Your entire argument was constructed on speculated bigotry.



Do you see any black McCain supporters, I think not. And I am doubtful that all black citizens share the same views, the only thing you share is one thing, preconceived opinion.



Do you know what is truly pathetic, the foundationless voting from black non-contributing zeros who have never voted in their entire lives voting for Barack Obama only because he is black.



You can deny your prejudicial reasoning all you like, I can still read through your ignorance and senseless lies.

They are ignorant. They haven't been able to see past Obama's skin color. All they see is a black man and they are black too...so they think this man will help them and make them rich. It's pure uneducated ignorance. Obama is a very wealthy black man that basically grew up with a "white" mentality. I don't think he will do anymore for black people than any other president has done. But, lucky for Obama, they are too dumb to realize that and he got all of their votes.
Basically, 18-25 year old college kids and black people are who got Obama voted into office today and all because they wanted a "black" man for president. Everyone jumped on the bandwagon instead of really examining this guy and what he stands for and what he will do with our country.
Black people keep denying that they voted for him because he is black, yet black people showed up in RECORD never before seen numbers this year to vote and the shouting, "yay our first BLACK president!" isn't helping their case any.  Not to mention that most of the tv interviews that I saw, whenever a black person was asked who they intend to vote for.....wait for it....wait for it.....it was ALWAYS Obama.



Prepare for it guys, America is going to hell in a handbasket under the reign of the first terrorist tied president. Good job everyone. Pat yourselves on the back!

I was going crazy inside.
I feel the same way!
I work right in the heart of Harlem for over 2 years now. It kind of grew on to me. I know everybody on the block and they know me. Never had any problems. But today something changed, something in their eyes changed. In fact, I felt like minority myself. Maybe I became a racist over time that I live in this country. But there is a reason why I became that way. I will not get in to the details, but I always was and still am very respectful to other races, but rarely see it in return.  I only hope, that the new president will do something about welfare system.  I don't think its fare that I have to work to support their entire colony that refuse to work from generation to generation.

Do you really think that's what they believe? It's not because they think they are going to get something from Obama...you would be pretty happy, too, if you were oppressed for hundreds of years and all of a sudden, an African-American was elected to the highest office in the United States. Kind of like when women were given the right to vote...I'm sure they didn't groundlessly celebrate.

Second rate citizens?
While you remain what? First rate?



Probably not, a lot of white people would be ashamed to call you one of their own with such an ignorant filled comment as that.



I'm not looking for Barack Obama to "solve my financial problems" I am wise with my money, albeit young.  I'm not looking for a handout because I work hard for what I want.  But I also believe in helping out the majority of the people.  I did not vote for him because he is Black.  It could have been anyone else, with any color of skin, as long as I agreed with them more, that's who got my vote.  To me it seems like white people are focusing more on his race than a lot of blacks.  Except those who were at his rally tonight that have overcome this imbecilic way of seeing and believing things.



People like you disgust me.



The stupidity and amount of bigotry exuding from this question and details is truly beyond human comprehension.



Grow up, and get a life.

I certainly did not. And I cry for this country because we are F'ked. You will see this has split the country into white, black again. And the Man doesnt have any experience. Im planning on leaving the country. I never thought I would see the day. I think more people voted against Bush than for Obama. A sad day for America, we are going down the toilet. All homies, I hope you are happy when the Muslim people come over here and start to kill you and me. You will see, its the end of the world as we kow it. I feel sick.

Obama's entire campaign was ran on "change" from Bush, and McCain is the same as Bush. That was it and it worked! He has no experience, ideas that have been tried and failed in other countries, but because he was nowhere near Bush, people voted for him. So this was more of a vote AGAINST Bush..I don't care what people say!

I'm not from the US but I can tell you why the majority of Europe was routing for him:
The alternative was another conservative right wing nutcase a la George Bush!
No but seriously:
Pro national health care
Pro choice
While still pro death penalty not so much as Mccain
Sees the need of strong science curriculum in schools
Pro environment
Pro renewable energy sources (vs. offshore drilling and nuclear energy suggested by Mccain *shudders*)
Believes in global warming as man made problem (which Palin apparently does not)
Higher willingness to cooperate and talk with Iran rather than taking a line that looks very similar to that that Bush had with Iraq (and we know where that ended...)
Pro national health care
Pro increasing minimum wage
Pro gay equality
Pro stem cell research
Opposed to the Iraq war, looking at alternatives to sending more troops
Anti war
Not pro creationism (unlike allegedly Palin)
Pretty much sums it up!



I appreciate I don't have in depth knowledge of US politics but from what you hear over here, there was only one sound choice and that was Obama! McCain just sounded like another Bush which is something I personally would like seen avoided at all costs!

The reason McCain lost is because the youth vote comes from schools where universities employ profs like Bill Ayers and Wade Churchill (87% of them).



Also because the elite, mainstream media is corrupt and spewed hatred about McCain.



Now, the Dem led congress who let our economy tank will not be able to hide behind a Republican president.  I am not pleased to know that I will be able to say "I told you so."

Although George Dubya helped Obama win just by belonging to the same party as McCain, it came with a price. As far as I am concerned, if only Al Gore had won in 2000 ,( he did actually, Florida was rigged by Bush ),the world would be a much better place today. No doubt about that.

Where are all the McCain supporters?



Okay, so I still see quite a few people on here saying that this country is doomed.  They're still saying how they're going to leave the country.  Good, the door for this country is that way -----------------------&gt;.



Why are you whining about democracy?  Democracy worked perfectly yesterday and you can't handle it.  If you're that upset that your candidate lost horribly, move to Cuba.  You won't have to worry about your candidate losing or having to vote.

<additional details>



Autumn:  I hope I do get the change that I voted for.  The great thing about being an American is that if for some reason Obama doesn't help move America toward the future, in four years, I'll be able to vote for another president.



To everyone who's telling me to stop the name calling:  I'm not calling anyone names.  I'm simply offering a solution to the people that can't stand the thought of Obama being the president.  I'm ready to do my part to make this country everything it can be.

As for me? I WILL  respect  the President of our country, even though I didn't vote for him. That's far more that I can say for most liberals. Hopefully he will govern from the center, not the FAR left as his history shows. Anyone who prays should pray for our country.

It has nothing to do with race. If I liked Obama, I would vote for him no matter the skin color.  I voted for McCain because he would be a better president, not because he was white.

It's difficult to take anyone seriously who has "a approval".  An approval is the appropriate language to use.  And just because your candidate of choice did not win, it does not mean those who did not vote for him are "stupid".  It's a shame you are taking such a hostile approach to the situation.

How about this, Either shut up and respect your next president, or get out of the country. I'm sure you were wearing your flag pin all election and talking about how important it is to America to vote, but now you're whining because you're team didn't win.

I would have voted for Obama in a heart beat if he intended to do what is best for America. The same with McCain. As it was John was the 'lesser of two evils'. Outright Marxism versus Socialism lite? Bad choice.



As for Americans being so dumb, I think that was proved when the media figure sent people into the field to ask the people on the street if they agreed with what Obama had to say, all the while substituting McCain's statements for Obama's. They agreed, even though it was opposite of what Obama actuall said.

My goodness.. how much hatred you have in you. I don't understand why you would even say this about anything. He was elected and that's that. Even if McCain was elected as president, he would have died by the end of his term from old age, and that idiotic woman would have taken over the presidency.

Americans were ready for a change from the status quo of the last eight years. However risky that may be. I only hope that Obama is even 1/4 as honest as he tries to make out. But I also feel that it is very apparant how this election was no different than many other elections in the past. Americans are band wagoners. Very few of them can think for themselves and they are easily herded like sheep into a pen. Most of the young vote Obama got, came from easily swayed Wii addicted types who couldn't give one good reason for voting the way they did if their life depended on it. They just want to fit in. It is "cool" at the time. I for one, chose a write in. Simply due to the fact that while McCain is a great American....he did have a track record of siding with Bush way too often. But Obama??? Unproven, inexperienced, perhaps even a sheep in wolves clothing....so if the home team wins the next five games in a row then I'm supposed to buy the T-shirt also right ???  No Thanks !

Is that a question? if so then congrats to Obama



Besides; what is wrong with fried chicken and watermelon?  The chicken I may understand because of it being fried, but watermelon is okay.  And the secret service protects the White House and surrounding area, so someone would be stupid to have a gunfight there, so your arguments have no merit

Your whole point is shat on due to the fact that Obama believes we're all equal and that color doesn't matter.



He represents the very thing you obviously still think anyone gives a crap about except the Klan.



Honestly, get over it, you weren't affected at all by what happened "HUNDREDS OF YEARS" ago. Move on, stop complaining and realize none of the "white americans" who are still alive today had anything to do with what happened to the "non White Americans".

The 90+% support right after 9/11 or the 20% support after the numerous failures of our president Bush? It will depend on job performance. Our president Bush was heavily supported until he made so many bad choices for America. I believe that Obama will have a much better job performance than our president Bush.

I'm' pretty sure he is going to severely boost the taxes people owe if one is making of 250,000$ a year. Even above that isn't there another category for the wealthiest 2% of Americans? Is there any specifics you could tell me, like what percentage will the wealthiest 2% be taxed. On Obama's website it doesn't mention how much exactly but I heard 63% of their income but that cannot be right.

He's going to try, but the wealthiest americans are all in tax shelters, tax havens, and have no direct income.  They have made their money many years or even generations ago.  Instead I fear this tax plan will start dropping well below the $250K mark and start heading toward families making less than 1/2 of that sum.  In this economic crisis, raising taxes on too many people could move our recession into depression.  I hope he considers this move carefully before doing it.  I'm not anywhere near the wealthiest group, but he can find me if he keeps lowering the bar, and I won't be happy with higher taxes.  I'm barely making it as I stand right now.

Why can't people understand straightforward logic?  Obama WILL NOT tax "the wealthy".  Don't you understand that "the wealthy" and particularly those "making over 250,000 a year" defines Obama, his family, and all his cronies?  What do you think he did, sit around with his group and say "Guys, we have to pay more taxes so other people can have more"?
Sure he did.

There is a HUGE difference between "the wealthiest" and the 250k earners.



I don't know where Obama got the 250K concept from - it isn't a current bracket.  Right now, individuals top two brackets are at 164,550 and 357,700 (33% and 35%).  For married couples it's 200,300 and 357,700.  That's "earned income" by the way.



There are other types of income - the type that "the wealthiest" would be more likely to have... capital gains, stock gains, real estate, and collectibles gains are typical examples.  Also, income from bonds can be non-taxable or tax advantaged.

Yes I am happy as the Republican Party has run the country to the edge of ruin. Senator McCain was gracious in defeat and gave an impressive speech. I believe had he not saddled himself with Gov. Palin it would have been a much closer election. I also believe President elect Obama won because he was meeting with economists and other financial experts while McCain was crowing about "Joe the Plumber". I seriously hope Gov. Palin goes back to AK and stays there. She may be ready for SNL but she is definitely a "Not Ready for Prime Time Politician".

I honestly think it had an effect. All of this hateful bile was bound to backfire. I've never seen so much hate directed at a presidential candidate. And yeah, at some point there's going to be a sympathetic backlash for the guy.



Right-wingers seriously overplayed their hands on this one. If they could have come up with rational objections to his policies, that would have been one thing. But this constant barrage of hyperbole -- he's a socialist, he's a terrorist, he's a closet Muslim, he's a Nazi, he's a Communist, he hates America -- makes the people saying it look like nutcases after a while. People just tune you out and won't take you seriously.

You will find out later, we all will.When Obama raises taxes on the wealthy business owners (the people who actually put money in stocks )  the business owners will just lay off workers and raise prices to get the tax money back. pass the charges on to the consumer. THAT HOW BUSINESS WORKS  then they will take the money out of the stock market and our economy will take a horrible turn . it happened during the great depression and history will repeat itself. Oh yeah Barack did not sit in a church for 20 years with a dispicable "preacher" who says the US of KKK. and GOD DAMN AMERICA. It was taken out of context*

I will give the man the benefit of the doubt and wait and see. We at least have a chance of controlling a runaway congress but Nancy Pelosi is also a "Dud". I really hope that things go well.

We are united, deep down where it counts.



You've seen the usual bickering and arguing and so forth that comes with any election.  It's loud, it's boisterous.  But it's over, the people have spoken, and we'll go forward with a new president.



What you haven't seen is a military coup, where a few officers declare martial law and take control of the country, or a former leader declare the election invalid, and refuse to surrender power.



Think about that - that would be a remarkable event in many parts of the world.



This country is like a family - brothers fight with sisters, and kids talk back to parents.  But if there is a challenge from the outside, it's dollars to doughnuts that we'll fall into lockstep and pull together to take on anything the world can throw at us.  You saw that on September 11, and some of you saw it during WW2.



So we ARE united, in that we overwhelmingly respect the democratic process, the rule of law, and the American way.

The change he is talking about has to do with alot of things, equality of all Americans. We all know that hasn't been going on. Ending this war in Iraq responsibly. Getting our reputation back to a good name, which wont be easy. And just so much more, I am tired. And for the first time in along time I am going to go get the best sleep I've gotten in years. There is a calmness about what has happened in our fine country and its a beautiful thing, while some of you may not see that now you will come to see what most of us do.

please remember Kennedy created the myth of Camelot in the White House while sending the Knights of the Round Table to die in Vietnam.....so where does our Army get sent next in the cause of idealism? Darfur?



He came to office a young untried Senator with little national and no international experience and Americas enemies.....ie the Soviet Union.....made the calculation they could push him and he would back down. The result in the Cuban Missile Crisis had the world about 45 minutes away from a nuclear war which would have killed us all. So how hard does say, Rhafsanjami (sp?) in Iran think he can push?



and of course JFK firmly established the tradition of extra marital sex and adultery which Bill Clinton so brilliantly followed........

1. NO,  I think that in a few months Americans that voted for Obama will be crying about it.  I really do hope that I am wrong about the man, but history is rarely proven wrong and Obama wants to repeat some very bad mistakes from America's past.



2. He has 77 days before he gets sworn in.  I hope he picks a good cabinet and listens to them.  I hope he keeps his word and works to unite the country, but since he hasn't honored his word before, I am not holding my breath.

If I got raped and got pregnant from that, there is no way I would even want to birth that baby. If I chose to keep it, I would kill myself due to trauma. Don't be ignorant.

McCain is another Bush and he only cares about big businesses and taking away women's rights that's another reason why I didn't vote for him. Also this country is in a recession and we don't want anything to get alot worse than they already are.

Will Republicans return to fiscal conservatism?



They have borrowed money and spent like drunken sailors the last 8 years - they are supposed to be the ones with sense!  What happened?
Now we've got a Democratic Congress and President, who despite all good intentions will probably spend us into an even bigger hole.  Then the ONLY thing you can do is raise taxes.
Will ANY Republican be brave enough in the next years to say "Enough" with the budget deficit and debt, and do what it takes to lower it, including decreasing pork, decreasing tax loopholes for the rich and corporations and, yes, asking Americans to pay slightly higher taxes till it's better?
They'd better if they ever want to see the inside of the White House again.

No fu#king way! No matter what blacks say about whites being racists, they voted for Obama because he is 1/2 black. You can listen to their "reasons" all you want, and they will say generic sh!t like "I like his policies" or "he will be good for America", but if you ask what do you like about his policies or how will he be good for America, they are stumped!



You will hear it for weeks how now we have a "black president". Who is the racist and so focused on race?!?!? There has never been a group more hypocritical!!!!!

What a stunning response this young lady picked for the best answer. Blacks have come along way! Trust me if Obama was as much of an a$%hole that Mccain was... he would not have gotten this far... Victory has been declared... Its time for our nation to heal!

I voted for McCain in 2000.  I like his policies on immigration- they are so good I'm surprised conservatives like him.



However after 9-11 he did little to speak out against the false pretexts for sending our brothers and sisters at arms to their deaths. A clear case of war profiteering.



After being a part of the problem (Bush Administration) it was Colin Powell who finally spoke out- and gained the respect of Americans from both parties.  He became the man I thought McCain was.

I don't have a problem with either McCain or Obama.



I do have a problem with is the new thinking "vote for the person who looks like you".  For example, blacks voting for the black guy, women voting for the women, old white grandpas voting for the old white grandpa, and if there was a hispanic candidate you can bet the hispanics would be voting for him.



We should vote for person with the best policies for the country.  Not vote for the person who shares your appearance.

Yes ,I did. I'm from the "baby boomer generation", and also a retired military vet. Other than the color of my skin, I felt I had more in common with McCain, as his views on the security of our country, and a lot of areas that Obama was and still is pretty vague about. I feel they both have "pipe dreams"about how to fix the economy. Every new candidate says they are going to bring about change, but the voters don't always realize it could be a change for the worse.



Anyway, the election is finally over with, and McCain gave a very gracious speech. I hope Obama and McCain really work well together in these next few years putting side partisan politics for the betterment of our country's problems.

If you are asking this question, it tells me that you are thinking people voted because of Obama's color of skin??? That is very sad that, if that is true,that American people aren't more intelligient than that.  A Presidential candidate should NEVER be voted  for what they look like or what gender they are, but what their vision is for our country.  Every American or generations before had to overcome diversity to get to where they wanted to be, so it is shouldn't be about the color of Mr. Obama's skin or Mr. McCain's age or what their wives are wearing. But I know that some people are so caught up in that it's how they end up making their decisions. It's okay that Mr. Obama was elected and I feel that way not because he is Black and that he will be the FIRST African American person in the White House....I don't even think that should be mentioned.  He is a person, a human being and an American who campaigned because he had enough money to do so and he won. Good for him.  John McCain had a good try; he can be proud of himself for doing all he has done in his life.

They are out there, but I don't know any of them. Everyone I know voted for Obama. But there are some who sincerely wanted McCain to win. Not everyone is saying "Yay Obama is Black." I know I voted for Obama. But for deeper reasons than color.

Don't kid yourself, there are any number of black conservatives who are well beyond the "gimme" of the past fifty years. And infuriating as it is to the liberals the number is steadily growing. If you studied both sides of the issues you'd know that.

Does anyone still want to know why blacks didn't support him ?

No, because usually bi-racial people tend to identify more with one side of their heritage than the other and for Obama that seems like his black side. So he's either the first black or the first biracial president.

No one can change it now.  All of you who are suggesting other's being angry b/c their party didn't win....Aren't you being racist?  Your party is no better than the other.

Why is there so much stupidity being "asked" this morning?



If I see one more "Are we all going to hell in a hand basket now that Obama will be President" question, I'm gonna flip out.  I didn't personally vote for Obama, but far be it of me to condemn this man before he's ever even taken office.  Perhaps he'll be the greatest President we've ever had.  Perhaps he'll screw things up.  Who knows?  I don't see any point in sitting around whining, bitching and complaining about it though.  The United States of America chose him as President.  Get over it!



Anyone else with me on this one or did I just wake up on the wrong side of the bed?

I'll just go with History.The last time we Elected someone with ideas as idiotic,and very similar to Obama's was Jimmy Carter.



The Result? Double Digit Inflation,Double Digit Unemployment,A gutted and toothless Military,Gas Prices that made $100 a barrel Oil look like a bargain when adjusted for inflation.



Basically the man nearly ruined the Country.



So far the Dems already plan Higher Taxes(On everyone,believe otherwise if you're an idiot) And even if they only Taxed those "Evil Rich People" more,guess who pays it?You! One way or the other.Either your Job is eliminated to make up the difference,your wages stay stagnant,or you pay more for everything you need.In the end you will get burned by higher taxes,no way around it.



And of course the Dems are already planning severe curtailments of Free Speech,all the better to help keep them in control of the Media,in order to stay in Power longer,so get ready for the long version of them destroying the Country.



His absolute disregard for Human Life is just repugnant,what more can I say on that.It's one thing to be Pro-Abortion,but the guy is on the record fighting against protecting a child even after it's born.Infanticide,seriously,what a cretin.



Basically I consider this possibly the Darkest Day in America in my lifetime.I see no other way to look at it.But at least Americans proved that whole "dumbing down of America" thing worked,with flying colors!

I didn't not vote for him, either. But I'm curious to see if the world may be a little different now that there is a change in race in the White House?  Are we really going to see who is racist and who is not?  I pray that the things I have heard NEVER happen, such as "Obama will never make it through the inauguration, he'll be assassinated first" which is a HORRIBLE thing to almost PLAN AHEAD!



It was voted upon and agreed... let it be.

As a staunch conservative I was not happy that Senator Obama won.  My original intent was to come out today with the Conservative Resistance Movement and be as small minded, victrolic, acidic, and down right untruthful as the democrats were after the 2000 election.  the "Bush is not my president mentality".  Then, I realized in that, I was wrong.  I will take a long view here and wait and see what our new president brings.  He has the opportunity to show the nation that he is capable of leadership--to be a true leader he will have to fight his own party on excessive agenda items.  The opportunity is here for him to truly live up to ideals and govern for us all.  If he's a good president--I'll support him--if he shows himself to be a bad president--well--the democrats thought they were mean spirited nasty and victrolic in the last eight years--you haven't seen anything yet.

I am not furious that he won.  Why are some people so set on the fury and anger part of the human nature.  I am concerned.  During his tenure he allocated over $18 billion to ACORN and he voted against things he says he is for during his seat.  I am just very concerned.  I am not sure if he voted the way he did because he was a young member and felt that he had to appease his seniors, not unlike what happens in corporate America - however - this concerns me.  I am just worried about the state of our country and while I was a McCain supporter, I would have still been concerned if he had won.  Our country is in a mess, and VOTE FOR CHANGE slogans are not enough to comfort me.  The Democratic party lifted protective rules that had been put into place after the last depression, the Democratic party has held the majority for many years in the Senate and House, the last word does not stop with the President.  I can't stand Bush....however the crisis our country is in is predominately in my opinion the Democratic parties fault.



Additionally, I will pray that he has the foresight to lead us out of the mess that we are in.  Pray that our country will remain a democracy and that he will stay safe in his position.  Despite all of my reservations about his leadership of our country - I have a great amount of respect for him as a brave man.

What is your issue with Barack Obama?



Why so much disgust?



This man hasn't failed in anything he has set out to do.



He is extremely intelligent.



He and his wife both seem to have genuine care for people and trying to make the US a better place to live.
She will be a wonderful First Lady.
He speaks as though he was born to do this.
He is completely opposite of G. W.  and exactly what we need!!



He would never even have considered putting a "Sarah Palin" on his ticket.



So what exactly is all the whining about?  Can we really get any worse that where we are?  The fact that he has not been tainted by years and years of being in politics could be a great thing for us!



Why not give the man a chance?

I think people want more of the same.  Ignorant people are full of fear because they don't understand anything and they like to be lied to.  Poor people that voted for McCain are ignorant.  The rich people just like the tax breaks and widening the income bracket.  McCain actually thought middle class was people who make $250,000 a year.  I don't know anyone who makes that.
Sorry, I know you wanted to hear from people who have a problem with President Elect Obama,

You are completely delusional.  Where have you been the past few months?  Not listening evidentally!  He is going to raise your taxes!  His wife is not fit to be first lady.  He has been in politics for years, in Chicago, the worst political machine in the country.  They do no care about us.  Sarah Palin can govern circles around him and his VP.  And last of all, you will see how much worse off we can get.  You can take all this to the bank - if there are any left in 4 years.

Everyone supports him except a handful of Republicans. They are some of the most stubborn people I've ever dealt with.



I love how they look into the future and see how bad Obama is going to do in office, or threaten to leave in the truckloads just like the Democrats did when Bush was elected. Then they laugh at how pitiful they were then and they are doing the same very thing now.



One thing that really really ticks me off though is when Republicans can set there and be pessimists about Obama and how bad he is, when they won't even acknowledge right now our country is in bad shape from 8+ years of Republican mistakes.



I know both parties can do this, but at least the Democrats can admit when they have been wrong and that' something the Republicans can never do.



EDIT: Funny, people are scared of Socialism. When Bush and his administration just started the first steps to Communism. But nobody will acknowledge that. Its also funny that the Socialist economies in europe all have better health care, education, less poverty, and WAY WAY WAY WAY WAAAAAAAY higher standards of living then we do. Also like to add the best president we've ever had was Democratic, had Socialist economic ideas and was elected, 4 times in a row. You people need to get a book, and learn something before act as if you know what Socialism is, because obviously none of you DONT.

Your comments indicate that you are most likely fairly young and haven't lived long enough to see what a liberal President along with a liberal majority Congress are likely to do.



Okay, he's won it.  If he does everything he promised to do I suspect you won't be nearly as happy four years from now.



For example:



The following is a narrative taken from Sunday Morning's televised 'Meet The Press' and the author is employed by none other than the Washington Post!!



Senator Obama was asked about his stance on the American Flag.



Obama Explains National Anthem Stance Sun, 07 Sept. 2008 11:48:04 EST.



General Bill Ginn' USAF (ret.) asked Obama to explain why he doesn't follow protocol when the National Anthem is played. The General also stated to the Senator that according to the United States Code, Title 36, Chapter 10, Sec. 171... During rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present except those in uniform are expected to stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. At the very least, 'Stand and Face It.'



Senator Obama Live on Sunday stated:  "As I've said about the flag pin, I don't want to be perceived as taking sides," Obama said. "There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression, and the anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all.  It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose.  I like the song 'I'd Like To Teach the World To Sing.'  If that were our anthem, then I might salute it.  We should consider to reinvent our National Anthem as well as to redesign our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and love.  It's my intention, if elected, to disarm America to the level of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren.  If we as a Nation of warring people, should conduct ourselves as the nations of Islam, whereas peace prevails.  Perhaps a state or period of mutual concord between our governments.  When I become President, I will seek a pact or agreement to end hostilities between those who have been at war or in a state of enmity, and a freedom from disquieting oppressive thoughts.  We as a Nation have placed upon the nations of Islam an unfair injustice. My wife disrespects the Flag for many personal reasons. Together she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past, many years ago. She has her views and I have mine. Of course now, I have found myself about to become the President of the United States and I have put aside my hatred. I will use my power to bring CHANGE to this Nation, and offer the people a new path of hope.  My wife and I look forward to becoming our Country's First Family.  Indeed, CHANGE is about to overwhelm the United States of America."



Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you heard it right. This could possibly be our next President.  I, for one, am speechless.

Biden has been in  politics for years. Wouldn't he affect Obama since he's now going to be the new VP.  Yes, I do believe that America could be worse in the long with him as president. His issues are socialistic. I would have chosen someone with a few extra years experience and with one or two issues at least that I could agree with. Sorry to say it, but America is doomed.

Because I believe the only reason he won was because 95% of blacks voted for him and a lot of latinos voted for him. And I also think that everyone just jumped to the conclusion that because McCain voted like Bush, he would be like him. Obama wants to raise taxes on the rich and give it to the poor, but they don't earn it. They just get it! That isn't fair to me. And he wants to raise business tax, making businesses pay more, and that will lead to workers getting laid off.

Some people are genuinly scared this black man is going to be one of the greatest president's ever.
It's also understandable some are jealous of this charasmitic and intelligent black man.
Also, many are set in their ways and not used to seeing hope and change.
They're used to uninspired dull liars.

As a full right wing conservative I will say I will respect his position as our future president for the years to come, and I would salute him due to the respect I give his office. But I have to say, being the person that Barack Obama is I have very little too no respect for him as a human being and I'd rather be divided from his ideology then united by it.

Bush DROVE this country into the ground. We are in billions of dollars of debt thanks to him. We are in 2 wars, one of which we shouldn't be in. WE HAVEN'T EVEN CAPTURED OSAMA BIN LADEN THE MAN RESPONSIBLE FOR SEPTEMBER 11th. He and Cheney are only making money for themselves off of their oil.We have horrible health care plans. THE ECONOMY IS SCREWED. MEANWHILE They're helping there friends by giving the highest 2% tax breaks and when CLINTON left office HE LEFT US WITH the lowest unemployment rate in modern times, the lowest inflation in 30 years, the highest home ownership in the country's history, dropping crime rates in many places, and reduced welfare rolls. He proposed the first balanced budget in decades and achieved a budget surplus. and Bush goes and screws this country.



since McCain Voted with Bush over 90% of the time, and it is the Republicans that screwed us. WE as a NATION voted for OBAMA. and you better respect our president cos i hated Bush but i never said or did anything disrespectful because he was the president of the world's most powerful and beautiful nation.



&&. McCain was such a flipfloper. we didn't need him. correction we DON'T need him.

he also outsourced everything to freakin CHINA! We lost so many jobs to BUSH. i think he will go down as the worst president in history and that OBAMA will be one of the best.

A sad day in history!!!!!?



Yesterday the american citizens chose to elect the most inexperienced presidential candidate in the history of our country.



How long will it take for the American people to realize they were wrong, and how much blame will they accept for it.

Now that the Democrats rule the house, senate and the oval office, what will they do?



They should be able to pass every bit of legislation they've ever wanted, abortion on demand, gay marriage, gun control.  And the economy is all in their hands.  I'm sure they'll take credit if it succeeds, but if they fail, they will have no one to blame but themselves!



</question>



<additional details>



Well, I hope they will restore the economy, and gas prices are low right now, so we'll see if that stays or if they go sky high again.  But restore America to the way it was?  Not likely, we'll be a much more liberal america.

Exactly.



Considering their records, they'll spend a lot and raise taxes for everyone.



The only good outcome is that in 4 years people will realize that they need fiscal conservatives and turn to the Republicans to clean up the mess.

Oprah is not a great political mind.



In the exit polls the people who voted for McCain said it was a positive the people who voted for Obama said it wasn't an issue overwhelmingly, so no I don't think it was a negative factor.

Probably not, even though the media made Palin look like a complete fool.
Too many people voted for Obama (yes and McCain) for the wrong reasons.  Most of those who voted for shallow reasons voted for Obama.  So the only thing that could have saved McCain would have been education but we lack in that aspect so...

He could have won if a lot of things had been different. If he'd made speeches like he did last night a lot of people would have changed their vote. If Palin hadn't F-d up her interviews he would have done better. If Bush hadn't done such a bad job, people wouldn't have been gun-shy when it comes to voting in another Republican.

Sarah Palin would have been fine were she better prepared intellectually to take on Hillary Clinton, since it was her vote she was after and didn't get.



What did for John McCain in the end was the collapse of the house of cards that was Free Market casino-style economics.  The correct policy of massive State intervention was just too implausible a flip-flop for any Republican following Reagan and Bush, and McCain paid for it.



And credit must go too to Barack Obama.  He was no John Kerry or Walter Mondale or Michael Dukakis.



And if Obama's experience and knowledge in world affairs does not match his charisma, well there is a sympathetic wise old Republican senator waiting in the wings to provide the President with what is needed, a good friend of the new Vice-President, and sufficiently distanced from George W Bush.



I doubt John McCain has given up quite yet.

I believe that it is an historic accomplishment that America has elected a man with African heritage.  Maybe now this country will begin to end their obsession with race and actually move forward.



I do not, however, believe that Obama was the right choice for America (in a political sense).  Obama is against the very principles this nation was founded upon.



I am willing to give Obama a chance to earn my respect - however, I am very skeptical that he will be able to fulfill the highly rhetorical promises he made to the public during his campaign.

Wow, so we elected a bi-racial president. It's a stepping stone but by no means a huge step. What he does the next 4 years will define things. I would wait until the next 3 years are over to start forming on opinion on him. Right now, reality says he can still screw a lot of things up and go back on many of his promises. Like every president before him. Just electing someone that's bi-racial doesn't make the U.S. some sort of Utopia now. People really need to get back into reality.

Yes, I couldn't help but to think about all the black people who have endured so much racial hatred. I thought about the civil rights movements from the 50's & 60's and the people I know who on a local level in my community lived through that time and fought and protested for equality. I thought about all those people who worked so hard just get the right to vote just a short 40 years ago and how much things have changed. I am happy that many of them did get to live to see all their hard work paid off.

Some of the "greedy rich people" work hard for their money and spend it wisely. That's why they are rich. Maybe instead of taking money from them we should teach everyone else how to work hard to earn their own money, then budget, save, and use their money wisely. Just a thought.

Only GOP people for this question.?



Now that Obama has won. Should we not all realize that we need to have better sense when both picking a candidate and then standing directly behind him. If it were not for Palin who added conservative values to the ticket Obama would have won by even more.



Plus, we need to crack down on voter fraud next election. That was why Obama won.

100% with you on this one.  I want to be more involved next time I didn't realize how organized and how many volunteers Obama had.  We, the GOP, need to do that in the next election.  Door to door and phone calls in the weeks leading up to the election not just the last 96 hours.  We need to be as involved or more so than Obama supporters in 4 years.

As someone whose enthusiasm for McCain only developed after he picked Palin, I agree.  I remember back in the primaries wondering why he won and became the candidate.  My state (WI) was so late that it almost didn't matter if I voted or not.  I hate the whole system, there were better candidates.

Hey, tit for tat. Bush stole two elections - Obama gets a free-bee! lol



Another HUGE reason for the upset - McCain is like 300 years old. He probably wouldn't make it through four years of presidency. Then that would leave airhead caribou barbie in charge. Something awefully scary about a pre-menopausal woman with a rifle in charge of the largest army in the world. I see visions of invading the North Pole when I look at her.

When he raises taxes on people making more than $42,000 a year.  When he pulls the troops out of Iraq and it is followed by a bloodbath.  When it comes out just how close a friend Bill Ayers is.  When he goes back to his racist church.  When he grants amnesty to all the illegals in this country.  When he gives federal dollars to ACORN to pay them for registering all those fictitious people.  I could go on but I won't.  I think the majority of the people in this country have made a huge mistake and I think we will all be paying for it for a long long time.

Possibly. It would have depended on the Chinese-American Republican guy's age, experience, platform, and ability to mobilize large demographics in this country. Obviously race and ideology only had SOME effect on what happened yesterday. There's so much more to it. But there are a lot of "what ifs" the day after the election.

You miss the whole point. President Obama won because of his vision and leadership. His campaign has never been about race. However, if his opponent were to be another minority, then it would force a small portion of voters to start looking at issues, instead of the color.

That's a hard one.. it all depends. to be honest because Obama is now president I would probably say Obama however, there is a strong possibility that the chinese would have won because people who are racists would always go with the lighter shade. I think that most racists people is allergic to black skin.  Someone here yesterday said that they hate Obama. Why would someone hate him if they don't even know him? Duh!!

The electoral college needs to be scrapped. How is it that 52% of the popular vote is equal to 70% of the electoral college votes ? Why does the "weight " of a person's vote vary according to where they live ?
It certainly doesn't benefit the average citizen.

Why is there so much attention placed on our president-elect Barack Obama's race?



He's been nominated to be our next president.  What he intends to do, his philosophy, his leadership is more important than the color of his skin, eyes, or hair.



</question>

I realize this is history in the making.  Everything he does will be part of history.  When will people be able to see beyond race and the color of his eyes, hair, and/or skin?

I have been thinking that same exact thought for awhile now.
Like you said, I understand this is history in the making, as well as would be if there was to be a woman president, but besides race or gender, it doesnt mean (or Shouldnt mean) anything.
If not these next 4 yrs than the 4 after that we are bound to add Some diversity to our presidency. I am not sure what the ratio of caucassion to mixed, black or hispanic etc there is, but I'm glad a majority of people can accept a change. I know I was voting for him!

I actually believe that Obama will face LESS threats than his predecessors. The threats against Obama will come from racist hate-mongers in this country. it is likely the threats from international hate mongers will decrease as a more rational approach to military use and effective use of our strengths will create less hate and anger. Notice i didn't say ALL, just less.

white people who voted for obama seem happy that black people can now feel proud



yet alot of mccain supports are still hatin



but i figure since more white people voted for obama then they did for mccain then maybe this could be the beginning of a new chapter in history where nobody gets held back because of race and help one another

That's never going to happen. Blacks and whites will never be close. Blacks are too hung up on the mistreatment of their ANCESTORS. Seriously, when I see a black person, I get dirty looks. Whites are not the most racist ones any more. I have few black friends. They are people I work with. Not because I dislike them, because they dislike me. And now they will think they have more power just because the president is black.

I don't think it will make them closer there are too many idiots in this world that still see color first.  I just hope people didn't vote for him based on the color of his skin but rather for what he wants to do for this country.

This IS one of the most historical moments in American History.  No one will be able to escape the unity that this moment brings to, not just our country, but the whole world.  We will remember this moment not just as white and black people but as human beings.
This is certainly a new chapter... one which I am proud to be a part of. .

I think it makes the barrier between us much larger, because I dont mean to sound racist but I mean this IS America, and we ARE surposed to be white, so why do we have a black president?



I think it makes the whites feel like American doesnt revolve around them anymore, its around the black population, well its not



America was built by white people, and I think we should have one as president.

I think the only way race relations are going to change will be if individuals change their thinking.  Change the way they look at color and get to the root of any hate held for those of a certain race, be it white, black, or whatever.  If you don't find out why and where the hate or prejudice comes from, you will never be able to get over it.

It isn't just race that divides us. There is still a gender bias, with men making more than women for doing the same job. There is prejudice for religion, sexual orientation, age, you name it. Any way that one person is different than another can be used for discrimination, and that will probably never change. People have always discriminated against other people that are different from themselves. I think it's a lot better now than it has ever been, because we bring it into the light, and fair minded people speak out against it when they see it.

I am a McCain supporter and I was never "hatin" as you so eloquently stated.  It had nothing to do with the color of Barack Hussein Obama's skin.  It had to do with his associations.  He could have been white and I would still not like him.  William Ayers is white and I can't stand that man... he's a TERRORIST!!!!  Oh, and he's good friends with BARACK HUSSEIN OBAMA!



You need to remember that we all watched as Saddam Hussein was hanged for his murderous/terroristic crimes.  Now, we have a new president with the same name and ties.. HUSSEIN!

Secretary of Defense John McCain - is it possible?



Could we see Obama reach across party lines and appoint McCain to such a position? And if so would McCain give up his Senate seat and accept this? I would like to see it.



I know alot of people are expecting that to go to Colin Powell-and i too think this would be a good choice and still reaching across party lines as Powell is somewhat a republican himself. But on the other hand it seems Powell is done with the political scene.

I hope it goes to Powell. I think McCain shoots from the lip to fast and loose for this position. Looking at his campaign as an example, he said many things that if he had thought about it he would not have said. After something is said it is hard to take back. Powell would be a much better fit for this position.

Obama is not going to choose McCain for any position.



The trick here is to look at _who_ Obama has chosen for key positions in the past.



Obama has consistently chosen democratic party loyalists as his key advisers.  So we can expect that his cabinet will be filled with people whose primary qualification is party loyalty.

Bubba your an idiot. Victory has been achieved in Iraq. I was there when it was at its worst. I have friends there now who have informed me of the drastic changes that have taken place. When we handed over the Al Anbar province to Iraq, that was a historic day. Of course the media did not portray it that way but some of the most insurgent infested cities are in the Anbar province, Fallujah and Ramadi for example. The fact that the Iraqi Army and Iraqi police are able to control those areas is a victory in itself. The victory in Iraq is not a simple we won the war because that's not the victory we are looking for. The victory in Iraq is one that comes in phases. The end of Saddam's regime is one, the day that Iraqi citizens of both genders could come out to vote for the candidate of their choosing is another, the Iraqi military taking over tha Al Anbar province is another, and the eventual creation of an Iraqi Airforce that will allow them to defend themselves from the constant threat of a Syrian and/or Iranian invasion. Those are victories and if you are to blind to see the progress being made then you just don't want to see progress. You want us to fail, you want the deaths of my fellow service members to be in vain. That is your right to feel that way but I hope that people who hold an opinion like yourself are the minority. I too would like to see  John McCain as secretary of defense. I feel it is a position that is more relevant to his skills and experience than the presidency was. It would also make me feel a little better about serving under President Obama

Do you think the property value will go down on the white house when the Obama family moves in?  ?



A year ago we had two afro American families move into our neighborhood, we of coarse moved and sold our house immediately only to find that the value dropped because of it.

This guy is obviously making a joke and you are all falling for it. Why is it that a white guy makes a joke about a black guy he is  labeled a racist and a black guy make a joke about a white guy and he's considered clever and humorist. This country is so divided...lol

Colour of one's skin is never an issue, it's the person inside that's the issue.  Racism is one of the bad traits of Americans.



I think history was made today because "the black Issue" wasn't the only reason Obama won.



I think USA needed a change of direction and the Democrats offered that change.



Having a black USA President is wonderful as it shows that enough Americans showed that skin colour isn't important.



Martin Luther King's Freedom speech should be listened to at this time in history.

I think the disasta from Alaska was a big part of the reason that McCain lost. If he had picked Romney, I think we would have had a real horse race. If the Republicans choose her to help lead their party, the will be ever so much easier to beat at the polls. So here's hoping!

Where can I buy a Sean Hannity T-shirt?

I'm going to look forward to watching Hannity beat up Obama.
Also for the first time in my life I'm starting to worship the confederate flag.  It is amazing what this Obama victory has changed me.  Me wanting to buy a confederate flag!  I want one!

Here we go again. Even if I told you why I voted it wouldn't matter because everyone is different. You have some Black people that may have voted for him based on race but if you was Black I think you would understand more. The first Black or mixed President use to be just a dream for America.

Another thing John McCain wouldn't have gotten my vote anyway because he really don't care about ALL Americans and that's the honest truth. If he did he wouldn't have said back in 2000 that he hates Asians. In his own words "I hate the Gooks and will forever hate the Gooks."Asians are Americans too.

Even though many of the black voters that were interviewed said that they voted the issues.  Thay also said that they wanted to take this time to vote for "one of their own".  You can't have it both ways.  I would say race had some impact, but blacks normally vote 80% Dem, so not that big a diff.

I think is says that Americans understand the difference between the past and future and that we value moving forward and are not afraid to take risks.  McCain is a great America with an awesome sense of humor but his experience was in a world long gone.  We need to sever ourselves from our selfish, arrogant past and move forward in a way that will keep the world on our side.  I have no doubt Obama is the man for the job.  I see his mixed race as a super plus, since it allows him to move comfortably between different circles in America and in the world.  He is intelligent, charismatic, sensitive and real.  He has the potential to bring us all together.  Go OBAMA!!

I can only pray we can unite together at the seams in which we have separated. As Obama said, Lincoln was faced with a more divided nation and managed to get us together. He is willing to earn the respect of those who did not vote for him. I hope we can all come together as Americans - whether demorcrats or republicans and just solve the issues vexing the USA today.

We voted an arab into the presidency ONLY because he looks black. Sad reason. This country would have voted for Gomer Pile if he was black. Sympathy votes aren't anything to be proud of.

Joe the Plumber turned out to be a liability, not an asset to McCain.  Once it was found out that he owed back taxes of $1,200 and didn't even have a plumber's license, that ended that little debacle.  It was just one of many mistakes the McCain camp made.  Still not as bad as picking Sarah Palin as the first VP choice.  Wow, that really did them in.



Since there is a lot of working class people in Ohio, they have been really hurt in this economy, which turned into the #1 issue real quickly in the last few months.  When voting for a new President, they are naturally going to look at the existing President (Bush, even if it isn't his fault), and decide if things are going well for them.  Obviously, we see how powerful an issue a bad economy can be.

Because Bush's failed economic policies have cost many Ohioans their jobs. A lot of the factories that provided middle class Ohio with a base moved overseas thanks to Bush's outrageous open trade policies. Also, Ohio has been one of the hardest hit areas as far as foreclosures go. Couple those things with the rise in energy prices and McCain's lack of getting the evangelical base in Ohio to rally behind him and there was no way that Ohio was going to be red.



But it wasn't just Ohio that those principles helped get Obama elected. Michigan, Iowa, and Minnesota were all he same way. I can also remember McCain going to those states earlier and telling the voters to wake up and realize that their jobs were not coming back and it was time they found some other type of employment.

Simply put they brought judgment upon themselves for supporting Obama.  The Republicans did the right thing to highlight what his policies were through Joe.



They were trying to highlight the real issues by using a symbolic representation to show what Obama could do.



I do not agree with your position.

I think what they mean by that is that there isn't any Republican that has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio. Some Democrats presidents did. But no Republican ever became  President without winning Ohio.

Do you think many republicans are as much sore losers as the democrats were in the past two presidential-?



elections?



I remember when Bush won in 2000, many Democrats cried "unfair" and "election fraud" and in 2004 I remember many Democrats were so in shock that Bush won a second term, many declared they would leave the nation and at least one report out of New York hit the news that a man committed suicide over the election results. Democrats were upset, outraged, and just really sore losers. But the Republicans all kept saying, "deal with it" and "if you don't like it leave" and "he is our president now and deserves your patriotic support". Now, the tables have turned. Is it time to address the many Republicans who voted McCain with the same smug sense of superiority? Are the Republicans feeling the burn? Have they become the sore losers the Democrats have been in the past?

Why am I being called a racist?



Just because I think obama is the worst thing to happen to this country? So you all clump us together, So you can also say that most people voted for him because they were afraid of being called racist. racism is what you make it. Blacks are the most racist people in this country. They live for the word racism. It has gotton most of them out of trouble because they use it like peanut butter. When thing don't go their way, they yell racism
I am racist. I am racist against ignorance and just plain stupidity. Color has nothing to do with it. But for this Election. (IF) you had put some one with experience like say ( POWELL) I sure would have voted for him. But because you chose to elect someone who has no experience or strength to run this greatest Country=== Then I guess you can consider me a racist!

Saying Obama is the 'worst thing to happen to this country' is questionable though. Considering the damage Bush-Cheney-Rove did to our constitution, economy and world image - then maybe you are a racist.

You can't be racist against stupidity. That makes no sense. Look, i don't care whether you're a racist or not, because racism is never personal. But when you make the comment "blacks are the most racist people in this country," you don't show racial prejudice, you just show your own ignorance to how many African Americans you have personally known in your life.

Did Palin detract largely from McCain's campaign?



I almost felt half bad for McCain and Palin during the speech after McCain conceded, it looked like they were trying really hard to tough it out and not bawl, lol. Although I am a Democrat, I have nothing but respect for their effort. But getting into the reasons why McCain didn't get it- Do you think Palin was about half of it? If I was an undecided voter yesterday, I'd have for sure taken that into consideration. No disrespect intended, I'm just wondering. In my opinion, Palin definitely wasn't the right woman for the job, and she unfortunately was a huge detraction from McCain's campaign. What do you think? What are some other reasons why McCain didn't fare too well? (Please keep comments graceful and respectful of both parties.)

I have to disagree, Palin was a very good choice because she united the conservative base of the party. However, old school GOP handlers tried to control both of them causing confusion and anger which makes it uncomfortable.

Not at all.
Governor Palin was the only person for whom Senator McCain could have run with.  If the focus had been maintained on energy, she would have done brilliantly.  However, they both let themselves get off of that message, and once they did that, it was downhill from there.

He made an idiotic decision in choosing Palin, and has been stuck with the results. Now he'll never get another shot, and has probably realized what he's done to America's long term future by positioning Palin for future presidential tries.

1st - I voted Obama



2nd - I respect McCain and can live with myself had he won.



3rd - Palin is a nitwit and McCain chosing her is what decided it for me.  If that is the type of decision maker he is, to pluck some governor without an ounce of national experience out of Alaska, I don't want him running my country.  Plain and Simple.



4th - Other factors that made me keep my distance from McCain:  Abortion - We cannot have a bunch of old men on the bench making decision for women.  Even if in your opinion the choice is wrong...it's still their choice, not yours.  Gay Marriage - Why can't we accept it?  God has no place in Gov't.  Gay marriage exists and we're all still alive as a result.  Time to relax.  The War - Completely misguided.  To stay there for 100 years if we have to to get the job done is idiotic.  We are blowing 10 Billion dollars of borrowed money each month and guess who has to pay that back, you guessed it...us.  The Bush Legacy - Let's face it...Bush has put a sour taste in everyone's mouth.  The thought of putting a republican in the white house for a third straight term makes me ill.  Especially a republican who shares the same views and policies that have been driving this country bankrupt and into the ground for the past eight years.

Not largely per se, but I definitely think she had a little something to do with all the voters who were undecided. I was an Obama supporter all along, but I am by no means anti-McCain. I thought he had some good ideas and I think that no matter who won, it would have been much better than George W. Bush. However, I think almost anyone (Republican or Democrat) would agree that out of the Vice Presidential picks, Joe Biden is much more experienced and appropriate for the job. In the slight change (for either party) that the VP may have to step up, I think the idea that it could be Sarah Palin scared a lot of people away from McCain. Regardless of how experienced or great McCain is, Sarah Palin does not have the credentials or experience to be VP or potentially President of the United States.

Black Man Given Nation's Worst Job



NOVEMBER 5, 2008 | ISSUE 44•45



WASHINGTON—African-American man Barack Obama, 47, was given the least-desirable job in the entire country Tuesday when he was elected president of the United States of America. In his new high-stress, low-reward position, Obama will be charged with such tasks as completely overhauling the nation's broken-down economy, repairing the crumbling infrastructure, and generally having to please more than 300 million Americans and cater to their every whim on a daily basis. As part of his duties, the black man will have to spend four to eight years cleaning up the messes other people left behind. The job comes with such intense scrutiny and so certain a guarantee of failure that only one other person even bothered applying for it. Said scholar and activist Mark L. Denton, "It just goes to show you that, in this country, a black man still can't catch a break."

Black President/Historic Occasion?



Why, if President Elect Obama's being "black" is not an issue/consideration, is this such a Historical election?



Everyone is saying - this is the most important election or we have taken such great strides as a country or i never thought i would see a black man elected in my lifetime..... that's all fine and good but then what i don't understand is - why are people saying it's not about race?!  While i would hope people didn't vote for or against JUST because of his ethnic heritage - his heritage (aka being a black man) IS what is making this historical.



So....



if the historical occasion isn't because we have a "black man" or African American as the President elect - what's so historical about the election?
OR
if the historical occasion IS about his being a black man - what's wrong with that?!?  i'm a Polish Catholic and remember being over joyed when we had our first Polish Pope.....

How will Obama ruin this country?



Our economy is already the worst it has every been since the great depression. Mccain is planing on keeping Bush's plan, and Bush's plan is not working at all. If anyone is going to ruin us it will be Mccain. But it doesn't matter anymore because Obama has won the election. So how would he ruin the economy? Please explain.

The economy should be as good as it was with Clinton in office.  You probably don't remember that do you.  Jobs were plentiful, we had a surplus in our National budget.

larger taxes for Corporations. Corporations do not care about the people neither do the government if they tax them. If you tax all bread products $10.00 who will pay the taxes? the corp. or the consumers of the bread? Consumers of the bread. The people who buy it will pay the taxes. Do cigarette manufacturers pay the sin taxes or the consumers? The consumers. So as we are voting for another tax increase on the evil business, realize you are voting for another tax increase on consumers of bread or other products. Most are Middle and lower classes. At least 95% as Obama says. Evil corporations or stupid electorate.

The economic crisis was caused by Democrats like Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) and Reps. Kennedy and Waters allied with the Clinton administration to broaden the acceptability of risky subprime loans throughout the financial system, thus precipitating our current crisis.  John McCain tried to convince congress there was a problem looming but was largely ignored.



Unless there are big changes to loan qualifications the problem will not get fixed.

ok guys. the day has come and obama won. a lot of people are happy and a lot of people are angry. but what it comes down to is that barack obama is our nations leader.



who agrees with me that we should all show our respect to this country and to our new leader. mccain said himself that we must all participate and show respect whether we like the outcome or not. as true american citizens, i believe we should ALL participate in helping this country. you may not like obama...but he won. so are you going to work with the rest of the country...or are you going to be one of the people going against the tide?



please everyone....show your respect for the final decision. if we want the country to get better. we must ALL cooperate and be willing to assist in any way possible. in this sense, america will get better.



</question>



<additional details>



this is a fresh start. obama didnt "mess up"....at least yet. bush messed up big time and that is why he was bashed. i am not saying that it is accpetable. but it is more understood. this is a fresh new beginning and everyone should participate in helping. i am not saying "go with the flow" or "believe in everything obama says bc its patriotic" i am saying dont purposely hold back bc you are bitter. there are many things that will help this country. mccain said to support him..and if you are a mccain supporter...then please support that. to the few who tried to go against my statement...i am very right. and there is no denying that--only the defiant and stubborn would hoenstly try to disagree. and those people are the people i am afraid of. it is those people who will try to hold this progress back.

I am a republican and was a staunch McCain supporter. I still don't agree with most of Obama's policies and am nervous about the future of our country. However, I do feel that since he will be the president, we do need to wish him well and pray that God will watch over him and guide him to do what is best for this country. Hatred and anger will do nothing to help this country over the next 4 years, then, hopefully it will be a new ballgame!



Truth be told, though,the Bush administration did not create this economic mess. The root of this is the sub-prime housing market. The Clinton administration highly encouraged Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to give mortagages to pretty much anyone who wanted part of "the american dream" regardless of who could afford it. The Bush administration wanted to reform this in 2004, but it was haulted by a democratic congress.

Freedom to keep the money you earn - gets control of your own life.
Freedom of speech - keeps gov. in check.
Freedom of religion - self explainatory
Equality- Equality in chance of advancement.



Dems want to change freedom of religion by using hate speech in Churches.(anti-gay "The Bible is" but who would want churches to teach from the Bible?) This is also Freedom of speech issue. Freedom of speech - Dems want fairness doctrine. (When the fairness doctrine was in force all radio media would not touch political talk.) Dems want equality in what possessions you have not in the chance you have to earn those possessions. You will see the equality drum be being beaten for African Americans and the word "racist" still being slung aroud. These I will fight against. And democrats want to make corporations their tax collector. All taxes are paid by the consumers. Corporations just pass them along. Which is why corps. do not care about corp. taxes.

Ok so the election is OVER! Can WE the AMERICAN people stop bickering and going back and forth over a matter that is now done and over with?



To the McCain supporters: Please let it go! Obama won and is going to be the 44th President of OUR country! All of us need to support him because he is now OUR country's leader.



To the Obama supporters: The election is OVER! He won. There is no need for more ridiculous comments about how horrible a choice McCain was. Stop throwing dirt!

I got a great email forwarded to me this morning, I think it's pretty appropriate.



I don't know for sure if it was truly written by David Letterman but that is irrelevant, whoever wrote this had a valid point.



No matter what your political convictions are this is an eye



opener....What a thankless people we are!!!



David Letterman, on President Bush. (Surprising)



David Letterman wrote this; it's the David we don't often see....



'As most of you know I am not a President Bush fan, nor have I ever



been, but this is not about Bush, it is about us, as Americans, and



it seems to hit the mark.'
'The other day I was reading Newsweek magazine and came across some



Poll data I found rather hard to believe.  It must be true given



the source, right?
The Newsweek poll alleges that 67 percent of Americans are unhappy



with the direction the country is headed and 69 percent of  the



country is unhappy with the performance of the President. In



essence 2/3 of the citizenry just ain't happy and want a change. So



being the knuckle dragger I am, I started thinking, 'What are we so



unhappy about?'



A. Is it that we have electricity and running water 24 hours a day,



7 Days a week?



B. Is our unhappiness the result of having air conditioning in the



summer and heating in the winter?



C. Could it be that 95.4 percent of these unhappy folks have a job?



D. Maybe it is the ability to walk into a grocery store at any time



and see more food in moments than Darfur has seen in the last year?



E. Maybe it is the ability to drive our cars and trucks from the



Pacific Ocean to the  Atlantic Ocean  without having to present



identification papers as we move through each state.



F. Or possibly the hundreds of clean and safe motels we would find



along the way that can provide temporary shelter?



G. I guess having thousands of restaurants with varying cuisine



from around the world is just not good enough either.



H. Or could it be that when we wreck our car, emergency workers



show up and provide services to help all and even send a helicopter



to take you to the hospital.



I. Perhaps you are one of the 70 percent of Americans who own a home.



J. You may be upset with knowing that in the unfortunate case of a



fire, a group of trained firefighters will appear in moments and



use top notch equipment to extinguish the flames thus saving you,



your family, and your belongings.



K. Or if, while at home watching one of your many flat screen TVs,



a burglar or prowler intrudes, an officer equipped with a gun and a



bullet-proof vest will come to defend you and your family against



attack or loss.



L. This all in the backdrop of a neighborhood free of bombs or



militias raping and  pillaging the residents. Neighborhoods where



90% of teenagers own cell phones and computers.



M. How about the complete religious, social and political freedoms



we enjoy that are the envy of everyone in the world?



Maybe that is what has 67% of you folks unhappy.



Fact is, we are the largest group of ungrateful, spoiled brats the



world has ever seen. No wonder the world loves the  U.S.  , yet has



a great disdain for its citizens. They see us for what we are. The



most blessed people in the world who do nothing but complain about



what we don't have, and what we hate about the country instead of



thanking the good Lord we live here.



I know, I know. What about the president who took us into war and



has no plan to get us out? The president who has a measly 31



percent approval rating? Is this the same president who guided the



nation in the dark days after 9/11? The president that cut taxes to



bring an economy out of recession? Could this be the same guy who



has been called every name in the book for succeeding in keeping



all the spoiled ungrateful brats safe from terrorist attacks? The



commander in chief of an all-volunteer army that is out there



defending you and me?
Did you hear how bad the President is on the news or talk show? Did



this news affect you so much, make you so unhappy you couldn't take



a look around for yourself and see all the good things and be glad?



Think about it......are you upset at the President because he



actually caused you personal pain OR is it because the 'Media' told



you he was failing to kiss your sorry ungrateful behind every day.
Make no mistake about it. The troops in  Iraq  and  Afghanistan



have volunteered to serve, and in many cases may have died for your



freedom. There is currently no draft in this country. They didn't



have to go. They are able to refuse to go and end up with either a



''general'' discharge, an 'other than honorable'' discharge or,



worst case scenario, a ''dishonorable' discharge after a few days



in the brig.



So why then the flat-out discontentment in the minds of 69 percent



of Americans?

Obama has only 2 years left of his six year term as state senator.  the governor of illinois, a democrat, will select someone to fill those last two years.  In the case of Joe Biden, he was just  reelected to the senate in Rhode Island.  The governor of RI will select someone to fill his post for two years, and then a new early election will take place in 2010.

Black, Muslim, Man, or what have you he is  an American.  America is a country of, and about diversity.  So his father is Kenyan, and his mother is a woman from Kansas, it shouldn't matter.  We are a nation immigrants, a nation of young and old, a nation of many hues.  It is long past time where we should stop looking at what makes us different, and instead look at what makes us the same.  Do I care that Obama is an African-American? No. Do I care that his middle name is Hussien? No.  This election victory if anything proves that America can look beyond it's tarnished past and broken promises and see that is a country based on freedom and "Liberty and Justice for all."

Am I the only one who is sick of this color thing?



I am glad that Obama is our President Elect!! However I am sick of people saying he is going to change this country into something along the lines of being soley based upon the African American population. Black power, However you want to put it. People say that this is a victory of the African American community and none other. I don't get it? Obama is MIXED!! His mother is white his father is black. He was raised in a white household. This is a victory for AMERICA, I think. So, I guess my question is,  why are so many people all about black black black? Can anyone see beyond a tone of ones skin? Can people realize that Obama is half black and half white and that we are going to get no where if all people talk about is the color of someones skin.

Yah funny how Obamabots stressed how he was mixed up until he was elected then they all proclaimed the first Black rather than mulatto president.
Obama failed to get the 60 senate fillibuster proof votes.



The 5 conservative justices on the Supreme Court have publicly said they won't retire during an Obama presidency.



Obama will have a hard time getting anything done that he wants.

I have waited all my life to see this barrier broken. The people who claim that racism was solved twenty years ago needed to look at the ill-disguised hate and fear that was the sub-text of the Republican party.



Now we need an atheist as president, and a woman, and someone of Chinese descent. We've taken the first step. It's time to show the world that the rich white Christian men do not have the permanent monopoly on power in the USA.

I don't think the racism issue will ever be gone. The first thing I heard on the news this morning was "We have, for the first time ever, an African American President". My jaw dropped open - this man is not African American! Not only that, why is it so important to be pointed out every time Obama is mentioned? It's getting so ridiculous that no matter what is said, it comes back to black and white when that should have no bearing on who won the election!

he's for abortion....including killing a living child if it is born alive & the mother opts to kill it.....(so the adoption process by loving parents who cannot have children of their own is going to be hurt by this)....and a father has NO RIGHTS to stop it.....



he's going to bring our troops home before the war is won (and we WERE winning) which could strengthen the terrorists who attacked us 9/11....



he's for higher taxes for working people - so people who sit home and DO NOT WORK can get "a check".....



he's considering re-writing the constitution - because he feels it's outdated...so that blacks are "paid back" for their slavery (like that's not an outdated idea? I know I never had a slave).....



he claims to have gone to the same church for over 20 years - but never heard what the preacher was preaching (Jeremiah)....

Obama stands for the traditional democratic ideals of taking a deep interest in the fortunes of the 95% of the US population that comprises the America working class.  The philosophy here is that as all wealth is generated by work, and as all wealth floats upward a mechanism must be in place to insure that wealth never totally accumulate at the top.  This is the purpose behind the graduated income tax.  As long as the American wage-earner has the ability to buy back the product of his/her labor the system stay in balance.  Moderate taxes and good wages at the bottom insures that the wage-earner can both produce, consume and save.  Savings then become capital that can be used to invest in the means of production to insure that the worker always has work.  By this mechanism a robust blue and white collar middle class is maintained while the 'investing' class realizes a decent return their investments in the overall system.  Done right, this is the best of all possible systems.....everyone get a piece of the prosperity action.  I recommend it!

he has the vast majority of electoral votes. each state has so many and if you win the popular vote in that state you win all the electoral votes
now officially the electorate college CAN vote against the popular vote, but it never happens. the official electoral votes will be cast mid december, but for all intents and purposes, obama won.

Looks like you and I are equally in need of a civics class. I can tell you this much: He's won the popular vote, and a bunch of electoral votes (but don't ask me how that's calculated, I'm totally lost on that one... I thought the electoral college hasn't vote yet!), and he's now the President-Elect. He will be inaugurated into office and become the actual President on January 20th.

Obama is the President elect. For now. In December the electoral college will vote and make it official. He will then take office on 20 January 09.



There will be no recounts but i believe there should be multiple investigations. Of course since the Democrats are in power there won't be.

He won the popular vote. In December, the Electoral College will go off to cast their votes -- which are based on the popular vote on a state-by-state basis -- and then Congress ratifies THOSE votes. That's when he'll be officially declared the winner. But for all intents and purposes, he is the winner. It's just a matter of making it all Constitutionally binding now.



Obama will take office on January 20. Bush is still president until then.

One of the main reasons that people  used to come to America  was because America was the Land of Opportunity ....so.........Why would people want to come to an America that will be the Land of Socialism under Obama ?

Did you hear what Obama said this morning? OMG what has this country done?



Obama said he feels good about change. He said he does not know if it will happen in 2 years or even a term but he is hopeful change is on the way. Lord have mercy what in the world is going on? Not a single person has identified the change and Obama said it may not not happen in one term. Obama supporters you promised you would hold him to the fire. Start now make him explain what change he is talking about and exactly when it starts and his plans for it.

Republican Winning California?



I heard all the talk of McCain being able to win California, as heavily a Democratic state as it has always been.  So, this caught my curiosity.  I think Reagan carried the state twice, but has any other Republican nominee for President ever been able to carry California?

Democratic States Proven More Educated Than Republican States!!!?



According to US Government Census/Demographic research you will find that the majority of Democratic States are highly educated as opposed to those States that are Republican..



Republicans States have the majority of uneducated citizens, and thus may lead to narrow minded views, that refuse change; as opposed to the highly educated Democratic States.



The census below states that per capita Democrats are more educated than Republicans.



The data below is irrefutable evidence of educational degrees per capita re: Republican / Democrat



Source US Census..Dept of Education
http://www.census.gov/population/socdemo...



Why do Republicans refute this information with surreptitious rhetoric and libel?



</question>



<additional details>



Republicans that refute this data... it is factual information.. How can you deny this?
Narrow minded views once again from Republicans.. this type of ignorance is what drove our country into debt and distress.



TG:
By refuting factual data and living in your own narrow mind shows your ignorance, and a shame to your Republican party.

You have to ask yourself what that means about the world of higher education in America today, what is being taught and what the biases are.



I recommend the film "Indoctrinate U".. it's an independent documentary about the liberal bias of the world of higher education

This coming from a REPUBLICAN...



People want change, and they knew that was the easiest way to get it. They rolled the dice, now, let’s see if he will accomplish what he says he will. The world is about to change….. forever…
McCain supporters were optimistic to the point that they were blinded by the reality of what was around them, He was going to continue where Bush left off, and BUSH only has an 8% approval rating… So, at that point, it should have been obvious who would win; and although the optimism initially showed, with his estimated early lead with the popular vote,  once the polls actually started to come in, it was suddenly obvious and overwhelmingly eye opening to the McCain campaign what lied ahead; Obama had it at that very moment and unanswerably, in what was to come because of the obvious; every black person in the country voted for Obama, along with the majority of Hillary supporters… which was a given… and the fact that McCain was losing key states early that he HAD to have to win… Because, Obama’s promise of “CHANGE” was convincing enough for them to vote Democrat, and roll the dice….This was also apparent before the election…



Let’s see what happens, if he’s half the leader he says he  is, maybe, just maybe, we will get through this era of change…and come out stronger…united….free.



In the future, I would personally hope, that Republicans have opened their eyes to what is around them, and don’t let Optimism reign to the point that they don’t see what they are really up against, maybe then they will fight a little harder to preserve our rights as people, and what we believe in as a FREE country.



GIVE the people what they want, and see if they can handle it… Can YOU???
We are a nation that wanted change, how much change, we will see in not only the months to come, but the years to come…
He is now in FULL power with the House and Senate… May god be with Obama in the reform and decisions that he is faced with, and the direction and judgment in which he employs; And may god be with the people for whatever lies in our future…
For better or for worse…
Prepare yourself for what is to come…. Educate yourself and people around you, and support what you voted for. Only then, will you have achieved what you worked and fought for….



GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!

Are you happy Obama won?



I am. Im very glad that McCain didnt win. He only brought in Sarah Palin because he thought it would help him get more votes from women. McCain was going to keep our troops to stay in Iraq for a couple more years, because he thinks we are winning. The war has been going on for 7 years. Obama wants to bring them home, which I am very happy about. I think McCain wouldve been just like Bush.

Bananas, a women has the right to get an abortion.

You would be able to get an abortion since Obama will be president. You wouldnt be able to if McCain was.



God of Games, I so agree with you! Im so freakin sick of the rich becoming richer. While the poor are suffering.

So at the end of the day no matter if you like it or not somebody had to take over the white house. Before you people start saying obama is going to mess up our country let the man do his job first, before anyone wants to cast the first stone. Can he at least be president for a month before you people start going crazy ! Give the man a CHANCE. He is your president no matter if you like it or not. If you have an ISSUE then MOVE.

Obama is giving us the same rhetoric that Carter did.  And that was 4  years of harsh suffering, both inside the US as well as globally.  Having lived through one, I'm not looking forward to living through a repeat.

I'm am ELATED! I have never been so proud to be an African-AMERICAN. This is a huge accomplishment for African-Americans. Not jut because he is the first Black president, but because he was given an opportunity. Many Americans were able to look past race and see a very qualified individual. It feels good to know that America can see an individuals qualifications first. This is what my ancestors wanted for themselves and their legacies.  I have never felt so inspired and motivated. This win has given me the momentum to aim high and to give 110%. Anything is possible if you prepare yourself and remain focused. I look forward to his administration. American is in a horrible financial crisis and we need to clean-up our image around the world. His diversity will definitely help reshape our image and relations with other countries. He is a very level-headed man and is WILLING to listen to others while maintaining focus on his country. I'm sure he will level the playing field in regards to taxes, health care, and education. I feel like future generations will  benefit tremendously from his tenure in the White House. Again, I am happy elated, proud, and optimistic!

Just to clarify...



The troops are going to stay in Iraq for a couple more years regardless of who won the Presidency. Obama says he'll pull the troops out but it'll take a long time to do this.



What we're in right now, isn't even a "war."



Obama isn't bringing the troops home, he's sending them to Afghanistan.



If McCain took office, he wouldn't be able to make abortion illegal. So that wasn't even an issue in this election.



If you voted for Obama, I really hope you voted for the right reasons and not because of misconceptions.

hey, did u fight in the war?  probably not.  so who are you to say they should come home.  for all you know, 95% of the troops believe they should be there.  i don't think it is up to us (the people they are fighting for) to say if they should come home or not, i think it is up to the troops!  and bush is against abortions too, but they are still legal.  just like if a republican is in power, unions wont go anywhere, either will abortion.  some of you people really just have no clue about reality

I'm honestly worried. AND I DON'T EVEN LIVE IN AMERICA. Barack has no idea what he is doing, a president needs to be strong to make the country strong. Obama won't do that, Russia is already making threats so it obviously doesn't see America as much of a threat. And the thing is that no matter where you live Americas desicions affect you. Especially now as far as the economy is concerned. As for pro choice or pro life I'm pro choice, as in CHOICE WHETHER OR NOT TO USE A CONDOM, or go on the pill, or use one of the many other forms of contraception. With all these options there really is no excuse for unwanted pregnancy and abortion is a big issue, since when is LIFE not important. If you don't want the baby at least adopt it out to one of the thousands who can't have their own.

how could any one in their right mind allow who ever they want to get an abortion?! thats just sick!



McCain only allowed it if you got raped, but for obama its just like, "oh that girl got herself knocked up? here have an abortion," most chances that girl will do it again.



EDIT: if you are young and can't take care of your baby then you PUT IT UP FOR ADOPTION! you don't kill it!, also, the rich are becoming richer because they  work hard.  and if McCain was president you could get an abortion if you got raped.

He's purposely lowering expectations because he promised so much to get votes, just like the Democrats promised to get out of Iraq to get the majority in Congress in 2006.  In some countries, it's illegal to promise hand-outs, etc during elections.  Looks like we might need to look into that.

Look in the mirror... your statement alone shows that you want to promote the race card and not the issues card.



many of those who support McCain are not "fear mongering" ... we are just sad and disappointed and worried about the future of America.



I did not support Pelosi, Reid, H. Clinton... I never supported many of the democratic policies or directions -- so, I never supported Obama, too.  That is not fear mongering nor is it racist.



But you can't see beyond that because you only want to think that 100% of McCain supporters are racists?  Really?  Because in reality you are continuing the fear mongering from your end.

The electoral college elects the president. The majority vote just decides which party will send their representatives to the electoral college to vote. You'd assume because a man wins the popular vote that the electoral college would vote him in, but take a look at GW Bush and you'd see how wrong it is possible to be.

They'll vote on December 15, but it is mostly a pro forma vote.  There have been very few instances when a single elector has not voted for the person whom he (or she) is committed to.  So unless the Republicans can somehow co-opt a large number of electors, this race is over!

The electoral college vote is the "official" way to win. Obama remains the presumptive winner until the Electoral College certifies the election before the Congress, sometime in December.



Now, the electoral college vote is supposed to reflect the popular vote, so the certification is more an official duty than any sort of contest, but under the Constitution it still has to be done.



Barring any major legal challenges (ie, all McCain votes were thrown out in certain counties or there was widespread intimidation or other charlatainism), the electoral college will certify Obama as the president -elect.



Source(s):



Notes:



John McCain was born within the Panama Canal Zone which was US Territory at the time, and so is eligible to run.



The popular vote has gone for the losing candidate three times in the nation's history - twice in the 19th century and then in 2000.



It would take a large number of faithless electors to turn this election to McCain, which no doubt would prompt an investigation and legal action under state law (which governs elector's pledges), as well as civil unrest. There have been one or two faithless electors in most elections, but the largest number were in the 1830s.

Yes,because theirs is the only real votes that count.



And while they generally follow the popular vote,they are not bound to follow it.



The electoral College has voted for the other candidate a couple of times in U.S. history.



The election is not over until all ballots are counted even though McCain conceded the election.



If the final results are contrary to the projected results,it would still be possible for McCain to be president.



After the electoral votes are tallied,the congress has to certify the election results to make it official.

In this country (a republic) we have something that sets our form of government apart from a true democracy and makes it better.  That is the Electoral College.  The Electoral College is the means by which the states, not the people elect a president who represents the union, not the people.  In article 2 of the U S Constitution states are required to select electors for the electoral college by their own method.  No voting is required.  The fact that states choose to hold a vote to choose electors is handled by the state constitution, not the U S Constitution.  So yes according to the U S Constituion the electoral vote is the only one that counts.

Obama haters=America haters?



Just wondering how the far right is feeling today? Seems that there is alot of anger here on Y.A.  Its strange how there seems to be so much racism being shown by McCain supporters and republicans.



Is it just me, or are they bitter with the realization that in the 21st century the social rewards come from hard work and talent and not from racial privilege? If you want a backward, ignorant Alabama lifestyle where such privileges still exist then you should move to Alabama. The rest of the world will progress and you'll fall further and further behind, becoming more bitter in the process....

I use rural Alabama as an example because there and in places like Misissippi we still find vestages of teh old South. And, we all know the old south was and in some cases is very racist. So I use rural Alabama as an example.



I'm not implying all republicans, jsut the one's who are saying they want to leave the country, or are talking about assasinations, how blacks will be getting more wellfare, or how the U.S. will look like south Africa, etc.etc..

Your title is all wrong, I love American but do not like Obama.  He's fooled millions of you.  You talk about racism, how do you think Obama got elected?  He got the black vote because of his skin color, simple as that.



Barrack Obama, Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey were flying on Obama's private plane. Obama looked at Oprah, chuckled and said, 'You know, I could throw a $1,000 bill out of the window right now and make somebody very happy.' Oprah shrugged her shoulders and replied, 'I could throw ten
$100 bills out of the window and make ten people very happy. Michelle added, 'That being the case, I could throw one hundred $10 bills out of the window and make a hundred people very happy.' Hearing their exchange, the pilot rolled his eyes and said to his co-pilot, 'Such big-shots back
there. Hell, I could throw all of their asses out of the window and make 56 million people very happy.'

Ok you proved your ignorance.  Thanks for playing.



The racism I see are the "left" people screaming yay, first black president (don't forget he's half-white). I have not seen "right" people upset about the race issue (maybe the election race, yes) to the point that you are speaking about.  We weren't the ones using the "race" card to begin with.  It was certain people who voted for Obama who went around speaking about first black president, etc, etc.



As far as Alabama, you, my dear, should never come down here.  We are some of the hardest workers and some of the best talent.  But hey, if you want to stay ignorant, stay up or over, wherever you are (I assume it's either CA or NY ... possibly IL)  Alabama is HOME to the DoD (do you know what that is?  They're helping save you from wearing a turban ... ) HOME to NASA (let me guess ... you think we never landed on the moon). and HOME to some of smartest "yankees" you'll ever meet!  I was born and raised a Yankee ... because of people like you, I choose to stay down here ... where I'm not judged.  I did move back up there for a bit; it wasn't worth the criticism.

I love America and I think even with all it's problems it is still the greatest country there is. I did not vote for Obama, simply for the fact that he moved from the very far left to more modrate for the campaign, and once he gets in we'll see if he stays there or shifts left again.



As for your question you, by asking this question, are no better then the people you ask about.

EXCUSE ME? Last I checked McCain actually SERVED his country and wasn't caught in some controversy saying he doesn't love America. All of a sudden because he won the election he's this American loving hero? I LOVE MY COUNTRY NO MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS! Your accusations are way off base.

You are absolutely right my man!......Not only should they migrate to ALABAMA, which is the deep south but they should go to the deeper south, MISSISSIPPI, where the elected officials there still feel that they do not have to abide by any laws or regulations that are put into place for the STATE....Those BIGOTS there play by their own rules and still to this day, they get away with it......GO FIGURE!.....

No. We love our country, which is why we hate Obama. What we hate is radical liberalism. What we hate are people who gloat and name call  and say things like "get over it" like a high school lead cheerleader, proving our educational system has failed.

How can you not see that the Republican party ran this country into the ground with it's Christianity first, America second, policies? Isn't the state of national, if not global, affairs today proof enough that the Republican party is incapable of running the country? Obama may or may not be the answer, but one thing this country certainly does not need is more of the same.

Hmmm. Seems along the same lines that people were criticizing Michele Obama for saying "for the first time she was proud of her country..." If you can be "not proud" why couldn't she have been? Be careful, your hypocrisy is showing.

Each state has a number of electoral votes based on population.  The people vote for their choice and that is the popular vote.  The popular vote in each state determines that states electoral vote.  The person with the most electoral vote wins the office.  It can and has happened that the popular vote winner did not win the electoral vote and vice versa.  Seems kind of odd doesn't it.

On election day, we vote for who we want to be president. Whoever has the majority of the votes in that state, the entire state usually goes to that candidate. It's pretty unfair, really.



Under an electoral college system, as a liberal citizen of Tennessee, it's pretty rare that my vote is ever going to actually count. Similarly, a conservative citizen of California or New York isn't going to have their vote count, either.



I'm personally still holding out for the Every Vote Counts amendment, which would have the president and vice president chosen based on the popular vote, not the electoral college system.

The answer is yes and no.  People were voting on which way their state would vote in the Presidential election.  And 48 states and Washington DC has a winner take all model for electoral votes.



Electoral college was setup so we did not have a direct democracy.  Especially in the beginning of the country all a candidate would had needed to do was campaign in the North East of the country.  Most of the population back then was in the North east.  It can be argued that only the big states get the attention now as well.  Look at the results of the 2008 election:  Popular vote was 54% voted for Obama and 46% for McCain.  But with the electoral college vote, due to small and big states, was ~350 Obama and ~150 McCain.



By establishing the electoral college each state had a say and the President was elected by the union of states.  Congress is elected by the citizens.  It was a form of indirect and direct democracies.

How far do you think obama will be fair to both blacks and whites?



there is a big deal being made in the news today of obama being black.  isn't he actually mixed race?  btw i am truly overjoyed that a democrat is to be at the helm in america again, they tend to be more fair minded than the republicans.  to me, obama being mixed race is a bonus and the future is a beautiful great big melting pot, as blue mink once chimed.  what do you think?



</question>



<additional details>



i think that is fair comment@ all people of colour being regarded as the n word a long time ago by many more whites in america than today, therefore obama belongs to blacks.  however, the fact a person of colour has been elected and supported by folk of all creeds in america suggests a sea change in racial attitudes.  therefore, from my personal point of view, obama belongs to us all, even british little me.  i hope the world will become more inclusive because of the election of a guy who is quite simply fair minded.  free at last?  i share dr martin luther kings jr's vision of people being regarded by the content of their character and nothing else.  what a wonderful man king was.

I think he was crying because he never believed that he'd see a black man become president; this was a historic moment.

That is what is was. Jesse was out there with MLK - marching, organizing, fighting.  He was been called the N word.  He has had his life threatened.  He has been arrested and beaten.  He was with MLK the day he died.  He has invested his whole life into this moment.

No, he was crying because he's upset that it wasn't HIM winning instead of Obama. Jackson, as well as Al Sharpton and the rest of the racists running under the unbrella of "civil rights activist", are under the guise that they're actually owed something.



Obama won, fair and square. He, unlike his followers, didn't use the race card against McCain. He's an honorable man, he'll hopefully make a good president, and I'll support him without question.

Let me just say something and it will sound racist, its not meant to but it will. Black people are saying I never thought we would see the day when we had a black president. Its about the blacks being in control to them, not the real issues. African Americans slogan is "we do not want it to be about the color of our skin." ThThat'sxactly what it is, and Jesse Jackson is the worse. If Lil Wayne ran for president the majority of black would vote for him, just because of the color of his skin. The only race problem in America is the one they make. I bet five out of ten white people voted for Obama, and you could not find one out twenty blacks that voted for McCain. Who is racist now? The Blacks voted for color in this election not the person. I think Obama will be a decent president, but not neccissarily a good leader.

No.  While I am opposed to practically everything Obama stands for, I think Jackson's tears were for all those who worked so hard and even died to get us to a point in our country where a black American (I detest the ref of African American) can be elected to the highest office in the land.  I kind of felt that emotion myself, even as a white, Christian, conservative republican.  For his show of emotion I applaud him, but I'll never applaud him for most of his social agenda for this country.

If you had had been born like Oprah and Jessie Jackson at a time when blacks did not even have the vote maybe you too would have been greatly moved by the result.



I can remember reading a letter from a black American soldier who was in Vietnam fighting for his country.  He found out his mother had been beaten to death by whites and there had not even been a proper police investigation into who had carried out her murder.  He was a young American who was putting his life on the line for a country where justice for African Americans was still a dream, in the minds of a few brave souls like Martin Luther King.



I remember seeing buses full of frightened black children having to go through crowds of white Americans screaming abuse and throwing things at the buses just because they dared to attend white schools.



As someone who saw these things to witness an African American being elected to the White House bought tears to my eyes and I am not black or even an American.



Hopefully this will make you see why this result has affected so many in what you call an over the top way.

I am not from the USA, but I can tell you many people from around the world have increasing respect for Americans for being able to change their history from slavery and racial discrimination to electing an African American as the president. USA has provided a great model for being tolerant to all races and all cultural back ground, a lesson that other nations can look up to.

I'm not sure where the hell you got the idea that he was voted in as President because of his color!!



You do realize that he got 61 percent WHITE VOTE!!!! And if all white people were like you, then he wouldn't have gotten any.



People are glad that he's the first black president because it shows that our country has come a long way, even from 100 years ago. Who would have ever thought that in my lifetime people would put asside their differences, race, gender, etc., and vote for someone because they can do some good.



And not sure if you even watched the news, but the majority of voters said that race had NOTHING to do with their vote!!!!!!!! (can't remember the percentage now)

Although I disagree that Obama should be labeled as the First African American President, I do think that we should all accept the election result and give him a chance to prove himself. One other reason why Obama won in landslide is because people are angry at the Bush Administration.



I also think that this election is good for the Republicans in the long run.  It is time for the Republican party to reflect and to correct the mistakes have made in the past 8 years, and then make a comeback 4 years from now.

I think the majority of American people have spoken! I didn't vote for Obama because he is black, I voted for him because I didn't want more of the same we have had for the past 8 years. Remember the public voted against Bush in the last election, he just won by electorial votes. We really didn't want 4 more years of the same. McCain would have just carried us on in the same direction Bush did.

I am not sure how bad of a president he will be, but I agree with you 100 percent that he is where he is today, because of his skin color.  If he weren't black, he'd just be a run-of-the-mill senator.

<question>



What should the new symbol of the Democratic party be, a flock of sheep or the Kool-Aide character?



If they want to be accurate it must be one or the other.  They blindly follow regardless of the disaster that these fools - Obama and the new crooks in Congress will bring upon our country.  This is the biggest and worst thing that possibly could have happened to America.  I am sure the election celebration will go down in history as one of the most before and after scenes in history.  The pain and suffering that will occur is unimaginable.  After Obama and Congress destroy this country,  the mobs will be even larger demanding their resignation.

Awww someone's all mad that his team lost. You need to get over it. I didn't vote Obama, but he's our future president, so show the man the respect he deserves.



You act like the Dems are ignorant and blindly follow a leader, but how much do you actually know about Mccain's policies? If you were able to step back and look at it, Mccain would have cost America around a trillion more in debt than Obama would over the next 4 years. His tax plan wasn't as good (as pointed out by most economists in America). His health care plan wasn't either.



So other than Obama being black, what didn't you like about him?

As for get off the meth.  I think we all need to get on it just to be able to live in what will be the worst time in America's history.  This was definitely a history changing election.  You are going to see how bad things are going to get.  We are in for eben worst economic times ahead, maybe even as bad as 1929.  If you have any money of your own you had better start to pull it as stash under your mattress because Barrack is on the loose.  He will start to take all the money that we have and give it to the unwilling to work.  Socialism is on the loose.  God help us!  Back to the main question, which symbol?  Does it really matter.  I think its more like a blind man.  Where now the blind will lead the blind.

From the UK, though I currently live elsewhere, I can say I've never seen people CHEERING over the outcome of an American election. All over the world. Normally nobody gives a toss. Essentially, it is a victory for common sense and a more inclusive view - and the Republicans would do well to do the same. Obama is a citizen of the world.



And the reason I feel obliged to comment on your election - in which you had a vote, so no whining please - is because it affects us all.



Well done, America. You have channeled your history well.

I was stunned...... but then I got to thinking about it and thought maybe this really is the change this country needs. After all, it wasn't going real well when the white folks were in charge now was it? I personally would have like to see a woman as president. I don't think we'd be in two wars now if there was. I think there really would be a chance at health care for everyone, if a woman were president. I could be wrong though. One morning she might have PMS and end it all for all of us by pushing the button.

For a start i find the USA elections very hard to understand  example in one state last night the republics had 10 thousand vote and the democrats 12 thousand yet the republics won that state and what are these ellectrol college votes?



From the UK I am glad the republics didnt win as this guy looks like he is about to have a heart attack which would mean Palin would have stepped into his shoes and not being funny she sounds thick and stupid



Democrats  first USA Black president feel sorry for him think he will be assassinated by Easter I am not the only one in the UK who fears this

Muslim America - obama raised muslim !!!?
The one faction that hates Christian America no longer has to oppose USA, they planted a muslim in office.



We moved from a socialist country because of Ronald Reagan's free America, and now the hope is gone with this monster in office - having contolled more fraud votes (ACORN was trained by oscama - one guy admitted to being paid to vote obama more than 70 TIMES !!) in the history of America than we have seen in Russia !



You black Christian voters, you biggots, you only voted for obama because he was black, but he is not Christian, but attended his childhood muslim school sent by his Kenyan muslim father.

"A century ago, President Theodore Roosevelt's invitation of Booker T. Washington to dine at the White House was taken as an outrage in many quarters," McCain recalled. "America today is a world away from the cruel and prideful bigotry of that time. There is no better evidence of this than the election of an African-American to the presidency of the United States."

I think its sooo sad that many of you (Y R obamabots hateful--its funny because you are the only one that posted a hateful comment lol. The contradictions lmao--oh and by the way McCain bashed bush harder than democrat) feel that he won because of race like a sympathy vote or thinking because ppl hate bush. He won votes from whites, blacks, hispanics, gay ppl, asians and other races and because alot of people from all background thought he would be a better candidate McCain was a great runner they both had flaws BOTH!!! I know plenty of blacks that voted for McCain so please get off the race card. I am happy he is president because it shows not only the growth of this country to look beyond color and see a man ....but it also shows how important it is to vote. I am glad McCain threw his support behind him he was not a sore loser even though he crowd was childish. I feel like we have come far as a country. I also am happy because my main concern was the economy. I did not vote for bush but I respected him as my president and gave support and think we should all do the same for Obama -- he is truly a man of change and class and so is Michelle and I am proud to say he is My president!

Abortion is WRONG WRONG WRONG. it is murdering and 98% of women who got an abortion regret it. that is NINTY EIGHT PERCENT. and Obama is not going to do anything about it.
he is taking money from the people who worked hard to give it to the lazy asses who dont have jobs. People need to work for money, not just get it because they are too lazy assed to make it the REAL way.



He says that he is making all of these CHANGES. my question is what GOOD changes is he going to do? all of them seem like pretty horrible ideas.

I think he is a giant douchebag. He promotes taxation(and seriously more taxes probably won't solve much.). And no I am not a Mccain supporter. They are both total idiots. He is just gonna make things harder. Things are hard enough with these taxes. What about us middle class people? My family is in the upper middle(and we worked hard to get up here). One time my dad's new job payed for a month of living in a luxury apartment complex. Now the badside was the taxes. We had a $700 income tax all because we were living there and they thought we were rich. They didn't care that we had a big family to feed,or anything like that.

As stated, “The families are personal friends, not just professional acquaintances.” site listed below-(freerepublic) They have known each other many years, similarly to him knowing his  insanely controversial Pastor Jeremiah Wright for 20 years, but it is no big deal, right? That doesn't mean anything, right? Or does it? Seriously. He lies yet again stating, "[Bill Ayers is]... a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who's a professor of English in Chicago, who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from. He's not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis." “The reality, however, is that Barack Obama knows Bill Ayers quite well. Obama's political career was launched in Bill Ayer's living room.” site listed below-(antiprotester)

i don't what to think because we know nothing about him at all. Never in the history of America does its people know so little  about a candidate.



Racial guilt, media bias is what put Mr.Obama in the White House..



was it the right choice??? we have 4 yrs to find that out. For America's sake I truly do hope  that Mr.Obama is the man he claims to be.

More like they want to get their shots in while they still have a weakling in power (BUSH).  Didn't the military deals with Venezuela happen BEFORE Obama won?  What was Bush's tough response to that?  The country that mocks America openly and calls Bush "the Devil" during a UN speech!  I guess he was too busy hunting down Bin Laden to do anything.  What a complete joke Bush is, when 3rd world dictators laugh at him.

Yes, it would have happened if McCain had won. I'm not worried because Obama will invade Russia to show how tough he is.

First, Barabanov expressed skepticism that the Iranian threat is the real reason the new BMD system is going to be deployed with frontline radar bases in Poland and the Czech Republic. Like the late Henry Ford, Barabanov argued that people have two reasons for doing what they do: a good reason and the real reason. In the case of BMD, a determination to fence Russia in is, he argued, the real reason.

Vladimir Putin is Ex-KGB and managed to keep himself in power after his terms as President were up.  He knew that he couldn't do squat against Bush.  You'll see when Obama is President.  He's going to re-ignite the cold war because we'll be so concerned with ourselves.  It'll happen right under our noses.

This Russian thing is a response to current US actions and planning as well as the growing realization that the US is impotent as a global power given the Bush fiasco in Iraq.  A patient Bin laden still has this country in his sights.



But you can blame it on all Obama if your IQ allows such fantasies.



You can ignore what Bush has done to destroy this country with the blind support of a lot of uneducated people.



The landslide victory is more indicative of the anti Bush sentiment in this country, than any love of Obama or dislike of McCain. Now we get to reap the incalculable benefits of the Bush era. Since the world has seen how the US struggled in Iraq and can't really pose the power the US was once, until Bush, perceived to be. The US is going to be a sitting duck. This is just he beginning.

Of course it would have happened if McCain won.
Did you read this story?
Medvedev said, “the global financial turmoil as consequences of aggressive, selfish U.S. policies.” I seriously doubt he or anyone else would feel differently about McCain. He also said, “he hoped the next U.S. administration would act to improve relations. In a separate telegram, he congratulated Barack Obama on his election victory and said he was hoping for "constructive dialogue" with the incoming U.S. president.” Doesn’t that tell you how at least one Russian feels about Obama?



Yes it is starting already and thank goodness it has! McCain criticized Obama and claimed it was his lack of experience that he was willing to sit down and talk with leaders of countries we oppose. I think those leaders look at this as promising and so do I.

<question>



Are you worried about Obama?



I just recieved this e-mail and felt it appropriate to share:



n the last 10 hours, two friends called me.  One was ecstatic.  The other very worried.  One friend supported Barrack Obama.  The other supported John McCain. My Obama friend talked of a new hope and brighter days.  My McCain friend spoke of difficult times ahead and fears about tomorrow. My Obama friend said that Obama would change everything.  My McCain friend said the same thing, but for different reasons. My Obama friend gushed at Obama's victory as though the stars seemed more in line.  My McCain friend recoiled at Obama's victory as though the heavens had fallen. My Obama friend considers Obama a magnetic personality, poised to the change the world.  My McCain friend sees Obama as a polarizing personality---poised to change the world. I simply listened to both of them and thought about the morning. 
 
For you see, this morning--- the world still suffers from the broken edges of our humanity.  8,000 people will die today from AIDS.  14,000 children will die from conditions that we could have prevented.  Young men and women on various sides will die as a result of various conflicts around the world. This morning--- the complexities of our world still transcend the efforts of one man, one party or, even, one nation.  People will do unspeakable things because they say they love their country or their God. This morning--- families from all backgrounds will struggle, marriages will fail, and parents will worry about their children.  The most local of our circumstances and problems will still seem overwhelming and hopeless for so many, no matter what the political landscape looks like. This morning--- the poor are still poor; our prisons are still full; our schools are still in need.  People still judge too many of our brothers and sisters because of the color of their skin.  People still awaken to lonely homes and even lonelier lives.  And, people still believe that one more dollar, or one more purchase, or one more title, will make the ache go away. This morning--- our brothers and sisters in the faith still fight over the least of what we can agree upon.  And, people continue to believe that our answers exists somewhere among our own abilities, gifts and graces-a lie told, and believed, from the Garden until now. And, so, this morning--- we need not create another Satan.  That job remains taken. But, on this morning--- we need not create another Messiah either.  That position is also filled. And because of that, this morning--- the solutions to our problems remain vested in our ability to look past our differences and trust the best of what we can agree upon. This morning--- the Table remains, as it has for 2,000 years and through countless elections, as the real center of hope for both how God sees us and for how God intends for us to see each other.  While the world casts its hope in the extraordinary---buildings made of marble and granite; God delights and offers real hope in the ordinary--- bread, juice, and stables made of straw and hills made of jagged rock. This morning--- the message of the Good News remains for those who have and have not, for those who vote left or right or not at all, and for those who consider faith a burden or a crutch. This morning--- the family of God remains bigger than boundaries and nationalities and ideologies. And, we still pray that men and women of all ages, nations and races, will make good decisions for the good of the world for the right reasons.  Because, our hope remains in something more sacred than even an election, a president, a congress or the concept of democracy. This morning--- our God still reigns, still loves unconditionally, still offers forgiveness, still calls us to do good and seek justice, still encourages us to live faithfully, still insists that we make peace, still favors the poor whether of material or spirit, still comforts those who mourn, still draws close to those who hunger and thirst for Him, still believes in the communion of the saints, and still prepares a place for when the journey is over. Yes, this morning--- much is different, but little has changed.
 
And, so, for my two friends--- and for all of us--- the real question on this morning--- or any morning--- is what shall we do with THIS DAY--- that the LORD HAS MADE---I say let us rejoice and be glad in it. Be salt and light... you matter. Shane

I would have been more worried if McCain and Palin had won. He is older, and while experienced, wanted to tax health care benefits, and if he died, she would have taken over, and I have less than 0% confidence in her abilities to even lead a girl scout troop.  Also, McCain has 7 houses; how can he relate to the economic struggle of the average person????

HERE IS MY
OPEN LETTER TO OBAMA



I am what you have called “a typical white person”



I am that black person, that you consider a “sellout”



I am that baby that survived a partial birth abortion, that you would have had die and that you call a “punishment”.



I am the UAW worker who worked hard to build the Ford Granada, that you (Obama) told Indianapolis radio station WFBQ. "It may be the worst car that Detroit ever built… This thing was a tin can.”



I am a small town American, who you said was “bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations,"



I am Joe the Plumber, who works hard and wants to some day own his own business, but may not get the chance if Obama is elected because his hard earned income will be re-distributed to others.



I am Tito the Builder and I love America and I want to know, “Why the heck are you going after Joe The Plumber,’” “‘Joe The Plumber has an idea. He has a future. He wants to be something else. Why is that so wrong?"



I am Sgt. Joe Cook, the Iraq veteran. When you Obama’s said that ”Iraq was a mistake”, “you disrespect the service and sacrifice of everyone whose died promoting freedom.”



I am the American you called “selfish” because I do not support re-distribution of wealth.



And, surprise surprise……

There's nothing left. He emptied out the Treasury to his rich friends as a going away present. And for what? The economy got worse!

Let us pray for Barack Obama to deliver us from evil?



Our Father, who art in heaven,



Hallowed be thy Name.



Thy kingdom come.



Thy will be done,



On earth as it is in heaven.



Give us this day our daily bread.



And forgive us our trespasses,



As we forgive those who trespass against us.



And lead us not into temptation,



But deliver us from evil.



For thine is the kingdom,



and the power,



and the glory,



for ever and ever.



Amen.

Liberals - If you care about endangered species please answer this?



The United States is the last country on planet earth that believes in capitalism and has shown that it worked.  Why then do you want to kill capitalism?  It is the greatest country on the planet and you want to make it like all the others.  Freedom was fun while it lasted.  I have already read stories of the layoffs and stopped projects happening across the nation.  When the economy completely collapses then the govt will come rushing in to save the day with socialism and the capitalist species will be extinct off of the planet...  Hope it was worth it.  :(

Will the people hold President Obama and Democarts accountable?



Since President Obama has promised a wide range of policies and has the tools (a Democratic heavy Congress and Senate) will the people hold him responsible if they fail just as they did for President Bush and the Republicans? Will they harp as loudly for any of his failures as they did against President Bush?

The one faction that hates Christian America no longer has to oppose USA, they planted a muslim in office.



We moved from a socialist country because of Ronald Reagan's free America, and now the hope is gone with this monster in office - having contolled more fraud votes (ACORN was trained by oscama - one guy admitted to being paid to vote obama more than 70 TIMES !!) in the history of America than we have seen in Russia !



You black Christian voters, you biggots, you only voted for obama because he was black, but he is not Christian, but attended his childhood muslim school sent by his Kenyan muslim father. He is not a black American (no slave background), but a black Kenyan socialist!!!

I'm seriously deeply saddened.



*Edit* For all of the people who say that black voters or first time voters voted for Obama because he is HALF black, that is not true.  Some of us are able to make educated decisions based off of research and how we feel the country would run best,  rather than something as insignificant as race to help us make our decision.  I am one of those people.

Did you notice race was barely mentioned during his campaign? Not even he addressed it. Yet now that he's won, it's the topic of conversation. Republicans refuse to believe that he won fairly, because they don't support his policies. News flash: we voted for Obama because he's going to change this country. And if blacks voted for Obama, good for them for voting for a man they support, who encouraged more than 600,000 new voters in this election. What an inspiration.

I don't think it's about race honestly.  We will see what he has to offer.  No one really knows, just what he says (And he is really good at public speaking), because he has only been in the Senate a short time.  So I guess we will see what he will do.

I think people are just scared of change.  He promises good change, but we've been believing presidents before during campaigns and it all turns out to be a lie.  I also think the 'White men' are afraid of losing power that they have had politically for hundreds of years.  It's also a generational thing.  Our parents and generations before them lived in a different time.  We are more open to whatever-black, white, gay, straight, not so judemental.

Basically, there are people out there who believe that race is something to judge someone on, and judge a whole group of people on, instead of judging someone on their own merits.  So instead, they would rather find reasons to hate that person because they belong to a "group" of people they don't like.



It doesn't matter what color you are, you know people that don't like someone else only based on race.  They are the same types of people who don't take the time, or make the effort, to judge someone on what type of person they are.  So, it's laziness that makes them so opinionated about people they don't know anything about.

I am truly, genuinely surprised by how MANY people... intelligent people even, including my father... think that he ONLY won "because he is black".  First of all, he IS half white.  Second, and most important, it is WHAT HE STANDS FOR that I voted for, and the VAST majority of his supporters are with me on that.  He coud be bright pink with pea green polka dots for all I care, there was NO WAY McCain would have gotten my vote.  It is PAST TIME for a Democratic president, and he happened to be the one that was nominated.  Hilary would have won just as easily.  GET OVER IT and stop trying to make up excuses people, it really just makes you look IGNORANT!!!!!!

I'm not one to pray too often but I have been willing the Powers that Be to bless Obama and keep him safe from the ignorant lunatics out there.



And "cb.." when we say "colorblind", we don't mean the clinical definition, which I know all about, and I think you know that.  The colorblind we mean is a specific outlook on human race.  I know abstract concepts can be a little difficult for many Cons, but with a little effort, you CAN learn. :)

Well...there's a first time for everything, and Obama happened to be the first black presidential candidate (now president).
The same thing would have happened with Hillary Clinton being a woman.



They always try to find something to undermine them...it's natural, I guess.
But you were correct in saying peoples' true colors are now showing. The racists crawled out from under their rock to complain.

Yes he is! We are all Americans regardless of party lines, race, cultures, economic stature! This is your America as much as it is mine! You matter and your voice matters as much as anyone. But how we all deal in the light of adversity determines who we REALLY are as individuals. So, I ask who are you? Are you someone with integrity? Patriotic? Let us all move beyond the gravity of resentment, mistrust, and distrust so that we all can unite and take America back to its high standing in the world.

No, I think they picked up 5 seats...you need 60 to fillibuster, I believe they have 55.



Even if you had 60 Democrats, you would have to assume that they would all have to be in agreement on an issue. That doesn't happen very often.

Who are these freaks that are still spreading anti-Obama propaganda?



I thought it was just sleazy campaigning from both camps before the election.  But I still see all that weird stuff on Y!A about Obama.  Is there actually a bunch of "real" people that just sit around and spew BS about a guy for no reason whatsoever?  I mean, the election is over, so it serves no purpose.  Please tell me America is not that deranged.  Why don't these weirdos move on to trashing their rival sports teams or something?



</question>



<additional details>



Wow, because the Dems were bashing Bush?  I thought they were calling for recounts because of massive election fraud in Florida.  But I guess that would be called Bush bashing back then.  Now that his approval is approaching 2%, I'm surprised anybody thinks those Dems were wrong.



Yeah, sore losers are understandable.  Especially those who were trying so hard to spread talking points (in the real world) and BS (on the internet), and it all amounted to a huge defeat.  Obviously both sides have sore losers every time.
The scary thing is how much some people HATE Obama.  There are so many sick, racist, ignorant people.  I seriously doubt that Obama will have the smallest effect on their lives at all, and yet they are freaking out.  How dumb do they have to be to think McCain and Obama will actually do anything differently?  Their election platforms were so similar they had to stretch for the stupidest things to actually argue about.

of course there's still a good reason to talk about the TRUTH about Obama. He may have been elected but he's still dangerous. We must be aware of the things that he will attempt to get passed. Congress is still supposed to represent us.

Unfortunately, yes. Just like those who for 8 years kept claiming that Bush "stole the election", and those who said "Bush would declare martial law and cancel the election". The "deranged" ones on the left did it to the republicans for 8 years. Right or wrong, there will be those sorry individuals who will do it to the democrats to "get even". I wish they would all grow up and leave it alone. The nice thing about this country is that every 4 years we have the chance to change leaders. Hopefully, we'll have a better presidential candidate in 2012.

Mostly they're just sore losers, but I think many of those people really believe what they're saying.  Being convinced of all the lies, they can't accept that no one else was as well, and are looking for reaffirmation.  There will always be few who can't let go, I've met people who were still defending McCarthyism as late as the '80s, and I know people today who still defend Nixon.  Most of them eventually get bored and look for something new and about which people actually care to rant, we just need to give them time.

Well, I didn't cry. I wasn't happy that my guy didn't get in. But, I try to find the positive in everything... so, I'm happy that the country got who they voted for (that just shows our country is strong and our democracy is working). I feel bad for what they actually got. Who knows, maybe he'll be a good president, maybe not, only time will tell.

why would you cry, that's stupid



people just need to deal with the fact that not everyone in the world is going to be happy with the decisions our country makes.



and if you didn't vote your opinion doesn't count anyways cause you didn't wait in lines to have you opinion be heard.



so no i didn't cry and no one should have it was a stupid repsone on the peoples part.

If obama turns out to be racist what effect would this have on affrimative action?



Will such an attitude and actions stemming from such an attitude have progressive or degressive effect on what affirmative action rights efforts put forth over the last 60 years?



</question>



<additional details>



What I mean is if Obama uses his power to persecute white people or put in severe disadvantage (similiar to the situation african americans had in the 1950's and before only in reverse) would the back lash be very strong and bring back the bigotry and erase such efforts  that we as an enlightened nation tried to erase and over come?

Hypothetically speaking, if it were to come out that he is a racist (which would be extremely odd considering his mother is white), then it would be extremely disasterous for our nation.  The white people that voted for him will feel duped and will be extremely angry, as they should be. And I think a potential race war would be next.



Of course, he isn't, but i'm answering hypothetically.



As for affirmative action, that would be the last of our worries. Like I said, there would be a race war if Barack was a racist.



That would make for an interesting fiction novel, though. But I think you and I both know he is nothing even close.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Yes. I am afraid you are right. All progress in making people equal in this nation despite of color, creed or ethinic backround would be gone if this turns out to be true. It would be a step back wards. However, saying this is a quick way of getting labeled a racist. It is not Its legitimate problem

I believe that Obama is prejudiced against whites; you can find evidence for that in his books. He was ashamed to admit that his mother was white while he was in college, and he has hung out with radical black activists most of his life (Revs. Wright and Farrakhan, Frank Davis Marshall).



Of course, as president he won't create legislation, but Comrade President Obama will support any legislation by black Congressmen that will benefit black Americans, and he will staunchly support affirmative action and quotas for blacks. he has to give back to the black people who gave him the presidency.

That old wart hog is going to the pen - he should have been there a long time ago.  I guess Palin is going to appoint a Jesus freak to replace him.



By the way, why is this convicted felon on the loose?  The Judge should have required him to stay in his DC home pending sentencing and transport to the pen.

Yes he is slightly in the lead. It looks like he might win. I believe Palin will appoint herself to the Senate. It is the only way she will be able to maintain her political career. I see her popularity in Alaska going down fast and the longer she is Governor the worst it will be for her.  I cant believe the people of Alaska voted for a convicted felon!

No.



The "change" aspect is referring to a completely new approach to our country. We're going from a extremely conservative President who supports the war to a democratic President against the war, etc.. Obama has views that differ GREATLY from Bush's.

I think it has more to do with:
1) making sure the rich doesn't get richer while the poor gets poorer.



2) trying to fix the mess in iraq

One of the few good points to Obama being elected is that this now puts the idea of black people can't succeed because white people won't let them, to rest.

Similar policies? What huge rock were you under during the past few months?



His color probably had something to do with it. I'm not going to lie and pretend it had nothing to do with it. But he was also a HUGE CHANGE from the Bush Administration and McCain didn't really have a chance following a Republican. That is the 'change' we are all looking forward to.

First off, I am no racist, so do not think I am.



But I do believe if minority voters who never voted before did not cast a vote, Obama would not have won, in fact, it would have been a landslide the other way.



I did not support him nor vote for him, but now I have to give him a shot to see how he performs, I sure hope he does well for us!



I was out earlier today shopping, and I heard a few things that I do not like hearing!  Pretty much came from black people talking, saying that "they (whites) will finally know what it is like to feel how we have!"  That is taken by myself as them thinking totally wrong as to why this man was elected!  Also pretty much taken as if they will be taken care of, and white people will have to fend for themselves!



Is this really the way it will be?  Remains to be seen!

To me,no one's race or color has anything to do with it.I just don't like the so called "changes" that will occur. I am not on welfare,food stamps or any government program.Where the money is coming from for all these changes I wonder,people it won't be redistribution to your pocket.Is BHO going to redistribute his wealth too?Just wondering.What about those on SS and no other income with no children to get tax breaks.Boy,are we the people ever in for a rude awakening.

Yet in the back of my brain i'm hoping that a good change will come to America.

No,history repeats itself again.



Democrats controlling the white house and congress = financial disaster.



Higher taxes for everyone,wind fall profits taxes on oil companies,etc.



Obama wants to pull troops out of Iraq,but he will send them to Afghanistan to fight.



The democrats sent troops to Vietnam despite the protests against the war,spent money on their "Great American Society"programs that technically bankrupted the U.S.



The government couldn't declare bankruptcy back then and it can't declare it now without destroying the global economy now.



But then again it is necessary to destroy the economy and the U.S. Constitution in order to establish a global government.



Don't count on the military,most of them will be turned over to the U.N. even though the constitution prohibits it.



Based on news today,it looks like most of his white house staff and cabinet choices are democrats from the Clinton era.



Higher taxes and more spending,No change there!



Going back to "worse than Clinton"gun ban-there is the change America doesn't need.



Forget about reducing crime or protecting yourself,you won't even be able to own a toy gun.



Like to hunt,better get it in while you can.



No hunting means that the wildlife will increase to the point that their habitat will not sustain then and then problems between humans and wildlife will increase.



The last I read about Great Britain,the people are trying to get parliament to change the gun laws to allow hunting because the wildlife population has gotten out of hand.



Don't forget that he will be filling a lot of empty federal judge spots that the democrats have blocked because of politics not the judges qualifications and it will be 30 to 40 years before the American people can even try to straighten it out,if they are still allowed to vote then.

<question>



What do you think about this prophecy? I think i agree....?



A Prophetic Warning from Pastor Steve =Foss.



I am writing to you today an urgent =message concerning the coming American election. God has released me to =share with you a powerful prophecy He gave me eight years ago. I have =shared this prophecy in a number of public meetings, but I have never =published it for all our friends and partners.=20



In January of 2000 God gave me an =incredible insight into what was about to happen in the coming elections =in America over the next decade.=20



I am not using this e-mail to tell you, =who are citizens of America, who to vote for. However, you need to hear =what the Holy Spirit is saying. Never in my 22 years of ministry have I =seen such a spirit of delusion released upon our country.=20



In January of 2000, while the Republican =nomination for president was far from being decided, God spoke to me =that George W. Bush would be the president of the United States. He told =me it would be the hardest fought election in American history. I'm sure =we can all remember the incredible battle that took place in Florida. He =told me that President Bush would be elected to two terms. He told me =that during Bush's term there would be a season of unprecedented =economic prosperity.=20



Now despite what the media has said, the =economic wealth created during the last eight years was unprecedented. I =know the media and one of the political parties has been trying to paint =the last eight years as the worst economic time in American history, but =it is absolutely untrue. If you look at the wealth created, there were =more millionaires created in the last eight years than any time in =history. Multitudes of people were able to sell real estate before the =housing market collapse, and received incredible transfers of wealth. I =could spend hours showing documentation of the wealth created, but =suffice it to say, the evidence is there.=20



God then said to me, "At the end of =President Bush's second term there would be an economic collapse." As =everyone in the world knows, we have just faced the greatest economic =threat since 1929 and the Great Depression. I will speak a little more =about the present economic situation a little later in this message.=20



Every detail that God gave me has come to =pass exactly as He said. Now there is one more important thing that God =spoke to me. This is the purpose and the reason I am writing this e-mail =today. God spoke to me that after George W. Bush, America would elect =its most ungodly president ever. I'm going to say that again. God spoke =to me that after George W. Bush, America would elect its most ungodly =president ever.=20



As of the writing of this e-mail we are =now less than two weeks away from voting for our next president. At this =time the polls are strongly showing that the Democratic nominee for =president will easily win the White House.=20



Now in 2006 I began to ask the Lord, "Is =that guaranteed to happen in 2008?" He spoke to me very clearly and gave =me the key words to what I believe holds this election in the balance =right now. He gave me these key words that can forever change what is =about to happen in America.=20



He said, "It depends on the Christians."=20



I am not going to endorse a candidate, nor =am I telling anyone who to vote for. I am simply sharing what God has =shown me.=20



I had a vision earlier this year. I saw =Barack Obama in this vision. He was speaking to a large crowd and being =broadcast on television. He was speaking incredible words of unity, =peace, and bringing all sides together; the words were elegant, the =words were comforting, and the words were inspiring.=20



But while he was speaking I saw all a =powerful spirit of violence coming out of his spirit feeding into the =spirits of those that were hearing him. That spirit of violence was =directed at anybody who opposed what he was saying. Those who heard his =words and received it had the spirit of violence being implanted inside =of them. It was a rage like I have not seen before.=20



It was the rage that would be unleashed =against those who oppose and stand in the way of Barack Obama's agenda. =We are already seeing the beginnings of this spirit manifested here in =America. The vicious attacks against Sarah Palin have been unlike =anything we have ever seen before. The sheer hate for this woman from =people who knew nothing about her, and who claim to stand up and protect =the little people, and women, has been shocking.=20

What do I think of this prophecy? I think you are a crazy person. You speak of the hate towards Sarah Palin - a lot of people have "sheer hate" for candidates of both parties. It's politics - and people get passionate. It's just the way it works - check out political history sometime.



I could write all of the exact same things and replace Obama with McCain.



On another note - aren't you a bit old to still have imaginary friends? God didn't tell you anything - your mind did. Learn to take responsibility for the things you believe and say - don't blame them on the invisible man.



You didn't see any spirit - you'd like to believe you did because this somehow makes you feel you have some power and know more than others. You don't - it's a nice thought, but it's not true.



Just so you know: your bible has way more hatred, murder, rape, pillaging, and theft than anything I've ever seen in my life - all in the name of God or because God told them to... Much more vicious than any attacks made against Sarah Palin.

You have to be very careful when you talk about demonic spirits...What is totally amazing to me is how you are able to see these demons lurking through MR. OBAMA and you did not foresee the same demons that was and still is lurking through-out MR. BUSH. This man started a war with the IRAQ people without even having a solid plan in place, therefore putting the lives of our Solidiers in JEOPARDY, and you talk about a spirit of Violence that OBAMA has? What about BUSH SIR? This is evil at it's best when this man has absolutely no remorse for all those young men who are still stuck over seas fighting a senseless war. You better make sure that it is truly the HOLY-SPIRIT that you are entertaining and not the ANTI-CHRIST. Genesis 1:26 goes on to say that God gave man dominion over this earth and everything within it so all this destruction that we see upon this earth was caused by man...We can only allow the HOLY-SPIRIT access within us when we receive the LORD as our SAVOIR and he therefore dwells within us. I am concerned that this HOLY-SPIRIT, which is the spirit of love, has only shown you how the MC-CAIN-PALIN team was attacked and it showed you absolutely nothing about how OBAMA was ridiculed by the MC-CAIN-PALIN PARTY throughout this election. You have a one-sided PROPHETIC-VIEW concerning this whole thing. I believe that the holy-spirit gives us different gifts of the spirit and I am not attacking this gift that you have...I am only here to tell you that if this is truly a gift of the spirit, it does not have a respector of persons because it see all things, discerns all things spiritually....Please ask GOD for guidance and understanding concerning these visions that you have.....They could very well be the TRICK OF THE ENEMY.....GOD BLESS YOU........

Whether or not this was real, it has hit on things I have seen and heard to be true. Now it is happening. I have always told God I wanted to stay and fight rather than be taken up. I would rather inherit the earth, than leave it. (:D Now the blind on here can call ME a religious nutjob, except I never go to church. Instead, I study history and religions. Whatever God is, he/she/it is real.) I wish I could have read the missing part, and if you would, please email me the rest? The dreams I have had all night long have been amazing. (I dream true. I don't care who believes me) Those who fear this next four years have reason, regardless of whether they know the real reasons why. I have seen in my dream small "islands" of people who flee this mans' policies. I cannot elaborate here. I'd be happy to discuss with whoever wants to, but will ignore those who simply want to insult, rant, rave, threaten or whatever. Some of his supporters will wake up and wonder how they didn't see the truth earlier, most will become agents of the change which will be our undoing.

If another black president is elected, will Obama lose his title?



I mean, Obama's not fully black, but he's considered "the first black president." So if a fully black male is elected president somewhere down the road, won't he be "the first black president"? If so, would Obama lose his title?

So you're asking if when Harold Ford is elected President in 2020 will he demand that the press and public consider him the first black president? I don't think so, because that's a distinction that matters only to white people who obsess about skin color.



President-elect Obama did not run on his gender or his skin color. He ran on his credentials which are his long public service as a community organizer, state senator and US Senator, his vision for a 21st century America, the quality of his character, and his judgment.



Having demonstrated that the path to victory lies in holding bigger ideas and articulating sounder policies than the GOP candidate, who will inevitably be shackled to economic and tax policies and a neoconservative foreign policy fantasies that do not fit the needs of 21st century America, why would you change?

I don't know what black means these days, but being that he is obviously African-American and darker than many popular African-Americans (Halle Berry, Beyonce, Jay-Z, Harold Ford Jr., etc), I think it is established that he is the first black president.



Most African-Americans are as white as he is, even if they deny it.

LOL whut?  National socialism !=socialism.



Myth: Hitler was a leftist.



Fact: Nearly all of Hitler's beliefs placed him on the far right.



Summary



Many conservatives accuse Hitler of being a leftist, on the grounds that his party was named "National Socialist." But socialism requires worker ownership and control of the means of production. In Nazi Germany, private capitalist individuals owned the means of production, and they in turn were frequently controlled by the Nazi party and state. True socialism does not advocate such economic dictatorship -- it can only be democratic. Hitler's other political beliefs place him almost always on the far right. He advocated racism over racial tolerance, eugenics over freedom of reproduction, merit over equality, competition over cooperation, power politics and militarism over pacifism, dictatorship over democracy, capitalism over Marxism, realism over idealism, nationalism over internationalism, exclusiveness over inclusiveness, common sense over theory or science, pragmatism over principle, and even held friendly relations with the Church, even though he was an atheist.

What does it say about McCain's words:



McCain: "Wealthy people can afford more....I really believe that when you are... reach a certain level of comfort there's nothing wrong with paying somewhat more."
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNke6ad0t...



McCain was one of only two Republicans to vote against Bush's '01 tax cuts and one of only three to vote against his '03 tax cuts.
http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic...



McCain, explained why: "I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the more fortunate among us at the expense of middle-class Americans who need tax relief."

Awww, it's so cute that you're repeating what you heard from the other ignorant people.  He's not a socialist, he just wants to help the lower and middle class to be able to make it in a country where the cost of living is alot more than the minimum wage.  Why can't you people see that?  Stop your whining.

Socialism is not the answer America needs, this nation is divided in half over this election, look at the popular vote total, 63 Million for Obama, 56 million for McCain, if that is not a dividision I don't know what is! The "I told you so's are coming"!

Liberals - If you care about endangered species please answer this?



The United States is the last country on planet earth that believes in capitalism and has shown that it worked.  Why then do you want to kill capitalism?  It is the greatest country on the planet and you want to make it like all the others.  Freedom was fun while it lasted.  I have already read stories of the layoffs and stopped projects happening across the nation.  When the economy completely collapses then the govt will come rushing in to save the day with socialism and the capitalist species will be extinct off of the planet...  Hope it was worth it.  :(

I agree with you.  I fail to see how so many could think of this as being about race when it is really about capitalism.  I will freely admit that I was aided, greatly, by scholarships and affirmative action.  I am living the American dream because I was helped and now I do my best to give back, but that will be much more difficult, if not impossible, if much of my income is taken away from me.  I help my entire family, even an aunt and uncle.  If I am going to get punished for all my hard work by being over taxed then so are they, and then they will be on welfare.

Capitalism isn't a species.  It's an economic system, and a rather cruel and competitive one at that.  Capitalists aren't an endangered species either.  Homo sapiens (humans) is a species and it is endangered by it's own unsustainable birth and consumption rates.  The longer we as a species continue to indulge in an "us vs. them" or "every man for himself" philosophy, the closer we come to our own extinction.  The sooner we can bring ourselves to think of ourselves as individual representatives of one species, the better our chances for our long term survival.  Btw, no economic system I'm aware of has ever been 100% capitalist or socialist but rather some combination of the two.

in real life, I have many democrat friends and we get along just fine. The majority of the ones who use this site are so disrespectful and hateful, it's impossible to be respectful towards them. Granted not all of them are like that but the ones who stand out and use the Y!A politics section the most seem to be. I dont hate you, I dont even hate them, I just get heated in political debate and the more name calling that goes on, the more heated I get. If they're anything like they appear to be on here I'd probably have to smack them around in person. But if they're respectful and not so hateful in real life, I could sit down and have a decent debate with them in real life.



By the way, I'm not saying the republicans who use this site are a batch of innocent kittens either. I know the name calling goes both ways and I've done my share too (usually when provoked). Thats politics. Thats probably why people dont like to discuss politics.

Well Obama won by a lot, The democrats have the majority in house and senate. The democrats didn't get to 60 senate representatives to avoid filibustering though. McCain gave a great congratulatory speech for Obama, and as I said Obama won.

Like I said in the last one
No I am not happy at all. I could care less what color he is but most people who voted for him only voted because just that. No one really seemed to listen to his plans such as ban fire arms.



It's in the constitution it's an ammendment the american people have the right to bear arms for our protection.



He wants to slow the progress of weapons such as nuclear and space....every other country is doing that and we'll appear vulnerable. He wants to increase taxes on wealthy and give to lower class. Sorry but I don't want my money goin to people who live on welfare and too lazy to get a job and decide to have 10 kids.
He wants our troops out of Iraq now. Yes we do want our troops home but if we just pull out without finishing the job to the rest of the world we will look weak.
He wants to cut back on our defenses....remember 911 anyone?
And last but not least his full name is Barack Hussein Obama and he is of Muslim descent. No wonder the middle east likes him so much
Hopefully I am wrong when I say America is in for a rude awakening

Me and my boyfriend are very liberal minded - we both supported Obama (me Clinton first).
My family is liberal too...
while his entire family is arch conservative and very religious.
His mom usually sends me funny emails from work, but in the weeks before the election, more and more of her forwards contained blatant propaganda against Obama - like calling him a muslim, questioning his citizenship... the usual stupidity.
I mostly deleted the mails, but couldn't resist sending her a few things back...



like this:

Give Obama a chance. If you don't like what he does than that's fine but right now you can't KNOW how he will be as a president.



Look at all the people who loved Bush and now he has the LOWEST approval rating of any president!

For some reason it became fashion to bash President Bush.  I think the anti-Bush press led the charge.  This country has had a tradition lately (past 20 years) of trashing good people (Palin for example).  People in this country need to start thinking for themselves and not follow the press like a pack of wolves.

No. After watching an episode of Law & Order C.I. a few months ago in which a political candidate was shot (ASSASSIN, episode #CI7014), I was thinking that they wore those colors in case Barack was shot. The black and red would minimize the impact of blood.

I'm not sure when wearing red and black became a subliminal message of communism.



Sometimes a red dress is just a red dress, not a Marxist statement.



EDIT: I just saw footage of what she wore. It's an ugly dress. The kids looked cute. I didn't detect a note of communism.



It's unfortunate that a pretty color has been associated with a political statement from the 1950's.



So we don't start running around ripping the heads off of roses and tulips, and claiming some sort of Communist conspiracy involving Valentine's Day lets remember that first ladies have always embraced the color red:



http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttru...



It's a warm, passionate and exciting color. It's the color of Christmas and Valentine's. Restaurants use red decor to encourage people to eat more.



Only bitter conspiracy theorists would see some sort of 'message'.

Socialism is not the answer America needs, this nation is divided in half over this election, look at the popular vote total, 63 Million for Obama, 56 million for McCain, if that is not a division I don't know what is!

They differ way too much on their military philosophy, though....Obama would never agree with McCain.  McCain was for the surge from the start, Obama's been pushing for withdrawl.



Obama might keep on Gates, at least long enough to blame him (and Bush by proxy) for something and use him as a scapegoat to pull out of Iraq

Personally i think Petraeus would be the best fit.  I know Obama and him do not see eye to eye, but Petraeus is the most logical choice because he is most familiar with the war we are in as of now

popular votes is the overall amount of votes that person got.(out of the whole united states.) The electoral votes ...I'll give you an example. The bigger the population in a state,the more electoral votes for that state.California-55,Florida-27,New York-31...etc. And a candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win. That is what matters...even if one wins the popular vote and the other is higher in the electoral,the one with the electoral still wins. Unfortunately. It really shouldnt go by the electoral. So, to sum this up, Obama really just got the good states,the more populated states.The population njumbers for both were pretty close.

The electoral college system was defined when horse was the fastest way to travel. Electors are chosen by each political party in every state, and charged to bring the state results to the electoral college, where the presidency would be decided. There was wiggle room provided to the electors in order to deal with contingencies such as the death of a candidate, etc. If, after much discussion in the electoral college, there was no majority of electoral votes for any candidate, the House of Representatives elected the president, for example John Q. Adams.



The system became obviously obsolete with the advent of overnight cross-country travel by airplane, and instant news via electronic communications. However, there are some obvious flaws (potential abuses and manipulations) with the "popular vote"  (one-person, one-vote) system, so we are apparently staying with the electoral college until a clearly better system can be defined.

The president is not chosen by popular vote. That would be like, count all the votes in the entire US and whoever has the most wins.



Instead the US uses the electoral college. So, each states gets a number of Democrat electoral people and Republican electoral people. The number is determined by the number of senators and representatives each states has. Anyway, when a candidate wins that state, then the electoral college people they chose get to vote. So, they most likely vote for that candidate, but they don't have to. The people chosen to be in the electoral college are well educated people that know politics. This kind of protects us against smooth talking politician. For example, if the electoral college felt that Obama was really a fraud and the good people of that state had been fooled, they could give their votes to McCain.



The founding fathers felt that there needed to be some way to make sure that gullible people were not taken advantage of. And you have to remember that, when they came up with this, most US people did not have the benefit of formal education.

Popular vote:  One vote equals one vote.



Electoral vote:  The majority of votes for a candidate equates to all the electoral votes going to that person.



Popular vote is the way to go now, with new technology and the ability of people to get to the voting stations.  Electoral votes was good in 1785 when farmers and others were unable to get to the voting stations.



Electoral votes are determined by population of a state.  That is why some states have more electoral votes than others.  It is not a fair way of assessing the process anymore.  That is how sometimes a person can win the popular vote but lose the election.

Am I hearing things?
I'm still waiting for the Democrats to let the notion of the 2000 election of George W Bush to "sink in."
Could they possibly help the "people of the nation come together and hope and pray that he does the very best" and all that and not endlessly mock him over NOTHING, call him names and accuse him of stealing the election with no proof whatsoever?
EIGHT YEARS!!!



And you're talking about 24 HOURS????



Please listen again to Senator McCain's concession speech from last night.



Contrast it to those of Al Gore and John Kerry.
Class v. bitterness.
Watch the public statements of Republican leaders and the gracious offers from President Bush to help smooth the path.
Night and day.



When Clinton came into office, he fired everyone from the Bush Administration immediately, leaving positions unfilled for months.
When Bush was elected, he kept many Clinton staff until their replacements could be confirmed, smoothing the transition for the good of the country.
Let's see how Obama behaves.

Hatred and love can sometimes go hand in hand.
For the ciizens who love their nation so much that they cannot bear to watch it fall or be compromised and endangered.



SO hatred comes .unequivocally, hatred comes.
Same goes for religion. The emotional reasoning is often irrational but it is sadly a human frailty



If you want the "other" side to accept your choice for POTUS, you have to give it time. RIght now, it is out of the question.



This is the nasty side of politics. It splits families and  friends

I give it a 95 on stupidity and a full 100 for both of them being malicious smear merchants.  Couldn't be more pleased they lost and lost BIG.  Gives me hope that it's just a minority of our people who lost their decency and morality in this country.  It became disturbing to realize just how many Republicans were hateful people who didn't mind spreading lies as long as it gave them a chance to stay in power.  So glad their day is over.

I'm relieved and proud to have OBAMA as President! Let's RUB THIS in the Repulicans FACES because I surely haven’t forgotten about the poor mistreatment that the red neck republicans handed out to the democrats in the past 8 years. Remember those stupid red neck republicans that wanted to give back the STATUE OF LIBERTY to France because France had the balls to critique Bush? Remember how the Republicans wanted to re-name french fries to FREEDOM FRIES? I specifically remember republicans telling any and all Democrats and any countries that didn’t agree with their backwards, lying, hating, cheating, stealing, Enron policy ways that if they didn’t like it they could go to hell or move to France. I will always remember the following Bush errors for the rest of my life: 9-11 (it happened with Bush leading our country!) The "Weapons of Mass Destruction" that never appeared and this country was thrust into war with Iraq. The "False" Victory in Iraq. The Enron scandal. The censorship of the general media and of citizens. The terrible Aru Ghraib prison abuse scandal in Iraq. Guantanamo Bay scandal. Numerous human rights violations all across the globe that the United States caused. The terrible lack of help during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina and stupid Barbara Bush's racist statements. The TAX CUTS to the WEALTHY. The high as a kite gasoline prices. The inflation. The Financial meltdown on Wall Street. The real estate crisis. The rise in the homeless population. The slashing of funding towards the reproductive health of women. The slashing of funding towards HIV/AIDS services and funding in crucial areas of this nation. Our broken healthcare system. Not enough funding for mentally ill patients who are homeless. In addition, there is more!

No. Only the 50 States PLUS the District of Columbia have votes, as does the Electoral College that represents those 51 entities. As those other places (including the U.S. Virgin Islands, Northern Marianas Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico, all of which are classified as 'organized' territories) and over a dozen 'unorganized' territories in the Pacific are not taxpayers, albeit under the protection of the United States, they don't get a vote. They have their own governments.

What's with the hate on Bush?



Any president that had to go through 9/11 would be criticized for whatever they chose.  On that day in September we all wanted us to go to Iraq and get everyone involved in the attacks.  Now that we see what it takes to do that we are blaming Bush for actually doing the things we wanted.  Inflation was going to happen due to oil prices and whether we like it or not, Bush couldnt do anything about how much OPEC was charging for oil.  Its supply and demand and we didnt start driving less until it got really high in price.  He could start off shore drilling but then all the environmentalists would come out and get angry that we are polluting more.  At the beginning of his term the housing market was soaring and everyone was trying to flip houses for a huge profit.  Once it cooled off those people that got loans to flip the house were stuck with a mortgage they couldnt pay.  Once again, we seem to blame that on Bush.  The banks then made the stupid decision to give loans to people that couldnt pay them.  The FDIC watches over banks but they are still publically traded companies that can do what the CEO thinks is best.  Then Bush has to act or bank runs would soon follow and then everyone criticizes him again because they dont think the government should bail them out.  So whatever he does he is screwed.  Due to gas going up in price, inflation rose, and then people didnt have the money to spend on other gifts.  Add that in with people losing their houses because they made a stupid decision to ask for a loan that they couldnt repay.  Some of this, us as citizens started, but we seem to want to blame it on someone and choose to do it on Bush.  We hate on him about the war but in the last 7 years has their been a terrorist attack on this country?

Good point "Why So Serious."



True "lol, internet" but FDR also killed tons of innocent people when he decided to bomb the Japanese.  The few that survived probably got cancer from the radiation.



The thing I disagree with is trying to install democracy over in Iraq.  I am all for trying to get the terrorists but trying install our values over there doesnt make sense to me.  If they came over to US and tried to put their beliefs on us we would fight back to.

Maybe if Bush hadn't been on vacation so much, he wouldn't have "had to go through 9/11":



"And there you have it. National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice has made a big point of the fact that Tenet briefed the president nearly every day. Yet at the peak moment of threat, the two didn't talk at all. At a time when action was needed, and orders for action had to come from the top, the man at the top was resting undisturbed..."

I think the real problem with Bush is the Iraq war.  People conflate high oil prices and a bad economy with this war though it's unrelated.
People felt betrayed when no WMD's were found and other information came out that showed deliberate use of false intelligence.  Then it becomes obvious we went to war on the cheap.
The problem with Bush is that he is too laizze faire and it made him look like he can't think for himself or even make good decisions.
That's what's wrong with him.
I think he did a fine job with the economy.
But the war was a big mistake.

Because he went to war based on America's fear, when he knew there was no connection to Osama.  I do feel like we have some responsibility to help other countries like Iraq, but he could have waited to get support from our allies.  If we all pulled together, we would have been much stronger, and probably would have gotten out of there by now.

I think people put too much blame on Bush as well. He's done some stupid things, but he only managed to accomplish those things because our stupid congress passed them. Congress is also at fault, but people put all of the blame on Bush. That's not quite fair.



Iraq was stupid. Period. Bush was stupid for suggesting it, and Congress was stupid for listening to it and declaring war.
"On that day in September we all wanted us to go to Iraq and get everyone involved in the attacks."
Uh, no, not all of us did, because many of us were intelligent enough to realize Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. Osama Bin Laden and Sadam Hussein HATED each other. They had nothing to do with one another. Hussein wasn't involved with Al Qaeda at all. Not a single 9/11 terrorist was from Iraq, so the war in Iraq isn't a "war or terrorism". We went to Afghanistan because that's where the terrorists were-- they weren't in Iraq.



Once that excuse failed, Bush said it was because they had nuclear weapons. When that proved to be false, he said it was because Hussein was an evil dictator that we had the moral responsibility to take out. Granted, it's good we got rid of him, because he *was* an evil dictator, but it's still a lame excuse because 10 years earlier (when Bush Sr was President), America was on Hussein's side during Desert Storm (well, technically we were doubledealing cheats who helped both Iran and Iraq, but that's a different conversation). We HELPED Sadam back then. Sadam was just as bad in the 90s as he was in this decade, so if we really had the moral responsibility to get rid of him, why didn't we do it back in the 90s when we had the chance? Better yet, if we *knew* he was this evil dictator clear back then, why didn't we get rid of him then? It seems to me that this "He's evil, so he needs to die" excuse didn't come into play while he was giving us money during Desert Storm, but showed up when it was convenient for the current President Bush. So, while I understand the logic behind that reason, it seems a little weak to me because it seems like a last resort more than anything else.



The war is stupid. It puts us millions of dollars into debt each month-- our government literally has no money. And that comes back to haunt citizens with taxes. I think the war has created many unnecessary problems.



The banks did give out loans they shouldn't have handed out, but the reason those companies could do that is because during Bush's terms (I think it started at the end of Clinton's term, and continued on into Bush's), most of the government regulation on those companies was taken away. That's what allowed them to run their own companies to the ground. Again, it's not all Bush's fault, but he was definitely a part of it.

I'm relieved and proud to have OBAMA as President! Let's RUB THIS in the Repulicans FACES because I surely haven’t forgotten about the poor mistreatment that the red neck republicans handed out to the democrats in the past 8 years. Remember those stupid red neck republicans that wanted to give back the STATUE OF LIBERTY to France because France had the balls to critique Bush? Remember how the Republicans wanted to re-name french fries to FREEDOM FRIES? I specifically remember republicans telling any and all Democrats and any countries that didn’t agree with their backwards, lying, hating, cheating, stealing, Enron policy ways that if they didn’t like it they could go to hell or move to France. I will always remember the following Bush errors for the rest of my life: 9-11 (it happened with Bush leading our country!) The "Weapons of Mass Destruction" that never appeared and this country was thrust into war with Iraq. The "False" Victory in Iraq. The Enron scandal. The censorship of the general media and of citizens. The terrible Aru Ghraib prison abuse scandal in Iraq. Guantanamo Bay scandal. Numerous human rights violations all across the globe that the United States caused. The terrible lack of help during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina and stupid Barbara Bush's racist statements. The TAX CUTS to the WEALTHY. The high as a kite gasoline prices. The inflation. The Financial meltdown on Wall Street. The real estate crisis. The rise in the homeless population. The slashing of funding towards the reproductive health of women. The slashing of funding towards HIV/AIDS services and funding in crucial areas of this nation. Our broken healthcare system. Not enough funding for mentally ill patients who are homeless. In addition, there is more!

Although I am not a supported of Bush, I do agree in that the criticism of Bush has been exaggerated.  A lot of policies of Bush have been poorly planned and executed.  Politically educated people are aware of his exact mistakes. Yet the public, influenced by largely exaggerating media, joins in the criticism when they really have no basis for saying this.



Bush did wrong yes.  But the public joins on the bashing Bush bandwagon making him seem like a worse guy than in reality. Plus they need a scapegoat to blame the war and recession on.  Although he has some fault, it's grossly exaggerated.

Your very smart my friend and I am taking political science myself and the answer for this my friend is that the media is so one sided that they have there noses shoved up one political side called the democratic party as we know they don't want to mention anything that has happened good for us in the past 7 years! We haven't been attacked as you mentioned! Not only our government for economics is horrible and they blame this on Bush this is absolutely blasphemy my friend how can you blame something on someone who has no control!? The real answer is for this look who is in control of our government for the past couple years and look how bad it sucks! The democrats and they think bringing in more will help there so into tax in spend its killing our country and not only you can think the democrats for passing NAFTA for killing this country opening up our boarders and killing our economy and there is nothing we can do now and this is why Hispanics and other minorities vote for them because they get treated like royalty while were left in the dust to rot! How can you pick a candidate to run for president when he has no knowledge on anything and only votes 16% of the  time and the other 80 plus percent he votes present, wants to pull out of Iraq, (meaning many soldiers will be out of jobs, they like to be over there that's what they have signed up for!) Pulling out of Iraq will only bring the terrorist here! Kind of funny we haven't been attacked since we left to Iraq?!!!! You can credit the democratic party for many screw ups and you have a lot of ideological young teens and adults voting for them because they think its cool? What is this? The question to ask is what has he ever done in his lifetime as a senator? Nothing and not only this have you ever heard of Obama before 2 years ago? Was he truly born in America? Isn't it illegal to send out billions of emails to people without there consent? And not only how did he get all this money truly? And he wants to ban guns, many hunters!!! I'm just overwhelmed how someone can win an election who isn't even a truly US citizen and only a senator for a couple years and never even served in the military and has no knowledge on anything whatsoever and afraid to make choices???

I totally agree!  The left-wing media has brainwashed a great number of Americans into believing that Bush is the worst president!  It seems the media shrugs off 'Slick Willie's' antics and scandals in the WH and conveniently covered up the fact that he gave us the biggest tax hike in US history - AND he had the golden opportunity to get Bin Laden, but he let BL go, which has fallen on Bush's lap!  Now, the media has everyone blaming Bush for not being able to get BL!  If Clinton had gotten him when he had the chance, Bush wouldn't have had to worry about it and chances are, 9/11 wouldn't have happened!!



Yeah - everything is Bush's fault in the eyes of the liberal media - and many Americans are true patsies to go right along with everything the liberal media says against Bush!



Bush has become the liberal media's scapegoat!  They'll blame everything on him, including earthquakes and hurricanes!!  Hurricane Katrina was blamed on him - did you know that??  I was shocked when people actually said Katrina was all Bush's doing - now that's really pathetic!!



The 8 years of Bush is going to look like a total picnic, compared to what Obama is going to do to this country - hang on to your seat 'cause we're going to be in for a LOOOONG 4 years of socialism=disaster!!



Edit:  lol, internet:  There was NOTHING illegal about the Iraqi war!  Bush did it all according to the Geneva Convention and took a vote on it FIRST!



If the Iraqi war was so 'illegal', then you have to blame some of the democrats, too - John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and others on the lib side!  Bush didn't go it alone and just send troops in without first consenting with the Geneva Convention - get a clue!!

AMEN BROTHER!!!!!
I totally agree!!!!  My husband and I were just having a discussion about this very thing.  I know that when 9-11 happened and my sister who worked at the time for Cantor Fitzgerald (in San Fran) called me screaming because she was on the phone with a friend of hers in NY when the first plane hit and basically heard her friend die... as I stood in shock realizing that what we were watching was not a repeat of the first plane hitting but Oh Dear God.. a second plane... as I fell to my knees that morning and sobbed at my 1 yr old sons crib side begging the Lord to make it stop... I was so relieved and wanted to kiss GW for saying we were gonna get em!  I was and have always been a supporter of this war.  Where does our freedom come from people!!!  Have we forgotten?



And as far as the economy... oh my Lord!!!!  Look in the mirror America.... I didn't see Bush holding a gun on people telling them to take out ridiculous mortgages and payday loans sending themselves into bankruptcy.  And what about the lenders?  I was a mortgage broker for many years and stopped about 5 yrs ago because lenders would give money to any Joe Blow off the street.  Giving loans for 150% of the mortgage value!  These banks knew that they would eventually foreclose and just assumed that when they did they would get their money back, well ha ha on them.  Where I live now there are actually people just literally walking away from their homes.  They can afford them, but don't want to pay the huge loan payments when they can pay less for rent.



I don't see anyone consulting Bush when they sign for those moronic payday loans, or buy a gas guzzling SUV and then gripe that it costs $85 to fill the tank every three days.  Why is it Bushes fault that we are an instant gratification greedy society?  He tried to give us a break with the stimulis checks and wouldn't you know it that everyone I knew who was not in financial trouble put it in the bank and those who were irresponsible blew it on a new Wii or computer or vacation!  Irresponsible it Irresponsible... hell even Forrest knew-stupid is as stupid does!



You don't like how the economy is going, then tighten up your belt!  Don't eat out, don't spend money to have something to do, play more board games at home, shut off your 12yr olds cell phone!  OMG!



Sorry, I watch so many people around me that are freaking out about a depression and blaming Bush.. all while they have empty beer boxes laying all around and havent had a homecooked meal in ages.  Taking out pay day loans to pay an electric bill and then blowing the rest on fast food and beer.  Buying houses that they can't afford.  You want things to change?  Then start with yourself.  If we don't buy these houses that are stupid expensive, then guess what happens..... the prices come down because they need to get paid too.  Houses where I live were 500K plus last year, we just went to look at houses and the same ones we looked at last year for 500K are now 275K and dropping.  I don't own my house because I refuse to pay more than I feel it is worth or that I am willing to pay out each month comfortably.  In about a year when prices are down even further, we will buy... something I am comfortable paying for.  You should be able to pay all your bills on ONE income at 40hours per week.  If you are trying to live higher than that then that is what is called living out of your means.  If more Americans took one of the person in the households income at 40 hours per week and made sure that your bills plus gas and food fall in that, then we would see our economy bend to meet it.  Just like gas got too high, people quit traveling and began using alternate forms of transportation and gee look, gas is down again.  And if you don't like how you would have to live om 40 hrs per week pay, then get a better job, sorry.  And I am by no means rich, my hubby works a middle class labor intensive job and I do not work.  But I drive a new car that is paid for in full and live in a nice neighborhood in a 2500 sq ft house, and we didn't start there, no... we saved and worked hard to have it easier now.



UGH... anyway... off my soapbox....  Stop blaming Bush for what we did to ourselves.  Blaming Bush only makes you look the fool.
Great Question!!!!!!!!!!

This one, but I have heard that it does not create a paper trail which would be of concern.  I do not know for sure that this is true, however.

My precinct (and my entire county) used paper ballots.  (They were the kind where you fill in the middle of the arrow.)  It was the same type of ballot we have used in the last several elections.  I prefer those paper type because I am wary of computerized voting machines that could be tampered with and don't leave a paper trail.

There isnt a damn thing republicans can do.  I'm relieved and proud to have OBAMA as President! Let's RUB THIS in the Repulicans FACES because I surely haven’t forgotten about the poor mistreatment that the red neck republicans handed out to the democrats in the past 8 years. Remember those stupid red neck republicans that wanted to give back the STATUE OF LIBERTY to France because France had the balls to critique Bush? Remember how the Republicans wanted to re-name french fries to FREEDOM FRIES? I specifically remember republicans telling any and all Democrats and any countries that didn’t agree with their backwards, lying, hating, cheating, stealing, Enron policy ways that if they didn’t like it they could go to hell or move to France. I will always remember the following Bush errors for the rest of my life: 9-11 (it happened with Bush leading our country!) The "Weapons of Mass Destruction" that never appeared and this country was thrust into war with Iraq. The "False" Victory in Iraq. The Enron scandal. The censorship of the general media and of citizens. The terrible Aru Ghraib prison abuse scandal in Iraq. Guantanamo Bay scandal. Numerous human rights violations all across the globe that the United States caused. The terrible lack of help during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina and stupid Barbara Bush's racist statements. The TAX CUTS to the WEALTHY. The high as a kite gasoline prices. The inflation. The Financial meltdown on Wall Street. The real estate crisis. The rise in the homeless population. The slashing of funding towards the reproductive health of women. The slashing of funding towards HIV/AIDS services and funding in crucial areas of this nation. Our broken healthcare system. Not enough funding for mentally ill patients who are homeless. In addition, there is more!

Truth be told, I don't know that they can.



Fair or not, and I understand if people say its not, but Bush is quite a scapegoat.



If things go well for Obama, the Republicans will not be able to beat him.  If things go poorly for Obama, he'll be able to blame it on Bush with some credibility.



I don't think the Republicans can really come back, at least on the Presidency, until 2016 at the earliest.  Now they may have a better chance with the Congress, that remains to be seen.  But I doubt they'll get the Presidency.

Obama is actually a terminator like in T2 where one is sent back for bad, and one for good (Obama). He has to rectify all the **** happening to the world.



Also, it's plausible that he has already foiled the bad terminator, McCain. The diseases on his skin are from oil leaks xD.

If you win the state, regardless of by how much, you get that states electoral votes. Say you win Nebraska by 10,000,000 votes. That gives you 5 electoral votes. Say you win California by 1 vote. That gives you 55 electoral votes. So even though the person that won Nebraska is up by 10M votes, he's down by 50 electoral votes. The same thing happened with Obama. He won the states he needed to win to get the electoral votes.

It's all a play on numbers and the various combinations.  States have a given number of electoral votes (I think based on population), and it is possible for a candidate to recieve the popular vote, yet not the electoral vote.  Strange, yes, but it was created so that states with little population would feel as if their vote counted.

<answer>



Electoral votes are a winner take all system for each state. So you have some 500+ electoral votes divided between 50 states based mostly on population. Let us take Minnesota as an example, which has 10 electoral votes. If Obama wins Minnesota with just .1% of the popular vote over McCain in that state, then Obama takes all ten electoral votes. So in an extreme example, a candidate could technically lose the popular vote by quite a bit and still win the election by collecting enough electoral votes by barely winning the right states while not getting any votes in the states they didn't win.



This is also why candidates often ignore states when running for President. Democrats have defied this wisdom for the last two elections in a 50 state strategy, which is one reason given for their come back in popularity.

I am not a supporter for either sides, but this is breaking many laws when sending illegal advertisement without any of our consent?

You signed up for something.  If you requested to be removed you were.  also registered democrats are on the list.  Again all you had to do was request a removal.  He did not do anything illegal nor did any part of the campaign or the Democratic Party.  there are very aware of those things.  They also RETURNED some campaign contributions if they did not follow the letter of the law.



Also it is not illegal to send anyone any e-mail or regular mail, as long as the mail it's self is legal.  There still is little regulating the internet and certainly not harmless e-mails.  Some internet providers have some spam regulations, but if you give your email address it is not spam.

Obama voted 89% of the time with the President.  Why?  Because almost 89% of those Senate votes are simple stuff that everyone passes.  McCain's ratio on the rest of the stuff (i.e., what would make one a maverick) is about 57-59% depending on one's definition of what should be considered.  That's about as maverick as it gets.  Face it, the guy's been a moderate RINO for 26 years.  He isn't going to change his spots anytime soon.

It is impossible for Obama to keep his promises. The promises he has to keep will depend on which personality Obama keeps when he is in the white house. Who he was as a senator and who he was on his campaign trail were two totally different persons, with a completely different set of "promises"and agendas. I believe it will be virtually impossible for hi to keep any promise he made, EVER. Besides we are all aware that the Democrats never say what they mean or mean what they say. They say whatever they need to say to please whatever group they happen to be talking to at that moment so he would first have to figure out what his promises really are. And no, I do not think he has any intention of keeping any promise that he has made, he is a shady person to his core, with no core values or beliefs. He will do whatever he wants to do when he needs to do it, right or wrong and if it backfires, he will simply blame someone else cause it went wrong.

I really don't think so; just because of what you said, it doesn't add up.  His plan will spend way more money than it will bring in.  Right now he says that he will tax people bringing in 250k or 150k or.....who knows.  He has said a few different numbers, but he voted last year to raise peoples taxes making 42000.  Therefore, I wouldnt put it past him to do that, to be able to pay for everything he wants to do.  That is one reason I didnt vote for him is because i make over 42000.

I actually have low expectations for Obama...



Basically, I want President Obama to pull the troops out of Iraq and that would make me happy........ but even that might be hard to do.... so I set the bar even lower.. I just don't want him to invade Iran.



Because McCain would sing "bomb, bomb, bomb Iran" which President-elect Obama brought up during the debate.  And that crazy McCain warmonger attitude was TOO MUCH!



So.... basically, as long as President Obama doesn't become a crazy warmonger, I'm good.

It was only about 45% of white people voting for Barack.



But yes we definitely still have racists in this country.  You can find them here if you look at some of the question before they get deleted.  I've seen several tonight using the N word.



But we're better than ever before and becoming less racist with each generation.

Not at all.  Whites will be considered "racist" until they are slaves or dead.  As long as we live in a country where James Byrd and Megan Williams are not mentioned in the same breath as Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome then expect no reconciliation to happen.  Positions in government mean nothing when your neighbors are raped tortured and murdered and no one sees the murder of whites by blacks and the murder of blacks by whites in the same light.



Until that time there will be no lasting peace.

I actually believe that the number was 43%. That's higher than most democratic nominees before him, though.



The number, however, was significantly lower among white men, according to exit polling data.

Why are Americans against Universal Health Care, Assault weapons bans & Wealth distribution?



It seems amazing that so many Americans, Republicans mostly, are so concerned about and Anti Social reform. Lets face it the so called free trade you have been use to has almost ruined your Economy and also spread the Financial Virus of deceit throughout the World! Its time Americans faced up to reality and sought Social Reform, as Australia has done by banning deadly assault weapons except for Police, Armed Forces, Security & farmers protecting life stock. Also you need free health care for all, not just the rich & a social reform package designed to prevent homelessness & poverty. Its Truly amazing that the Worlds most Powerful Country could allow Returned Servicemen & women to sleep on the Streets, due to inadequate Support. Agree? You have a model of a supportive, yet still Democratic Electorate here in Australia, to base your ideals upon. Good luck !

because he's not white.  my daughter is 1/4 black 3/4 white.  Yet my father in law (black guy) calls them black.  They don't even really look black.  I don't get it.
If Obama is half white, then we could call him white, since if he's half black as well and we call him black.
It's just because he looks more black than white.
Many american blacks now are 1/4 white anyway.  Look at the pure Africans and you'll see they look a lot darker than black americans.

I understand your question and wondered the same thing myself .  Honestly, I don't care what race he is, it is just genuine curiosity.  But, from what I gather, since he has an african father, then he considers himself black.  I read from another yahoo answer that in other countries he would be considered a brown boy.  Even then I wouldn't care what color he was.  It seems the black population keep perpetuating the "race" and "color" issue.  Maybe this election will prove to them that we really don't care about skin color.  Get over it and step up to the expectations those who are not "of color" holds themselves to.

Hardly anyone in America is "fully black."  In fact , all the world's populations are more mixed than people generally think. Race is really an artificial and superficial idea because human beings have been having contact with other groups and having children with them for many, many generations.  But we say "black" because our society has always classed people with even slightly different skin color as negro.  Even people of quite light colouring.  The Jim Crow laws did not exempt light coloured negroes.  So Obama is black, maybe not racially, but in terms of his identity.

I feel sorry for him, because he's not going to be able to fix anything to anybody's satisfaction - and even if he does a great job Neocons are going to come up with a thousand lies and excuses why it's not good enough.
He has a very tough job ahead of him - and Republicans are going to block him from doing anything to help this country at every step - because they don't want him getting credit for it.

You are right.  No decent person wants to see their president hurt, killed or otherwise incapacitated. I am a life long republican and I would be happy if Obama succeeded in bringing america back to glory.  I do not support his policies but he will be my president, elected fairly in a true democratic fashion.



These haters on YA do not represent Republicans.  They are a fringe group amongst themselves.  Hate is all they have and I pity them for that.



So are you ready to hear what a true republican proudly has to say about the election and Obama?



Congratulation Obama.  Congratulations to Obama supporters.  Your candidate ran a tremendous campaign and deserves the title of President Of The United States.

Well said.  I hope Republicans can do better than those who formerly hoped for a Bush failure and wanted the country to do poorly, so their ideals could be affirmed.  My ideals do not lie with a party or a name, but with the prosperity of my country.  I hope Obama does well.  God bless America!

I agree with you.  I can't believe some of the stuff I am hearing from hard-core Republicans.  What is really disturbing are the bulletins and text messages I am seeing that were written by people I consider close friends.



Stuff like:
Hurry and buy a gun now before they are outlawed.
Pray for innocent children that will be killed - (I assume this is a reference to abortion.)
Families are going to lose military jobs.
We are going to have another great depression.
We are going to have more 9/11s.



And I am actually getting racist texts, like:
The national bird is going to be changed from an Eagle to "fried chicken."  Have you ever heard something so outrageous that you start to wonder if you are on a hidden camera show?  I mean I cannot believe someone would actually say something like that!

This is almost entirely George W. Bush's fault - the self-proclaimed "Uniter" who was so contrite after he stole the 2000 election, ended up becoming the single most effective DIVIDER of the electorate, all in an effort to make the Republican party dominant.



In the end, all he did was destroy Republican chances of returning to power anytime soon, as well as destroying any chance of bi-partisan collaboration to address some of the very serious problems we all have to face.



Fortunately, our new President really IS a uniter, and hopefully we'll get past the trivial issues that divide us, so that we can work together.  Just because Dumbya spread hate, doesn't mean we have to keep it alive.

<question>



Was Obama elected because of race?



Being he had (has) no realistic (some would be tremendously harmful) plans for this nation, had good if not close connections to Reverend Wrong, known extremist Ayers, and other black nationalist groups, why was he elected when McCain had a relatively spotless record?



40% of whites voted for the man. The infamous "white guilt", perhaps? Or just stupidity from watching too much television?

if Obama was white and did and said exactly the same things he did, he would have been laughed off the podium during the primarys for having absolutely NO experience for the position.

Exactly; the double standard is incredible. Note, other answers were also good, but I've argued this bit before, so it relates a bit better personally.

He won because ppl blame Republicans for our current economy.  Also Obama raised more money than any other candidate ever and actors, entertainers and uneducated athletes said to vote for him so ignorant ppl with no political brains followed their idols.  I guess our country wants to pay more taxes.

I think 40% of White America voted for him because he courted the Unions - notice he won Ohio and Pennsylvania that have lots of union people in them. Also - they voted for him where they would not have voted for Jesse Jackson or another black candidate - I think partially because he is mixed and maybe more acceptable as the "First (Black) President.

No he was NOT elected because of his race. Your statistics are wrong baby. 55% of Whites voted for him, 66% young people of ALL races, and 53% Mexicans. Do u think they voted because of his race? Get it together baby and just accept the fact that the American people chose to take another route. We are tired honey. Instead of being so negative (especially with your "race" views") just put some stank on it and suck it up. Give him a chance. Jeez, did u not listen to McCain's speech last night? But yet u decide to poke your lip out and pout, looking like you've been sucking on sour grapes like a 5 year old child. I'm sorry but that just makes me mad. Leave the wagon and come join the band. Stand behind him, and if u don't want to do that, just go to another country, because people who are willing to think positive and stand strong most certainly do not need u here

Most blacks voted for him. Many of them who have never voted a day in their life. I also think there was a lot of "white guilt" which is ridiculous because a president should be picked because of his views, not his race.



Also- If McCain was black and Obama was white... how do you think most would vote?

Does anyone else feel like negativity is what cost McCain the election?



McCain was supposed to be about country, bipartisanship, and a change from the old republicans. Then he picks Palin, the female Bush, and he launches a series of nonsensical, horrid attacks on the Obama campaign instead of focusing on the issues. The only time I recognized the McCain I knew and loved was in his concession speech.

This question has already been asked a million times and the amazing thing is that all the people asking really don't know the answer and apparently think that this is the first presidential election the US has ever had.



The polls are open from 7am until 7pm. You will not start getting election results until at least 8pm. However there should be a projected winner by midnight.

It might be an upset in the US but I don't think it will make much difference to the rest of the world.



It would just be more of the same old same old rather than worrying about a new broom.



I have no opinion either way on McCain versus Obama, by the way, in case my answer indicates that I do.

We live in Pennsylvania and our votes are very important because it is such a tight race here. What do i say to this woman to make her vote, without making her feel like im yelling at her.  She says she's undecided and doesnt know who to vote for, so she's just not going to..
(oh and while we're at it, how do i make her vote for Obama).

The beauty of living in this country is she DOESN'T have to vote, and you don't have the right to tell her who to vote for.



Informed voters know this and they know they shouldn't be telling others who to vote for.



Edit: I don't know why the thumbs down.  It is wonderful that people can make their own choices in this country.



Edit: As far as campaign promises go, all promise the same things.  I have yet to see any really come to pass..like affordable healthcare.  Couldn't really afford it when DEMs were in office, and can't really afford it now.

It's everyone's right to vote or not vote. You can't make anyone vote. You can't tell them who to vote for either. It's her choice. But, tell her if she doesn't vote, she has no right to gripe about anything happening in the country during the next presidency.

You can tell her it is important to vote. Not only is she voting for president, but for people running for office in state, and local elections as well. But you should not tell her who to vote for. That is her decision alone.

Natasha you are undoubtedly a fool, to liken him to Hitler was more than just a dim remark.

It would have not been close because Obama would have the liberal and conservative supporters on his side.  The result is 52-47, but I suspect it would have 82-17 if the ticket would have been Obama/Palin.

Palin had a negative effect on McCain's campaign so you can only imagine the disaster that could have been had Palin ran with Obama.



I personally believe that had Obama selected Clinton as his VP this would have been an even BIGGER landslide for Obama.

I think he won because he is younger and can offer change. McCain is 72, remember what happened to Reagan, hum I forgot. This nation needs young energetic peep!

You mean what Powell said about how Obama will have to deal with a crisis on January 2nd or 3rd, yet he doesn't know what the crisis will be? I hope it woke people up to the fact that an invisible hand is most likely guiding the nation.

No.



Since McCain has conceded to Obama, no states have to do a recount or anything like that.  Obama is president.  End of story.



Add:  Shoot, try this on for size.  Any states that hadn't turned in their votes, the moment McCain conceded, their votes wouldn't really matter.  (Unless it was for one of the other people running for president I suppose.)  When the one concedes, then that's the end of it.

Is This An Appropriate Song For America This After-Election Day?



THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN'



Lyrics by Bob Dylan 1963



Come gather 'round people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone.
If your time to you
Is worth savin'
Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin'.



Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who
That it's namin'.
For the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.



Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside
And it is ragin'.
It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.



Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is
Rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.



The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is
Rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'.

if you haven't, do you really feel every single democratic candidate or republican candidate (depending on your party) was better than every single candidate of the other party (every single time)?

Does it bother you that people are trying to detract from President Obama's Victory?



He won the popular vote and won the electoral vote by 200 points yet people still say he will destroy the country and bring the end, etc. This sounds like a Hypocritical statement because the american people have  picked their prez but some people wanna assert that their individual opinion overshadows millions of people votes (that sounds like communism). give your thoughts and opinions in a respectful manner please

<question>



Why are so many modern North Americans still so hung up on race?



Reading the politics section I can't help seeing the enormous amount of racially-charged epithets regarding the Election.



Why is this?



</question>



<additional details>



I'm from the UK and yes my teeth are mostly filled.



And slightly yellower than those with veneers.



I'm not talking about 'propaganda for news', I'm just noting the amount of people on the Y!A politics section who seem to be bringing out the Klanspeak from the dusty cupboard of history.  Why so many?



"We are just as amazed at a queen who takes forever to acknowledge the death of the mother of her own grandchildren."



Wow, could you be less topical or analogous?



Hardly anyone gives a toss about the queen, or her opinion on her family.  You obviously do, but what has that to do with racially charged politicking?



*EDIT*



Note I did not say 'an entire continent', obviously the majority who voted Obama won't be using racial epithets.



I also got the 'teeth' bit in before anyone else did.  It's usually the thing someone will throw at you if you're a Brit commenting on US politics.

The ones who are hung up on race the most are the ones who call white people racist.  The do not seem to understand that by making a big deal out of their own race they are themselves promoting racism.  They have leaders here who play it up and get grants from the government to make a deal out of it for them, when in reality those very people hold them down.



Its a crazy little cycle.



But ya know, as far as the election, to have one ethnic man (can;t say black because he is only 14% evidently) as president in over 200 years is pretty historic.

well when minorities vote 90+% of the time for Democrats how can you say it isn't a factor?...90% is a dominating number, so of course it should be mentioned...also there are white racists that voted for Mccain because he is white and black racists who voted for Obama because he is black. You are from the UK so I'll give you a pass but I just don't get why Americans ask this question. I hate it too how their is separation of races in communities, income, and voting but until all races want to work with each other, there will not be any change. I hope one day to see the  equality that Martin Luther King was REALLY talking about.

I never considered myself racist prior to this election, but after being bombarded with racism from blacks, I feel differently about it now.  I mean, they were constantly accusing people of being racist because they didn't want to vote for their great one.  I didn't vote for him because I believe unequivocally that he has entrenched ideologies of radicalism and socialism.  I don't trust him for those reasons -- nothing to do with his skin color.  So why should that make me racist?  On the other hand, there were hundreds of thousands of black people that voted for him ONLY because he is black.  Now isn't that racist?  HMMMMMM

I could have cared less who won the election I feel the whites win no matter what. Obama is 1/2 white and was raised by white folks who he loved dearly so given that he would not hurt the whites his grandmom would not want that. He is a rich 1/2 black man so if the poor blacks think change is coming he used all of you to get what he wanted to be President of the United States. Dont start crying when you dont get what you want. DONT FORGET HE IS 1/2 WHITE EVERYONE LOVES THEIR MAMA AND GRANDMOM WHO RAISED THEM. LMAO stupid people!!!!

But 4real:



To all those who are not proud, why is that?  Because the system worked against YOUR favor?  Well, NEWS FLASH, it is a system to work for everyone.  There is a set model in place so that every year/every election, every law enacted, every everything is to be conducted the same way each time, and how the outcome ends up will be fair because the process has not changed.



Sorry, this election didn't work out in your favor but like all elections go: There is 1 winner, someone always loses.  Chill out and better luck next time!  How do u think us Dems. felt for the last 8 years?

I was one of those people, I have to say.  But as Im finishing up a year studying in Japan Im realizing how much I really do love America and how fortunate we are to live in such an amazing country.  I think its hard to be proud to be an American when it feels like so many people around the world seem to have you judged and figured out before you even start talking to them.  I have to be honest, Ive been ashamed more than once this year about saying Im American.  Ive been judged by it and have had to deal with endless ranting on the American lifestyle (though I do have to admit, there are so many things we need to work on). (And as a sidenote, this is not to say the world hates us.  Thats not true.  However the US isnt very popular.) But with President Obama about to take his place in the White House, I feel like our nation is heading down a very good, optimistic path.  Now that theres somebody in office who gives so much hope to so many people, I think more and more people who were anything less than proud of being an American will change their minds.  Im not sure where you stand on the election, but today, I have honestly never been happier to be an American.

I don't care about his skin color or name.  I care about his atrocious proposed policies and no I won't get over it.  I will criticize him because I care about my country.

Help me compile a list of all of Obama's promises?



I'm about to begin my website which will monitor Emperor Obama during the next four years.  One thing I want to do is report on all of the campaign promises he breaks.  So please help me compile a list of all promises he's made.  For instance:
1) Promised guaranteed health insurance for every American
2) In a speech yesterday, he promised "more pay for every teacher." So I'll be contacting teachers throughout the 4 years to make sure that every single teacher in the U.S. gets a raise
3) Every person of the middle class will pay less in taxes
4) An immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq
5) An immediate increase of troops in Afghanistan
6) He's promised he will capture Osama bin Laden



What else?

Forgive me if im wrong but it only seams to me like he won because  hes bi-racial...
Dont get me wrong, i think its totally cool you guys gotta black man in the white house... but what happened to voting on what these people believe and stand for?
I joined in with the hole  '1St black pres! whoo yh! win win win!' blah blah blah but now ive actually sat and thought about it, Do you think most of the people voted for him because they believed in his values and generaly supported his words?
Or do you think they voted mainly to change history, to make this man an historic character by the colour of his skin??



I could be totally wrong, im not even american so i have no idea how these things are shown to you but as a british women, watching the news, thats just the way it seams..

People voted for Obama cause he was black, and just as many voted for McCain cause he's not black.



90%+ of blacks voted for Obama and 90%+ of blacks would have voted for Hillary Clinton if she was the Democratic candidate.



The only difference with Obama is that MANY MORE people came out....and if you love democracy....that's a good thing.

McCain is weak on economic issues.
Bush is a failure.
Palin is a dolt.
McCain/Palin could not keep a coherent, focused, proactive campaign going.
Obama ran positive, eloquently, articulately, with focus & clear message.



There's your Obama win.

I voted for Obama because he's smart. He's written books, has a high IQ, and sounds like he knows what he's talking about. I don't care if he was a green haired hobbit, I always vote for smart competence over corrupt ignorance.

I think alot of us have questioned that as well. I personally voted for obama because i believe he can turn this country around and will be a man of his word...which was questionable with mccain who seemed to be a copy of our current president! But after you mention it....im sure there are probably quite a few people who may have let race be the soul deciding Factor for their votes.

I'm not happy he won.  Here are some reasons why.



- his threatening of legal action against the nra
- his proposal of a civilian national security force.
- his law enforcement "truth squads"
- the sing for Obama kids were scary -  even more scary, the fact that he featured this sick indoctrination on his web page
- his promise to cut funding in missile defense and slow development of future combat systems
- his proposed domestic programs that would greatly expand the already over-inflated size of federal government
- his proposal to raise capitol gains taxes on some would hurt our already ailing market
- his energy policies that would limit our energy options in terms of domestic drilling

I am smiling from ear to ear.  Finally, a president I can be proud of, a capable leader who'll create calm and confidence in this country.



You think you had it rough over the last eight years?  Try it as an American.  Whatever you're feel about Bush, add a profound sense of embarrassment.  Let me help you understand what it was like as an American living with Bush.  Imagine yourself in an airplane.  The airplane flies through a severe storm and begins to shake violently.  The lights flicker.  People start to pray.  The airbags deploy.  Then you go to the cockpit to get some reassurance from the pilot only to discover that the plane is being flown by a five-year-old who has absolutely no idea what he's doing and is running around, amusing himself by pressing all the buttons.

Our country has endured a bloody civil war and President Jimmy Carter.



Frankly, the fact that Obama won is no big concern.  The concern that I have is the "worship" of political leaders.  It is a very dangerous policy.



He is another president.  A mortal human being.  Not worthy of worship.  I hope that he turns out to be a great president who improves all of our lives.



I guarantee many will have disagreements with him, even may who supported him during the campaign.  It is the nature of politics.  Fortunately, we have a good system of checks and balances in our government.



But please . . .the songs and chanting have to stop.  It's over the top.

From an American, who cares what you think?!?



Like you though, a lot of Americans fell in love with his speeches and see him as the Messiah. They are drunk on the Cool Aid and the reality will set in soon enough. Everyone will then see he is all talk!



Of course the French love him, he feels the same as they do on socialist issues. He had a f#cking picture of Che on his wall for God's Sake!! When are you morons going to wake up? The scary part is that you may have already woken up and are happy with a socialist as president. That is the direction the majority of Americans WANT this country to go. Those that didn't help build or protect it that is!

And after the last illiterate gobshite you put in power, and the repercussions that had on the whole world, of course people over here are celebrating that an intelligent broad visioned man has just taken bush's place.

I think you will all be quite surprised by how little things change in the big picture. Now everyone sit down quietly and pray that he isn't assassinated. Also wait for the tax hikes that aren't supposed to happen ( always amazes me when tax goes up after they say they want to lower it ) 1 thing i give to McCain he was for drilling. not much else ill give to him ... well neither of them were that awesome. To bad Hillary messed up. And please dublin point out to me the " broad vision"

It was a fairly small victory on the popular vote, not a landslide. McCain got 47% and Obama got 52%.

The speech was very well composed and delivered, and it was great to hear.



I have to say McCain's speech was also very good - gracious and magnanimous (if he had spoken like this in the campaign I think it would've been closer).

This is a very, very, sad day for America. Ignorant voters have just elected a dangerous Marxist-Leninist socialist.



Unless you are a welfare dead-beat, be prepared...hold on to your wallet. Hold on to your purse.



I gotta blame my own neighbors. White suburban SUV-driving, McMansion owning, guilty Liberals, residing in their lily-white enclaves...trying to "prove" they are not racist.



My own neighbors voted for skin color alone, not the issues. Pathetic.



And a few million "Mickey Mouses", recruited from the homeless shelters to register to vote by ACORN. And driven to the polls today, drunk and high, given a free pack of Marlboros (Obama's fav brand) and instructed to vote for the Messiah. Those votes certainly helped the "ONE".



These  are the type that are genuflecting at his feet, tonight. Kissing the bling on his fingers, too. Ugly stuff.

Ooooh nice Britain jibe. I think you should all take it easy and stop generalising us all.



I think most Britains are gonna be in a very good mood with most Americans this morning, I for one am very grateful that the majority of you saw sense and have elected Obama, good move guys!
Just as all Americans are not the same, all Brits aren't either. Stop being so grumpy!!!

Not everyone is the same, you have to go by the person not the nationality.
I know not all Americans are not brash and full of themselves.  It's just a shame that these sorts of people give others the wrong impression.
It's the same everywhere.

his father was african, and his mother was American.



I think that's pretty damn African American.



ADD: African American is also COMPLETELY seperate from being black. Egyptians are african, they aren't black. Haitians are black, they aren't African.



And even then, black is a skin color, not an ethnicity. His skin is still fairly black, therefore I would consider him to black.



Overall though, there are so many little words you can use to describe someone'e background and appearance. But one thing is for sure: he is 100% American. Whether he is "black" or "African American" or "bi-racial" is completely irrelevent.



He has still hit a milestone for minorities.

It would only be an issue if he didn't address HIMSELF as a black man, but he does alot of times say he's a "black man" so i go with how he identifies himself



Plus he's half AFRICAN not half african-american. his father was born and raised in kenya which could actually make him more "black" than alot of regular african americans who were here from slavery. Kenya has no ties to slavery at all so all the people in kenya all full african blood.



EDIT: Y'all are real dumb! lol you don't know about history, check the definition of what it means to be an AFRICAN-AMERICAN it's different than coming from Africa as an immigrant and getting citizenship. If Obama's father had citizenship (God rest his soul) he would be called kenyan-american NOT african-american, that is a term only for the decendents of slaves brought to america from africa. but whatever i ain't gonna school you guys no more....keep giving those thumbs down

Most are just frustrated.  There is no need to assassinate anyone.  Obama won, the Democrats control both houses of Congress.  Let's see what they do.  If History is any teacher, the House will return to Republican Rule in two years (just as it did when Clinton raised taxes) and Obama will be out in four (just as Carter was after energy costs "sky-rocketed" and our military was seriously weakened.)

In my opinion, it's wrong to wish anything bad upon someone else.
Obama has a family and he has friends.  If my own father/mother/friend became president, I would not want anyone to wish death upon them.  Would you?

People like this are sick, and can not tolerate defeat.  Making clear your differences and your criticisms is one thing - wishing harm on the man that won instead of your candidate is quite another.



Okay, he won.  He is basically guaranteed four years in the white house.  If you're that upset about it, focus on your movement in 2012.  The country has spoken.  You don't have to respect Obama, but perhaps you can respect the vote.



Any person that wishes Obama would be assassinated are the really extreme contingent of sore losers.  If they weren't guilty of such outrageous claims and demented fantasies, I would say they're pitiful.  But they're not.  They're just pathetic.

It'd have been sooo much better if he wrote it himself.  But he didn't.



I must say though.  Obama's stance.  Change, over "More of the Same", seems a lot like a pig wearing lipstick.  We've had democrats in office before.  Socialistic ones as well.  Obama IS more of the same.  Just not the same as the last 8 years.



Democrats and Republicans have run this country for 200 years.  It's all, more of the same.  Give a 3rd party a chance.  They are the only ones that bring Change.

Why is the electoral college still around?



I'm just curious, we call ourselves a Democracy, yet we do not go by the popular vote, is that not a republic? Yes, we did vote today, but it doesn't matter unless there is a close run in the college. Why is it still around? I thought it was created because of a communication issue centuries ago, which i don't see today...

I had a conversation with my friend about this. We are not a democracy but a Democratic Republic. The first founding fathers were afraid of mob rule and wanted to distribute the power of the people. Our influence is within the senate. This will prevent abnormal swaying of political interests.

Absolutely!



At least 2 out of 3. He was in the right place, Democratic party and at the right time, a time when everyone hates Bush and Republicans. You could argue that he is the right man only because of his skin color that netted him 96% of the black vote (notice I didn't say "African American"). That is a devisive phrase that keeps hatred alive. I'm a Scotish American and probably much closer to my roots than 99% of blacks of African descent. But, I'm an American!

I think he will become one of the greatest presidents of all time if he can get us to start working on renewable energy, Help with Global warming, have other countries see us in a more friendly way in foreign affairs, and Find Osama Bin Laden and end this war on terror.



Not to mention help our economy get back on it's feet.  If he can do all that, he will be an amazing president, and if he does all that and someone still kills him because of the color of his skin, then he will still go down in history as one of the all time greats.  I hope people will give him a chance before they judge him, and I hope they will judge him negatively with words, not with a bullet.

There is no time to lick wounds, point fingers, and wallow in post-election mud.
We have to stand up for our principles, as we always have — through Democrat administrations and Republican administrations, in bear markets or bull markets, in peacetime and wartime.



We stay positive and focused.



We keep the faith.



We do not apologize for our beliefs. We do not re-brand them, re-form them, or relinquish them. We defend them.



We pay RESPECT to the office of the presidency. We count our blessings and recommit ourselves to our constitutional republic.



We gird our loins, to borrow a phrase from our Vice President-elect.



We lock and load our ideological ammunition.



We fight.



First assignment for fiscal conservatives in Washington:



1) Oppose the Democrats’ next stimulus boondoggle.
2) Oppose Obama’s windfall profits tax proposal.
3) Oppose new bailouts for states deep in debt.
4) Oppose new foreclosure prevention measures that will simply provide perverse incentives for borrowers to walk away and delay a needed market correction.
5) No more federal loan guarantees for corporations

Really stupid and unsincere.
I pity his supporters.
Remember what Bush did to get voted for the second time ?



Obama's been making fun of McCain uncounted # of times.
And when his supporters joins too, he do nothing to stop it but laugh as well.
McCain's speech tonight WAS the BEST speech in the 08 elections.
And when the supporter boo at the mention of Obama, McCain told them to respect the friendly-jihadist.



McCain was the TRUE hero.

He was being realistic as they say Rome was not built in a day. GWB screwed this country up for nearly a decade. Getting the country back on the right path is not going to happen quickly and no one should expect it too.  Bill Clinton was able to clean up much of the mess that the first George Bush made and he’d only be in office for four years.

Okay, "Kat J", what are you talking about?  How is asking people if they can respect the power of the vote, and the power it yields, disrespectful?  Those who are offended by this question are clearly feeling defensive tonight, and for what cause?  Have you noticed that everyone who "belittles" or "berates" also happens to be on the losing side?  You think that by reading two sentences you can talk to me about my sentiments and opinions?  Are you a Republican, or McCain supporter?  Because if so, all I have to say to you is - wrong again.

Congratulations if you supported Obama.  It is not uncommon for someone who has experienced a loss to feel a little sad or depressed for a while.

I live in this country and I didn't vote for Obama. And no I can't respect the vote, since they came from a majority of people who just voted for Obama because he is black. Don't believe me? OK.

not when people voted for him because they didn't like Bush...or because of their race...or because of the lies told to the american people through the liberal media...George Bush was a great president...he did what he said he was gonna do...great economy, best in years until the democrats got into office...made us feel safe at night with no more terrorist attacks...now 8 years of hard work is flushed down the toilet...i hope you people are happy now...you all are an accessory to murder when this country falls...

I respect the fact that once again a man has lies his way into office.



When are people going to quite selling their vote so cheaply? So if I promise to give you $1000 in tax breaks and you  will give me your vote?



By the way, I have promised to do what I can to raise your electric bill and gasoline prices to force you to use less. I am gong to take control of your health care and tell you if you can get medical treatment, when and where.



And since I have done such a great job with managing the financial end of social security, medicare, medicaid, fanny may, fanny mac and managing the rest of the federal budget,  I am promise you  that I am going to do what ever I can to take control of what ever money you have left and manage it for you.



Just think, no more worries! We, the federal government, will take care of all of your problems for you! In fact, we will gladly manage all aspects of your life for you.



Isn't socialism great! Now we can be just like the USSR! Such a shining example of how to correct everything that is wrong in the world!

should i respect the votes people i know personally gave him just because he is black? should i respect the votes six college girls gave him because they think he's cute? should i respect the votes he got simply because people thinks he speaks well? (hitler and po pot both gave great speeches) should i respect the votes he got because he had a good catch phrase? i can respect the votes he got because people agreed with his position on the issues (even if i do not agree with most of them). personally i think he got a lot of votes for the wrong reasons.

Agreed, they don't want to say it because they think they aren't "racist", but the fact that a black man won over a white man upsets a lot of people. It's politics and progress people, not skin color. I love this country, and I don't want to see it Rest In Peace. If you're upset about the results, go do something. Go volunteer, help this country instead of complaining.

Other  countries  wanted  Obama  to  win  b/c  they  knew  he  would  lead  the  way  for  government  to  continue  to  strip  away  God's  plan  for  America,  tear  down  the  basic  Judeo-Christian  principles  that  our  country  has  long  honored  since  we  first  became  a  nation.  They  know  that  under  Obama's  leadership,  it  will  be  the  final  nail  in  the  coffin  for  us  to  be  destroyed.  We  have  turned  away  from  God  and  refuse  to  repent  of  our  immorality,  and  greed.  I  know  God  will  take  care  of  me,  but  what  about  my  loved  ones  that  may  not  yet  be  in  fellowship  with God.  What  about  all  the  innocent  children  who  are  being  brainwashed

Why are you all so negative, are you so afraid of the rest of the World that you want to 'Enforce World Security'?  You have it in your head that everyone wishes they were American when the truth is that most of us are grateful to be anything but American. Half of Americans live in third-World conditions but are so brain-washed that they don't realize it, having been fed 'Ultra Patriotism' from birth, I see this in the answers above mine.  I'm pleased that Obama won simply because he's a Democrat, clearly you morons are not. We all know the Politics of the Fox Network.....

Not immediatly. One of them has to die or resign first.



ADD: According to NPR, it probably will stay the same. The judges who are possibly nearing retirement are liberal judges anyways, so Obama's judges would just replace them, and it would be the same break-down of liberals to conservatives.

The Supreme Court won't change unless one of the supreme court justices either dies or retires.....and then if that happens, watch out for the biggest liberal judges to be named to replace them.  What can we do to stop it, make sure that none of them want to retire and let this country go even more liberally like France, and make sure that any attempt on their life from the liberal "oops...must of been a terrorist attack" is actually investigated and the true culprits of Polosi/Boxer/Shumer/Reed/and Obama are tried for TREASON & MURDER.

Is there any conservative Justice that is going to retire in the next few years?  I really cannot stand people [on either side--and I am conservative like you] who don't truly think before they post a question.  The only way any President can propose a candidate as a Justice on the Supreme Court is if there's an opening.  Re-read your grade school social studies book.  Presidents can only appoint [with congressional approval] new Justices, not remove and replace current ones.

Yo Doom and Gloom--
What you know about history you can stick in your eye--the only guaranteed destruction of this country will happen when you find someone flaky as you are. Ohhhh-a Liberal Supreme Court!!!!!!!!! Death and Destruction!!!!! Oh Boy, what a Nitwit. Have you managed to get your tootsies in a bundle long enough to actually study the XCourt enough to even name them?
I thought so. Better yet, Presidents who have named Supreme Court Justices with political ends in view have almost invariably been disappointed. Even Clarence Thomas and Souter have disappointed--Only Scalia has been a conservative loony. Roberts is the perfect Chief Justice--pale, bland, and a complete dummy. All the others have underwhelmed us, but a few have turned into cyphers.
so get'em

YES. Oprah is a hypocrite and racist! During an interview with the white lady doctor, Oprah put subtitles - yes subtitles. The lady spoke more perfect English than Australian anyway. Then they interviewed some of her African patients who spoke broken English (at best), yet no subtitles. Again she put down the white person to try to make her own people look better
2.Oprah always likes to make fun of British and
Australians on her show by doing really crap imitations of their accents.
Why doesn't she do this with African or Asian guests?
I have only watched the show five times, enough to come up with these conclusions.

Obama.........................…



Why do most black people/Obama fans see Obama as some sort of savior and hero? Like as if he is a messiah, its really putting off, due to the fact that Obama is nothing like that, yet people worship him almost as if he is something great and good, and the fact that most of his 'fans' don't even know what they are voting for. There going into that booth, blind, with the image of Obama as some sort of savior in their minds.
Im not a McCain supporter either, but the whole Obama worshipping is totally obsurred.

Well lets see now -- masses of people worshiping a Savior/ Messiah with no credentials and no proof of any of his talent/ miracles except a massive publicity machine fueled by Roman soldiers over hundreds of years. Sound familiar? Sure no one has even read his proposals on his website? How many people do you think have actually read the good book and debated its glaring contradictions and inaccuracies? Its never about the truth. Its all about the PR.

Bush on the Constitution:



A 'goddamned piece of paper'
By DOUG THOMPSON
Dec 5, 2005, 07:53



Last month, Republican Congressional leaders filed into the Oval Office to meet with President George W. Bush and talk about renewing the controversial USA Patriot Act.



Several provisions of the act, passed in the shell shocked period immediately following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, caused enough anger that liberal groups like the American Civil Liberties Union had joined forces with prominent conservatives like Phyllis Schlafly and Bob Barr to oppose renewal.



GOP leaders told Bush that his hardcore push to renew the more onerous provisions of the act could further alienate conservatives still mad at the President from his botched attempt to nominate White House Counsel Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court.



"I don't give a goddamn," Bush retorted. "I'm the President and the Commander-in-Chief. Do it my way."



"Mr. President," one aide in the meeting said. "There is a valid case that the provisions in this law undermine the Constitution."



"Stop throwing the Constitution in my face," Bush screamed back. "It's just a goddamned piece of paper!"

of course why would you think he wont
he may change the second amendment if he can get congressional support
but that amendment is out of date and no longer needed
and that would be constitutional
the question is i the Constitution is changed will you support the Constitution and hand you gun in or when it doesn't suit you your no longer a Constitution supporter

I'm sure that just like all the other Senators and Representatives, President Obama will conveniently forget that the 9th and 10th Amendments to the United States Constitution exist.



Write your Congressmen and Senators and ask them to support the Enumerated Powers Act.

No, I'm sorry to say that we see very little information regarding any other countries politics -- unless it's a country where the people are being told to vote for a certain candidate or else they will be killed or something.  Like what happens sometimes in middle eastern countries.  Otherwise, I'm afraid we don't hear much at all about your elections.



Too bad to as I've heard that your healthcare system is far better than ours and maybe we could learn something from your country and other countries if more people were actually exposed to news about your government.

As arrogant and ignorant as this sounds no they are not. And the first person to post your answer is the same type of idiot, that just elected the newest moron to the Oval Office.
You have to forgive te anger you are seeing here by a few of us. It is not that we do or do not like Obama. It is that we have just given away every check and balance our system had. We have more or less just turned this country into Russia. By this I mean the Democratic party has no one to stop them. They can enact what ever laws they want. Would I be just as pissed if t was the Republicans? Yes I would. Cause no one party should have absolute power. Keep a close eye on things as you are about to see America become the Once Late Great America.

I love Obama 2

</question from>



<question>



I know God does not make mistakes and even the wise can not see all ends. But,I have to wonder why Obama?



I just wonder what good could come out of a President that:
1. Did whatever it took to win
2. Is willing to let botched abortion babies die
3. Called Gov. Palin a Pig and Sen. McCain an old fish
4. Friends with terrorists and radicals
5. Took Phantom money, from sources unknown to anyone
6. At this very minute has a damning tape that the networks will not release
7.Did nothing in the Senate
8.Has no plans for America except raising taxes
Obama winning just does not make sense to me. We all have worked so hard for what we have. Why do we have to give it away in taxes or worse lose our jobs. Now,  we no longer have and option, now we are stuck with a man whom his own advisers say "they know nothing about". I have had several offers to write a fantasy book and perhaps a comic book. I am going to spend my weekends and free time writing working on that book now. I know as a Black father and business man my work and expertise mean nothing. 96% of Blacks voted for Obama including most of my family members. I graduated top of my class and I begged them to look at the facts... no one listed. If I had known the Presidency lent itself to such propaganda... I would have became a watch maker.



</question>



<additional details>



Because I am the mom,



Yes, I have put great thought into that and I as a Black man I really wanted him to be a good person but his actions prove otherwise. His actions show a man bent on his own self serving no matter the cost. Some telling examples are the times he lied with no shame or remorse:
1. It is documented durning the election he lied over 150 times.
2. How he is willing to work with evil people if it promotes his agenda like Rev. Wright and Williams Ayers.
3. How he is willing to throw people under the bus for his own causes.
4. How his own advisers and team "do not know him"
5. How he is willing to let people lives be destroyed, people like Joe the Plummber because they question him
6. How he is willing to let his own family live in poverty.
So, I have to say he is a monster, and I suspect he will verify that as time goes on.

Thank you for your words. They say a man who stands for nothing will fall for anything. Obama strikes me as a man who stands for nothing ... expect socialism. Please help me understand why  people think everything is going to be OK now?

Has no plans for America except raising taxes - ?  Are you kidding me?  Do you even know how to read?  I almost hope that you are illiterate, because otherwise there is no rational explanation for such stupidity and lunacy.  If you had "looked at the facts", you wouldn't have made such a dumb statement.  Why are you guys such sore losers?  I felt a little bad for you at first, realizing that if I would've had a bad night if I had been in the same situation, but a good quantity of you... just aren't deserving of that compassion anymore!  GET - OVER - IT - ALREADY.  The country has spoken.  Sorry you and your petty ideals were in the minority, but that's just the state of things, isn't it?

Well stated.  I believe a lot of people voted for Obama due to the color of his skin.  They should have looked at how he is going to perform.  It would be awful for the first black president to totally mess it up for all minorities that follow.  That is a lot to carry on one's shoulder.  Hope Obama thought of that.

i wonder the same thing. my family has prayed so much that, if it was his will, that he would not let obama win this election. but I guess God said no this time. and we dont know what it is, but God has a plan for this and whatever he has planned, either good or bad, its gonna happen, whether we like it or not. i personally strongly despise Obama for what he says he will do and what he has planned. the u.s. is in deep deep trouble, but God will protect us if we turn to him. i am so dissapointed that obama won the presidency. i seriously wanna cry. THIS SUCKS!

Ah, but you can't forget about Palin, since she's the reason Stevens won. He will get booted from the Senate, Palin will replace him on the ballot, and she will coast to victory in the special election. We haven't seen the last of her (unfortunately).

I have no respect whatsoever for McCain.



He dumped his first wife for Cindy McCain and her millions, while his first wife hadn't recovered from her accident.



He crashed how many planes?



He voted with Bush, by his own admission,"more than 90% of the time."



He promised to keep the wars going, regardless of the consequences.

I believe McCain would have been an exceptional President. He has proved his love and dedication to his country through his long service. He put his life on the line for it and nearly lost it several times. He suffered torture and starvation for it. He is a PROVEN legislative leader who has written and passed several pieces of MAJOR legislation and countless minor ones, many with bipartisan support. His plans for smaller less intrusive government is what the country badly needs, not more.

I absolutely agree.



I was actually inclined to vote repub in the onset, but then I saw McCain exercise some questionable decisions. I also saw Obama handle some less than polite criticisms with class, which ultimately won me over.



Coming from a military family, I have nothing but respect for Sen. McCain.



My only concern now is that Obama has an enormous task in front of him. And even though our government is riddle with Dem's, it doesn't necessarily mean Obama is on easy street.



Histroy has shown that when a Dem Pres. was in office with a Dem House or Senate, or vice versa, less was accomplished because of all the in-fighting.

Absolutely. I'm not American, but if I was I would be a democrat, but John McCain has my uttermost respect. What he suffered for America, makes him a hero in every sense of the word. I wholeheartedly agree with you and it saddens me that so many democrats are making fun of him, when he fought for Americans, so their future generations would be able to have the right to vote and chose their own government. Anyone who risks their life for their country is a hero and John McCain is exactly that.

Bush has called the ambassador from Saudia Arabia 'Bandar Bush' becuase the cousin of Osama Bin Laden has worked so well with Bush in the past, bailing him out of one oil bankruptcy after another.

If anyone is in bed with Osama, it is Bush, who has ties to the Bin Laden family going back decades. What other reason does Bush stop his attack of Bin Laden, let him creep into Pakistan, and then have Bush go attack Saudi Arabia and Bin Laden's enemy, Iraq?

Obama or Osama?

I don't think either one is a good choice to lead America. Obama is a self admitted pot smoking, cocaine snorting tobacco user. He says he didn't try Heroin because he did not like his dealer. Not because it was illegal and morally corrupt! And who can look up to this kind of man?

His pretty words and unbelievable naivety don't convince me that this is the best man to lead Democrats to victory. We are all being fooled because the media fawns over the first black candidate.

The really big problem is Americans have all been conditioned to believe it is a choice of ONE or the OTHER, Obama or McCain. Neither one IS a choice too!



In reality, we can vote for anybody we want, don't cave into either party choice, if ever there was a year to slap Republicans and Democrats across the forehead, this is it.

But Obama is a joke, and people who vote for him should know better than to be suckered and fooled.

Yes it does. Obama has no emotion. He is cold and calculated. And the fact that he spent 20 years in a America Hating Racist church, does not help matters. He is not passionate about America, and if you don't have passion, how can you have positive change or growth? When I listened to John McCain last night, I saw a Proud man, who has survived a POW Camp, and he has more passion for America, in his little finger,then Obama every will. And I know I have made the right choice.

You are on to something. When the parents of Obama & Osama had them, they called each other to make a secret pact. Obama's parent's plotted to make him a canadate for president & Osama's trained him from a baby to be a terrorist. The like sounding names was designed to confuse the 2 so simple minded American's would not be able to tell them apart. This master plan is working.

I'd vote either BNP or UKIP.
Both parties want to take back control from Europe and contrary to the belief, the BNP have the British born people and their needs at heart regardless of your colour or religion.
I've taken the time to research their policies and being a black British born man, they would help put right the things that both Labour and the Conservatives cocked up over the years.

labour actually, mainly because the tories are pathetic, they make alot of promises but they never quite explain how they plan to do it. they cant change the world, all they seem capable of doing is insulting other mps. cameron is the most vile creature i have ever seen. conservatives are for the rich, even now, however much they pretend to be for the masses. cameron is educated beyond his intelegence and in my opinion has nothing to offer this country. they are out of touch, elitest and in my opinion, dont understand the everyday difficulties. for instance, cameron picked which school to send his child to, which was not in his cachment area, is that fair? doesnt that suggest that he believes himself above the system?. i understand that alot of bad things are happening at the moment, the problem is many are beyond the government control, unfortunatly people feel the need to have a scapegoat. yes they need to decrease fuel tax, but theyll need to make that money from somewhre else, thats how it works. there will be the same amount of taxes under the tory, but maybe theyll just spread them around a bit.i fear for our country if we have a tory governent. going to the right is never good, capitilist, overtly national, its one step from fascism.

also, ukip are one policy party, they have nothing to offer us, and bnp? well, im a history student, and ive read all bnp literature i can get my hands on, and its scarily similar to that of nazi party propaganda,or itallian nationalism.  re patriation? if ur black british, you will eventually be forced to leave. it says that quite clearly. they promise much, but explain nothing, there ideas are rediculous and unworkable, immigration is an important part of any countrys economy, im training as a nurse and i understand the need for imigration, the nhs needs immigration. unfortunatly british people just arent interested enough.

The disadvantage of having two large, main parties is that people find it hard to tell the difference. When Major was PM we had the same sort of discussion - isn't it time to remove the Tories?

In a decade or so (barring something unexpected) we'll be argueing whether its time to switch parties. It's one big cycle: Labours been in power for more than 10 years, so the media starts to turn against them. After 10 years, the media will turn on the Tories, and we'll switch back.

I can answer this using a singe word "Obama".

Out of all the main candidates that entered the primaries, Obama has the best record of fighting for the rights of the average man on the street. He's



championed more causes for low and middle income Americans that anybody else and he hasn't done this by taking it out of  the wealthy either like Clinton would.

Yes.

And his name is Senator Barack Obama.

He really does have a vision for this country.  And visionaies have a way of making things happen.  They really do think outside the box.

They're fearless, yet extremely focused.

Just look at the founders of MicroSoft, AOL, Amazon and e-Bay.  All visionaries.  All very successful.

When Obama becomes the President, America will be in for some wonderful things.

McCain might have been best for our country in 2000 before the Bush/Rove machine got through trashing him. In case you have forgotten their dirty tricks, here is a review:

http://www.bartcopnation.com/dc/dcboard....

Now it may be too late for him to make a comeback. In any case, wasn't it repulsive to see Bush waiting for him on the White House steps to try and squeeze some political benefit out of "endorsing" him? Almost as if he was enjoying bringing down his old enemy again with the "kiss of death."

I think people in general are angry at Republicans, and Democrats are far from crazy, just a bit disorganized.
While McCain is an alright kind of guy, he seems just short of carrying the load of the presidency, something like the way I felt about Bush, nice guy, but not quite strong enough.
The next four years are going to demand a very strong, quick, intelligent person, one who isn't afraid to do things that may not be popular because, like taking unpleasant medicine, we have to resurrect our economic status in the world or resign ourselves to being a second rate country.
I don't see McCain doing this, he's shown a willingness to turn his back on the people who have voted for him so far, the independents and more liberal branch of the Republican party, and kowtow to the conservatives, who are not as mighty within the party as Huckabees lack of voters has proved.

Both.  I am voting *for* McCain AND *against* Obama.

In other words, if McCain wasn't an option, I'd still have to vote against Obama. But, I like McCain!  It was very easy for me to switch from supporting the moderate Hillary to supporting the equally moderate McCain.

BTW -- I will also be voting *against* Pelsoi and her ilk by voting a straight GOP ticket!  The first time in my life that I vote for the GOP and I'm going all in!

Given that Rove has been such a master at this...I must take him at his word.  :)  I could also look at it this way, perhaps the lying didn't really bother Rove at all, perhaps he was most bother that McCain has been an amateur, Rove's brilliance is that he ALWAYS maintained plausible deniability...McCain keeps getting himself on the record with is misinformation.

Do you Americans actually ask any questions about "issues" in this election or is it all about childish.....?



....slagging matches.

The absolute rubbish we see posted on YA has nothing to do with actual issues and policy.

What's with the silly name calling and crazy accusations from both sides ?

I don't see many questions here about economic issues, crime, health, education etc etc.

Why is this ?

Does this stuff not matter ?

As a non American I find it to be amusing on one hand but a little worrying on the other that a people entrusted with picking the most powerful person in the world seem to be treating this decision as a high school popularity contest.

Believing only in what diatribe the media feeds them on on political choices; no matter the issues. Political Ads get canidates elected.

Are you surprised? Really? Our country was founded by the people who thought old-timey England wasn't strict enough. One time they accidently showed a boob on tv during the superbowl. All the children here got eye cancer from seeing it. True story.

Uh, here's an idea:  Don't look at YA for political insight to the U.S.  Dude, not smart to make generalizations about our country based on freakin' YA.  Maybe you don't realize, but this really isn't a very serious political forum.  You may want to do some research before casting judgement.  God, so smug!!

Adversarial running contests create playground bickering and childlike popularity contests.
Perhaps we should be asking people what they want to happen rather than who they want in power. This might yield more positive results and lead to policies and actions most people want.

There are a few questions that pertain to the issues. However, it's mostly just name-calling.
I asked a serious question earlier and was berated for the question by several answerers. I also received my first hate/rant email from one of them. That was interesting, but it did make me chuckle.

It is ridiculous and pathetic.  Unfortunately, on the rare occasion that there is an intelligent question, the responses are overwhelmingly ignorant and off-point.



I do, however, think that the majority of the people in this section are under 18 and are not able to vote but are content to spew the garbage they hear from their parents.

i will take the time to answer your question with out the pain of an insult from you because the answer is simple: IT is all about distracting the masses with silliness and stupidity. Most of the people on this forum only go by the talking points from their party they support. Many people on here are bloggers who think they are smarter than they really are. When one party the Democrats for instance nominate a man like Obama who has no real discernible record you can not talk about the issues. Obama claims he is for change but yet nothing about his pandering is new or revolutionary. He subscribes to classic socialistic ideals: Class warfare, tax the rich and weaken the military and appease our enemies while claiming he alone can solve everyones problems
Now lets take McCain. The base conservatives were not fully behind him because of his stances and going against the party norm thus considered a "maverick". He too adheres to class envy and is on board with the notion that man is causing global warming which is not what conservatism is but yet he does adhere to the core beliefs of conservatism with a great stance on the war in Iraq and national defence in general. He too is pro-life which is always a positive with conservatives.
Everything was going Obama's way until McCain selected Gov. Palin of Alaska. She is what conservatives dream about 100% so now the base in unified behind McCain and Obama's poll numbers are dropping so Obama and his surrogates and the DNC have to attack her. This was a brilliant move by McCain becuase now the focus is off of him and all the attention is on Palin. 
American Politics is mostly based on self interest and name calling and childish behavior that too many people really think govt is the solution when it has been proven time after time that it is the problem so the media as well as pop-culture need to simply distract the masses with hyperbole and non-sence to make each candidate look like what they are not and that is: self congratulating egotistical bastards that only care to get power and influence at any means neccessary which is true in every country including that of Englad.

You are absolutely correct.  We Americans picked Bush didn't we? He is undoubtedly the worst president that this country has ever had.



Thank God he will be gone in a few more months. At times issues are discussed on YA but rarely do the people involved know much about the core of an issue. There are a handful of intelligent people on YA but they do not go on line too often. Too bad, because some of them really know quite a lot about what is going on and they write in clear, concise language. I find that most of the writers are kids who are using YA as a game. I am an older American and I found that most of my friends are very well versed in issues and can discuss them in detail. Some are Obama supporters and some (the richer ones) are 100% for McCain.  It makes for an interesting discussion. I find that at this time many Americans are very frustrated because of the political situation, the war, our extremely poor illegal immigrant situation, the economy, etc.  We have a Congress that cannot move off its rear end to get anything done. Unfortunately, this is not the America I knew when I was growing up.

Why do you want to vote Republican?



At the time the White House estimated cost of a war to remove Saddam Hussein would cost $50 billion to $60 billion, before war started

Since then the estimates have grown and grown.

Last estimates in March = $3000 billion
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...

Thats $3,000,000, 000,000

Every American family now has a debt of approx $40,000 to pay just for the cost of the war - and rising.

McCain has already said he doesn't really understand economics.
Not his strong point.
He boasts that he understands war and conflicts.



So given that we have an economic crises to address over the next 3 years - why would you want to vote Republican?

National Security. Something I really have yet to hear a Democrat talk much about and actually stand behind. All I hear them talk about is money, money, money. As I recall money is the root of all evil anyways.

Money is nothing without security. Something Clinton did very very little about during his 8 years as president.

2 attacks on U.S. soil. (1st WTC bombing and OKC bombing)

Numerous attacks with casualities on U.S. Embassies. And the U.S.S. Cole attack again killing more.

Bin Laden declared jihad on every man, woman, and child in the U.S. during Clintons run. With all of these attacks and obvious threats you would have thought more than lobbing a few Tomahawks would have been done but it wasn't.

It's a widely known fact Clintons national security failures definitely did nothing to help what would become known as 9/11. Clinton had all of the same intel Bush did. That's also known.

So why do I vote Republican? Well 9/11 was the only terrorist attack on the U.S. or any of it's interest in the 8 yrs Bush has been in office. Versus the several with Clinton over his 8 years. Bushes only happened in the first 8 months. The 8 years after have had no terrorist events happen on U.S. soil or it's interests. Much better than Clintons natiional security legacy IMO.



Money is nothing without security. Plain and simple. 9/11 was gonna happen by early 2001 no matter who was president. It was already too late.

And not every Republican is the same. If you want to believe the cookie cutter mold idea, then I have to believe a Democrat would help ruin our national security more, as history proves this.

I just want to know why he can't tell the truth and why his lies continue to pile up.  There are at least 50 and growing.  Look on snopes.

Midterm Monday...there will NEVER be a health care plan for everyone in the US.  We want one...but we believe in competition and we have organizations that can help those that don't have it.  BUT...we are a democracy and we  can't help everyone all the time.  Sometimes you have to help yourself .  I do believe in helping children and older people and VETERANS!  I don't think they should suffer at all.  I don't think anyone should suffer.  But you cannot ever devise a plan that will satisfy and take care of everyone.  There are too many illegal and too many dishonest people here that take more from the system that is due them and they feel ENTITLED to everything because they are AMERICANS.  Sometimes you have to help take care of yourself...and even if that means taking a second job and getting a medical insurance plan on your own.  People do work TWO jobs sometimes....hubby and I have at times to provide the best we could.  WE felt it was OUR responsibility to take care of ourselves and our family without leaning on any government for it.  Everyone else says they work and can't make it.  Get TWO Jobs then until you can.  No one says you have to work one job and if it is hard...well life is HARD.  MILLIONS do it.
Give up your entertainment every week...stop buying cigarettes and alcohol or the best of clothes.  Go to a thrift shop if you have to.  We do sometimes and they have great things !  You don't have to tell anyone you go there...but for kids who wear clothes out and outgrow them more...you don't need name brand stuff.  You wouldn't believe the prom dress my granddaughter got for fifty cents because it was black day.  Anything black was 50 cents.  It was all sequined and absolutely BEAUTIFUL!

Why pay 500 bucks for a dress you wear one time?



People can afford more than they say they can.

It will never happen...under ANY party !  Even socialism has it's problems with poor doctors, medicine and care....you will never have the best of care with that program either.  You should be able to have the best you can afford and not take what is given to you if you can afford the best.

I'd be curious to know why & how he thinks "universal health care" is going to help our country.



1.) People who can't afford health insurance b/c of a low paying job usually qualify for state health care or Medicade.

2.) We've already been paying into Medicare our entire working lives without reaping the benefits. He wants to make us pay more?

3.) People who can't afford health insurance b/c they have too many debts... that's their own problem. Let them sink or swim. They need to cut up their credit cards or something.

4.) I have GREAT health insurance through my husband's job. Our vision insurance covers exams and glasses up to $400 and it's only $8/month. Our dental insurance is amazing and costs $8/month, and our health insurance is a $1,000 deductable with a 20/80% co-pay. It's $104/month. He works hard and therefore, we're able to have good health care.

5.) Isn't one of the reasons America is so advanced in medicine b/c people find medicine an inspiring field to go into? Doctors who work really hard get good paying jobs. If it's "universal health care", doctors will be paid less, therefore, fewer people will be doctors. Progressive medicine in America will come to a hault.

6.) If a small minority of teenage mothers want to complain that they can't get Medicade, can't get WIC, can't take their baby to the health department, and can't work out a payment plan with the hospital, they're full of crap.

I suppose the question you asked is a valid and concerning one that needs to be answered, by both parties. Good question. My question would be more on a personal note. My question is that: Although America has come along way from the way it used to be, with some ignorance still in existence, has it ever crossed his mind that just because he is a black man  that people "hate" him without really knowing him or his character, is he afraid of the possibility of people wanting to assassinate him and what preventative measures would he take to ensure that him and his family's safety while in the White House.

Given the current panic on Wall Street, a lot of Republicans seem to be pushing for keeping profits privatized, but socializing losses.  I've seen a lot of baseless name calling of your being a Marxist, a communist, or a socialist.  Could you clarify for the public why these labels do or don't apply and what regulation or oversight the government needs to provide at this point or whether another government bailout of private business like Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac is in order?



(I'm pretty sure a lot of the people using the labels are confused about the actual meaning.  It's ironic that the free market is the answer for all the problems according to many people on this site, until their own cronies are in trouble, and then the government has a responsibility to stabilize things.)

I predict that his answer to your question is that no, there is no danger of surrendering our sovereignty to the United Nations.  He was pretty clear that he'd take on allies if they failed to clean up problems that were threatening us.  I intensely doubt that he'd give in to people who clearly do not have our interest at heart as stated policy.

Edit for the questioner who asked exactly what is Obama's health plan:  http://www.barackobama.com/issues/health...

Edit for Monk Fan - it's universal access to health care, not universally identical care.  You must be young and healthy.  People my age or people with some minor health problems are often be denied health care except at a HUGE cost.  I recently applied for a new health insurance policy, because I needed to care for my aging mother and young son, and decided to leave my job.  I have NO financial problems that keep me from buying insurance.  I have minor cholesterol elevation, but no evidence of any atherosclerosis.  However, all heart problems of any kind and all blood related disorders were excluded, and the cost of my coverage was three times the amount that the coverage would have been if I hadn't had this minor blip in my record.  In other words, I would have to pay three times what another person would, and still would NOT HAVE COVERAGE for that entire set of illnesses.  If I were suddenly to have kidney problems, and they could argue that my "blood disorder" caused the kidney problems, then those would still be completely out of pocket expenses.

Donald trump would be right except the lenders are not dropping the price of the houses to current market levels. At least they aren't in Las Vegas. If the loan defaulted was $400k and the market value is $190k, the bank wants $390k. They aren't negotiating the loss. Vacancies here are through the roof. Wait until next year, more banks will have folded and they will be more realistic.

I can answer for Americans. As many names as we are subjected to nowadays, especially by Brits and Europeans wanting Obama elected, I can tell you that, reasonably enough, damn few have any idea of what they're talking about. And why not? It's not much their business. The issues surrounding, say, our election cycle, are very complex, as issues are anywhere. Yet from reading YA daily, the loudest are the very ones who claim to be right about our issues here.



My understanding of British politics I get from the Times, yet I confess I lack a real understanding of the national characters in play, even as I do get the basic issues. In the end it's the same for all of us on either side of the ocean; we each claim an expertise of the other that neither has.

Don't be conned by politicians. They are different horses from the same stable to con you into thinking that your vote counts, well it doesn't. Go to you tube and type in "Clinton Curtis voting machine" and you will see the inventor swearing in court that the votes are fixed.

Go to you tube and type in "the real John McCain".

Go to you tube and cut and paste the address below.

Whilst I can understand people being disillusioned with the current PM and his Cabinet, to wish to see all Labour MPs (?) defeated is surely not the best thing for us all and certainly not fair on many Labour MPs who are valiantly trying to do the best for their constituencies.

Blaming Labour is one thing, but if they were voted out, look at the likely alternative. Be careful what you wish for.

What is your question or is it just showing you are another republican with seething resentfulness of those who are famous. Careful resentfulness causes cancer, don't let it eat you up so bad...I didn't know she was doing that but I am thankful to see all the celebrities who are doing all kinds of generous things to help. I also appreciate that they are the only ones that get anything out of having a republican in the white house since they are the top 5% & yet they don't let greed rule their life.

Who gives a rip?  Everyone knows Hollywood supports the Dems.  That is so confusing to me because under Obama's tax plan, they will be taxed more heavily than they are now.  Why do we care what Barbra Streisand likes, who she supports, etc.  Why do we care what Lindsay Lohan thinks of Sarah Palin?  Why do we care who George Clooney is supporting?  Go to your local voter's registration office.  Sign up to vote.  Vote in November.  Support the party who supports our troops.  Support the party who supports America.

Why does no one care about the millions that big businesses especially, Oil and Insurance, pour into Republican campaigns? They are buying SOMETHING with their money!



Celebrities are just supporting candidates they like in a public way. Their money doesn 't get them special favors in Washington! And that goes for celebrities that support BOTH parties.

BTW: I am much more tired of simple minds being influenced by negative campaigning and false "news" stories from forums like FOX.

Striesand is the one that got the nation started talking about Bush's lack of intellect.  She said:  "We have a C student in the white house".
She didn't mention that is was an Ivy league school.  She got the info from Bush's own book.  The truth is, he was a B- student in the aggregate.

Meanwhile, Babbs barely made it out of Erasmus High in Brooklyn and when she did, she went directly to work in a gay bar and never entered a real school again.

The people in my country are to stupid to know whats going on in my country. Thirty years of reganomics has put the american economy in the crapper. Unregulated financial markets, people in financial firms buying and selling risky bonds and equity investments then expecting a tax payer bail out . We in the U.S. can only blame ourselves, both republican and democrat presidents have led us into this mess. Thirty years of stagnant wages, has the middle class living on debt. We americas  think we will have an endless line of credit from the rest of the world. Americans have 
a negative savings rate, which is the same as the savings rate during the great depresion of the 1930's. Years of outsourcing good paying jobs to countries such as China and India and bringing people into america who will work for less than americans will, have helped destroy the american middle class. Americans are too concerned about God,Guns and gays to vote on the real issues that affect our lives.

No country could take the cost of the Iraq war without problems even the United States. It is already 100s of billions of $ and the long term cost may be $3 Trillion.($3,000,000,000,000). To me the Iraq war was to protect Israel so it could be argued that protection of Israel has brought down the American economy

Well of course a large part of our economic troubles are due to our housing bubble. Europe is about to experience the same thing (due to no fault of us on the other side of the pond).

But as far as what we are doing, good question. We've shipped all of our jobs to China and India, but that was OK while we were selling houses to each other. But now that everything has hit the fan, we are in for hard times. No magic bullet here.

The Democrats are trying to give the Republicans the boot, in hopes that Obama can make some positive changes. The Republicans don't think we have any economic problems and if they did, would be too arrogant to admit it.



In other words this country is in the worst economic situation it's been in for a long time and we have 8 years of Bush to thank.

You are correct that, as the saying goes, when the US sneezes the world catches cold. What is being done to correct the current problem is not simply up to our Federal Reserve, but to you Brits as well. London over the past decade or so has become a genuine powerhouse for financial affairs, not seen there since the fall of the Dutch and the huge growth of the Royal Navy in the 18th century. You did not claim to blame the US as the sole cause of the problem, and we thank you, especially as the very mortgage packages bought by investors were a large part of the London markets. There is as they say blame to go around.

What's being done is what has been promised to the world since the 1930's. That the US taxpayer will back the bottom worth of the dollar. The bet so far is that we'll pull it off. The weakened dollar (that chavs say means US failure) has been a boon for the US recently, and now it's on its way back up. I'm hoping, among others, that it stays weaker longer so as to assist with our efforts against Chinese commodity dumping. But the worst-case scenario, depression, remains with us for now.

I can not wait.  I am a McCain supporter, but I think Obama will rip him a new one.  Obama is not the best with off the cuff answers, as a matter of fact he sucks at it, but he will beat McCain.  Even when Obama stutters and says um a 100 times, he is still more inspiring to watch then my crippled old guy.  I will vote for McCain, but I am an American and I love to watch an old person get the crap kicked out of themselves.

Why NOT vote with Bush's policies 90% of the time?



What's the problem with McCain voting with George W. Bush's policies 90% of the time? I've heard it blown out of proportion and made into a big deal but there's really no reason for this. When we (the rich) benefit, the money eventually trickles down to you (the middle class/poor). So his tax cuts and economic policies helped you in the long run. Look how much better we are as a country 8 years later.



I've been a devoted Republican since I started voting back in '72 for the the Reagan-Truman ticket.

First tickle down economics does not work (at least in the United States) I suspect because the executives just can't help spending the money when they know that the anti big government republican party that supports (literally) capitalism will bail them out when their companies declare bankruptcy.

Secondly, why not ask real questions in this election like why every Senator in the US Senate (both parties) voted with Bush 80 to 90% of the time including to continue to fund a war that the people they represent do not support?

The question here is given Bush's low popularity would you want it said you agree with him 90% of the time when 70% of the public agree with him only 10% of the time(if that much)? I'm sure there are people out there who agree with Bush 100% of the time and love him. Those would probably be oil loving millionaires. As a country only so many of those make up the general population. If you're looking out for the interests of the few over the many it's super! I think that was what Saddam was doing in his country.

I think some of you misunderstood the question.
Being born IS something he has done but you must agree most of us HAVE been born.
Being the right age again is not something he had much to do with.
Alot of people are Democrats and don't run for President.
I need something he has accomplished that was/is good for the American people.
Also I don't think or like that some have stated he is Black.  I don't care if he is purple or green lets leave color out of it please.

I know this goes against the spirit of your question, but personally, I would prefer, at this point in time, someone who is not quite as familiar with the regular workings of our government. I am tired of the bullshit, the bureaucracy, and the game that our government has become. I am tired of seeing child molesters, fraudsters, liars, and manipulators in the government. I WANT someone who doesn't know how it works, because it makes it a hell of a lot more likely that he will find a new way to make things happen. A BETTER way.

Not bills or legislation but here are three things I really respect.

1) He educated himself in law.  Ya, I can here the anti-lawyer groans, but he learned not to make himself rich or to help sleazy creeps get off.  He used his knowledge to teach people constitutional rights.

2) He devoted years of his life to helping other people.



3) When the march to war was popular, yet weapon inspectors had found no evidence of the weapons of mass destruction, he was one of the few officials who had the courage to speak out.  Anyone purely thinking about there own political future would never have done so in a time where French Fries became Freedom Fries because the French dared to disagree & DJ's who played the Dixie Chicks were fired for playing the music of dissenters.

If this is a UK general election:
When the vote is tied in a constituency, the returning officer has the casting vote, and casts his vote by using a random method (usually the flip of a coin) to decide who wins the seat. How he conducts this lottery is up to him, he can go for methods like drawing straws, but a coin flip is the preferred method.

This method has never been called upon in any parliamentary seat in the UK in modern times, though it is regularly used to settle tied elections in council wards with small electorates.

So to answer your question, every single seat would be decided by a lottery conducted by the returning officers.

EDIT - there is no "status quo" to preserve at an election, since in effect nobody holds the seat, it was vacated by the dissolution of Parliament (although all government ministers retain their jobs unless a new government is elected.) - Only the speaker of the house of commons votes to maintain the status quo when required to make a casting vote. Returning officers use random methods so as not to appear politically biased.

Every constituency would be decided by the casting vote of the returning officer.

Traditionally, in a tie, the returning officer casts his/her vote to maintain the status quo.



So the new parliament would have the same political make-up as the old.

EDIT: I've checked this out and Ed is absolutely right and I am wrong. It is decided by drawing lots.

"Procedures at a General Election 12.12 
Where there is a tie between two or more candidates receiving the same number of votes the acting returning officer will decide the result by lot. It is a matter for the acting returning officer to determine the method to be used. "

Some previous answers could be right, but if nobody actually voted, I am not sure that a returning officer's casting vote would apply.

In such circumstances it may be that the Queen. as the ultimate Head of State would be the one to decide what happens. After all, even after all the voting and counting is done, it is She who invites the winner to form a Government. It cannot be done without her say so.

No, because she doesn't know the answers and she needs to rehearse a bit more. Examples are her response to the question on the Bush Doctrine which any aware politician or student of politics should have been able to state and describe in all its formats and updates without looking like she was being asked to explain Einsteins Theory of Relativity.

But it won't be her who provides the answers to questions like that, it'll be her spin team putting words in her mouth. She knows nothing whatsoever about national foreign policy, so she needs to be told her answers. That shouldn't really surprise anyone. She's been appointed as running mate because of the potential votes she could bring in, not because she's the best available politican for the job. There must be at least 100 more knowledgeable and experienced Republican politicians who could do a better job than her, but they dont match the spin doctors' voter rating profile. They are after the people who may have voted for Hilary Clinton had she been standing. It's cynical but, hey, it's politics.

Palin could probably give you the answer to the meaning of life and explain nuclear physics in simple terms as well, given enough time for her people to write a speech about it for her.

Absolutely. IF McCain is elected, she will be VP.  IF something were to happen to McCain, she would be in charge of such things.  Given the state of unrest in the world, I think it is very relevant to find out her view and policies on the matter.  I think one of the marks of a good politician would be to maintain composure under fire. Foreign policy and healthcare issues are very dynamic right now so she needs to have a strong voice about these topics.

Will all 1.2 million abortions be banned if McCain/Palin get their way?



Latest figures I found showed that there were 1.2 million legal abortions in 2005.

If McCain /Palin manage to re-arrange the Supreme Court - will all these abortions be outlawed?

no - wut many people dont realize is even if abortion were to be outlawed - it would only be effective in state governments - basically roe v wade can never be reversed - its up to the states and since states like california and mass. are very liberal the US will never be without abortion

No that is ridiculous, no one is going to challenge Roe Vs Wade and relegate women to back alleys.  Palin was Governor in Alaska and we have some of the most liberal abortion laws in the country.  She never attempted to restrict them.

The abortion issue is a scare tactic to make the left worry that she's going to come to their homes and make them have babies against their will.

That is what they want but I hope not as it will push people under ground an so some one will die any way, there is no point in forcing some one to have a baby that they don't want or do not have the means or the possibility to care for that is only making more suffering, it all very well saying it is a gift from God but God don't ever pay any bills.

No. Abortion would still happen. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that women are prepared to travel for one. For example - in Ireland where abortion is illegal (except when the mother's life is at risk) - thousands of women travel to the UK each year to have one in safe conditions. If they didn't have that option there would be a lot more backstreet abortions preformed with many women losing their life in the process.

Ah, m'dear Ms Stevie, how I've missed your little jabs.

I'd wager that McCain's lead has dwindled due to the peaking of the 'Palin effect', and it seems to be specifically around Palin's dumb-brained comments on being able to see Russia and not knowing what the Bush doctrine is.

Flimsy superficiality can only last for so long. That is NOT to say the polls won't head back McCain's way between ow and Nov 4...the GOP just got a good bump...and now the bump has passed.



I'd expect the numbers to drift even more for McCain in the next few days following Lehmans and AIG. That ain't 'fundamentally sound'.

State polls are a better indicator than national polls.

As of now, Obama leads in VA, OH, and is tied in NC and FL.

While we know Obama won't win FL, the election isn't until Nov. 4. So really, that's the biggest poll of all.

sadly I must inform you about those polls, who does them??? the media mostly. and the media love obama in this race, so they are pro him in the polls all the time. there is a lot of people who wont say they wont vote for him because of race too, they dont want anyone to think they may be racist. 
it is not about mccain's age, obama's race, or palin's gender. its about who is right for the job. and that is mccain. and im a democrat who wont be voting for obama. keep a eye on ohio and those states. clinton was right when she said rarely does a pres get elected that ohio didnt vote for him.

The major point, Obama is not up, and has not ever been up by NEARLY the amount he should have been.



On his BEST day he was up by about 15pts.  In this current political setting he should be up by 15pst on his WORST day.



He's not even surpassed the margin of error in the current polls since the conventions.



He's been barely above the margin of error in past polls if he was above at all.



I can still remember the Democrats screaming he was a sure win and he was WAY ahead in the polls when he was up 3pts, (well within the margin of error).



He's getting a much needed boost from Fannie May and Freddie Mac, he was absolutely DESPERATE to get the attention off of Palin and back on himself, and this gave him what he needed.  That is until the debates, when Palin comes back into the spotlight, whether she does well or not is meaningless.



The fact is they will all be talking about Palin again which is death to Obama.

<question>



Why do Sen. Obama's supporters differ on how much of his deep-seated anger should be revealed to the USA ?



According to the Salon:

Obama and the rules for Angry Black Men
Why does Barack Obama have to be Virgil Tibbs?

Sept. 18, 2008

Where to begin? There's something off-putting about choosing to demonstrate this point with exclusively black heroes -- and fictional ones, at that. No Thurgood Marshall? No MLK? Huh? Furthermore, rage has no color, especially not in an election like this, and after the hell Obama caught for refusing to renounce the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, why would he then do an impersonation of the guy?

Like a lot of people, I too would like to see Obama draw more definite lines in the sand, or to see someone take the Republicans to task for their misdeeds without backing down or qualifying their statements with one of those they-must-love-their-children-too type concessions. But I have no desire to see Obama's revenge take the form of a snitty Mr. Tibbs

For Angela Davis and your non-answer to the question, Carol McCain was in a car accident in 1969 while John was a POW.  He returned to the U.S. in 1973.  He did not divorce Carol until 1980.  7 years is not exactly what anyone would call abandonment.  And he did not leave her helpless and destitute in the divorce.  Reagan was also divorced.  Nancy was not his first wife.  And he was also Republican.  Nobody cared about his divorce.  Nobody cares about McCain's divorce except for you and a handful of people trying to make an issue about a common occurrence in American.  The Hollywood celebrities who are so vocal against McCain get married and divorced, repeatedly, at a much higher rate.

Birds of a feather flock together.  You wouldn't want to show too much to the masses as it would turn them off.  What you suggest is already there.  There is so much hate going on now and I just cannot understand it.  Allowances ave been made.

as far as him the problem is he had a nutty childhood and was drug around to all sorts of wied places, so you really cannot blame the guy for shucking his white heritage as per the book.  On the other hand to stand or sit there and tell you he didn't know what Wright or Ayers slap in the face of all aMericans.



If the shoe fits wear it and either apologize, make an excuse or stick to your guns about your believes, don't just act like it never has happened and over 20 years.

sad but true many in this country have no idea how lucky they are and would rather whine and moan and groan about their lives and blame it on the man, when in reality as Led Zep sings "It's nobodies fault but my own".  If these people could learn to love themselves first, then possibly they could enjoy live, bu to harm and hate others only leads to a path of destruction and despair.

I for one think the country has had enough of it and is now headed back in the right direction where what a person does counts and who is the most qualified gets the nod.  It been too long with the promoting idiots using the the government, media and peter principle.



I do understand what yo a saying as I live in a southern state with a large minority population and see it every day in about 70% of the people and it's sad.  I used to think they just had no manners are were brought up that way, but now understand that they are indoctrinated in the government programs and schools in the area.

Oh and don't forget ACORN, why was he such a big part of that mess and trained and represented them.  You need to google that if yo want to see some unhappy and mad people.  Say a prayer.  Later.  Rev. I'll add to sayings "An idle mind is the devils work" and If you don't work for it yo don't appreciate it".

Did Sarah Palin's teleprompter BREAK during the RNC?



This came to my attention today. Tell me what this petty little lie says about Palin and her party. Excerpt from the article:

At a fundraiser in Canton, Ohio, this evening, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin had an interesting description of her speech to the Republican convention.

“There Ohio was right out in front, right in front of me," Palin said. "The teleprompter got messed up, I couldn’t follow it, and I just decided I’d just talk to the people in front of me. It was Ohio.”



...

Says Martin, "Perhaps there were moments where it scrolled slightly past her exact point in the speech. But I was sitting in the press section next to the stage, within easy eyeshot of the teleprompter. I frequently looked up at the machine, and there was no serious malfunction. A top convention planner confirms this morning that there were no major problems."

</question>



<additional details>



I'm surprised how many people are blatantly IGNORING the facts. The reporters sitting in the first row could SEE that the teleprompter was working just fine. Palin claims that it "got messed up" and that she "couldn't follow it".



Seriously? Somebody please explain to me how this isn't a blatant lie?

http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/2008...



Edit:



Are you that desparate?  Once the teleprompter got ahead of her, she just ignored it all together.  It would have been difficult getting back in sync with it once she started talking without it.  So her ability to speak well somehow is overshadowed by her NOT following the telepromter?



And I also doubt that the people you mention had their eye on the teleprompter rather then the person speaking at the exact moment of the malfunction, no matter how minor.

The truth is that Palin's teleprompter never broke down. Claims of the non-malfunction were supported by RNC organizers and meritorious McCain staff members. This story is an exaggerated tale from the McCain camp to emphasize Palin's attempts to appeal to the average American on the heels of McCain's slogan of "straight talk." All politicians use teleprompters. McCain and Obama both use them to speak effectively. However, McCain admits that he is not very adept at reading a teleprompter. This is the difference between an ivy league graduate from the top of his class and a near military academy dropout. Either that or someone who is relatively young versus someone who sorely needs bifocals.

Of course, the Press(Media) lies all the time. 
Since Obama IS so good at reading Teleprompters, perhaps he could offer the Lady from Alaska some pointers. In turn, she may explain to HIM, how it's usually a "good idea" to know what your Policies ARE, so he won't stumble on simple questions.

What does Mr Obama need to do to keep American women satisfied?



He finally got Mrs Clinton where he wanted her after a long fight but now his prospects seem to be wilting. I think American women voters like a long sustained campaign with a carefully timed climax. Some men like that too but it depends on the type of man. Do you think Mr Obama could keep it up for the next two months continually without stopping? Will that make the average American woman happy? Is he big enough for the job?

If he had a brain he would focus on the republicans rejection of abortion and the right to choose.

Palin is to women what Clarence thomas was to the blacks. She is an uncle tom who opposes women's sexual freedoms (like most devout christians do).



The majority of women want the right to choose but they are so blinded by their desperation to have "their first woman leader" that they have put their right to choose on the backburner. 
Obama should get that pan off the backburner and wake women up.

"Hussein" is of Arabic origin, and its meaning is "good; small handsome one". The name of a prominent person in Shiite Islam and a royal name in Jordan.

At first...I was a little surprised at his middle name...I had to get use to it...but in the end...it's just a name. His father was Muslim...those are his roots. And he is proud of it.

Please stop saying Palin's email wasn't used for state business.?



Here are the titles of some of the emails that were in her inbox.  The text wasn't shown, but the titles clearly show state business matters.

Emails from Randall Ruaro (deputy chief of staff)
"Draft letter to Governor Schwarzenegger."
"Please approve" 
"Court of Appeals Nominations."
Other e-mails from Ruaro indicate they're about employee and budget issues for the DPS (Department of Public Safety)

Michael Nizich (chief of staff)
"Using Royalty Oil to Lower the Cost of Fuel for Alaskans"
"CONFIDENTIAL Ethics Matter."



So, can you honestly say those are all "personal" emails???

Democrats were in the Senate and in the House of Representatives making the laws that created the present conditions.

All of them are responsible for this mess. Don't think that Democrats will be able to fix it. If they could, they would have done it already since they are a part of the government as well.

You can either spew out partisan fallacies or do your own damned homework.

Check out WHO started Social Security and what it's original intent was. Find out WHO broke all the promises made by the original Social Security program.

Check out WHO screwed up banking with a flawed bill that led to rampant poor practices.

Check out WHO got rich off Fanny and Freddy and WHO continued to get money from them until the bitter end.

Here's a hint: You're not going to find the Republican Party at the bottom of this mess.

THANKS FOR SUMMING THIS UP IN YOUR OWN WORDS: "I don't need to do any homework-I've watched it."

You've also "watched" a computer and a television. WIthout doing any homework, please tell us EXACTLY how both work.

Bush isn't the reason it happened....it's that old "trickle down" effect.  Do you think the economy takes a dive all of a sudden?  It takes some time...and it STARTED when Clinton was in office.  The problems with the banks STARTED when Clinton was in office.  The banks made the bad loans, now years later it's caught up with them.



Ya, Clinton looked good when he was in office, he made everything happen.  Now we're paying for it!

Let's be honest here.  Mortgages, and their related securities, have brought down the latest Wall Street firms because of the liberal lending policies of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.  These institutions are ran by Democrats.



How can we expect Obama and Biden (in the pocket of the banks) to get us out of the mess that these institutions, run by Democrats,have gotten us into?

That's a fair point.  The people that got us into this mess are the ones who created and sold the dodgy debt that propelled the housing market boom.

The country is in palin mania, all she is obvious fodder for the media. McCain has no real plans, and if he does no one but he and George Bush know what they are.  He gets no crowds when he goes and speaks, because he is not saying anything.  He is depending on his negative ads to win the election.  All I have to say is wait until they get to the debates.  Mccain will not stand a chance against Obama.  And lets not even talk about how Biden will mop the floor with palin!

I'd put it like this: Palin is a notch better than McCain.



I notice during her interview with Sean Hannity, she spoke from a position of a Democrat on the economic issues (when it's clear, Republicans does NONE of the stuff she was saying needs to be done).

On the Energy issues, she sound like the same 4 years of the Bush administration and the Media just brought us our worst nightmare that, in fact, Bush's cohorts are running her inner-circle. You know what that means: 4 more years of the SAME 'OLE B.S.

she was roped in because of her looks, that she is a woman, the women who would have voted for Hilary and more than likely now to switch. To make McCain look good is going to take some doing. 
And i do not like her one little bit, that she can expound on abortion, that its right to have the baby even if its a case of rape or incest smacks of a retrograde step. I watched her on the Jon Stewart show, along with all the candidates and believe me it wasn't a pretty sight. She shows her ignorance and i for one would never vote for her.

Dont be so naive, there's no way this was done "unintentionally " or "inadvertantly". This was actually a very clever ploy. If you remember just before McCain announced his choice the only person anyone was talking about was Obama and now i havent heard much from him for weeks now. All the focus is on Sarah Palin and McCain is four points up. 
Also dont forget that Palin's ideal's are very representative of middle America's ( be it consciously or subconsciously). All the shots of her hunting, her strong stance on anti-abortion etc was a very strategic move on McCain's part to show that what she represents he represents but without having to put himself too much into the forefront of these discussions. 
Dont be fooled that they didnt anticipate all the attention this was a very very clever move on his part,

It all depends on WHO you are talking to.  A very high number of answers here won't tell you anything.. since they have simply accepted whatever the party says, and are very sarcastic and ridicule even the fact that you have the brains to ask.  A lot of that also comes down to the fact that this is not the best place for solid information. 
Most educated voters are never going to just settle for what the claims are. They look for alternate sources (not extremist websites), READ both sides, then come to their own conclusions. I can tell you what I have read, and concluded that it is the biggest farce in the last 50 yrs (or more), but remember, this is my opinion., UNLESS I can provide documentation.  I have close to 30 yrs experience in genealogy,.. the value in that, is that it is based on finding reliable records instead of just opinions. So, I am far more likely to reject rumors.  If people are acting only out of emotion, then that can control the thought process to the point where they don't care what is true, much less know how to find it.

Palin is lipstick designed to cover up McCain/Bush policy (the Pig).

It's that simple.

The problem is that America's problems are very real, so we can see past a coat of lipstick....especially when it's this shallow...this unqualified and this radical.

Vote Obama/Biden.

About Obama:

London:
Time/date: Wednesday, August 11, 2004 4:00 P.M.
Location: 2 Dryden Mansions, Queens Club Gardens London W14

"I feel sad having to expose Barack Obama," says Martin, "but the man is a complete fraud. The truth is going to surprise, and disappoint, and outrage many people who were drawn to him. He has lied to the American people, and he has sought to misrepresent his own heritage.

"Obama's life story is vastly different from the one he portrays. My point: if he will lie about his mother and father, what else is he lying about? Can we expect 'bimbo eruptions?'

"Fiction: Obama stated in his Convention speech: 'My father ... grew up herding goats.' The 'goat herder' claim has been repeated endlessly. It is a lie. Fact: Obama's grandfather, Hussein Onyango Obama was a prominent and wealthy farmer. His son, Obama's father, was a child of privilege, not privation. He was an outstanding student, not a herdsman.

"Fiction: Obama was given an 'African' name. Fact: Obama is a Muslim who has concealed his religion. I am a strong supporter of the Muslim community, and I believe Muslims have been scapegoated. Obama has a great opportunity to be forthright. Instead, he has treated his Muslim heritage as a dark secret. His grandfather was named 'Hussein.' That is an Arabic-Muslim, not African, name. Hussein was a devout Muslim and named his son, Barack Senior, 'Baraka.' Baraka is an Arabic word meaning 'blessed.' Baraka comes out of the Koran and Arabic, not Africa.

"Barack Senior was also a devoted Muslim, and also chose a Muslim name for his son, our own Barack Obama, Junior. Again, his name was an Arabic and Koranic.

Obama has spent a lifetime running from his family heritage and religious heritage. Would his father have given his son a Koranic name if the father was not a devout Muslim? Obama's stepfather was also a Muslim. Obama will be the first Muslim-heritage senator; he should be proud of that fact. There is nothing to be ashamed of in any of the three great Abrahamic religions.

"Fiction: Obama Senior was a harmless student 'immigrant' who came to the United States only to study. Fact: Obama was part of one of the most corrupt and violent organizations in Africa: the Kenyatta regime. Obama's father ran back to Kenya soon after the British left. It is likely Obama's father had Mau Mau sympathies or connections, or he would not have been welcomed into the murderous inner circle of rapists, murderers, and arsonists. I believe Obama's secret shame at his family history of rape, murder and arson is what actualizes him. Our research is not yet complete. We are seeking to examine British colonial records. Our investigation to date has drawn on information on three continents.

"And what about Obama's beloved Kenyan brothers and sisters? None of his family was invited to Boston to share his prominence. Are his relatives being kept in the closet? Where are they? More secrecy, more prevarication.

"It is time for Barack Obama to stop presenting a fantasy to the American people. We are forgiving and many would still support him. It may well be that his concealment is meant to endanger Israel. His Muslim religion would obviously raise serious questions in many Jewish circles where Obama now enjoys support," Martin states.

"Our investigation is continuing. In he meantime, Crown Books should stop selling Obama's novelization of his life. We have asked Crown to do that. Obama is living a lie."

1.McCain will be better for our economy... here is why: In order for any plan to work we have to government spending. McCain plans to cut wasted earmarks among other things and even go as far as to ask his cabinet to work for $1. We also need to create jobs, McCain will cut corporate taxes to keep good businesses here and get other companies back. He will also get rid of INTERNET taxes, that will spur domestic and international trade. This works to create jobs. He also will promote drilling and alternative energy that will create jobs. So, more jobs created more people working and that equals a larger tax base. So you have more people working, that means he can cut taxes for everyone. You have more people paying less in taxes so it works out great for everyone.
2. McCain would be better for foreign policy- and it is not just about security. I want to stick with the economics of it. The dollar has fallen due to inflation. That means everything costs more for us to buy and cost less for countries outside the US to buy. But, many countries invest heavily in the US, to see our dollar drop so drastic makes them less willing to invest in our country and it hurts our industry. McCain will get the value of our dollar back up. DID YOU KNOW THAT IF THE DOLLAR WAS WORTH WHAT IS WAS  JUST 4 YEARS AGO. OIL WOULD BE UNDER 50 BUCKS A BARREL? The value of our dollar and our trade deficits is mightly important. Once we get these under control our foreign investors will pour more money in.
3.McCain is better for our Security... He was responsible for the Surge and our success in Iraq. Contrary to belief, McCain hates war and he knows a hard head makes a soft behind. He will work for peace and yes we can be peaceful and respected.
4.McCain is better for our environment... McCain Alterantive energy developmnet and the use of clean coal etc.
5.McCain has the best policy --- Our economy is in no shape for the type of Health care overhaul one candidate suggests. It will not work. It will destroy our Health system. But,we can work to make Health care more affordable and that leads back to wasted spending in government and hospitals. If we start at the top we can free up more money for healthcare and cut wasted costs.

1) independant analysis has shown that Obamas plan would be better for the economy by about 30% although the current plans of both candidates would incur more debt overall.

2) McCain doesn't strike me as a very friendly sort of person I think he would be better at making enemies than friends.  I've seen videos of him getting angry over simple questions that he didn't want to answer, He appears to have somewhat of a quick temper.  Obama doesn't have any foreign policy experience but Biden does have some extensive experience in this subject so I'd have to say again Obama wins by a small margin.

3) As far as security goes I don't think it matters.  You can go with the Bush Doctines which basically give us the pre-emptive strike mandate among other things or the Obamas more diplomatic soloutions.  So basically it depends Do you want to throw the first  punch and avoid more risk or talk your way out of it and be on a more moral path.  With either candidate there is a good possibility of another war.

4) Obamas is by far the candidate to choose if your worried about the environment he favors renewable energy like solar and wind etc.  McCain wants to drill for more oil and build more nuclear plants(the single most expensive form of energy production)

5) Unfortunatly I don't believe either candidate will be in a position to do a whole lot about health care.  They might try to fix it in some small way but with the economy how it is now they won't be able to do much.

Overall I think Obama is the better candidate.  Hes easily a better public speaker and overall seems more intelligent even if he is less experienced than McCain.  He also doesn't lie about his opponent nearly as much.  I've been keeping close tabs on both candidates for a couple months now and I've tried to view the candidates on an equal footing but I've got to say McCain keeps falling short in my opinion.  90% of the hardcore dems and republicans don't seem to do anything but bash each other in blogs.  Too much name calling makes me feel like I'm back in grade school.

Nice. I lost nothing, and am still doing great. I don't want any change. But if your partner lost 40k, then you either were the worst investor in history, or are still extremely well off. There's no way you want Obama to tax the rest of your portfolio, and increase dividends taxes. Unless you're just making all of this up to sound poignant with no idea of what you're speaking.

Almost everyone who has money in an IRA, a 401-K, or other investments has lost money in the current crisis. The more money you have in those investments the more you have lost.

When you hear them say the market went down 5 percent, that means that most people's investments went down by that much. So if you had $100 K in your 401-K, you've lost $5,000. The market is down far more than 5%.

Lassaiz Faire economics led to phenominally wealthy robber barons and the Great Depression. George W. Bush and his lapdog Congress have tried it again, and it's leading to the exact same thing. They don't seem to learn.

(BTW, Democrats now have a slight majority in Congress, but Republicans can - and do - still block much of what they're trying to do. And Bush has vetoed much of what Dem's have tried to do. So Dem's are not really "in control of Congress".)

Everyone will be before the year is out.  Every tax payer is still paying for the savings and loan farce; every tax payer and their children will pay for this one.  Mr. Bush has allowed extremely wealthy people to milk the rest of us of our meagre savings - and once again the Republican Government steps in to protect those wealthy hogs at the expense of the small investor and the middle income tax payer.  Mr. Regan gave us Savings & Loan for a generation; Mr. Bush has wiped out the integrity of the financial infrastructure of the free world.

What party do I vote for?



I believe that reducing taxes on the wealthiest and large corporations will result in them raising salaries on their employees because that's how rich people/businesses get rich.

I believe that we need to cut welfare to single mothers, cut government funding for runaway/abandoned children shelters, eliminate "socialist" programs that allow teenage mothers to go to school, but we need to make abortion illegal because that's mercy to unwanted fetuses.

I believe that attempting diplomacy with anyone who opposes the US is pointless but sending our troops to fight them anywhere is extremely effective.

I believe that although God is all powerful but we need our government to enforce God's rules in our schools and bedrooms.

I believe that human beings have no impact on the environment, even as I ridicule the environmental disasters occurring in China and other backward countries that have minimal government laws restricting polution.

I believe that minimizing government in all facets of our financial lives because stock market crashes, housing market crashes, inflation, unaffordable quality health insurance do not impact the majority of Americans.  The free market will correct everything.

<question>



Strength of John McCain?



John McCain freely admits that the economy is not an issue of which he has strong knowledge.  Given that the economy is the number one voting issue in this election, what possible strength could McCain offer to overcome that weakness?

~Remember~  6 of John McCain's top advisors are lobbyists for special-interest groups, which are generally blamed for a great deal of the financial crisis we are currently experiencing.

Thanks in advance.

Where in my question did I say I was rampantly for Obama?  I am merely exploring the strenghts/weaknesses of McCain



Wendy- very interesting info.  I have long speculated that the strength of McCain is a ridiculous ability to beat the odds at survival.  Physically, mentally, and politcally.  However, when it comes to the political survival, I have found that McCain has survived through bootlicking and bellying up.



I'm sorry- that was unfair to McCain. He did earn his "Maverick" rep-  Until W came along and he licked W's boots and became a good dog.  What the F K did the W administration do to bring McCain so low?  Or is it a McCain character flaw?

John McCain knew enough about economics to see the fiancial mess coming 2 years ago and cosponsored a bill to reform Freddy Mac and Fannie Mae. It was voted down. Look it up its called S.190 the Federal HOusing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005.
Two of Obama's campaigne.fincancial advisors James Johnson and Franklin  Raines used to work for Freddy Mac and were fired.

Phil Gramm is Mccain's economic advisor and he is the MAN that that was a direct cause of this financial crisis. McCain voted for the Gramm Commodities Deregulation act of 2000...that caused Enron, high gas prices and this financial meltdown.

Gramm slipped this bill into a budget passed on DECEMBER 15th, 2000! No committee, the day before the SENATE left for vacation and Clinton is gone baby gone. McCain backed and voted for this BS.

read for yourself... 
" While McCain’s movement to the center was widely popular (if not on the right) – and he even flirted with becoming a Democrat – there’s now strong reason to question whether it was anything but a temporary, expedient tactic. (In his 2002 memoir, “Worth the Fighting For,” he wrote, revealingly, “I didn’t decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president. . . . In truth, I’d had the ambition for a long time.”) "

Never mind ANY of the issues. He wants the power of being President, in his OWN WORDS.

Why would McCain embrace illegal immigration?



Yet another example of poor judgment



McCain’s immigration record includes:



SUPPORTING MASS AMNESTY

The May 29, 2003, Tucson Citizen quoted Mr. McCain as stating that "Amnesty has to be an important part of" any immigration solution. He was part of the bipartisan coalition that tried to pass amnesty legislation in 2006 and 2007. In 2006 he voted in favor of S. 2611, legislation that would reward between 10 and 11 million illegals with amnesty if they apply for legal status and pay a $2,000 fine.



SUPPORTING IN-STATE TUITION FOR ILLEGAL ALIENS

Mr. McCain was a cosponsor of S. 774, the Dream Act, providing in-state tuition for illegal aliens. The legislation would have enabled illegal aliens who entered the United States before age 16 to obtain a green card and then use their newly acquired status to obtain green cards for the millions of parents who illegally brought their children with them into the United States. Mr. McCain missed a Senate vote on the issue in October. He said that he would have opposed it on the Senate floor had he been there to vote.

VOTED TO KILL THE BORDER FENCE

In 2006, Mr. McCain voted for an amendment to S. 2611 offered by Sen. Arlen Specter to require consultation with the Mexican government concerning the construction of fencing along the U.S.-Mexican border. According to Numbers USA, an organization that lobbies against illegal immigration, this amendment would have effectively guaranteed that the border fence was never built.

VOTED AGAINST PERMANENTLY BARRING GANG MEMBERS AND TERRORISTS FROM THE US

Last year, Mr. McCain voted against an amendment (Senate Amendment 1184) introduced by Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican, that would have permanently barred gang members, terrorists, sex offenders, alien absconders, aliens convicted of domestic violence and aliens convicted of at least three DUIs from the United States. The Cornyn Amendment was rejected on a 51-46 vote.



VOTED IN FAVOR OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS TO ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO COMMIT IDENTITY FRAUD

In 2006. Mr. McCain joined with Mr. Kennedy in working to defeat an amendment by Sen. John Ensign, Nevada Republican, that would have barred Social Security credits for work being done prior to their receiving amnesty — in other words, while working under a false Social Security number. The Ensign Amendment, (Senate Amendment 3985) was defeated on a 50-49 vote.



And here's McCain telling lies about his immigration record:



In a Jan. 5 debate, Mr. McCain declared that anyone who says he supported amnesty is "a liar, is lying." Several days before he won the New Hampshire primary, Mr. McCain was asked by a voter about criticism of his record. The senator replied: "I do not support, nor would I ever support, any services provided to someone who came to this country illegally, nor would I ever and [I] never have supported Social Security benefits for people who are in this country illegally." Any assertion to the contrary, he added "is absolutely 
false."

Because Obama is horribly new at politics, and when he comes up with a plan his handlers tell him to delay it, because it needs revision.
He's pathetic. I laughed for a good while when I found out he was chosen as the Dem's hopeful.
Well the only change you can expect from Obama is a change of career.
I can't wait to go to the burger joint he's working at in 6 months.
I'll ask for the "Failed Campaign"-burger.

Government deficits stimulate the economy so running a deficits is  a good thing during recessions but a bad thing when the economy is booming because it will create excess demand and produces inflation and high interest rates that will slow the economy. Deficits  increase the burden  on future taxpayers  so it in not a matter of  whether or not to tax, but when you will tax.

A full on stock market crash will be next, followed by a massive fall in house prices, while the uber rich bankers who are responsible for all this via the Fed printing way too much money will make huge asset grabs from ordinary people.  Millions unemployed, food and other shortages, pensions non existent and a sh*t load of misery...

Make sure you remember this and who's responsible, the banking and political elite who will blame it all on interest rates being too low... and then say:
"not our fault, a real shame, we tried our best to keep things steady, it's all the fault of The System" (the one they run!).

Let's just hope Iran isn't next or we'll all find a world of pain very quickly.

Richard K says, "Ukrainian Government - who gives a toss?"

That kind of attitude explains why there were so many more Russian Grandmasters at chess than any other nation.  Anybody from Europe or America SHOULD give a toss about the Ukraine.  In 2010 there will be an election there (it's something about democracy I suppose).  The prime minister, a lady who was previously considered anti Russian, has just switched to a pro russian stance.  She has connections with the gas industry and guess what?  The russians are spending $100m's of dollars on investing in gas pipelines into south Ossieta.  Any connection do you think?  Is it just a coincidence that all this happens while the US and the UK are otherwise engaged with their own problems?  Do you know how big the Ukraine is? approx 48m people at last count.

When will you give a toss?  When the media tells you to?

Please, that was people who work for fannie and freddie donating....as is their right.
McCain is the real culprit when it comes to frannie and freddie:
McCain should look first to his campaign staffers as the cause of that debacle. One of them was Fannie Mae's head of lobbying, and spread tens of millions of dollars around Washington in the form of lobbying contracts. A number of McCain staffers were on the receiving end of those contracts, collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars each from the lenders to rep their interests. And McCain's campaign manager served as president of a lobbying association that fought to protect Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae from the sort of regulation that McCain is now proposing.
Aquiles Suarez, listed as an economic adviser to the McCain campaign in a July 2007 McCain press release, was formerly the director of government and industry relations for Fannie Mae. The Senate Lobbying Database says Suarez oversaw the lending giant's $47,510,000 lobbying campaign from 2003 to 2006.

Charlie Black, one of McCain's top aides, made at least $820,000 working for Freddie Mac from 1999 to 2004. The McCain campaign's vice-chair Wayne Berman and its congressional liaison John Green made $1.14 million working on behalf of Fannie Mae for lobbying firm Ogilvy Government Relations. Green made an additional $180,000 from Freddie Mac. Arther B. Culvahouse Jr., the VP vetter who helped John McCain select Sarah Palin, earned $80,000 from Fannie Mae in 2003 and 2004, while working for lobbying and law firm O'Melveny & Myers LLP. In addition, Politico reports that at least 20 McCain fundraisers have lobbied for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, pocketing at least $12.3 million over the last nine years.

No, didn't and wouldn't. Don't like him politically. That said, I wish him all the best of luck for success in his new role. I think anybody crazy enough to want the presidency of the US deserves at least a fair shake before people begin condemning him/her.

because he calls himself black, thats how he identifies himself, and who he connects more with. on college forms and anyting which asked for his race he put African-American says in his books, so ye thats why. But if his Moms white meaning he's just as white as black why couldnt more whites go out and vote for him like the black people did. Lets cut the crap Mccain always was full of sh** and evryone knew but atleast he wasnt 50% black, its rediculous.

Terrified for the future of our great nation. Apparently the average American has no idea how govt. works. We have just spent the last 8 years with a govt run by a democratic congress and senate. Now we have only made it worse by electing a democratic president. And one that's all show at that!

Have you taken a good look around you lately?



Look at all the lonely people...
They sat in the shadows while we fought for them in this War with Ourselves.
They were scared but they heard us while we spoke of things such as Liberty, Equality, and Success as a Birthright.
Now look at them all come out of the woodwork. They are all full of bravery and courage. For the first time they feel like they are citizens of this great nation. For once in their lives they are not ignored... and it is all thanks to us, we who fought and committed ourselves to change when we felt that no one wanted to listen.
When everyone told us to get lost, we absorbed, and we retaliated against them every day, and every night.



After all this...

What about McCain's speech?



He did a great speech. It was done with grace and a lot of humility and I saw in him something I have not seen before, something he did not show during his run...maybe result would have been different if he had tapped into that charisma in him.



Obama had also a great speech. How unfair destiny chose to take away his grand-mother 1 day before his election.

Regan was unresponsive to the soviet empire, double digit inflation, high unemployment, a gas crisis, a hostage crisis.  I hope you are just uninformed instead of delusional.

"The Reagan Era" was when the Supreme Court upheld Affirmative Action, so I hope this is the end of that. I don't expect people to start playing fair, but I hope they do. And before you go there, I'm poor, not rich. I also oppose other forms of racial discrimination, not just Affirmative Action.

It can happen. I am old enough to have watched Reagan ruin America. Outsourcing geared up on his watch and he did nothing. He called it free market when the rust belt exploded, the homeless population quadrupled and the middle class began it's major decline. Yeah, free market. The billionaires cleaned up like Mr. Clean. The average person has been marginalized for not being a high enough roller... not in the Hollywood/DC billionaire's club. As if all life should revolve around 2 percent of the people, and all life should be about affording the wealthy more and more opportunity, and everyone else less and less. Unreal. Hollywood, in fact. Maybe it's not too late to turn things over. Maybe. We can hope and work, is all.

Look at how his preacher is! And you say we need to lay off of the comments um no his preacher does im white and i think it is wrong that we have to stop making the comments about a black man when if it was McCain in office most black people would turn that into a racist matter to. So don't say anything about the comments he is getting! He knew what to expect running like that. I am not a racist person but comments like this make me mad!

Actually.. I'm getting tired for being called racist, for supporting McCain. Just because I don't support Obama's insane policies on our economy, energy dependency, Iraq, welfare, abortions, taxes ect.



I've been also told, "Now you're going to get payback whitey", many, many times...



So I've been discriminated against for being white, and I'm seeing it alot in yahoo! answers. But it's not a first, and I'm not really making a big deal of it because I'm used to it.



I don't know wtf is going on. It's sick behavior from both sides.

It's very tiring, and annoying, and frustrating.



I knew this country still had racial problems, but this race has really brought forth the sheer magnitude of the problem.



Racists are funny though. They're so ignorant and unintelligent and lost it's comical. What country do they think they live in? Who do they think this land was taken from before all the white guys showed up? If you're racist, why do you still support products and businesses and sports teams that include african-americans or asians or pacific islanders or (insert minority here)? Do they not see the connection I'm making here? No, they don't, and that's why you have to kind of just sit back and laugh at their complete lack of intellect.

Yes and I am tired of the Media making it the main issue of reporting this morning. He won more than just the black vote. He won across the board (females, other minorities, and whites) and that is the reality of the night. We are all tired of the suffering the Republican party has caused in the last 8 years and we needed the change. Let's all work together to make it happen.
