Why hasn't our county tapped into natural gas as an alternative fuel source?



Natural gas is an abundant resource in America. We could provide fuel for all our vehicles for over 50 years while we developed other energy sources.  Fuel prices are as low as 1.15 a gallon.



So what's the problem?

A large part of the problem is converting the cars to run on natural gas.

Currently, the Bush Administration is pushing hydrogen energy and we already have fleets of vehicles running around on H-power.  It is bypassing the carbon-fuel issue and going straight to the long-term solution.  The beauty of H-power is that it is created from water and electricity.  As long as you can generate electricity, even from nearly unlimited sources like geothermal energy, you can produce fuel quickly.

Compressed natural gas does not hold as much energy per unit volume as gasoline, hence natural gas vehicles cannot travel as far. For example, a natural gas car might get 200 miles per tank, while the same model gasoline-powered car might make 400+ miles.

Car manufacturers insist that they cannot sell cars with such short ranges. It's the same reason you don't see mass-produced electric cars (50-60 mile range). The car manufacturers tell people what they need, and people believe it. It's also the same reason you see four-door sedans with 200-300 horsepower; no one needs that kind of power, but we're told it's good so we buy it.

Then there's the secondary problem of building an entire natural gas refueling infrastructure. VERY expensive. IF people started buying natural gas cars in numbers, stations would pop up. But people won't start buying natural gas cars in numbers until they're sure they can refuel them. The classic chicken-and-egg dilemma.

So SOMEONE needs to get the ball rolling, and it's going to cost tens of billions of dollars before it starts paying for itself. Not a very popular political stance, especially during a recession.

Natural gas is a conventional fuel, in the sense that it is not renewable, and it is largely an imported fuel.
No, it is not all that abundant. The USA produces but a fraction of the amount of natural gas it consumes. It could convert autos to run on CNG, but then it would have to convert electrical generation back to coal, or heat fewer homes with natural gas. America's natural gas is already being used.

There are very very large deposits of natural gas in Canada's far north, mostly owned by a company called Petro-Canada. So far, not even a plan to bring it to market.No plan to build a pipeline to get it.

No I don't.
I think that it would take such a massive step backwards and most nations especially those who are just becoming developed will not want to do that. It is an effort that must be made on a global scale and that will not be easy. I don't think that we can do that anytime before the problem worsens.

Yes, (cougar, puma, mountain lion) what ever you want to call it, exist. Cougars are the smallest in the large cat family, but are closely related to the smaller cat breeds. They way a wopping 200-400 pounds and are 6-7 feet long, nose to tail. Cougar sightings have been found outside their normal habitat, because of urban sprawl. They do walk 100 miles a day, so anything can be possible. If cougars have been sighted, be careful! They are the top of the food chain in North America and don't scare off like other animals.

Why do people think drilling is longer than hydrogen?



Why do people think that drilling will take longer than developing an entire new "green" infrastructure?  I am sick of people saying "We won't see the effects of drilling for years!  We need to invent the perfect hydrogen fuel tank, completely restructure the auto manufacturing industry, build thousands of hydrogen refueling stations, and have everyone in the country switch to expensive new technology!  Oil will take too long!"

It is simply ridiculous.  Why can't we drill while futuristic technology develops properly!  President Carter said back in the 70's that the solution to our oil problem was conserving.  30 years later we have transformed the auto industry, billions of dollars of development and the best and the brightest around the world have developed over that time cars that go twice as far on the same fuel.  Problem Solved!!
NOT!!!!!!!!!!!

Why can't we drill?
And the BS about "they aren't drilling on what they have" is just that.
What they aren't drilling doesn't have oil!
Millions of people in the US live below the poverty line, and are suffering because of the economy, which is suffering in large part because of oil prices.  We need to solve crisis, which is here and now, and let Gore deal with the polar bears which may or may not have some trouble over the course of the next century.



</question>



<additional details>



donfletwhatever, there are still a few places that can be extracted economically, such as the ANWAR, which are barred from drilling.  And $100 dollars a barrel is a walk in the park compared to what could happen if we fail to act.

Your 120$ a barrel oil is tremendosly accelerating the push for alternatives explosively, from 30+ years down the road
to possibly as little as 15  for a major shift to hydrogen and electric cars.
Shortsightedness will kill your investment.

This is about the Socialist agenda for the US - to knock down the US as a global superpower by undermining its economy from the inside. Artificially driving up energy costs, sucking out the cash to send to Saudi Arabia for oil and to China for the goods we are no longer allowed to produce here for 'environmental' reasons.  Seriously, if global warming is a global problem, why is it okay to kill production in the US and shift it to China where pollution controls and energy efficiency are far worse?

And if less oil consumption is desirable, how about drilling locally so it won't have to be shipped all the way across the ocean, consuming huge amounts of fuel just to get it here?

The BS is transparent.

Our public servants are supposed to serve our interests.  Instead, they threaten to punish us if we do what is in our interests.

What Would Jefferson Do?

President Bush was correct - we need to ensure current energy meeds are met even as we move to the energy future.  I particularly appreciate his push on geothermal electrical generation.  Bush has pushed this nation towards clean Hydrogen energy - but is also trying to make sure we get the petroleum we need today.

Drilling will have a more immediate effect at the gas pump. As we all know it isn't as much drilling for oil as it is refining it. I say drill now so we can pay less while we perfect other methods.

Your right, drilling will have a much more immediate impact. Even liberals are finally realizing what conservatives have been saying all along.

Who said it will take longer to drill than to change our entire petroleum-based economy? Of course developing an alternative green infrastructure will take longer.

Theoretically, if money was not an issue and we could give out free technology and vehicles to every American, then yes, it would be faster. But that's not the case.

The point is, by drilling you are only prolonging the inevitable - that oil won't run our economy forever. The sooner we get off of oil, the better. We shouldn't be pushing our problems off for another date, when it will only be worse. (aside from the environmental impacts arguments)

Of course we can drill. The question is SHOULD we drill. To many, that answer is no.

I've never seen anyone suggest that the time frame was the reason for supporting one energy source over the other. I've seen people argue that we are drilling now and need to continue.  However, if we are going to increase our investment we should do it in the alternative sources because that's where our future lies.

I do not believe we should drill. Environmental factors contribute to my stance, but that is not the only reason we shouldn't drill. Oil is not something that will be around forever. Drilling for more oil is just another 10 years of procrastination. Not to mention, now that we drill off our shores, why not Alaska and countless other places?

Of course we could drill for oil, but when all is said and done, we are going to run out of supply in the future anyways. Why not take care of our environment and find alternatives to fuel? It is the price of gas alone that is prompting companies to make hybrid or alternative vehicles. Why in the world would someone try to make an expensive new car technology when gas was $0.99 a gallon? The fact of the matter is, we need to make a shift off of fossil fuels and we should do it now rather than wait. As much as people like to say they drive a Prius because they live a green lifestyle, the reason you get that kind of car is to save money.

As much as I would like to think the American public would be responsible and realize we all need to take the next step and switch to alternative fuel, the majority would probably only do it if they were going to save money.

I think that you expect immediate drilling to solve the problem for the near future and lower prices rapidly.



I do agree with an increase in drilling, but do not expect rapid and great results.



The oil would go on the world market, controlled by OPEC and the big oil companies.



The Chinese and the rest of the world are increasing their usage, so this new oil will just keep us going with no real surplus.



Hydrogen has some problems and will require great changes in our technology and machinery.



We should have done a lot more in the past to conserve and develop more alternatives, but we as a people had cheap energy and just used it as if there were no end, driving gas guzzlers, building huge houses, heating and air conditioning in record levels, etc.  I have heard Rush Limbaugh and other conservatives ridicule small cars and ridicule the green movement.

As an owner in oil and gas reserves, I am eager to see demand continue to outstrip supply. Now the best way to make that happen is to reduce supply.  We could get out and exploit those reserves now, and sell the product for half what we are getting now, but why? We can get more for it later.

We really do want to keep that supply going for centuries, not just decades. And we already have it figured out that we need a price well above $100/barrel to justify the more costly extraction of our remaining reserves. By that I mean that we need that much just to cover costs, and we prefer to make a good profit.

So, even were we to do a lot more drilling and deeper drilling, we should not expect oil prices to drop much lower than they are now as a result. We can go on extracting, at reduced rates, for a long time, but not for free. Stop dreaming.

Most hydrogen comes from steam reforming of methane so at the moment it's just a less efficient version of natural gas (which itself isn't really worth using as vehicle fuel unless you don't get charged as much tax on it).

In the future we will hopefully switch to using better methods of hydrogen production that don't rely on fossil fuels (or release CO2) but at the moment making hydrogen from methane is cheaper.

No - I have a great alternative already: natural gas powered cars. They are here now, not overly expensive to buy, and are much cleaner for the environment than gasoline (petrol) powered vehicles. I have 2 of them, both made by Ford, and I love 'em! 87 cents a gallon to fill up in Utah, so I'm saving loads of cash. Honda also makes a new one called the Civic GX, but they're hard to get. Anyway, look into it and see if there's a place to fill up near you, because that's the biggest problem so far. Also, hydrogen doesn't have the same power as natural gas, and it requires a lot higher compression in the tank as well as there being very, very few places to fill up (plus the huge price to buy the car in the first place). Check out my sources to learn more, and good luck!

Will this kind of electric engine work in a car?



I have this theory for a car powered by an electric engine.



Ok so the car has a main electric engine. It will be charged from the plug at your house. When you turn on the car the electric engine will allow the car to drive but also it will charge a smaller electric engine. That second engine will then power the main electric engine.



I have thought of this for a while. In Chemistry we learn that energy can not be created nor destroyed. So if energy goes to the main engine and then to the second smaller engine and back to the mainn engine the energy will just be going in a cycle between the two engines and the energy that is lost in the car will be the energy that is used to make the car drive.



Will my theory work? Or am I getting the wrong idea about how electric engines work?

Electric motors require a battery to power them.They use electricity from the battery.Then the battery must be recharged.Electric motors do not make electricity. What you are describing is a perpetual motion machine.If you ever make one work,let me know and i will make us both multibillionaires.Scientists say it is impossible.Energy may not be able to be created or destroyed but it can be changed and in the case of an electric car,the energy in the battery is changed into the motion of the car by the electric motor.

Nope, won't work, for several reasons.
Even you admit that there are losses.  Losses would NOT be losses IF they could be put to use.



These losses must be made up somehow or you run out of energy eventually.
This is called entropy.
One main source of loss is friction.
Another, which partly includes friction, is that electric motors have, at best, approximately 35% efficiency with the rest lost to various causes.

It will not work. Violates First Law of Thermodynamics. You must use energy to propel the car. If you use more energy to drive a 2nd motor to recharge the battery, it will only drain the battery faster as some energy is lost.
Basically you are using a battery to power a motor that is turning a generator and recharging the battery. Typical electric motor efficiency is somewhere around 90%, but can be higher or lower based on quality and type of electric motor. Every component loses some energy because they are not 100% efficient. But even if every component WAS 100% efficient, you would only get the original amount of energy back in the battery, so it would have a net effect of zero on the charge of the battery.

there usually the same in quality and your just paying for the brand name.
However some people go by the reputation of the gas station.

We currently run ethanol (corn alcohol) in a 2000 Chevy Tracker (our only “gas” vehicle, we also run a truck on 100% water & 2 EVs). But most cars since the 80’s were modified from the factory to run on BioFuels. In fact you’re probably even driving a Flex Fuel Vehicle right now & didn’t even know it. Go to www agua-luna com for a list of this vehicles



ANY living plant can be made into fuel. However the best are plants that are sugar based such as sugar cane, apple, sugar beets, etc. as you will only need yeast to turn the sugar into alcohol where as when you use starch based plants such as corn, wood/grass clippings (Methanol), rice, etc. you’ll need more complex digestors to break the starch down into sugar first.



The following information was cut directly from a guide I offer at www agua-luna com, it is complete but if anyone’s interested in other types of foods to use or a more specific step by step of the process, including building your own still legally, visit www agua-luna com…



"The usual sources of raw material for alcohol Ethanol production from starch are cereal grains such as corn, wheat, rye, barley, milo (sorghum grains), rice, etc. Other types of starch are available from potatoes of all kinds, Jerusalem artichokes, & other high-starch vegetables. Starch conversion is the standard method of production & the one we will discuss here.



It is possible, however, to make alcohol from sugar-producing plants (saccharine material) such as sugar beets, sugarcane, fruits, & others. These substances need no milling (as do grains), but they do require some kind of grinding or squeezing process.



A third source of fermentable is cellulose, as found in wood & waste sulphite liquor. This more complex process requires the use of acids to reduce the material to wood sugars. Consequently, most do-it-yourselfers should stick to either starch or sugar.



MILLING



All grains must be ground before mashing to expose the starch granules & help them remain in suspension in a water solution. The grain should be ground into a meal -- not a flour! -- that will pass a 20-mesh screen. On a hammer mill, however, a 3/16" screen will suffice.



Potatoes & similar high-moisture starch crops should be sliced or finely chopped. Since potato starch granules are large & easily ruptured, it isn't necessary to maintain the hard rapid boil which is required of the tougher, dryer "flinty" starches found in grains.



CONVERSION WITH ENZYMES



For small batches (5 bushels or less), fill the cooker with water (30 gallons per bushel), & add the meal slowly, to prevent lumps from forming. (When, cooking with steam, or at higher temperatures, it is possible to save energy by using less water at the beginning. But for the "small batcher" with an ordinary cooking apparatus, the most complete conversion is obtained by using the full amount of water right from the start to encourage a rapid rolling boil.)



Next, add 3 measuring spoons -- as provided -- per bushel of Alpha Amylase Enzyme (mixed in water) to the mixture & raise the temperature of the mash to 170 deg F (77 deg C), the optimum working environment for the enzyme. Hold the solution at that temperature for 15 minutes while agitating it vigorously.



At this point all the starch available at 170 deg F has been converted to dextrins, so it's time to raise the temperature of the mash to the boiling point. The concoction should be liquid enough to roll at its own rate -- if not, add 2 to 3 gallons of water. Hold the boil for 30 minutes to complete the liquefaction stage. All the starches are now in solution.
Now reduce the temperature to 170 deg F, using the cooling coil, & add 3 more measuring spoons per bushel of Alpha Amylase Enzyme (mixed in water). After 30 minutes of agitation at this temperature, all the previously released starches will have been reduced to dextrins, thereby completing primary conversion.



During secondary conversion the dextrins are further reduced to simple sugars (maltose & glucose) by the beta, or -- to be more exact -- glucoamylase enzymes. You need Alpha Amylase Enzyme & the yeast necessary to carry out secondary conversion & proper fermentation simultaneously, you can add 6 measuring spoons per bushel of the fermentation powder (mixed in water) as soon as you've brought the temperature down to 85 deg F (29 deg C) using the cooling coils."

Ethanol is made from the fermentation of biomass.  Almost all of the ethanol made in the US today is from corn and in Brazil is is from sugar cane.  These processes, especially with corn, take nearly as much or more energy to produce the alcohol as you get from burning it.  This is because by time you factor in all the energy used on the farm to grow the biomass (fertilizer, pesticide, equipment), the transportation of the grain, the processing, and then the transportation of the liquid fuel--it's very had to "win" energetically speaking.  That said, it does not need to be mined; biomass is a renewable resource.  If we could find biomass that requires lower inputs to grow and process, it could be beneficial.  I the end, it still isn't going to be a silver bullet because we need the farmland that would be used to grow the biomass to grow food, and we need the fresh water even more.

See, all the hippies fought long and hard for ethanol a couple years ago, and they won - now they're all fighting against it.



I like ethanol.  Seriously - it is the ONLY thing that I can put in my car that isn't gas that works.  Ethanol is good for your engine too - it absorbs the water that usually rusts or freezes your gas tank.  It helps your engine start in colder weather, and the energy drop in with 10% ethanol is negligible.



Before ethanol, we used to pay farmers to burn off their crop, or in some cases we'd pay them to not farm at all to keep prices competitive.



People are too quick to give up on something.  Corn ethanol isn't the final answer to all our problems, but that doesn't mean it isn't an answer.  It's successfully cut our oil demand by something like 10%, and we're focusing technology on better development and more productive feedstock, such as cellulosic ethanol from crops like switchgrass.

A 100% efficient device is impossible--even in principle.  That's a law of physics called the Second Law of Thermodynamics. You'll learn about it when you take physics.



For now, think in terms of applications.  Any motor, no matter how well made, will have some friction as it's parts move.  When you have a heat engine, some of the heat is always lost.



Even a theoretically "perfect" device can't be perfectly efficient.  Think of a heat engine (any device that draws it's energy from heat).  For it to work, there has to be a temperature difference between one point and another. You can calculate the theoretical maximum efficiency by dividing the lower temperature by the higher.  A small difference doesn't give yo u much energy to work with--the efficiency is lower.  A really high temperature raises the efficiency (in theory--engineers have to take other factors into account as well in building an actual device).



One way or another, the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics shows up in any device.  As one writer/engineer put it years ago: "you can't win. you can'teven break even!" (R.A.Heinlein)

if anyone says it cheaper at home, they are lying. The recipe calls for $5.00 in methanol and lye for 5 gallons.  5 gallons of oil at walmart is $23.00.  Then you need about $1.00 in fuel. so, besides the equipment you have $29.00 for 5 gallons, then, you have 1 gallon of hazardous waste that if you get caught dumping it in a drain or on the ground, add $25,000.  Add in the $.40/gallon you owe in taxes, oh, they don't tell you that always, Forget to pay taxes, oops, another $10,000 fine.Since you are cooking a flammable mixture, a trip to the ER will run $5,000 if you mess up.  SO cost is anywhere from $6.00/ gallon to $7,000, not including the pots and equipment need to mix it in.



Here's a tid bit, biodiesel plants are shutting down because the cost is so high.



some people claim they get the oil for free, yeah right, Go to you local restaurant and ask them for their oil.  You might get it for free, but by the time you get 1 micron filters to get the chicken parts out, it'll cost $2/gallon, dropping the cost to $4 to $7,000.  Diesel is selling for $3.60, a 10% savings.

Bio fuels will become one of the biggest fuel types in time I think.  They are a proven technology and with mass production prices will come down with investment, research and technology.



However there are social issues to think about.  With many people in the word starving, can we divert land away from food production to fuel production?



Can we cut down more Forest to make more farming land, as is happening in Brazil now- and what impact does this have on carbon emissions?



Bio fuels will be an important fuel sources for a long time but it is not the silver bullet we need to ensure energy independence, cheap fuel prices and a (part) solution to global warming

Why buy an electric car to save on fuel costs?



When my reality is that electricity costs more that gas.  I have read three articles this month that state that the average cost of electricity is ten cents per KW.  But my SCEdison average cost is over 25c and my tier 5 (or marginal) cost appears to well over 40c and maybe 50c with taxes and users fees. And there is no discount for "off peak" to use electricity at night.  This seems to equal gas at four to five dollars per gallon?

I think that your math is wrong, or that you live in a place with extremely high electricity prices/ extremely low gas prices.  Running cars on electricity should reduce the fuel costs, since it's more efficient to create the energy at a power plant than in the engine of your car.



Do you really pay 25 cents per kW-hour?  That's a lot.  You should call your utility and ask why it's so high.

you are right.  It takes just as much energy to run a car on gasoline as it does coal (ie electricity).



If we were to build nuclear, the cost of electricity would drop everywhere but where you live.  You live in an area that is socialistic and tending toward communistic.  The reverse tier system says everyone is equal economically.  In the free parts of the US we do not allow socialism.

The electric you buy will all get converted to motive force; the infernal combustion engine  will be less than 25% efficient, once it has warmed up, once it is running at optimum load (not accelerating or braking)



the electric car will recover energy when slowing down (regenerative braking), will use no energy stopped in traffic etc. No side journeys to a petrol station, just plug in at home or work.
An electric car should cost about 5c a mile in electric.
or install your own photo-voltaics or wind turbine (for less than the cost some people pay for leather seats) and free fuel for life



plus free parkin in places like Westminster or LAX, often lower taxes, like no London congestion charge, use of California car pool lanes ...



and lower maintenance costs, no coolant, exaust, fuel system, or transmission, or valves and injectors etc.

The Th!nk City Electric Car in 2009. Would You Buy One?



I hear that the Th!nk electric car is coming back for sale in 2009 from Norway. This was the car Ford originally marketed here a few years ago and tanked from little interest.



The original one had:
Range: 50 miles
Top Speed: 56 MPH



This new one has:
Range: 110 miles
Top Speed: 65 MPH
Acceleration: 0-50 MPH in 16.0 sec. Woo Hoo!
Charging Time: 10 Hrs. (220VAC @ 14A) Zzzzzz!
Price: Under $25,000 and you rent the battery.



It looks kinda Smart Carish, but less geeky.



Personally I'm sticking with my Honda Civic EX. It carries 5 and has decent trunk space.



I don't th!nk there is a market here honestly. It might be cool to use if you have huge property to cruise around on.



Who would buy one of these?

It really depends on what type of hydrogen system you are talking about. There are two main types I can think of that "burn" hyrogen.
If you are speaking about the HHO generators, the whole HHO thing is a myth that has been perpetrated for many years and disproven not only by scientist's textbooks, but also by tests from well known entities like Popular Science I believe recenty tested and yet again, found it to be a myth. It quite simply violates the first law of thermodynamics. It uses a lot more energy to make HHO than is released from burning it in an engine.



However, if you are talking about using supplemental (i.e. stored in a high-pressure tank on the vehicle and refuelled with a hydrogen pump, or at home compressor) hydrogen to help power a vehicle, this can and does work on many test cars around the world. However it does require a lot of Natural Gas, or a lot of electricity to make hydrogen gas from hydrolysis.

I was actually in your situation about 8 months ago; curious how and if these things worked. I remember just as now most people are pessimistic and even bash the whole idea but I still believed in it. Well since then I became a member of the water4gas website and over the summer I got the parts and built my own kit.



I just finished a months worth of testing it on a 1999 v6 ford taurus and got a consistent 35+% mileage improvement. I installed 2 HHO generators with a MAF sensor enhancer and a O2 sensor enhancer. I didn't try it without the enhancers but everyone within the site say that it most likely won't increase mileage without the sensor enhancers.



I don't know exactly how the science works but my best guess is that the hho gas helps the gas burn more efficiently but the O2 sensor picks up on more oxygen, interpreting as a lean cycle and adds more gas to compensate. That's  why you need the sensors.
Other than my results, others have been posting theirs on the website forum and they have varied between 20% and 50%. It definitely works, although it's not all that easy to do in many cases depending on the car. So some have had headaches in order to achieve results. But those people are so determined that they end up making it work.
I realize that there are people out there who are experimenters not knowing exactly if and how it's going to work but try anyways. Then those who think they know everything, are all about theory and just want to hear themselves argue. They put this idea down like if they've got something to prove.
I just hope that you become an experimenter and create success with this incredible idea.

Hi Mark,



Let me start off by saying Hydrogen is a great option for free energy. I built my first hydrogen cell about 10 years ago. Have converted over 50 vehicles in the last 10 years (hydrogen & EV) & now currently run a truck (and another 2 electric vehicles, 1 on Ethanol & 1 biodiesel), my home hot water heater, home stove & home generator on hydrogen for free with caught rain water & the help of a $10 solar panel. I offer a step by step DIY guide to walk anyone interested threw the process. You can find it at www agua-luna com or you can email me.



There are basically 3 safe ways to make & use hydrogen... chemically, electrically & molecularly, the first 2 being easier so I'll only discuss them here. The fallowing steps were taking directly out of the DIY guide I offer to those who would like to run their vehicles or home on 100% water safely. The entire guide is available at www agua-luna com



On demand h2 generators are a bit different from the Hollywood versions like seen Chain Reaction with Keanu Reeves, that tend to explode violently every time a film is being made. However when used in an on-demand system there is no storage of hydrogen & oxygen in its gas form, only liquid (water) & is only transformed into gas “on-demand” in small cylinder sized amounts. It’s actually safer then gasoline as it doesn’t evaporate, creating explosive fumes in the tank & isn’t explosive in it’s liquid form (water) like gas.



Chemically



1. You’ll need a 6inch x 1ft schedule 40 pvc pipe. With pvc cement glue a cap on the bottom & use a screw on cap for the top. Drill a small hole (1/4inch or so) in the side close to the top, screwing in a small copper shut off valve. Place a few feet of stranded (food grade is good) flex hose to the valve & into the air intake of your engine (carburetor or fuel injections).



2. Now crunch up a couple aluminum cans (beer cans, soda cans etc) & drop them into the pvc pipe, along with a couple cups of lye (Red Devil drain opener has lye in it, some Clorox & Drano’s do to).



3. Then simply add water, screw on the top & wait a few minutes.



What happens in simplicity is that aluminum & lye don’t really get along so they battle, & as always the innocent civilians (water H2O) that the most casualties, by giving up its hydrogen & oxygen. This then builds up in the void of the pipe & is ready to be vented into your engine, by opening the valve. You may need to start your engine on gas then switch it off after the hydrogen starts burning.



Electrical is a bit easier then Chemically.



1. Simply take a small solar panel 1.5 amps is what I use ($9 at harborfreight.com), connect the 2 wires from the panel +- to 2 conductors (carbon cores of batteries work well, just be careful removing it from the jacket), but any conductive material will work ie. Copper, aluminum, steel, etc.



2. Drop the wires into a water tank (I use 55gal drums), make sure they don’t touch each other.



3. Drill a small hole (1/4inch or so) in the side close to the top, screwing in a small copper shut off valve. Place a few feet of stranded (food grade is good) flex hose to the valve & into the air intake of your engine (carburetor or fuel injections).



4. Then simply add water, screw on the top cap & wait.



After a few hours tiny bubbles will form & rise off one conductor (that’s hydrogen) & even smaller bubbles that just looks like foam will rise off the other (oxygen). I don’t remember which likes the positive & which likes the neg hydrogen or the oxygen.



The third method is more complicated & is what I use for my vehicles. It’s just a modified Joe’s Cell, there’s a step by step DIY guide available to walk you threw the process here www agua-luna com



It also covers the other 2 methods described in more detail.



Hope this helped, feel free to contact me personally if you have any questions if you’d like assistance in making your first self sufficient steps, I’m willing to walk you step by step threw the process. I’ve written several how-to DIY guides available at  www agua-luna com on the subject. I also offer online & on-site workshops, seminars & internships to help others help the environment.

at this time, never.  The electric smart car burns coal, so their is no savings in pollution.  The estimated cost to run it, per their website, is $3.00 per 70 miles that is equal to 50 miles per gallon which is not very good for a tiny two seater vehicle.



Where does electricity come from, lightning bolts?  In the US it comes mostly from coal!Lets see, power plants are 40% efficient, the transmission system is 80%, the battery inverter 90%, net 29%.  A Honda fit, 29%, deal with it, y'all



The site says 2010, I'm saying they will drop importation until there is a market.  Right now the gasoline smart car is piling up on the lots.

I think vicinic meant that the car uses electricity generated from coal.  Although electric cars have no tail pipe emissions they still use fossil fuels.



You can get around this though by contacting your electricity supplier and requesting green/natural/carbon free electricity.  It is the best was to reduce your carbon emissions.



and the smart electric comes to the us in 2 years.

what you all forget is that an electric car is 90% efficient. a gas engine is only 25%



this means that you can fuel the car on dead baby seal guts and still have way less emissions.



is coal the ONLY thing that generates electricity? no, it's just the only thing this greedy country will use.



If you use solar, wind, hydrogen, or others, you have zero emissions across the board



but to answer the question. Don't expect them to ever release it here. This country has been fighting the EV for 20 years, and have managed to keep it out of the market so far.

The Chevy Volt was never intended to be purely electric. People would not buy it in any quantity if it was only electric and had to be charged for several hours. However, it will run for up to about 40 miles before needing to turn on the gasoline engine, so if you drive less than 40 miles, and recharge it at night for instance, it will indeed be a purely electric vehicle for your purposes. It just has a gasoline "backup" engine for those long trips. If I had $40,000 laying around I would buy one. :) Maybe after I get my P.E. license.

Because we ruin their business by exposing the truth. Those stupid HHO kits are an easy way to make money for a lot of people by selling them to people gullible enough to buy one. All they need is to convince someone that the oil companies are just "supressing" the technology.
Its like that with a LOT of products though, even some mainstream ones. All this stuff about organic foods, and people pay out the butt for it, when virtually every long term study has found little if any effect on people's health from eating traditionally grown foods, not to mention that most of the "organic" food isn't really even organically grown. But thats just yet another example of people doing what they do best, make more profits.

Consider the total US sales of cars like the Prius and Honda Civic hybrid.  If these vehicles average e.g. 50 MPG compared to ~30 MP for their comparable non-hybrid cousins, and the average annual mileage is around 12,000 (typical for US drivers), you can calculate the annual fuel savings.



For an interesting twist on the report, calculate the fuel savings for different years (2001-2007) as the hybrid fleet grew.  Contrast the savings to the oil production projected from ANWR, the Bakken formation, etc.



Edit:  James E is flat wrong (see second link).  He posts this same false claim in multiple answers, so I suggest reporting him.

There are many positive effects of using a Hybrid Vehicle.



One common misconception about many hybrid vehicles is that you need to plug in a hybrid vehicle to charge it. This is not true. Many hybrid vehicles charge by themselves using an energy regenerating flywheel which charges the battery when the car is stopping. And if the battery does run out then the engine charges the battery. But this is still not a large impact because the engine never has a need to kick in and charge the engine because the flywheel is incredibly efficient. I own a Toyota Highlander Hybrid and I would not change to another vehicle because the Highlander is amazing.



Hydrogen is type of fuel that is not the most efficient due to the fact that it takes more energy to produce, compress and then transport the hydrogen than the amount that you would save by switching to hydrogen. But I believe in a few years we will be able to make this a more cost efficient type of fuel. And to point out to the guy above, it is impossible for a hydrogen car to be a bomb because there is no way that you would get enough energy to split the hydrogen particles and make a hydrogen explosion.



Electric cars are an effective source of transport. And to also point out, you can not crash the electrical grid by plugging them in. Sure, a lot of people may buy them, but there will never be enough cars on the grid to make the grid crash.



To answer your questions about the economics, by making a move to buy more hybrid vehicles, or, I'm not sure about this so don't quote me, subsidizing a overhaul of all vehicles in the country to give them all hybrid engines (not sure about this), the country would save a huge amount of money. This is because people would not be spending as much money on gas and the government would not have to spend as much money fixing negative externalities such as pollution.

hybrids do not save fuel in all cases, in some they consume more fuel.  Its all about weight kiddies.  The Prius saves fuel by recovering energy from braking.  If you don't use brakes, like on the hiway, you are lugging around a bunch of dead weight in batteries and electric motors. The added cost for a hybrid over a small car is not worth the investment.  For the $8,000 premium of a Prius, I can 150,000 miles in my 45 mpg car, which is like free gasoline!!!

at this time i would not buy a pure electric car, the range is too limited, and the recharge time is far too slow. to me a viable pure electric car would be one with a 250 mile range, a top speed of around 80mph, and a recharge time of 20-30 minutes, or the ability to swap battery packs quickly and economically. it would also be helpful to have the ability to plug the car in and recharge it at home as well. at that point i would buy a pure electric car if i had the money.

I would buy one. If nothing else to help the bleeding of this countries' wealth to nations who hate us.
I think the Chevy Volt is the most practical design. GM has always had the right idea with hybrids and electric vehicles, you have to make them affordable. I believe Toyota was actually selling their hybrids at a loss for quite a while just to get them on the market and to convince people to buy them.
The Volt is slated to come in around $35-40,000, but read the following:
Say you drive 20 miles each way to work. Driving a smaller to midsize car, you may get an average of 25 mpg, so you consume around $5 or so per day in gasoline. (going down with oil currently, but it will go back up) Multiply that by perhaps 24 days a month going to work, and you spend about $120/month, not to mention any other small trips to the store, going out, etc, so maybe $150-$200 per month in gasoline.
Now lets say that almost all of your trips are less than 40 miles. You use virtually no gasoline, and instead you have to pay that extra 150-200 on additional car payment.
The electric car is suddenly practical, and you are helping the country and the environment by using a more efficient vehicle.

no. electric cars are good as a two seater going less than 20 miles/day.  But you will need a second car or rent a second car if you need more transportation than to and from work, which would make Vicini a sad person.



I hope mr turbocharger studies his thermodynamics and economics better or else he will fail his PE exam.  remeber, the volt need juice and it's cross country mileage will suck because of all the excess weight being packed around.  OH, a similar car will get 40 mpg at $2.25/gallon, cost $50/moth versus $20/month in electricity.

I think Bio diesel. All of those sources can be bio diesel, and diesel engines get better mileage efficiency. More diesel cars could burn it as well as other sources of bio diesel. Europe has millions of nice diesel cars getting 50-60 MPG now. We are just stupid when it comes to conserving fuel here.

bio diesel is the best as it is made from used cooking oil, lye and ethanol. and the procedure uses a minimum amount of energy.



for gas engines, sugar ethanol is best as it has the highest yield of all the base components that can be used to make ethanol. cellulose ethanol would be second best because even though it takes more energy to make ethanol from that base, it is widely available, so the base is cheap comparatively.

There are many ways of producing electrical power with no fossil fuels. And even though we're still highly dependent on coal and oil, the alternatives are becoming more realistic and more prevalent. Eventually, electric vehicles will be supplied by cleaner sources. For now, there are still many advantages - even if much of the power comes from fossil fuel based electricity.

No, they don't.  It's entirely possible to make electricity with no fossil fuels whatsoever.  You can even charge your electric car with energy from your own solar panels and/or wind turbine.



That being said, it's true that right now about 50% of the electricity in the US is produced by burning coal.  However, because electric motors are so efficient, EVs produce lower emissions than gas cars even when most of the energy comes from coal power plants.



http://greenhome.huddler.com/wiki/electr...



So electric cars are already an improvement over gas cars, and we can make the power grid as green as we want.  For example, if elected, Obama plans to require that 10% of the electricity in the US come from renewable energy sources by 2012 and 25% by 2030.

A large powerstation using unrefined fossil fuel, close to source,constantly monitored and maintained, running at optimum load and temperature, with filters and sequestration technology and energy delivered direct to your car at home or work via a very efficient grid is nowhere as bad for the environment and the economy and national security (reduced dependance on vunerable supply chains) than small infernal combustion engines.



Electric cars will actually improve the efficiency of the grid, especially with increasing percentage of renewable, variable, energy sources because they can sell unused power back to the grid at times of high demand http://www.acpropulsion.com/technology/v... (a car like the Tesla http://www.teslamotors.com with a 200mile range but only does a typical 20mile commute has a lot of spare energy)

There is no argument corporate greed or rater corporate self preservation is the issue here. GM built and leased then took back totally electric cars known as the EV1 or EV-1.  They worked fine had about a 200mile range where you could charge the battery to 3/4 full in 45 mins and full charge in 3 hours( batteries are slow to charge the last 1/4) There were no problems with the EV-1 the only work the techs got was rotating the tires and filling the windshield washer fluid.



Car company's know they will shrink to less then 1/4 from what they are now.  Meaning they will be able to sell completely powered by batteries cars (no traditional engines) and nothing else  BUT they will also not make any money on parts and service because simple the cars will not fail much if at all.



The media and car manufactures use word games to confuse people and draw consumers attention away from real electric cars.  I have seen a lot of ads that call plug in electric cars HYBRIDS when in fact they are not.  Yes there are hybrids that you actually can plug into to charge but they are NOT plug in electric cars.



I think car manufactures are panicked they have already found out electric cars are almost maintenance and repair free, so once they car leaved the showroom the car may never come back for work ever.  Electric cars are so simple the guy who repairs vacuum cleaners  car diagnose and repair plug in electric cars with perfection.  Most all Men and a lot of women will be able to repair the cars perfectly too.



I know car manufactures are trying to figure out a way to make plug in electric cars faulty and need just as many repairs as a regular fueled car. Fact is electric cars are simple and have very few parts and will be impossible to design them so the consumer will shell out massive amounts of money to keep them going.  Some high up GM exec. said "electric cars are here to stay there is nothing we can do about it"  He's right.  If they don't some other car company or a new one will throw caution to the wind and chance possible physical attack from one on the big car manufactures and mass produced plug in electric cars.
the technology and manufacturing capabilities have been around for 15 years.  The batteries in the last 10 and they just keep getting better.  Fact is when plug in electric cars are dominating the roads people will have 1000's of extra dollars to spend and it won't be going for transmission, exhaust, radiator, brakes, fuel pumps ect.



repairs.
Car companies try to say people will not buy 200 mile plug in electric cars, because of the charge times and the "low" 200 mile range.  This is ridiculous.  If a person drove 200 miles every day in a year the would have  73000 miles on it.  If you take the usual 15K a year its 42 miles a day.  The 3 hour change time is also one of their points why people will not want plug in electric cars.  It takes 45 mins to charge a battery 3/4 full and that's 150 miles worth of charging.



45 mins is a lunch hour.  Another argument is the need for somewhere to plug in .  Oh please there is a "plug in station" every 200 yards in America by average.  Every phone/power pole you see is a possible charging station.



I in vision ATM type charging stations all over the world parking lots where you pay 2 bucks at the entrance and when you park you can just plug in power poles here and there along highways as emergency charging stations.  It could be even more simple by when you park you put your front wheels on a device that spins your wheels so you don't have to even plug in.



Huge sums of money have been going to dealers (car manufactures) regular repair shops, gas stations, oil company's, tow truck drivers, triple A, you name it just think about who got money from you over your car last and it's a good chance they would have never seen your money if you had a dependable cheap to run plug in electric car.



Now the myth that the world could not produce enough electricity if even 50% of the people had plug in electric cars, the additional emissions as a consequence of more coal burning (in fact no additional coal will be needed most times of the day).  Power company have said as long as most people charged at night they would be able to keep up with demand easily.  Also most regular car owners have cars that are not operating at peek efficiency wasting fuel.  With power company's overseeing the efficiency of their power production there will be less resources wasted and far less emissions over all being released into the atmosphere..



Fact is the day of buying a new plug in electric car and keeping it your whole life is coming.  The days of that old regular car falling apart so much you have to replace it to reduce the money ooosing out of their pocket are ending.  In the end the only people who will buy at least 1 new car every 10 years will but them mostly for image purposes.
