Why don't you do some reading if your "weak in knowledge" - you might actually learn somthing.



This a good book to start with: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Soldiers-Pocket-...

It's not particularly difficult - its only 36hrs and mainly composed of medical tests, basic knowledge tests, briefing and a few fitness tests (1.5 mile run, strength test and pull-ups), along with some team tasks to see how you work with others. As long as you prepare, you'll be fine. There is a good fitness program on the Army website, or you could ask your recruiter for the one they have in the back of the recruiting booklets they hand out free.

Anyway good luck.

Very good question - have a star.



Probably not, as the Taliban in particular seem never to run out of cannon fodder, and their training camps are located in Pakistan where we can`t destroy them.  As for Iraq, they seem quite happy enough killing each other.

Millions of innocent human beings have been killed in these unjust wars -  more than were killed on 9/11. Any killing of innocent people cannot be justified - not even for the sake of trying to destroy one man whether it be Osama or Saddam!



Naturally the people in those countries are going to want to fight back in defense by whatever means they can even if it is terrorism - terrorists are created by the perpetrators of terror (if you go and bomb a country destroying lives and land that is terror and by doing that you are breeding hate. I disagree with all forms of terrorism - state wars are brutal acts of terrorism!

No. I think the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are making little kids follow in the same footsteps. The war is killing innocent people and this is going to make the relatives (mostly the children, angry and full of resentment.) So most likely the kids are going to be doing the same thing that their friends, or family were accused of. The wars are just making things worse.

Hmmm.  Have we created more terrorists than we have killed?  I wonder if there is a chart for that?  Lets see, do you think it would be a bar graph or a line graph moving up and down like the stock market?  Hmmmmmmmm. This is something to consider.  It's going to be easier to do that when you are talking about Iraq/Afganistan because we can count the bodies and look at the terrorist training camps now in exsistance.  The tough part is how many terrorists have been killed here in the States.  Perhaps the ones that are now teaching in our universities could answer that.

I'd venture to suggest we've created more. Due to the tragic mistake of smashing up most of Iraq's infrastructure (roads, bridges, water, electricity and even oil production capabilities) without much thought about the aftermath - the suffering of millions 'rescued' from  an evil regime - and Dubya's war against tourists.
All rather remindful of the fateful Vietnam war - which the US lost, despite widespread use of napalm, destruction of villages, forestry - and massive loss of life.
Sadly some fail to learn from history - but just make the same mistakes again. As the
French express it "Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose."
And I'd suggest they are correct.

Yes. Look at Iraq. We've basically dismanteled terrorists there and forced them to retreat to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Terrorists have even turned their fellow Muslims against them because they have killed inocent people and caused so much chaos. That is part of the reason they will be defeated.

Hello,

(ANS) I think sadly that the answer is that the actions of the USA & UK in terms of going into wars in both Iraq & Afghanistan has only poured petrol on the fire.

I think its more likely that both wars have increased the pool of potential Ja hadist zealots & I think the chances of another 9/11 remain very high. The Taliban & Al Quida sympathizers have in all probability increased and despite words to the contrary I think the Wahabi hardliners continue to receive large scale funding from Oil money from Saudi Arabia.

**I don't see how this can be resolved to be honest. Its extremely complex.

**And I do definitely see whats happening as a clash of cultures & ideologies (ancient extremist Islam verses 21st century western Christianity in some respects) It has many similarities to the crusades of the middle ages?

No I don't believe so, however most of the original stockpile were American made.

A Scottish friend of mine gave me a brief history a couple years back explaining how the Brits had started their own program, spent millions of pounds developing delivery systems and platforms only to scrap them because of pressure to buy the American material which was not compatible with what the British had in development.

I do believe that today's arsenal is primarily British built and controlled however.

I sincerely hope not. I dont think it is as Royal Navy Ballistic missile submarines can launch simply by turning a pair of keys simultaneously and then pressing a button, whereas US nuclear deterrent missiles need launch codes from the president and would be vulnerable in the event of a sneak attack

The British nuclear weapons programme is dependent on American co-operation, but it is essentially our own.

We use American nuclear test sites.  TRIDENT is an American system, though it is tailor-made for our particular requirements.  The missiles are, I believe, also a modified American design.  The warheads come from American stockpiles.

This deal allows our nuclear weapons deterrent to be on a par with France's, but at half the price, saving us billions of pounds of taxpayer's money.  It is, regrettably, dependent on American co-operation for R&D and so on, but the big red button is firmly in Number 10.  I'd rather it be that way than the other way round.

Britains entire nuclear arsenal is owned by the UK, submarine based in Royal Navy vessels and therefore totally under a British chain of command.

The fact that its made in by the US is about as revelavent as the steel for the sub coming from India.

hi there
well done for thinking about this

basically its anything that can offend people where they are based

ie any kind of magazine with scantilly clad females, bad language

etc etc
bear in mind that females showing arms etc is a no no

i know our lads over there will love top shelf stuff but dont send it.

they are there short term and will have to do without.

hope it helps

If you asked the Iranians -- Murderer
If you asked our Gov't -- It would depend on what type of spin the media put on it. 
If you asked God (If you believe) -- I think he would say murderer
If you ask the person doing it -- Hero

How would you go about finding the terrorists?
I mean our gov't can't find em all and they have been using how many people and how much money over how long a span of time?

A vigilante....like Batman or a character of the sort. The terrorists deserve to die, and if you take it in your own hands, then you're a vigilante. The terrorists are NOT innocent people. Now you couldn't do it recklessly. It must be planned; you must find the targets and their areas of operations and get them there. If you do it in the street then you might get the bystanders as well. That's a vigilante.



The funny flip side of the coin is that if you saw a terrorist plot about to be carried out and you stopped it, you'd be a hero. But if you do a preemptive, then it looks like murder. Crazy, isn't it.

Soon vendors on the streets of Tskhinvali will be hawking weapons that were left behind with a mocking sign: "Georgia Army M-16; Never used, dropped once."

Why does the UK have so few transport helicopters available for Afghanistan



Apparently the RAF is going to send helicopters which are currently used for rescue operations (seakings) to Afghanistan due to a shortage.



Why have we so few available? I understand there’s a problem with some Chinooks and software, but still, surely we have got some more – wasn’t Prince William using one to visit his girlfriend a few months ago?

In addition, why don't other countries send some to help us, it’s a NATO mission afterall. I'm sure the French air force and Luftwaffe have a few knocking about - they're not exactly busy at the moment.

Call it 11 years of cutback under this Government.

The RAF Regiment lost 6 Squadrons and all of it's Rapier missile systems in the 2003 round. It was a toss up between the Regiment and keeping the Arrows flying - guess who won.

My son specialised on the Rapier system. Then had to re-train when they were disbanded.

You can count the number of RAF helicopters in Afghan on the fingers of your hands, the same with fighter Squadrons.

It's basically a fecking shambles - or in Forces parlance SNAFU.



The rest of NATO aren't as stupid as we are. As far as they are concerned the USA started the chain of events in Afghan and they can finish it.

<question>



WW2: Were many of the tactics used by the air forces and ground troops made up as they went?



What I mean is that to a large extent, WW1 followed the old tactics of massive pitched battles, trench warfare and bayonet charges- although I am aware that things started to change with the use of machine-guns and tanks.

WW2 was the next big conflict, but it was a whole new ball game- guerrilla and urban warfare, high-performance fighter planes, mass bombing, automatic weapons, rockets, camouflage etc etc. Most of this stuff must have been fairly new to warfare and some of it must have been literally made up as the war progressed, with Generals finding out what worked and what didn't as WW2 evolved around them.

Was this the case?



</question>



<additional details>



ps- Am I right in thinking that Naval warfare went on largely unchanged, except for the advent of aircraft carriers? I mean submarines served in WW1 too.

The battles ar eplanned aneither air support or artillery or heavy gun fire from ships is always planned.

As a battle progresses air support might be called in and given co-ordinates where to strafe or bomb and like wise if a battle is near the coast ships will provide artillery support but always to given co-ordinates

I am debating on either joining the Army or the Navy. Which service is better for a woman?



I am going into Nursing. I was told by the Navy that the Hospital Corpsman is closed to women due to it being the only medical supports for the Marines and it's being offered to men due to (war) and women not being able to go into combat.

I have spoken with an Army recruiter and he says that he can secure a "spot" for medical if that's what I want to do.

I want to know from first hand experience from any women in the military be it Navy or Army, and what was there experience like.

Thank you

Trust me, you aren't the only one that the Navy told that too. Anyone will tell you the military is what you make of it. Navy and Air Force, are a common pick amongst women. The quality, and lifestyle is different compared to Army. Every branches standards are high - don't let the sly remarks or some people fool ya!

The Army is fine, if you are interested in ground forces, and don't mind being deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. As a medic, that is where you will be needed the most. Yes they can reserve your MOS before heading to MEPS, and hand you a copy of contract. You can get a nice bonus, and so on.



That is totally up to you. But don't give up, give the Navy one more try.

I am not a woman, however I just retired 4 days ago after 21 years in the Army.  I have been around the world quite a few times.  I have a 17 year old daughter and there is no way that I would support her decision to join the Army if that is what she wanted.  The quality of life is much better in the Air Force or the Navy.  In the Army you would be treated like a piece of meat.  If you went in as a commissioned officer then it would be a lot different.  Picture yourself being one of the only female medics in a 500 man infantry battalion while being deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan.  We had 3 female medics in our battalion and I pitied them for having to be around us males the whole year.  You could imagine some of the stuff they went through.

Germany was much stronger than England.  The US didn't really do all that much to protect England that they couldn't have done themselves, aside from sending supplies.  The RN prevented invasion, and the U-boats would have still been defeated if later.  What we did do was keep the Russians from occupying Western Europe.  England could not have done that alone.

"we also took on Japan singlehandly."

Not true at all.  Most of the IJA was in China fighting the Chinese.  The Brits & ANZACs were in Burma and New Guinea.  The Russians kicked them out of Manchuria and North Korea.

First off the U.S and England did not become allies  until a little later on. Infact we didnt become involved in the war until 1940. The U.S was trying to stay out of foriegn affairs after WW1.

2. The U.S DID NOT have the best army back then. I believe England did or Germany did.

3. The U.S DID NOT have to protect England

4. The U.S  followed a policy of CONTAINMENT, meaning they we're trying to contain communism in Germany. And If you didnt know communism is a dicatership.



5. The U.S belived in something called the Domino Theory were if one country fell to communism others will follow, and we would not have that.

Another reason why we were involved is because of The holocaust. The ONLY reason why the war ended as it did. Is because Hilter decieded to kill himself. He could have easily continued despite the fact they we're getting beat up.

If the US hadn't helped the US would have lost the war. Roosevelt thankfully was intelligent enough to see that having Germany controlling all of Europe, with no landing point for a US relief force would have spelt the end for democracy world wide, as there would have been no distractions from the German nuclear project - meaning Germany would have been the one to get the bomb before the US.

The U.S realised very early on in the war that Hitler was not a man they could do business with and sooner or later they would end up at war with him. Britain was of great importance as a starting point for the U.S army to land in Europe (D-Day). 
Had Germany defeated Britain then the U.S.A would have to come up through Italy to get to France and Germany, and this would be very difficult with Italy's mountainous terrain.
The U.S.A did have it's own battles to fight against the Japenese in the Pacific, but Churchill convinced Roosevelt that Germany was the greater threat thus leading the U.S to focus it's main efforts on defeating Hitler.

Hope this helped.

This type of question and others about the British and Americans and Germans and WW11 constantly crop up on this forum. Don't you think we should drop the subject - it was more than sixty years ago and only causes antagonism between those answering depending on their nationality.

After years of "Non-Intervention" (including, verified reports of mass deportation and genocide, including many groups of people, especially Jews, and people trying desperately to leave Europe, and being prohibited entry by both Canada and US), the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour.  It would have been difficult for the US to take on Japan on their own, so they joined the Allies in Europe.  By this time, the British, Canadians and Australians had already racked up tens of thousands of casualties in Europe and Asia.

The battle for Britain was already won before the US decided to turn up.
The British owe no debt to the US.



You're right, the USA did have it's own battles to fight in the Pacific, which the British dutifully turned up and helped with, which is little publicized in your American history books.

The American war in Europe was based on financial gain only, showing how the government of the time had little regard for the lives of its citizens.

Sorry, after reading answers from several people who were"educated in france", I had to step in. The US didn't protect England from Germany. The same as England didn't protect us against the japanese. But, we are all buddies now. Except for people "edjumicated" in france. What a bunch of fools. I imagine that france really didn't surrender, and won the whole war with one arm tied behind their backs. Like the old expression;"I got a great deal on french rifles, never fired, and only dropped once!" Beat it, froggies.

I will not refer to if or not the Americans "protected" England during the war. It just goes to show how terrible our education system is here in the USA.Your reading of history should tell you that is not the case.
What I want to address is the subject of the French and try to put their point of view.The French knew at the outset of WW2 that they were no match for the Germans, and dont forget that a few years previously they had the terrible first world war on their territory, with all its awful loss of life . So what was the point in putting up any sort of defence which could only result in the immense loss of life and the complete destruction of their beautiful country. What would it have achieved?. There were those French that sided with the Germans at the beginning of the war, but they soon were got rid of. Rather than make snide remarks ,we should try to imagine what it would be like if we had armies fighting here. Would we like it if our cities were destroyed for little if any purpose. The French, sensibly knew that armies come and go and what ever the result of the conflict, they would still there and their country would still be intact. Occupiers cannot stay for ever. We found that out in Vietnam and we are finding it out in Irag. Do not lose sight of the fact that the French had a very effective "underground" army, without whose help we would have found it very difficult to carry on the hostilities.The French helped the allies and kept their country intact, what is so wrong in that?



With regard to the other answers, they are so far off the mark of accuracy and are so jingoistic, that you should disregard them completely if you truly seek an answer to your question

Army Rangers aren't the normal Army.

Marines don't think we're better then the army because our recruit training is 13 weeks long. We KNOW we're good at what we do. We don't "think" we're better then any of the other branches. Our evidence is in Everything the Corps has accomplished. Marines EARNED their title. Recruit Traning in the Marine Corps is much more intense then any other branch, not just the Army.

Actually, it isn't because of the Basic Training.  It is how the Army conducts themselves in uniform.  Apparently, every Marine that has been cross-trained has firsthand experienced the lack of military customs and courtesy that most soldiers portray.



Then they go back to their units and share to others of what the Army displayed.

Actually, this goes back in history.  General Pershing even stated that the Army lacks that certain etiquette that is supposed to be conducted.



As there were many other Army commanders that have felt that the Army is lacking what the Marine Corps has.  Marines firsthand don't enjoy harking on our brothers-at-arms (the Army),  we just wish they would conduct themselves in upholding the highest military traditions.

I too have been cross-trained and actually attended the Ranger School as required by my CO when I was with Force Recon.  And there was a lot of things that was not in order due to the individualism that goes on in the ranks of the Army.  However, I had no issues with the soldiers while attend miltary free-fall school.  They conducted themselves with good military ethics.

One of the issues is that we (Marines) believe that it is inettiquette to be wearing cammies off-base (when not transiting to/from home and base).  I've seen them wear it out in public, i.e. recreational parks and other public facilities.  Soldiers call their SNCOs regardless of rank, "Sergeant" as if they love demoting their SNCOs.  I for one would never call my Master Sergeant, "Sergeant"!  Army salutes with their cover (cap, hat) off and salute indoors, and walk with their hands in the pocket.  Also, soldiers do not conduct the close-order drill as 'clean and sharp' as the Marines would.  And mostly, it is the attitude of many soldiers, who act like that they are back on the block of their neighborhood.

However, there are some units in the Army that I have seen that impressed me with their military courtesy and custom, which overall, three-quarter of the Army lacks.  Sorry to say this, but I am only inputing on what I have experienced.

What about Army Rangers? You can't compare the 75th Ranger Regiment to the U.S. Marine Corp because the 75th Ranger Regiment is a Special Operations unit that operates under USSOC. Totally different animal.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Stat...

The Marine Corp does, however, contain a newly established MARSOC (which falls under USSOC), and the older Force Recon units. Those are the only units of the Marine Corp that can compare to the 75th Ranger Regiment. They are great guys.

And... Ranger School has nothing to do with the 75th Ranger Regiment. Ranger School is a TRADOC leadership course, not a Special Operations unit. A lot of people who attend Ranger School are sh*tbags from the regular army. Just because you graduate Ranger School doesn't make you a Ranger.

I will say, however, that "most" Marines are more professional than the average soldier. However, on the other hand, when you start comparing Marine and Army infantry, I see little difference. Infantry, regardless of branch, all perform at the same level of success and professionalism.

And lastly I'll state that it doesn't matter about the branch--it depends on the quality and caliber of the individual man.

As people have said, we dont think. We KNOW. Consider this, I believe it was in the Korean war 4th Marines was under the command of an Army general. The possition they held was being over-run and the General ordered everyone to surrender, even the Marines. It cost lives wholesale. After that the Marine Corps Commandant ordered the 4th Marines guide-on from the individual units within the 4th Marines to be spread across the globe. They can only be a whole unit when they retrieve their guide-on. The Army surrenders. Marines dont. Death before Dishonor. The Army has a major LACK in disipline and sometimes training. Marines have always held ourselves to a higher standard and so have America. America doesnt NEED a Marine Corps, America WANTS a Marine Corps. We are far more respected and feared world wide then the Army.

You have to define 'English' before you can get a realistic answer. Do you mean persons of Scots descent? OR do you include persons of Scots descent born in England?

As a one time regular of mixed (Scots and English) ancestry I can state with certainty that when you're in a potential or actual combat situation you don't give a f*** where your team comes from. All you care about is how handy they are when it comes to fighting.

Yes there are, just as there are many Scots serving in other regiments of the British Army, that could be described as "English".

After your 4 years is up, you'll be reserves. That means when the Corps needs you, they will call. And why do you keep spelling Marine wrong? You've made the same mistake twice.

When you are through with active duty, we are now in the Individual Readiness Reserve (IRR), that is if you haven't been affect by the "stop-loss".  If there is a need for your service, determining on your MOS  (can't expect a grunt to do admin work), they will definitely be calling you right back to active duty.  Remember though, 'Once a Marine, Always a Marine".  We are Marines for life!

all contracts whether active duty or reserves are for a length of 8 years. usually the standard is 4 active 6 reserve. i've heard as low as 2 years active and some up to 6 depending on the mos(military occupational specialty aka-your job). reserves are kind of stiff as to go below the 6 year mark but if they are short staffed and you are a hot **** prospect(or just smarter than your recruiter) you can lower it to a 4 year stint in the reserves. smarter than your recruiter only requires you to say something to the effect of "i won't join unless i get a 3 year contract". now the remaining years(you did 4 active, you have 4 left or 6 reserves, you have 2 left) will be spent in what is known as the irr (inactive ready reserve). at this point you are a civilian. you can have long hair, smoke drugs, and live where ever you please. you may however be called back to duty if there is a major conflict ie. the dirty germans pull some $hit and want to go for round 3. but in the absence of another world war you will probably just go back to being a nasty, grabasstic piece of civilian sh...well, you know.

Are some American Troops angry with American Civilians? Do you care about our opinions of you?



Can you explain to me why, if some are?

I just finished chatting with my retired friend from the Army, he was a Sergeant Major, and was in Korea 5 years ago. He says he was indifferent to Civilians, and their opinions then, that he just didn't care to hear it all. Is this true for most of you? Any of you?



Is there an effect on most of the Troops on the opinions of the Civilians? Are most, or any Soldiers angry with us, as a whole, and why, please?

Also, is there any emotional need by a soldier to be indifferent? Serious answers, I appreciate.

Let me have it! Thanks bunches.

I am on board with the Sgt. Major on this. Its not that their opinions are not welcome. Its the lack of knowledge and negative attitude that may cause indifference or just tuning them out.  Of course things may anger us such as in the protest in Berkley at the Recruitment Office.
Or blaming the whole military for isolated situations that cause a negitive impact on the whole in general. Or hearing the media bash the President of the United States while we are fighting a war. We have taken an Oath to Serve and obey orders and were not drafted so this is the life we have choosen. For those who can complain and whine of trivial matters then I say, let them because I would rather have them sitting at home watching CNN then be in on a patrol with me. The men and women who proudly serve are a different breed and no one can take that pride away from them. Not all are meant to serve in the military and I hope they understand that Freedom isnt Free if it wasnt for those who have given their lifes Past,Present and future to our Great Nation.  In closing, for those who have supported us my Thanks to You. For those who havent. I have no comment.

I think most of it is the fact that a lot of americans are angry about the war and seem to take it out on soldiers. They do not fight by choice they fight because that is what they are told to do. AND people say that this is a pointless war, but tell that to the people who's schools have been bombed by thier own people and the american soldiers have spent the time rebuilding and making it safer. And its not that they are angry at Americans as a whole its that they are angry about the lack of support. 
Freedom is not free and people need to remember that.

That sounds like more of a personal deal.Some military and ex-military do have a negative opinion about civilians though. they havn't gone through what they have in the military and so their opinion is not taken well.Those who choose to serve their country and believe in it have a deservedly low opinion of those that whine and cry about how things but are not willing to take it personal and serve directly.The rest of us veterans are far from indifferent.

I usually try not to let opinions, especially negative ones, get a hold of me emotionally. Sure I may not agree with some opinions that the overall civilian population has but what can I do about it? Get pissed off? I would not be doing anything productive. Troops need to be emotionally unbiased as much as possible because if they make decisions off that, bad results will happen.

I have just recently swore in to the navy, im on the delayed entry program, and its been about a month now and everything has been golden. Now they did an extended background check for my job in there. They found a DUI that should have never been on my record, because it got dropped to a wreckless driving. Now i have an interview set up with the background check people. What are the chances Im still going to stay in the navy?

in fact I have heard they have helped guys/girls get out of

You will stay in the navy, but be prepared to go to the courthouse to get court docs for proof.  Your job may be affected because of it, so be aware of that also.  You signed a release for info, so your recruiter has probably already been to the courthouse and faxed everything off to headquarters.  Tell your interviewers the same thing that you told us and you should be ok.

well just like the ARMY the navy has waivers for such things.  i highly doubt however that if you took a job that requires a security clearance that you will be able to keep it.  most likely you will have to go through "reno" (renogiation) of your contract.

It would be a good idea for you to sign up to the forum on a website called Rear Party, which is for the family and friends of anyone in the British Forces.  You can ask your question there.  Many of the members have boyfriends/girlfriends and husbands/wives out on Operation Herrick (Afghanistan) and they will be able to tell you about the guys stopping off in Cyprus on their way home.  Do join - click on the word "register" on the top right hand side of the screen - they will be a great support for you.  Link follows:

Yes, it will be accepted.  The shoebox size is just a suggested size.  As long as you don't exceed the US Postal Service max dimensions, your package will make it.  Are you mailing it yourself, or giving it to a program that sends them?  You can NOT mail to "Any Service Member" any more, you have to mail to a specific person in a specific unit.  Thank you for supporting the troops!

I am assuming that as this is posted in the UK & Ireland section, you are only interested in the British rules? The BFPO has an excellent website: www.bfpo.org.uk which will give you the informaton you need. You should be okay as the shoebox thing is only a guide, probably to prevent do-gooders clogging up the mail services with enormous packages, so the Families packages can't get through!

Yes they would, probably a federal agency like the U.S. Marshall's Office. Escaping from prison, any prison, is a civilian crime. If they have an idea where the escapee is hiding, state and local officials in the area will search as well.

1.) Natl Crime Information Computer gets an UPDATE to ALL fed, state and local Law Enforcement agencies. 
2.) FBI gets an alert.
2.) Depending what the crime was, local law enforcement in home town or 'haunts' of the escapee will get advised.
3.) Post office pictures

Pearl Harbor Was Allowed to Happen?



This theory states that President Roosevelt (FDR) provoked the attack, knew about it in advance and covered up his failure to warn the Hawaiian commanders. FDR needed the attack to sucker Hitler to declare war, since the public and Congress were overwhelmingly against entering the war in Europe. It was his backdoor to war.

Theorists believe that the US was warned by, at least, the governments of Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Peru, Korea and the Soviet Union that a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was coming. All important Japanese codes were broken. FDR and Marshall and others knew the attack was coming, allowed it and covered up their knowledge.



This is one of the few conspiracy theories i believe. Does anybody have any evidence to make me think twice?

I think it is partially right; the government probably knew an attack would take place but I doubt if it was known when or where.  The breaking of the Japanese Code was important but since targets are usually coded as are date it is not an exact and easy task to figure out.  The attack on Midway was pinpointed because the US had Midway send out an uncoded message saying the water purification system was down (they then jumped on them for not coding it) which being important was transmitted by Japanese command to the Japanese attack force and that is how the US knew the target.  Warnings by countries who have some thing to gain are questionable and I do think it was widely held in the government and military that an attack on Pearl Harbor was "impossible" to do secretly.  Hitler had not kept any other treaty he signed and the one with the Japanese had very little in it for the Germans; I think everyone was surprised he kept it so that reasoning is not real solid.

Not only had the US been warned more than once about the coming invasion, for several days before the attack the Japanese consulate in Washington burned all their official documents and sent their diplomats and employees home. The signs were pretty obvious.
It is interesting to note that Pearl Harbor was identified by the US government as the military site most vulnerable to attack as far back as the summer of 1907.

Sometimes reality is stranger than fiction.  The Americans were taken completely by surprise because they were a strong military power and they didnt think anyone would actively attack them.  You have to bear in mind that they didnt have satellites and communications werent what they are now. Although it was a huge loss for the American navy it was also a masssive tactical blunder by the Japanese.  Although it was a very well coordinated surprise attack.  Without it America would probably never have entered the war and Europe would probably be ruled by the Third Reich.

Nonsense! If President Roosevelt needed a pretext to enter World War Two he was given it by the Germans almost two months before Pearl Harbor. A German U-Boat torpedoed and sank the U.S. Navy Destroyer USS Reuben James in international waters in the North Atlantic and we had a lot of dead and wounded sailors and officers from that sinking. That was an act of war and he did not go to the Congress for a declaration of war. 
Pearl Harbor happened because the Navy was ordered to move the Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor. The Navy moored those battleships all in a row, even though the after-action results from a simulated air attack on Pearl Harbor carried out by the Navy in 1932 pointed out the vulnerabilities of that anchorage. They were also given a pointed reminder that battleships could be successfully attacked from the air and sunk almost a year before the Pearl Harbor attack when the Royal Navy attacked ships of the Italian Navy in the port of Taranto, Italy. 
But, there was one Japanese Naval officer who did take note of both of those events. He used the "lessons learned" to develop the air operations plan for the Combined Northern Fleet in its attack on U.S. military installations on Oahu. Even to the point of having other officers and petty officers create a torpedo with wooden fins to work in the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor. His name was Minoru Genda and he retired from the Imperial Japanese Navy in the rank of Rear Admiral. I spent four hours with him and an interpreter in a coffee shop in the Ropongi District of Tokyo in 1969. 
The Japanese JN-25 Naval code was not broken by us or any of our allies. Even in the preparation for the Battle of Midway in June of 1942, we could only decipher and use 10% of the encrypted messages transmitted by the Japanese. We did have access to their diplomatic code. But, the diplomats didn't have the term "Kaigun" (Navy) anywhere on their curriculum vitae. So they did not have access to the JN-25 code system.

I got question which they didn't answer to me correctly. I been in the Active army since 2006. A couple days ago, i went and I signed up for usaa.com. I had no problems, until two days later. I couldn't log in so i called them up. They said "I needed proof of military service". So they  requested me to send them a fax  with my driver license, social security and my military ID card. Will they steal all that information since now omost everyone are getting identity fraud. How would they check military service since no ID of Armed Forces show military number in the front that i know of?

All warrants for arrest will DQ you for service in the Military. If you think you are slick and not tell anyone when you join the military, they military will find out when they begin the process of issuing you a security clearance. If it has been determined that you lied in the process of enlistment, you can face criminal charges in addition to discharge from the military for fraud enlistment.



Don't risk it. Pay your traffic citation and move on with your life. Traffic citations do not DQ you from service, but certain Traffic Citations may DQ from being an MP, such as DUI/DWI; narcotics possession in a vehicle, possession of a stolen vehicle; and etc.

SURVEY SAYS?  Yes, if you intend to try to enlist right away.  Best bet is to put some time/distance between you and the warrant so it's not a hot/current situation on your security clearance background investigation.  Just friendly advice here.  It won't stop you but you don't want to end up being turned down for a clearance because it screws up a lot of opportunity for you down the road.

I assume you mean back home, in garrison.

Typically show up and get accountability of everyone.  Then PT for a bit before going into that day's training (which may be a wide variety of things.)  When training is completed, and all the gear/weapons are accounted for, there is word passed at the end of the day before being dismissed.

I'm sure plenty of Marines think about being a civilian.

typical day...

wake up early, before the roosters crow, sometimes run and exercise, sometimes not. show up fifteen minutes prior to the fifteen minute prior rule (in our shop anyway), so instead of being there at seven, we had to be there by six thirty.  get to work, do your job with about a half hour or hour for lunch, depending on how much you put out during your training.  finish up the rest of the day at work, then have dinner.  meals at the chow hall are all paid for.

depending on your level of motivation, either sit in your barracks room and watch movies, play video games, go out to clubs, to the theater, visit with friends, some get drunk every night; or go to the gym, work out, play sports.  electric and water is paid for so income is disposable, unless you have cable, phone or outside bills like credit cards etc.

i never wished i was a civilian... it wouldn't have made sense for me to join if i had wanted to stay a civilian.  of course you wonder the path your life could have took had you not chosen to enlist, but that's something you will never know the answer to.  the Marines make you the person you are... without being in, i wouldn't be the man i am now, nor would i be in the same place in life.  it is definitely one of the best things i have ever done.

btw i am posting this under my wife's account... who i actually knew in '98 in high school and married 2 days after i came back from Iraq in '03.  if i hadn't enlisted who knows if our lives may have ever crossed paths again.  that isn't the only reason i am happy with my choices, but definitely one of them.

Well that wouldn't happen.

I don't think those 3 would work together all that well.

Besides, Iran is a non-factor.  They are a 3rd world nation.  Their contribution would be minimal at best.

China's military is about 30 years behind the US.

It would technically be a battle between Russia and the US, and we both have too much to lose to even try it.

(This is of course ignoring the fact that the US would not be alone.  Most of Europe would have to be with us.)

We would defeat them in the air and at sea, and bomb them into submission.  It would be like vietnam, but on a larger scale.  We could have won vietnam easily, but we were not willing to bomb so many civilians.



Unless they nuke us, in which case if we survive we would kill half the world.  They dont think we will go to war with them if we have to, but they always underestimate us.



We would probably win a ground war against any of those countries, but not more than one.  We could never pacify china if they were determined to resist, but most chinese are different ethnicities and dont like their govt anyway.



We could probably eventually exterminate the entire population of those countries.

God help us if we have to fight a determined enemy in a large country on the ground in a huge scale counter-guerrilla action.



We can whip anyone, but the question is always at what cost and why?

If you are talking in conventional terms then it depends on certain factors like where they are fighting in the world, technologically the US would take the initial advantage both in the air and sea, but manpower wise the Chinks and Russians would pretty much overrun US forces with just sheer numbers.

In terms of nuclear capability then I think the US would have them both beat hands down, as its ability to launch from its naval fleet with cruise missile and moreover its formidable submarine fleet would make certain first strike capability definitely in the favour of the US.

But be aware the Russians are ramping up their defence spending by nearly 30% next year to counter US dominance.

I am not sure that the Chinese would be on the side of the Russians, they don't favour US aggression against Iran but they have never been too friendly with the Russians, despite their past ideological similarities there has always been an uneasy mistrust between them.

The Iranians which I almost forgot to mention would be taken care of by Israel, it is only the restraining voice of the US that has stopped Israel so far wiping Irans nuclear facilties off the face of the earth, this is where the preverbial sh1t hits the fan for sure!!

My friend is being activated... and i want to cheer her up?



This girl was my BEST FRIEND in middle school. Then, before i started high school i moved 30 miles away. we fell out of touch for 6 years. (All of high school and some time after.) We just got back in touch. I am so happy about it! I missed her. She joined the army, and now is being activated. needless to say she is VERY scared. So am I. she would be the first and only person i know in the military. SO this war has not had the personal affect on me as it has had on so many others. until now. What can i do to be a good friend, and comfort her? And myself as well...



END THIS WAR NOW! BRING OUR TROOPS HOME!



</question>



<additional details>



Hey, hold on! I did not say that she does not want to go, or did not expect to have to go. She knew full well what she was signing up to do. I respect her choice of what she is doing very much, but i myself have a very different view. (This is not supposed to be about me, but i am 100% anti war. I am a tree hugging, peace loving hippy. Say what you want, but you cant change who i am. sticks and stones.)
I just wanted to know what people think would be a good way to make her not be so scared. some people took this way out of context, and left some immature answers, and i roll my eyes. but others really helped, and had some good ideas! thanks for that!

The short answer is that the Marines had the doctrine and training and expertise needed to pull off operations in the Pacific theater, rather than being shipped to the European theater.  The US Navy's main fleet operations were to be focused upon Japan, and that meant the Marines would be, as well.

The Marine Corps was the primary ground force for the operations in the Pacific.  Remember, too, that the Marines were then, as they are now, and always have been, a much smaller organizatiion than the Army.  As an example, US Army (and Air Force, which was part of the Army then) manpower strength topped out at over 8 million men and women during the war.  Marine troop strength topped out just under a half-million in the same time period.  There were only 6 Marine Divisions formed during the war, as well as quite a number of defense battlaions, as compared to the literally hundreds of Army divisions.



Because the fighting in the Pacific would require a large committment of the Navy, and the Marines are a separate branch of the Navy establishment, and the Marines had already planned for island hopping operations against the Japanese in the Pacific, the Marines were tasked with winning the war against Japan, with considerable Army support, and of course with transport and supply and a lot of fire support being handled by the Navy.  The Marines had the training and docterine necessary to fight a war in which there would be dozens of "D-Days," while the Army would train only a few divisions in amphibious landings as the opening edge of their efforts in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and France.

This appears to be in general close to the mark.  However I have reason to think there may also have been some friction (political infighting) between the US Army Commander in Europe (Ike) & the US Navy over this issue.

Ray - only the ill-educated would say that the US were not doing much for us.  We all acknowledge how much sacrifice US forces made for the security of your own country and Europe. 
We just get annoyed when its rubbed in our faces all the time - its not very gracious is it?
Incidentally, there were at least some USMC in action in Normandy. But as others have said, they were principally employed in the Pacific theatre of war.

Actually a very few Marines were involved but the Marine's were responsible for the Pacific area primarily and had limited duties in the Atlantic/European theater of operations.  The Marines were better used and suited in the island hopping campaign where they remained under Marine Corps/Navy command.

Questions about the Navy "Seabee's?



(This question was asked by another poster but he got no answers and I was hoping someone would be able to shed some light on it... not only for him but for my own curiosity?) All legit answers appreciated and all others will be REPORTED due to the high rate of Assholes and Jackasses slithering on this site)



I know they are construction workers for the U.S Navy. I also know they're several different rates that comprise them. My questions are however as follows.



Would I need a High Score on the ASVAB to get any of the rates?



What is a typical day like for the Seabee's?



If I do not have much construction skills can I still get one of the rates?



Do you see your family(Husband/wife, kids) often or almost everyday(Except Deployments).



Are their deployments as long as the rest of the Navy or longer or shorter?



Anything else feel free to add.



Also, I am aware they are sent to Iraq and Afghanistan and I do not mind being sent there for the sake of helping my country.

Just a average score on your ASVAB test.

Typical day, you go to work at 7:30 am, get off around 4pm unless something special is going on.

You will be sent to an "A" school to learn the trade you sign up for, then learn as you work.

If stationed in the States, you'll go home around 4pm, except for duty or special duties going on.

No set time limits on deployments. You can be sent for as long as 18 months, or as little as 3 months. Depends on the needs of the Navy.

Being a Seabee is like anything else. You get out what you put in. I was a CM in the Seabees for 26 years and loved 90% of my time. They are a close knit bunch with the unwritten attitude of "you watch my back and I'll watch yours". Almost anywhere you go in the world with the Seabees, there will be another Seabee that you worked with somewhere else in the past.

Well, to the soldier on the ground it would make no difference, they would have to follow her orders whether they liked her or not.

As for me (former soldier), I personally would like to see someone with a little more military experience and pragmatism in charge. She's made comments that the Iraq campaign is "the work of God." I think that's dangerous to our troops, and lessens her ability to make sound tactical and strategic decisions.

I honestly don't think the military has such a huge admiration for McCain. We are talking about such a large and diverse group of people that this statement cannot be correct.



To answer your question, nobody knows what Palin would be like. Most people don't know much about her achievements and she does not have any experience as commander-in-chief in a presidential position (who does if you are not the president? So it's not her fault). It also depends on what national and international security issues she would have to face. It's no use going into such predictions.

To the questioner: I haven't met any people in the military who talked about McCain with admiration. You are kind of exaggerating this. I'm an Army wife myself with a deployed husband. Military people are not stupid, it's not that everybody is going to vote for him just because he is a R. Categorizing people like this is incorrect. I agree that he has respect because of what he did in the past but dear, when was that? The world has changed a lot since then and he has gotten a lot older. He wasn't a politician at the time. He was military and someone to respect, not a power-hungry man. There is a politician McCain and a past war hero. The former is not as respected as the latter. Most military families are scared of him getting America (and the military) into trouble.

As has been said, the military is a very diverse group--and I'd be willing to bet that it mirrors the public opinion quite a bit more closely these days than it would have 8 years ago.  There's a lot of bitterness out there about the multiple deployments, the poorly executed start to the war, the lack of general direction until Petreaus took over.



Personally I believe Palin would be an absolute disaster as commander in chief.  She could not even properly articulate what Bush's policies on the war have been thus far--a fact which is appalling considering that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been going on for 7 years now.  Her experience visiting the troops has been limited to Kuwait, and she has not demonstrated an appropriate understanding of how the military operates--nor have I heard a single instance of her attempting to increase this knowledge.  I've yet to hear her talk about the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan with anything remotely resembling intelligent understanding of the complex issues on the ground.  Sarah Palin very much seems to be a likeable, pretty woman who looks good on television.  I believe as the weeks go by we will experience more and more political gaffes on her part, and she will fade a bit out of the spotlight.  I truly worry if she actually were to become president though--a very real possibility when you consider McCain's age and past health difficulties.  She also has an appeal to the one issue voters (those who believe what someone thinks about abortion is more important than national security, the economy, immigration, and etcetera).

Do I need command sponsorship for DEERS enrollment? ?



I read what is needed for DEERS and as a dependant, I can do it for my child but does my husband need to get our son command sponsored first? If so, is there anything else that needs to be done before I enroll the child?



</question>



<additional details>



My husband is deployed. I live overseas and not even in the country where they would have any military facilities but I know I have to enroll him in person. I have a general POA.



I did not have him on the base, he will be born in a foreign country. You can't give birth on the base overseas since such care is usually not provided.



Greenman: they don't have any bases where I live but can I go to the Consulate? I did not know they deal with military enrollments. When I take the child, I can ask though. Thanks for the suggestion.

I just did this enrollment this morning.

And I live overseas as well!!

What we needed was the babys birth certificate. We went to our MPF (it can be any base/branch. (If there is no base then the embassy or consoluate can do it. If they cant, your husband has to work somewhere when he isnt deployed. If you live in a country other than where he is stationed, go to the nearest embassy, they will help you)

Once you have the child enrolled in deers, you will receive 3 copies of the 1172. One goes to finance, one goes to tricare, and the other is for your records. 
Once deers enrollments is complete, you will submit a command sponsorship letter that will need to be run through your husbands chain of command. His Commander (or designee) will sign off on it. You will need to go to tricare and have a 1466 completed. This shows the child is able to be treated at local military facilities and doesnt have any ISSUES. Its the form giving dependents permission to travel abroad for PCS. you will take the package (1466, 1172, Command Sponsorship Letter, Copy of his original PCS orders, and a Tour Election sheet) back to the personell center where they will complete the childs command sponsorhip.

Once this paperwork is complete you will take the package back to tricare where they will enroll you into TriCare Prime (overseas). You will go to finance as well and they will update your husbands number of dependents. This will increase your COLA allotment.

Its alot to do, and took me about a week to complete.

If you have more questions, please email me. I have copys of all the forms in my email!!!!!!

NO you do not need Command Sponsorship to enroll your son in DEERS. As a matter of fact, you have to enroll him no matter where you live if he is a Military dependent in order to receive any entitlements he is eligible for, i.e. Tricare and BAH.

Once you have his Birth Certificate, take it, him, your dependent ID Card and your General POA and go to the nearest U.S. Military base (it can be any branch base, not just the branch your husband is in) and go to the ID card facilityto enroll your son in DEERs. For example if your husband in the Army and you live in Spain, you can always go to the Navy Base at Rota to enroll your son in DEERs. If there is no U.S. Military base where you live, you can go to the U.S. Embassy and enroll him in DEERs there.

I have so many... but, one of the best is of singing cadences we made up in the cattle wagon (we sang about being tired of cattle wagons, and we would moo). Then the drill sergeant would get out of the cab, pound on the side of the c.w. and yell at us to shut up. :D



My second favorite was the night before graduation, when my drill sergeant was smoking us because one of the guys came back late from family day. We were doing overhead arm claps, and our platoon guide pulled out the two streamers we'd purchased as a gift for the drill sergeant. We were all grinning (while exercising), and her eyes got huge when she saw them. One said "1 2 3 stay with me" and the other said "whistle time". The first she'd say when she smoked us, and the second meant getting smoked. If we were rowdy, she'd give us "the look" and start swinging her whistle around. We settled down fast. I personally preferred "family time" (getting to sit in the training bay for an hour after dinner and get mail call and all that) to "whistle time".

We had this kid (who was my wingman) who, at shower time, would run down the center aisle with no clothes on. He'd be among the first in the shower, and he'd stand there and soap himself up and talk to everyone in the shower. About 30 minutes into shower time he'd jump into the drying room and spend the rest of the time towelling himself off while he talked to other people. This was a consistant thing; not just a one-time deal. He just liked being naked around other men I guess. We ended up getting stationed together. Lucky me.



Another time our chow caller's voice cracked while he was getting ready to march us into the d-fac. Our TI yelled, "O'Neal! Jump up and down!" Puzzled, O'Neal jumped up and down. "Feel anything drop?," our TI yelled when he finished.



I was really good at memory work and my TI didn't like me, so he stopped me in the d-fac infront of everyone and ran down the ranks system and chain of command, trying to trip me up so he could humiliate me and make me do something stupid. He couldn't get me on anything, and I wcould see the frustration in his face. Finally he let me sit down to eat and I felt like "STFU, idiot! One point for me!"



The weather at BMT was crazy. A tornado touched down while we were in the field traning, and another time it snowed and we had to go out and do PT in it. That was fun.



Those are just some highlights.... BMT was fun, I had a blast.



Did you go through? What was your favorite memory?

I was at ROTC Camp in Fort Lewis. We were on a tactical FTX where we had to sit in the dark and wait for the OPFOR to showup.  In the dim light we saw this dark figure in the trees. One guy asked for the password, and there was no answer.  So we fired ( blanks) at them. Nothing happened.  So we walked over, turned on a flashlight, and saw a 5-foot high ant mound.

It's not always formal like that.  If you are reporting to a new post you walk up and stand at attention and say "Sir, (rank) so and so, reporting for duty (or as ordered), sir!"



If they just want to tell them something they just walk up and say whatever it is they have to say.

Well being a military retired you actually it varied from branch to branch but really as far as I know there isnt an official response. Whenever I went in to talk to the General I would ususally go through his second in command and then the General would talk to me and call me by my first name in private. We were fairly close and things in Iraq were pretty lax so as to keep our men calm and as unstressed as possible as far as protocol.

Really depends on branch of service and what the matter is; typically they would request permission to speak and then give the information.  Big variable is what information it is and what the staff officers position is.  The G3 (senior officer in Operations) might go straight to the General with some thing but a lower ranking officer in G3 section would go through his chain of command.  Typically you you don;t ask permission to debrief-you are told to report for a debrifefing in which case it is "Reporting as ordered Sir".  Usually debriefs are done by the section head that the informatio applies too and is not done directly to the General and reporting for duty is typically the same way unless it is an officer reporting directly to the General.

I don't think that this is a question that can have a definitive answer.  The US war in Iraq is very controversial now.  Intelligent people will come to different conclusions based on what they value, i.e., stability in the middle east, self-determination, US interests, Oil, etc.



But to answer your question based strictly on the wording, I would say no.  The mere fact that Iraq wants US to leave should not be a reason for the US to leave.  I'm sure that the Germans didn't want the Allied forces to storm Normandy, but they did.  So the idea Iraqis want the US to leave should only be one consideration on the continued occupation.

i believe that no matter what happens there will always be military based there. i mean we've stopped fighting with japan and germany for years now and there are still military members based overseas there. so its not necessarily  a question on whether the US should leave or Stay its a matter of when they're going to stop sending new and more troops over.

The U.S. should absolutely stay.  Until stability is achieved we need to stay.  We have "broken down" the old way, and now we need to build the government the right way.



We are no longer in the "Us" and "Them" mode.  Yes, oil does play a part.  Oil is a critical element in the world's economy, and we are looking to ensure we can mitigate the OPEC cartel.  It is easy to say "No Blood" for oil, but that is a knee jerk reaction.  The reality is there would be more blood without the economic stability.



Anyway, we need to finish what we started.

Lower age limit for all branches, 17 with parental consent. Upper age limit: Army and Navy cannot have reached 35th birthday by entry onto active duty. Air Force, 26th birthday, USMC, 27th birthday. Hope that answers your question.

Military Pay...Please Help...?



My fiance went to boot camp 10/07/2008. He got a check deposited today in the amount of 750.00. Will he get this amount on the 1st and the 15th of the amount? Or is this supposed to be his pay for the first month. And I thought they take out mandatory deductions (uniform, toiletries, ect.) on the first paycheck. Please explain the whole military pay to me. My fiance is an E2 I believe.

The pay for his first check is covering all the previous pay that he should have been getting.  This means that technically the check was for 15 Oct - 31 Oct, but because he had just enlisted and was not in the pay system on the 15th, this check covers the period from 7 Oct - 14 Oct as well.



Also, your husband should be getting BAH which would be a part of that check covering 07 Oct - 31 Oct.



Overall I would say that you should expect roughly that same amount for your next paychecks.  This is because there is indeed a lot taken out for "Debt Payments" in the first check, but also more was added for the 7 Oct - 14 Oct pay period.  It roughly balances out so you should see about that same amount or possibly even a little more on the next check starting the 15th of November.



Just a side note.  The check for the 15th of Novemeber will come on the 14th because the 15th is a Saturday and the pay system only pays on non holiday workdays.

your hubby should bring home 1509.90 a month minus taxes.  he should be getting a leave and earning statement (LES) which he can give you access to via mypay.dfas.mil  this will itemise all deducts.



he also receives a uniform allowance that will offset unifom charges.



750 on the 1st and 15th sounds about right.  However this will go up after boot camp and he can claim Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH)  this varies and can be looked up at  http://www.military.com/benefits/militar...

They are not married so he will NOT get BAH while in BCT.



Base pay is $1509 for an E2 with less than 2 years so  $750 is about right He will get a figure probably a little less at mid month but it could be the same. A basic way to explain it is that they take the base pay remove taxes and other deductions and split whatever is left in 2. He is given half on each pay day.



Since he's in BCT and is considered a single soldier he doesn't get BAS or BAH right now because he's living in the barracks and he's eating at the  chow hall.  He will only receive base pay for the next few months. Once he gets to his duty station he will see his BAS but it will be deducted right back out in a meal card and his BAH which will go back out for his barracks room. He won't see and keep those until he's either over the rank of E5 and gotten approval to live off post or is married.

For the first few pay periods, I wouldn't expect a set amount.  BAH will not be paid until the two of you are married and then, only if you live off base.  Sign on bonuses are generally paid separately from normal pay, so if your fiance is planning to receive one, keep an eye out for it.



The next time you speak to your fiance, ask him about MyPay.  MyPay is the finance website so that you'd be able to see his LES (Leave and Earnings Statement), this breaks down his pay so that you know what went where and why.  You can also use MyPay to manage his TSP (Thrift Savings Plan), which is the military's version of a 401K.  If he hasn't signed up for the TSP, I highly encourage him to do so.



Once you're married, his pay will change.  If you choose to live off base, he will receive BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing).  He will also be receiving BAS (Basic Allowance for Subsistance), which is his food allowance since he'll no longer have a meal card for the chow hall.  When he is deployed, or away at training, he will not receive BAS.  There will be deductions listed on the LES for your medical and dental insurance, and also for any allotments.  Allotments are awesome if you have bills that are a set amount each month, like car notes and insurance.  An allotment allows them to be paid directly from finance, and it never even touches your bank account.  It's even better than automatic bill pay :)  Each year, usually on the enlistment anniversary, he'll also receive a clothing allowance to pay for new uniforms and any other incidentals he may need, the military doesn't monitor how you spend the clothing allowance.  When you get to your first duty station, go to the Family Readiness center and ask if they have any programs to "introduce" you to the military.  The Air Force has a program called Heartlink, and it's awesome!  Good luck!

No.  Any conviction of a domestic violence charge, even a misdemeanor, means that you can never again own, or carry a firearm even in your line of work.  This is what is known as the Lautenberg Domestic Confiscation Law, or Lautenberg Amendment.  This means no jobs in the armed services, a police officer, armed security, etc.  It is a federal law and there are no waivers for this.  In fact, when you go into any line of work requiring you to carry a firearm, you sign a paper that states that you have never been convicted of a domestic violence charge for this very purpose.  However, you cannot simply lie on it as they will conduct a background investigation on you.



In fact, when this law went into effect, many police officers and military members were forced to resign their positions or were outright fired because they could no longer carry a weapon which was required in their line of work.  See the links below.

I can only know whats going on over there by what they say. Its hard to see which candidate has a better domestic policy, but I can't imagine many people are unconditionally for one or the other. We are once again voting for the lesser of two evils.

Senator McCain had my vote until he picked Governor Palin as his running mate.  Given his age and past health problems there is no way I could vote for him when there is a good possibility that someone so totally unqualified to be the Commander in Chief.

Please somebody enlighten me, What exactly is meant by winning the war in Iraq, what will have been won ?



I personally don't know what the U.S.A. will have won from the war in Iraq, and how will they know if they actually have won ? Especially because the war was a personal war of the Bush family.

This is not to upset anyone and discredit your opinions, so on that note I think Emeradd you are forgeting what the point of this war initially was - 911- proven to not be related to Iraq, also it was because Saddam was suppose to have weapons of mass destruction, not so. I really do not think the mentality of Iraq or most middle eastern countries will ever completely change, and I do not mean this to be negative.



MOOSE: You are Brilliant!!!



Bouncing: Now you make sense and I agree I am not sorry for the loss of Saddam.



Luis - it is people like you that I hold the most respect for and maybe everyone should take note of your posting, you have confirmed my thoughts on a senseless war in Iraq. Thank-you.

What is victory in Iraq?  Bush has no idea.  Is it the partitioning of the country to Shia, Sunni and Kurd?  A dictatorship of former SH supporters?  A freely elected government?



For those who picked a free government, here is the fly in your ointment.  Iraq is majority Shia.  Know who else is Shia?  Google Iran for the shock of your life.  Bush spent trillions to set up a super-cell of anti-American Shia!  Brilliant.

Winning the war in Iraq means having a stable Democratic nation allied to the US in the Gulf. Since the resolution to remove Saddam was passed and signed in the late 90s this was hardly a "personal war" no more than the war on Germany was personal for FDR.

I'm in the USMC, and its really infuriating to hear "its a personal war of the Bush family". Even if you honestly believe that, how can you flaunt that opinion while people are dying in this war? Doesn't the psychological damage of your comment mean -ANYTHING- to you?



But... in answer to your question. Right now we're trying to make the Iraqi army and government able to stand on its own. They don't have much resources, very limited training and you're asking people that have lived life-long hells of terror and fear to suddenly govern themselves and fight their former oppressors.



Mayhap you're an isolationist who didn't care about the cities that were mustard bombed, or the Nazi-style death camps we found that had Kurds dying in the thousands... but for every life I've helped save over there, that was "winning the war" to me.

Changing it from a despotic Muslim country, into a model of Democracy  - that is what the politicians would consider `winning the war`.
Sadly, it`s looking as tho it ain`t gonna happen.



It`s costing too much. The American Public is fed up with it.



And those pesky car-bombers and WHY just won`t go away.



Personally, I never really thought of it as a `War` in the first place. It seemed more like an assault on a country, to me.
But at the same time, I certainly was not sorry to see Hussain outed and deleted.

No seriously though, the war was completely pointless and many lives have been lost in vain.

What will have been won will be the right for America to have air control over Iraq and for Soldiers and support staff and contractors to have immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts. We will have won the right for our troops to be able to carry out attacks on Iraqi neighbors with impunity. Basically we will have won the right to treat Iraq as an occupied colony without any of the annoying responsibility.
Also you can bet that once all the American demands have been granted by the Iraqi government that somehow miraculously it will be the right time to bring back the majority of the troops. Except those left in garrisons there.
We will win the ability to do what we like in someone elses country with no regard for its cit zens or its neighbors.

PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT UP



BUSH'S RESIGNATION SPEECH



The following 'speech' was written recently by an ordinary Maine-iac (a resident of the People's Republic of Maine). While satirical in nature, all satire must have a basis in fact to be effective. This is an excellent piece by a person who does not write for a living.



The speech George W. Bush might give:



Normally, I start these things out by saying 'My Fellow Americans.' Not doing it this time. If the polls are any indication, I don't know who more than half of you are anymore. I do know something terrible has happened, and that you're really not fellow Americans any longer.



I'll cut right to the chase here: I quit. Now before anyone gets all in a lather about me quitting to avoid impeachment, or to avoid prosecution or something, let me assure you: There's been no breaking of laws or impeachable offenses in this office.



The reason I'm quitting is simple. I'm fed up with you people. I'm fed up because you have no understanding of what's really going on in the world. Or of what's going on in this once-great nation of ours. And the majority of you are too damned lazy to do your homework and figure it out.



Let's start local. You've been sold a bill of goods by politicians and the news media.



Meanwhile, all you can do is whine about gas prices, and most of you are too damn stupid to realize that gas prices are high because there's increased demand in other parts of the world, and because a small handful of noisy idiots are more worried about polar bears and beachfront property than your economic security.



We face real threats in the world. Don't give me this 'blood for oil' thing. If I were trading blood for oil I would've already seized Iraq 's oil fields and let the rest of the country go to hell. And don't give me this 'Bush Lied...People Died' crap either. If I were the liar you morons take me for, I could've easily had chemical weapons planted in Iraq so they could be 'discovered.' Instead, I owned up to the fact that the intelligence was faulty.&lt; /I&gt;



Let me remind you that the rest of the world thought Saddam had the goods, same as me. Let me also remind you that regime change in Iraq was official US policy before I came into office. Some guy named ' Clinton ' established that policy. Bet you didn't know that, did you?



And news media has yet to mentioned the 500 Tons of  'Enriched Yellow Cake Uranium ' found and removed from Iraq!!!!!



Now some of you morons want to be led by a junior senator with no understanding of foreign policy or economics, and this nitwit says we should attack Pakistan , a nuclear ally. And then he wants to go to Iran and make peace with a terrorist wh o says he's going to destroy us.



While he's doing that, he wants to give Iraq to al Qaeda, Afghanistan to the Taliban, Israel to the Palestinians, and your money to the IRS so the government can give welfare to illegal aliens, who he will make into citizens, so they can vote to re-elect him. He also thinks it's okay for Iran to have nuclear weapons, and we should stop our foreign aid to Israel .



Did you sleep through high school &/or College?



You idiots need to understand that we face a unique enemy. Back during the cold war, there were two major competing political and economic models squaring off. We won that war, but we did so because fundamentally, the Communists wanted to survive, just as we do. We were simply able to out spend and out-tech them.



That's not the case this time. The soldiers of our new enemy don't care if they survive. In fact, they want to die. That'd be fine, as long as they weren't also committed to taking as many of you with them as they can. But they are. They want to kill you, and the bastards are all over the globe.



You should be grateful that they haven't gotten any more of us here in the United States since September 11. But you're not. That's because you've got no idea how hard a small number of intelligence, military, law enforcement, and homeland security people have worked to make sure of that. When this whole mess started, I warned you that this would be a long and difficult fight. I'm disappointed how many of you people think a long and difficult fight amounts to a single season of 'Survivor.'



Instead, you've grown impatient. You're incapable of seeing things through the long lens of history, the way our enemies do. You think that wars should last a few months, a few years, tops.



Making matters worse, you actively support those who help the enemy. Every time you buy the New York Times, every time yo u send a donation to a cut-and-run Democrat's political campaign, well, dang it, you might just as well FedEx a grenade launcher to a Jihadist. It amounts to the same thing.



In this day and age, it's easy enough to find the truth. It's all over the Internet. It just isn't on the pages of the New York Times, USA Today, or on NBC News. But even if

Sadness, mostly.  Many brave men and women fought and died in that war.  We defeated Germany, but screwed up the peace SOOO badly . . . that our "peace treaty" was the start of World War II.

Hitler grew out of the mess we left in Germany after defeating them.



We learned our mistake, and after WW2, we STAYED, and helped nurture the fragile democracies to GROW . ..



That is exactly what we need to do in Iraq and Afghanistan.  We need to STAY and grow their democracies . . . .

The American government has tried extremely hard to ensure that no one finds out more than they should know about Area 51, and things like that. Top secret weaponry and technology, and contact with possible aliens from who knows where are the most common ideas people have said about Area 51, and odds are, they are true. If all they were doing behind the electric fences of the dusty desert headquarters was developing outstanding technology then why is it so important to the government that no one steps a foot too close to Area 51? A man who worked there even anonymously contacted a paranormal investigator and told him that yes, Area 51 does have alien evidence, UFOs, etc. He also said they even made contact with an alien, with proof on video. It's on Youtube somewhere. I watched it, and was very surprised. But the real issue here is, why is the rest of the world not allowed to know the amazing secrets of alien life forms? Does America deserve to know, or is there a much more complex reason on why this mysterious wonder should be hidden from America for good?

As much as we would all love to believe that "we are not alone", this is just on the border line of crazy talk.

As much as I would love to believe in all this, we simply have no evidence. Man, I miss the days when I was a believer lol.

Really if you are old enough to spell aliens you are old enough to know that there is no limit to how low some people in this world will go. Our gov thinks that we the people couldn't handle the truth whatever it may be. I think what they really fear is that if there are aliens people that want off this rock would line up and start asking for rides to the nearest inhabitable planet and leave this mud-ball to those that already own it. (i.e. politicians and their financial backers world wide)

We cut that off then we slow down the process and I don't like it but to make everyone happy we need to conduct joint raids with the Pakistanis when we need to go into there country!  They just don't want us in there and that is what is hurting us!  Its the surrounding countries that hurt us not the one we are in!  In Iraq I was attack by more Syrians then anyone!

That applies to people before they get into the Army, If you are in and get a tattoo on your hangs and neck then you will get in trouble.  This rule has been around for a long time but i have never had to run into this problem yet!  Meps will get the tattoo's approved with a command waiver, but if they don't like what it is then you might have to get it removed, which the Army will do for you!

I've actually been through a few enlistment sessions, and personally have tattoos on my hands (knuckles) and chest. the rule is (or at least as recruiters put it), tattoos are acceptable nearly everywhere (obviously not your face), depending on your CO's personal rules, EXCEPT on the side of the hand that is seen when saluting an officer.



this may be a bit vague, but like i said, military rules aren't strictly enforced the same way by all officers, and some might be more lenient when dealing with them. i should also add, that even in the army, one person might tell you it's okay, and another might say it's not. i suggest, for 100% assurance, that you contact a recruiter before getting tattoos visible in uniform.



i also have stretched ears, which are now acceptable by military standards. the military will also provide "prescription" plugs, for safety matters.

Of course they can.



Any of the high velocity bullets cause "capitation" once they hit the body.  The impact could shred  limb or blow your head apart like a water mellon under Gallagher's "Sledge-o-matic".



Of course,  key factors are distance....  FMJ or hollow point....

Yes, depending where the round hits.  If you are shot at a joint, the bone is more likely to break off, causing loss of limb.  The 7.62 has a lower velocity than the 5.56, but the 5.56 fragments inside of the body, causing a lot of internal damage, whereas the weight from the 7.62 is much more likely to drop an enemy.  Regardless, if you're shot in the right place, your limb can come off.



Of course, the game Soldier of Fortune is obviously overdone.  Shoot somebody anywhere and a body part explodes like soda and pop rocks.

Not sure I understand what you are asking.  If you are disabled, you get a disability retirement from the VA and can use all military post facilities, thus you get a retired ID.

I've been trying for a long time to enlist in the Canadian Forces....?



and just before I'm ready for training, I get arrested for armed assault.



I'm trying as hard as I can to beat the charges, and I'm willing to pay anything, including most of the paycheck for my first tour.



besides that, i'd like to know if there is any way for me to offer my service as a way to keep my record "clean". i'm not afraid of paying fines or serving time, but i don't want this to effect my chances of serving my country, or deploying to Afghanistan.

I'm not sure about Canada, but in the U.S. military, you can go in, even if you were arrested, with no fines and you get to skip court, depending how how bad the crime.

If you've been arrested for armed assault why should the Canadian military want you?  You don't seem to be the type of person that any military organization would want or should have.



There is no mention of repent or of guilt in your posting.  Merely that you'd do anything to keep your record clean.  You don't sound like a guy I'd want in my unit.  I don't think your fellow servicemen could trust you should you be allowed to enlist.

There are Naval personnel stationed in Gibraltar. Army personnel are deployed to Germany and Cyprus on regular tours of duty. There is an RAF base at Akrotiri on Cyprus too.

How to handle a best friend who converted to islam during his second tour of duty in iraq?



I asked the same q in the religion section. Just wanna get the opinion of you all about how to approach my dear friend. Thanks.



We have grown up together, went to the same church etc. Actually he enlisted due to the extraordinary amount of rage he felt against muslims. Now he has become one himself, and encourages me to convert as well. He apparently had a close call in a mosque during an operation and thinks that a miracle happened there that saved his life. I think its a mere coincidence but I don't say it not to disrespect him. His opinion of our friendship with isreal has changed as well. I was kinda shocked and still don't know what to do.

Just avoid discussing religion or Israel with him, if you'd like to keep him as a dear friend. If his attempts to get you to convert make you uncomfortable, tell him, and you guys can agree to disagree. Then just talk about things that won't drive a wedge between you.

contrary to media Hype the Islam Faith is NOT all 'Death to Non Muslim Infidels'  Just as the Jewish people have their radicals, so does Islam.. and Christianity.



pretty sure the only religion that DOESN'T is Buddhism.



if you ever read the Bible.. parts of IT are waaayyy more  violent than the Quran.



you don't have to agree with his conversion.. but you DO have to respect it.  If you are not interested in doing so yourself, politely tell him up front that you are not willing to entertain the possibility.

I wouldn't do anything that might make him feel isolated.  Usually decisions made because of circumstances like that are short lived. Kinda like when you have a huge scare and think you are never going to say another cuss word again, miss another church service again and be perfect every second from now on and then you get on with your life and it becomes a memory.  You are one of his best chances of staying connected to his roots.  I am assuming you are a Christian, so I am talking to you as one Christian to another.  Respect his opinions and ideas.  You don't have to agree.  But you need to respect his right to his feelings.  Respectfully agree to disagree.  Don't freak out.  There is one God.  The bible says train a child the way he should go and he will not depart from it.  I am probably older than you and I have had similar circumstances.  I friend that I grew up with, went to church with, joined a cult.  She came back around after almost a year later.  She still talked to me because I didn't freak out and she could talk to me.  I was her link to reality and it helps to have that.  Now Muslims are not these crazy extremists like Bin Laden.  Some are.  Their prophet Mohammad was married to Khadija and her brother was a Christian.  The story goes the angiel Gabriel,(yep, same one) appeared to him in a cave in a mountain.  He ran home to his wife told her what happened and she took him to her brother who talked to him about God and he and his wife were saved that night.  Remember, Jesus was a Jew, there was no Christianity before Christ, there was no Muslim or Islam until Mohammad.  So see not so scary.  I know you are worried about your friend but its going to be ok.  Just pray for him.  Let him talk.  Let time take its course.  About his ideas on Isreal.  Remember in the bible even God got angry with Isreal.  I ain't too happy with them either sometimes.  I know "God's chosen people" But the bible also says we are god's chosen people.  That doesn't give us a blank check to go out and do anything we want to does it? NO. I don't believe in giving Isreal a blank check either.  I personally think we should judge each circumstance  as it comes up and decide what is best to do.  Just hang in there.  It will be ok.  God Bless You

Medical records are your own private business, if you have no visible marks/scars or remaining illness's simply don't share the information and lie about it.

I didn't bring in my medical records,  I just wrote down what I wanted them to know.  Fraudulent enlistment isn't as bad a you think it would be.  So long as nothing ever comes of it, the military will have no reason to try and fact check you.



Let's say in 2 years you are having trouble with whatever it was you were having trouble with before and get re-diagnosed with the same issue you had before.  well instead of treating your problem the mil will claim preexisting condition and fraudulent enlistment.  A common example of this would be back problems.

dont listen to that. tell them everything. they will not keep you out for that. they want you to be in the military, remember. tell them about everything you have had wrong with you, but tell them that you no longer suffer from it at all. the military will find out about it, and give you dishonorable discharge, and may even send you to court martial. the records are given through your recruiter and meps. you have to sign for the records to be released to the military, and you sign a little slip, and your recruiter drives to pick them up, or they are mailed. do not leave anything out, because it WILL come back to bite you in the ***.

Correction... at what they do....



Each of the special force branches  are the best... in their field of expertise.

Tough answer.  Each of the Special Forces Teams from each of the countries has unique talents.  Israelis apparently are fantastic in hostage situations, the Canadians are amazing in bad weather situations (wife's cousin is one...considers them highly trained thugs), The Brits are exceptional, my dad was UDT/Seal way back when...



The Seals are responsible for most of the major take-downs of high end terrorists these days in the middle east, and they don't advertise it.  Apparently, they're so off-the-charts successful that Congress is giving them whatever they need.  The Navy is also actively reorienting a LOT of resources and altering some of the fleet's primary missions... to help support them.

Britain.Even the americans would say us.



Britain is internationally recognised as having the best special forces, and rightly so.



Britains special services consist of
SAS
SBS
SRR -  not many heard of this one, the special reconnisance regiment.



Britain really is a league apart from the rest in terms of special forces, we may not have the most, but the ones we have are by far the best in the world.That rule applies to the rest of the British armed forces as well actually.

every country will say they have the "best" special forces. my suggestion is, check out each one and make the decision yourself.



i notice a lot of people say, israeli special forces, SAS, Delta Force, etc., but you should check out the Canadian JTF2, though, i doubt you'll find much information about them ;)



i wont lie, my opinion is slightly biased, like i said, every country will say it's the best, but i do suggest looking into it.

I'm afraid that, if the person concerned - your boyfriend, perhaps? - is determined to enlist, then you can't make him change that decision. You'll either have to accept it, or end the relationship.



Sorry to give you the bad news, but this is his decision,and if you try to change his mind, you'll only end up regretting it, as he'll become angry, hurt and resentful that you don't support him, and you may end up losing him anyway.

You don't stop someone from going into the Army.



Let me guess your boyfriend is joining up right? Well if you stop him from joining up and lets say you both get on with your lives, then one day you two have an argument and decide to split up.. then looks whos lost out. He has!



What I'm saying is, if it's your boyfriend that's joining then don't stop him because likes are, joining or not you'll both probably spilt up one day soon and I wouldn't want someone to lose out on such a good career.



You can't stop him, even if it's your son I wouldn't stop him. Whoever it is, be proud. If they are old enough to join the Army, then they are old enough to make their own decisions in life!

It's not your choice to make. Besides, despite the dangers inherent in military service, you should be proud of whoever it is. Soldiers are the brave foundation of our country. Our freedoms are built and kept through the blood and sacrifice of American Soldiers. Just because you don't have the guts for military service, doesn't mean you should try to stop someone who has that calling.

Why do you want to?  Do you have a boyfriend or bigger brother you think will get sent to Iraq and killed the day after he joins?  Don't believe the media because they tend to make it look like a massacre over there when more people get killed in supposedly safe American cities than over in the Middle East in the same time period.  If you don't want someone to join then there nothing you can legally do outside of begging them not to or giving them some incentive for not joining (such as giving them a lot of money not to join or something similar).  I would suggest just letting that person follow their dream and not think they will get killed for joining.

I'll put it to you bluntly.  Girlfriends come and go... your career won't.  If she is not someone who can support the decisions you want to make with your life, then it wouldn't work out anyway.  Don't fail to do something because of what someone else says.  You do not want to live with a life of regret always wondering what if.

ok let me just tell you from my experience, if you want to join the Air Force, and you feel pretty strong about it, you have to understand that that is a career choice. That is something that will be with you the rest of your life.



Im going to say this and I don't want you to take it the wrong way. But she is just your girlfriend. They come and go. Your decision about your career, do not come and go.



It is important that you do what you want to do, and what is the smartest thing that you know to do for YOU. What is going to make or break you.



If you are going to join, and you are going to have a girlfriend, then they are going to have to support you. I do not know about your relationship with her, or how long you have been with her. But don't let anything get in the way of what you want to do with your career. If you do then just like you said, you are going to regret it the rest of your life.



If she doesn't like it, I promise you that you don't have to have a girlfriend to be successful, and have a great career.



I hope this helps some

Tell her you love her and that you want to do this so you can have a better future for the both of you.  Depending on how long you two have been dating and how serious the relationship is, you can say that the AF can provide a stable income and benefits if and when you get married.  Also gives you both a chance to travel and meet new people, to live on your own and depend on only each other.
But if she's really adamant about you not going then you may just have to decide what's best for you and you alone.  And be prepared for things not to work out while you are away at BMT & Tech School, sorry.
I had a girlfriend who was supportive of my decision of joining but half-way thru Tech School she told me she had been dating someone else because she could not keep waiting for me (from BMT to Tech School I was gone 6 months before I saw her again).  Ended up being a blessing in disguise since I was able to date a lot of ladies while I was single.  And four years later I met my wife.
Hope this helps feel free to email me with any other questions you may have.

I was dating this guy 6 years ago and he wanted to join the Air Force to, i did not want him to go, i cried, i begged, he knew i was in a relationship before with a guy who went into the army and came out a real jerk, so he told me he was doing it and he would understand if i didn't want to be with him anymore but would love if i would stay with him, well i was already in love with him so i stayed and supported him, we've been married over 5 years now and he loves the AF, we have a great life, he wanted to join because he always wanted to serve his country and i didn't want to be a reason for him to have any regrets, our marriage is stronger then many civilian marriages because we appreciate the time we have with each other more, you have to do what YOU want to do, not what your girlfriend or even your parents want you to do, my husbands parents didn't want him to join either and now they say its the best decision he ever made, don't let your girlfriend hold you back, i'm sure she loves you but she needs to let you follow your dreams just like i'm sure she would want you to support her in whatever she wants to do, my husband has been deployed and it does take a certain kind of woman to be in a military relationship, its not cut out for everyone, but it has taught me to be independent and grateful for my husband and our life together, bottom line: join, or you'll regret it, my husband has been to every continent and has only been in for a little over 5 years, you'll get to live in places and experience things you never dreamed you would, my husband loves it and will retire when he's 39, if you don't like it after 4 years you can get out, do something else and have college money, good luck to you!

Many people face this, you are not alone.



You will of course miss her, and she will miss you.  But what you have to consider are these thoughts:



Do you want to stay where you are for a long time?



Do you want to resent someone for a very long time because you allowed them to determine your future?



In the long run, the time you will be away from her for basic training and technical school is probably 6 or 7 months.  Now if she says that leaving the current location is out of the question after you finish school, you need to answer the two questions I gave you above.



This is a decision that you need to make for yourself.  You said she was your girlfriend, not your fiance, not your spouse.  She really should not have an equal vote on this matter.  Good Luck in your career!

I know exactly how you feel. I didn't enlist b/c of my boyfriend. I was scared our relationship wouldn't last if I was gone and you know what....it didn't last anyway. I started recently thinking about enlisting again and was feeling like if I didn't do it I would wake up one day and wonder "What if?" I expressed my feelings to my boyfriend (a different guy) and he wasn't too excited, just like my ex. Well, he's an ex now too and I leave for BMT in December. At first I was sad about the breakup, but then I realized if he couldn't be supportive of something I really wanted out of life, then he wasn't the one for me anyway.



If she really loves you, she'll be supportive. Doesn't mean she has to necessarily like it, but she won't make you choose b/t her and your dream. And if she does, do you really want to be with a person like that??

The latest plan is before 2012.  It does take awhile to move stuff out and the U.S. still has to hand over 6 more providences, including Baghdad and finish training and supplying the Iraqi government.  For instance, Iraq does not have much of an air force.  The U.S. was helping Germany and Japan rebuild nine years after WWII.

We are everywhere! They can't even go to the local "Jamaal Mart" without us checking their bags on the way out. Iraq has money and trained security forces. They feel that our role over there is no longer needed. They also feel that we operate without regard to their privacy and property. I just looked up in the sky today and I didn't see any Iraqis flying a jet towards the White House. I wonder if that would be true in 2012?

Because they acknowledge that we are playing a big part in shaping their economy, and fixing rifts in their society. Of course, we can't be the endall, that is up to them. They are the ones who will have to (and I believe are able to) prove that they can hold elections without a warlord popping up, or that they are hopeless, and doomed to dictatorship.



That they themselves say that they want us there at least till 2011, they obviously have a greater grasp of the situation than you or I. I'd take their word over yours, that's it.

I do not believe that Russia and the United States will go to war, and this is why: Eventually, either in this election or the next, we will elect someone with Socialistic and Marxist sympathies, and he will be completely fine with what Russia does and is doing. They will end up in complete agreement, and there will be no need for war, except maybe a revolution here in the U.S.

it would be extremely unpopular in both countries..  with two nuclear armed countries, war is a limited option.  nukes will never be used by an industrialized nation unless fired upon by another industrialized nuclear armed nation.  it's a deterrent factor.  both nations understand that using atomic weapons would be the end of civilization as we know it..  with that being said, a conventional war IS possible though not likely because of that possibility of nuclear weapons being used.  no one wants to risk that.  Russia is, however, running the risk of being isolated from the rest of the civilized world.  and their economy will not be able to withstand such a situation.  ask Syria, Lybia, N. Korea, Iran..  2 of those 4 are on paths of un-isolation due to pressure from their own people.  and that's what you'll see from Russians if their government continues on this newfound folly of aggressive politics.

If the US and Russia ever went to war directly, it would indeed go nuclear very fast. There is little doubt that the US would win. Anything that Russia has in comparison to the US airforce's current planes, are only in development stages.  Russia's navy and army are a wreck. There is a reason Russia has spent most of its defence budget on retaining and upgrading its nuclear missiles, because it can't "win" without them.



The only hope for a non nuclear war would be if Russia has a far-gazing leader, one who would understand that a loss to the US would not mean a loss of their sovereignty, and that their citizens (the peaceful ones at least), would be treated well (for war) and possibly even prosper. One that would weigh the costs of that loss as better than the "benefits" a nuclear war.

When we go to war we all go. In support of each other. We all depend on each other to get to war, stay at war, and come home.



What I mean is each branch are trained in their own way to go to war. Without the Air force, and the Navy, we couldn't logistically get to war. So we are all in support of one another.

Here is the order....ALL at the SAME TIME!!!! It depends on location of the Operation,the time it takes a unit to move there and the specified training and equipment the unit has. Currently all the armed services are under deployment rotations that varies from 4-6 months to 12-22 months.



The navy is already patrolling the waters.
The marines are riding with them.
The air force has airfields everywhere
The army hitches a ride there
The reservists gets called there to compliment the force.
If I were you, I would be more concerned on who would be the first to be sent home,because NOBODY is able to answer that one!

We go all at once.



That said, the Air Force and Navy may very well have been in theater long before combat begins--we deploy aircraft and ships in areas where we think we might need to fight ahead of time.  Unless we're getting attacked, the first combat action will probably be in the air or from sea launched missiles, but you can bet that there will always be soldiers and Marines on standby ready to go anywhere.  The military works as a joint force--the Air Force does most all of the air lift to get people and equipment to a location, and the Navy provides a lot of fire power with cruise missiles and air craft.



Once exception is the USMC, with some of the MAGTAFs (Marine Air Ground Task Force) they have the capability to fight a limited war all on their own, but they'll probably be supported by the Navy.



Also, after combat, once ground forces leave, the Air Force and Navy will stick around to keep an eye on what's going on.

But I do know that it's not required. Thing is, if it's between two candidates up for promotion that are roughly equal, but one has gone to Sgts Course and one has not, the one that has will get it...



It's kind of like a degree. Two people that do the same quality work go up for a job or for promotion, but one has a degree, he'll be picked over the over...

Anyone who tries to disrupt their homecoming parades should get a beat down from those who are coming home. Really, these guys are hero's, what kind of jerk would try to make them out to be any different. I love our troops, I fully support them, both when they are serving and when they are out of the service. It pisses me off when people give them a hard time.

I think people who try to disrupt the homecoming parades are really just trying to inadvertently lash out at themselves.  I think most of them see into their own inner self and see these service members doing something that they never could and it angers and frightens them.  In response to this and to try to cover up their own feelings of inadequacy in life, they attack that which they are jealous of.  Either way, it is no excuse for their behavior.  They should be locked up for their actions.

do you mean what do i think of Islamic people trying to stop the home coming parades.?....throw them out of the country. we have Always welcomed our troops home from conflict. if they had any guts they would be back there fighting for what they are shouting about. not over here hiding behind mummy Britain's skirt afraid to fight for their country  like the slimy cowards they are. i suppose after running away like a little scared rabbit, it must be hard to look at real men!! 'is that it do you think?' if they don't like our traditions then they can f*ck off back to the hell of their own making that they ran from......but sadly the people 'as per usual' will just step back and allow the cave dwellers to run the shop......then wonder why they are losing their pride their identity and their country.

it saddens me that there are people out there like that.  these soldiers, my husband and brother being two, are doing there job.  they don't have a choice.  they are sent far away and put into harms way, so the least we (the American people) can do is show them our support.  even if you don't agree how the war is being handled and that it's still going on (like myself) you should still make sure that the soldiers know that we still support them.  it's sickening and disturbing that people would go out of there way to do this.

There are always going to be those few people trying to show they are anti war by chanting things like "baby killer!" I always wonder if they see the irony in the fact that they have the freedom of speech to say those things because of the troops they are harassing. The way I deal with people like that is to kill them with kindness. When I see or hear people doing that I love to just smile, walk up to them and shake there hand (if I can) and just say "Your welcome. I am so glad that you have the freedom to say what you want with out getting arrested or fearing for your life." After that I just walk away. It's funny, because kindness confuses mean people.



Remember, you don't have to support the war, but please support the troops. If you don't stand behind the troops, than please stand in front of them!

Rules on getting tattoos before joining or while serving in the USMC?



I was thinking about getting a tattoo before joining the USMC in a few years. I planned on getting "Greater Love Has No One Than This,That He Lay Down His Life For His Friends"-John 15:13. on my forearm... so its a constant reminder that if for some resin we get in one of those situations Where i can give it all up to save 1 or more of my buddies life's...but for some resin just dont think i can look at my arm and know what i want to do.



So,is it possible to still get in with that on my arm&gt;? or is their a way I cold possibly get it after boot so Ive got it before im deployed(Prob put in a request if I feel i wont be sent).

They have recently tightened the rules on tattoos - if you want to go ahead and get it now get it someplace that can't be seen in boxer shorts and a t-shirt.  If you want it on your arm you'd better get it on your upper bicep.  You could possibly get a waiver but it's best to avoid them if you can.

You have to understand with everything before and after being a US Marine has to be taken into a conservative approach to personal appearance, keep that in mind before any change you plan on doing.



That tattoo you're thinking of getting on your forearm is past shirt (aka Blouse)sleeve, making it visible, therefore prohibited, under the new USMC tattoo policy.



This also applies to current tattoos, nothing crazy no more that is. Until recently there is a no go policy on new enlistees, US Marines currently in active status to have or be with tattoos past their shirt sleeves, in any shape form or way is now officially prohibited.



read this..



Marines are prohibited from:



a. Tattoos or brands on the head and neck.



b. Sleeve Tatoos. A sleeve tattoo is a very large tattoo, or a collection of smaller tattoos, that covers or almost covers a person's entire arm or leg.



c. Half-sleeve or quarter sleeve tattoos that are visible to the eye when wearing standard PT Gear (T-shirt and shorts). A half-sleeve or quarter-sleeve tattoo is defined as a very large tattoo or collection of smaller tattoos that covers, or almost covers the entire portion of an army or leg above or below the elbow or knee.



d. Tattoos or brands that are prejudicial to good order, discipline and morale, or are of a nature to bring discredit upon the Marine Corps. These may include, but are not limited to, any tattoo that is sexist, racist, vulgar, anti-american, anti-social, gang related, or extremest group or organization related.



Marines who currently have a sleeve tattoo(s) prior to 1 April 2007, will be grandfathered. The Marine's command will insert a photograph(s) of the respective (tattoo(s) along with a measurement(s) of the size in inches and of the location(s) on the body and the date the tattoo(s) was documented, on the Page 11 of the Marine's SRB. The Marine will sign the Page 11 entry verifying the information is correct.

Why i dont want to vote?



OK first of all I am a military wife going on five years now. But to tell you the truth I really don't think i want to vote. i believe the choices that are being giving are sh*ty!



On one hand you have McCain, who wants to stay i the war, keep our men in danger, keep in mind my husband is gone to Iraq for 11 more months. He also has a sh**y health care plan and tax plan.



Then you have Oboma who wants to take our troops out of the war, while that sounds good, he also wants to cut military funding and that means my husbands pay and kicking people out all together. Personally I don't agree with the war. But I also think we have to much sh** over there just to yank all the troops out with out tons more drama.I am not saying keep the troops over there because i want more money but i am saying that after all theses men and women have done for this country your just going to take em out and basically demote them. I think that the us military deserves way more respect then that!



So basically I just want your feed back, you don't need to bad mouth me just be respectful in your opinion. I don't believe I am a bad American for not voting because i don't like either person, but as the saying goes if you did not vote then do not complain, i have no problem with that i think the world is going to sh** either way!

Obama has said repeatedly that he wants to begin a phased withdrawl "responably." I do not anticipate a foolish immediate withdrawl like Kucinish or Gravel would have done, I expect many negotiations with the Iraqi government to get the country headed on the right track, then slowly to withdraw brigades and redeploy them to Afghanistan and other Al Queda hangouts, under Obama.

Actually I think you are misinformed about both candidates.



Regardless of who is elected they are going to want to be known as the guy who ended the Iraq War.  So our troop presence there is going to decline no matter who gets elected.



I'm not sure where you are getting your notion that Obama wants to reduce troop strength.  That is simply not the case.  I know a lot of military members are leery of Democrats but the reality is we will be increasing defense spending for some time to come.



Go to the voting booth, you'll be surprised how much is going to be there.  If you don't like either candidate you can vote for a third party candidate.  Also, there is more than just the Presidency up for election.  There may be a Senate race in your state, plus your House Representative is up for reelection.

Yes, you have a tough decision. I wouldn't blame you if you didn't vote.
With any luck your husband will come home safe, and then you can worry about things like a dumb election. Honestly, though I'm more conservative, I don't think it will matter much who wins in your case.
I think either way lots of troops will be coming home soon.

I am probably one of the few people who think that a decision not to vote is a vote in and of itself.  I'm not crazy about either candidate.  I think McCain is too far left, and I'm sure you can figure out what I think of Obama.  The main reason I will tolerate McCain is that he is pro-life.  I can't understand how a nation like ours can tolerate killing innocent, unborn children.  While I support your decision not to vote for pres, don't forget to check out all the other candidates (state, local as well as national).  You may want to cast your vote for one or more of these.  By the way, we have a right to voice our opinions because we are citizens, not because we have voted.

I agree, both candidates are horrible this year... like MANY elections recently. You can't look at just one plan of a candidate and pick him.



Obama will not "FORCE" a pull out date without any conditions, he's not stupid. He's probably going to base it on what the generals have to say, then shorten/extend the time-frame. If all of a sudden a huge terrorist attack takes over Baghdad, he's going to postpone the pull-out date.
As for McCain, I don't think he's going to leave until all the terrorists are gone, even if the Iraq security group could take over, IMO. Seems to me he might even propose making a permanent base camp (yes/no) ???



As for Obama cutting funds for the military, that might be in part true, but he DOES want to pay more for those that return to the US and/or retire. I really have not dug deep into this topic, but it seems (before the debates) Obama will be cutting the tech finance of the military, not the actual paychecks and benefits (I could be wrong).



Honestly, I'm voting for Obama based on Energy mainly. I believe we need more GREEN energy so we can get leverage against Iran, North Korea, and China to change their energy plans. Also helps global warming and prevent a chain-reaction from occurring in the coming  20 years. If we go McCain, we actually lose the leverage on Oil and Nuclear, doing nothing to help CO2 emissions.
Obamas' health care is "better" than what McCain has to offer, even though I don't agree with either. Education... same reason as health care.
As for taxes... was it really THAT bad before the tax cuts Bush gave us? One argument for McCain saying Obama raises taxes on middle-class, is because the Bush tax cut expires very soon. The other is the 250,000 one, but most Americans make less than 40,000.



As for everything doing "crappy", blame that on Bush when he decided to invade Iraq for NOT having WMDs. Should have finished the 1st war before starting the 2nd one.



Hope that helps some...

Based on this little information - your boyfriend is a borderline loser, and getting out of "this little ****hole town" was the reason I joined the military, too.  Had a great time, learned a lot - traveled more than any other member of my HS class.  If he stays in podunk but you're out there seeing the world, you're going to outgrow him in a matter of months.

If you and he (or any guys for that matter) are meant to be, that love will survive the marines.

I did 6 years in the Navy, and had amazing experiences that otherwise I would have missed.  It did wonders for me, but that's me. Sure as hell didn't matter if some bf wanted me to stay or go.

Well truthfully  I've read some of these answers poster already and agree with none of them. First off, I hope you didn't just join because your bf did. Second  of course he didn't want you to join after going through his 13 weeks of hell in paris island.
The USMC is the branch I hold the most pride in and I joined the navy (I'm a corpsman with a infantry unit).  The military is what you make of it, just like anywhere else, you have a lot of good days and a lot of **** days.  You make great friends and get to do some things you would never dream of as a civilian.  You are doing a great deal not only for yourself but for our nation. If you decide to go through with it,  I would be proud to call you a sister in arms

Brittany: Speaking only for myself as a retired Army veteran of 24 years, yes it is worth it. I am not going to tell you to get out of the DEP and join some other branch, that would be doing you a disservice. I am going to tell you that what you are going to go through won't be easy. By nature, initial military training is very hard and is meant to strip you of your individuality (don't worry, you get it back), in order to teach you to obey orders, in some cases without question. Look at it this way, in civilian life if someone were to yell "GET DOWN", your first reaction would be to ask why. In the military, in the time it takes to ask why, you could be the recipient of a bullet through the head.
Just remember, the military is what you make of it. If you tell yourself it is going to be the worst thing that ever happened to you, you're right. If you tell yourself that it going to be a building and learning experience, again you're right.

Its what you make of it. I know a ton of guys in the service with extrmely awesome jobs, Ive seen some of them firsthand when I can get a friend who is a MP or MA to escort me in to bring them lunch or whatever. Some of these guys will never be happy, theyll end up being that old douchbag vet who has to talk down to everyone, but then there are they guys who realize how god they have it and love every moment of it.



The guys I know who joined for "respect" and to go blow things up absolutely hate it, but the good guys who did it for the team and for the chance to have a meaningful job absolutely love it and dont stop raving about it.



You just nee t realize first off that you are not going to get respect, but you will have self respect. Most people dont know what self respect feels like, but it is much better than respect from others. Do what you know you will enjoy doing and forget all that gungho crap, BUT dont take that as me telling you not to be a marine. The Marines get things done, they are strait shooters, they dont BS around, they get the job done. If you want to do something great and feel great after a hard days work, join the marines. If you are the kind who thinks they deserve respect, stay the hell away from the marines, you will hate it. Remember that in any service, you are the bottom of the totem poll, just like with any other job, but in this job, the guys who you work for actually deserve respect.

Dear Brittany,



Please understand you are NOT obligated to go, you can still terminate your 'promise contract', basically known as. Since you have not been sworn in officially and have not signed your last and official contract which is presented to you the day of your shipment to Recruit Training.



With that said, let me say this.



I have said this many times before to persons in reality and persons on the internet forums whom are interested in Military path.



Although recruiters make it out to be an adventuresome path waiting to be taken upon, this is not the truth. The Military, more so the Marines is not something to be taken lightly, nor should you think of it as an new adventure in your life, or something even fun to attempt. Military deep in core is purely for the Warrior hearted/minded and spirited. The Marines are strictly apart of the US Military for the sole purpose of shock and effect force.



The Marine Corps (as well other US Military Infantry branches) is where true Warriors are made into actual ones and the ones in doubt/denial are exposed and unfortunately let to root out, as realistic as I can put this, be liabilities to the real.



As Marines we are a family and everyone of us counts, if you fail we fail as whole.



We all are not created equal, and unfortunately/fortunately all are not Warriors. Even though they are given the chance, but little do you know once contracted in, there is no turning back, and I mean this, THERE IS NO BACKING OUT.



I am not here to discourage you in anyway, I am telling you what the recruiter does not.



I have been in the USMC for 5 years plus, I am 0311 MOS, I have done 2 Tours in Iraq, Anbar providence aka Ramadi. These experience have not changed me, nor have effected me psychologically in my Life. They in fact except other than made the well oiled Warrior I am.  But this what I wanted and always knew in my heart. I serve the purpose of what fuels me, my spirit as a Warrior and my rightful place in a society where I am what I am, a US Marine.



I say all this to you, for you to see what I am and others like me may be. Also to encourage you to look deep inside and to see if this is what you really want to be apart of or just another idea placed in your mind by someone or thing to benefit themselves secretively.



I cannot say I was once like you, because I knew my path. But what I can say is, once you are on that bus to recruit training, let along out the bus and standing on painted foot prints, you will realize either two things, you've made a mistake or this is now truly nothing that you want/feel you're cut out for. I can guarantee these feelings because I was there and so many other Marines before me and you, if you so decide to go.



Small towns are everywhere in the USA, yes it sucks. But it is not an isolated place, I mean as in the only place in the US. You can with the help of yourself, move towards bettering yourself for your actual dreams and pleasures. If you truly put your resources into it you will see the Civilian world is full of opportunities to progress yourself forward toward a good life in the future.



Military should never be the last choice to cop out on. It should be an privilege, not something to do if you don't have anything better with your life, because you do.



I hope I was of help to you.



Semper Fi, always.

Well I don't think the marines is a good place right now for you. If you join you will probably go to Iraq and have to walk infront of haliburton trucks so the trucks won't blow up any land mines, I suggest you go to college, and try to meet a nice intelligent person, and start a family not everyone is suited from the military.

Does the US only have a long term strategy of defeat in Afghanistan?



Do you feel we are getting anywhere in Afghanistan?



The taliban controls half of afghanistan, in the day and night time. Westerners can't even walk through Kandahar at anytime. Kabul is under siege. What has the united states achieved? We are supporting one of the most corrupt governments in afghanistan history. The people are not seeing any development to their lives, why should they care for the US?



I think we need atleast 500,000 troops in afghanistan to stablize in the long term. Or we need to negotiate with the taliban to bring about a long term solution.



Plus the aggressive posturing in Pakistan is detrimental to achieving any security in that region long term. Pakistan has a huge army, with a population of 173 million, thats six times the popultion of Iraq. There is no way in the world we could sustain such an occupation.

more troops is not the answer, the Soviet Union provided an excellent example of that. Whats this about occupying Pakistan? I have never heard of any such thing discussed by reliable military sources? Their army wouldn't be the problem in any case, the US has shown an outstanding ability to wipe all conventional foes aside. This is why they resort to unconventional tactics, such as suicide bombers. You are most likely correct that we couldn't sustain an occupation in that area and try to be humane, then again, we aren't planning on it.

Like Iraq, the problem will not be solved until the population endorse there government.



The partial success in Iraq is not only due to the military surge but it has to do more with the population starting to trust there government. The problem is that Bush is starting to dislike more and more the Iraq government.



In Afghanistan, the great majority of the population does not trust their government. That is why the insurgency is still strong.

My advice is don't believe everything that you read in the newspapers or see on the telly. If you want the straight word on what is really happening, buy and read Soldier of Fortune Magazine. They have been attacked by the "main-stream" media as being mercenaries, but they give more accurate information that any other source. They go in with the soldiers on the ground and in the air, and report without bias.

That was the result of Bush's abandonment of Afghanistan to try to get a win in Iraq.  I don't even want to argue over whether that was wise or not--I think it was dumb, but who really knows?



If we need half a million troops (more than three times what we have in Iraq today), we need to get some help from other countries.  We also need to figure out a clear goal there--getting that area ready to join the EU would take a million troops (since the USSR couldn't stabalize that area with smaller efforts, I don't expect the US or Europe to be able to either).  Simply getting Bin Laden (and ignoring the Taliban and regional stability) would take 50-100,000 troops to hassle him into hiding poorly, and a few special ones to assinate him.  So we need to be sure to ask Obama or McCain the same thing we asked of Bush and didn't get an answer:  What are we trying to do over there?



To ease your mind, both presidential candidates are going to step up our efforts in Afghanistan.  With the job in Iraq nearly finished, it's really a no-brainer.  We aren't going to try to occupy Pakistan.  One candidate has made it clear to the world that he'll violate their sovereignty if they don't assist us with Bin Laden, while the other guy implied he'd do the same but laughed at his opponent for actually saying it out loud.  So don't worry, no matter who is elected, something will be done in Afghanistan.

Right now I feel like we are fighting a war against an enemy we can't readily identify.  I think we should finish what we initially went to the middle east to do all those years ago: Subdue ALL Taliban/Alqeida Operations, Kill Osama Bin Laden.



Instead of introducing NEW TROOPS, just REORGANIZE the EXISTING TROOPS that are spread all across the middle east it seems.

marines make the same money as all other branches of the service but may have the slowest promotion rate. because the military provides food and shelter for free, you can join any branch and retire a millionaire in less than 10 years if you learn how to invest (and the market actually recovers)

One of nicest thing about military, is that they pay you more if you had spouse or children.  You pay base on a lot of stuff such as your rank, location, if you had special pay.  But you should make around 2000-3000 beginning.

The military pay depends on a lot of things.  Like if he has a college degree he will go in as an officer and they get paid more than enlisted.  But base pay is determined on rank and time of service. They add on BAS which is for food and BAH for housing which changes depending on what part of the country you live in.  Then they have hazard pay which he gets if he is working in dangerous situations. When my husband joined the Navy we were getting paid nothing at all while he was in boot camp.  When he got out we could afford a 600 dollar apt, and car payment, and all other bills with enough to spare to be able to go out and eat 4 to 5 days a week but it was only us two that we were feeding.

All of the answers you have received are good, as far as they go. You can look up military pay scales on line, but they don't give the full story and most people don't consider all the non-monetary benefits as worth consideration. You could probably make as much money as an E1 working full time at McDonalds but, will they give you free room and board, free medical and dental benefits, 30 days of vacation with pay per year (not paid vacation, a totally different thing), a chance to live and work in a foreign country, not necessarily a war zone, and good, solid skill training. So, when you look up the pay scale, consider all the other benefits as income as well and then take another look at Mickey D's and I think you will choose the Marines.

Well that really depends on what his rank will be when he enlists say he is an E3 when he enlists basic bay for E3 would be the same for every branch of the military I think, don't qoute me on that though, is around 1500 a month for E1 or 2  it would be like 1200 to 1400 that's just basic pay and most likely he will get extra allownces for housing and extra money for having dependents so he will be making a little more then what he is now and plus the more time he stays in he gets pay raises for time in service and obviously the more higher in rank he gets the more money he gets as well

assuming he is an e-1 he would make about 1300 a month
plus another 800-1000 for housing since he is married and has kids
and then another 250 for separation, the months he is away.
your health insurance would be completely paid for while he is active duty
and dental coverage is a small fee per month/year compared to what you would normally pay.

It doesn't even look like anything currently worn in the military, so I doubt anyone would anything of it.  Besides, civilians often go to the military surplus stores around the bases to buy gear for hunting and such.  What would be and is offensive is people wearing ribbons, medals, awards and patches they have not earned.  (Which on top of being faux-pas type offensive may actually be a federal offense).

Pakistan Air Force to participate in bilateral air exercise with Turkey?



Six Pakistani F-16 combat jets have reached Turkey to participate in the bilateral air exercise code named "Anatolian Eagle 2008" with Turkey.
The participation of the Pakistan Air Force pilots in the 15-day air exercise in Turkey will shape up their training and help in strengthening ties between the two countries, said a statement from the Pakistani Air Force.
The PAF has participated in several multi-national air force exercises. These include the "Anatolian Eagle" series of manoeuvres held in 2004 and 2006 and other exercises with the US, Britain, Iran and Turkey. The current exercise coincides with Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's official visit to Turkey.

First off, let me give you some good advice, why are you asking this online?  People in the service get in trouble all the time for displaying incriminating evidence on sites like MySpace and Facebook, in fact they often monitor for things like this.



Hopefully they can't trace your name from this site!



Even in the reserves you still can be held accountable for violations of the UCMJ (Uniformed Code of Military Justice).  More specifically Article 134 (Fraternization) for officers and Article 92 (being in an unprofessional relationship) for enlisted.



Below is an article on the subject.
Granted you're a reservist and not under the militaries eyes 24/7, you're still taking a risk.



You know the Air Force is big on it's core values, and common sense would dictate that dating a married officer violates the whole "integrity" part.



I'd be careful!
Good Luck!

It's not a guarantee!  The Army has had a hard time recruiting people these days, resulting in restrictions getting more and more laxed.  What I mean is that the maximum age allowed keeps getting older and older. If you are going into boot camp, there's always the possibilty you're not alone!

There is definately paperwork involved.  They are contracted, so they aren't military movers.  I would suggest watching them pack everything! Also, they are supposed to label and write down everything they pack, and at the end you need to sign some paperwork stating they packed and accounted for everything.  It's not uncommon for things to break or items like DVD's to end up missing.



You might be able to let your brother sign for all this, but you'll have to work it out with the TMO office.  But most definately someone has to be there!



Legal can help in getting permissions over to your brother!



Good Luck!

If you or your husband cannot be there when the movers arrive, your brother will need a POA from your husband authorizing him to have the movers take the things on your behalf.



Your brother will need to sign documents on your husband's behalf.  He can get the POA (power of attorney) from JAG



Edited:  yes he can sign the paperwork as long as he has a POA from your husband authorizing him to do so.

Should we just drop an Atomic Bomb over Iraq and win this?



Iraq is smaller than Japan so it will be effected even more. Same with afghanistan. Im tired of U.S lives being lost because we tried to help them. Sure innocent Iraqi lives would be lost but its a small price to pay for the entire welfare of the Middle-east and ourselves. Should we blow up Iraq and Afghanistan so we can prove our superiority again. I know it will affect the countries surrounding it also and I know we might get a jump in Oil prices but we can just say " Give us cheap oil or we'll nuke you "

Right now, we are not in a war with Iraq.  We are in a war with terrorism, and they just happen to be mainly in the middle east.  We are trying to help Iraq be a succesful country with their own government, and they can patrol their own land with safety.  If we bombed Iraq with a nuke, that would not solve anything, just put us in an awful position.

Theres not only terrorists and bad guys in Iraq, theres alot of good people, its just like any other countries put a higher percentage of people are bad people, like terrorists, if we dropped a bomb over Iraq that would be genecide or mass murder, you have to think about the other people, the 'normal citizens' who live in iraq, and who is 'We' you and a couple of mates deciding to go and drop a bomb in iraq, if you say 'we' in this context its very vague and most probably normal people think thats a bad idea.

First off that is appalling. Second Iraq and Afghanistan are not the only problematic sources to the situations of the Middle East. Its not a small price to pay in fact it would be a very big one. I mean by being there we have already tarnished the American image ( we did do also by electing Bush) I know becauseI travel places and I converse with people of other nations wherever I go.

What you just suggested is why you will probably never get elected to office.  Our problem in Iraq isn't with an opposing army, it is with an insurgency who wants us all dead so they can take over the country.  The majority of them like us but there are enough bad people there that cause us to fight.  Such a thing not only wouldn't prove our superiority, but it would cause us to be severely hated by the rest of the world and could eventually cause a few of our "allies" to band together and plot a secret invasion to remove the people in Washington who made such a poor decision.

The participation of the Pakistan Air Force pilots in the 15-day air exercise in Turkey will shape up their training and help in strengthening ties between the two countries, said a statement from the Pakistani Air Force.
The PAF has participated in several multi-national air force exercises. These include the "Anatolian Eagle" series of manoeuvres held in 2004 and 2006 and other exercises with the US, Britain, Iran and Turkey. The current exercise coincides with Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's official visit to Turkey.

<answer>



and?



Our exercise site ( near at Konya ) famous place for combat trainings and air-to-ground practices with live ammo.



Every year many ally and neighbor countries sends planes and/or pilots for live ammo + dog fight exercises , like RAF, US Air Force, even Israel Air Force too.



We had tanker planes ( KC-135R's ) , Awacs ( a fleet who had 4 of them ) , even drone planes for this purpose.



At Konya they can fly low and over mach speed like real combat, low altitude hills and solid ground place .. ideal for air training.



That's why Nato and other countries always use it for practice .. other hand Konya Jet Ussu ( Air Force base - Konya ) had simulators, combat control rooms, spare parts etc.etc for this purpose.



Also we build those f16's for pakistan ( and many other countries too ) .. and those pilots train & educated at my country ( like many other countries officers ) bottom line we had good relation with both area countries.



Today they visit our country for fly with our eagles ( again ) , they visit his schools and old friends and they exercise for hunt down some non - friendly air targets who had high tech ... with us.

No, you will either have to wear the BCG's (birth control glasses known by the military b/c they are so ugly)  they make tactical versions of them now in a goggle form. The alternative is, as in my unit, all soldiers with vision problems were given lasic surgery before deployment.  There is now way in hell you could wear a contact in the sandbox.  What are you going to do, change it out in the middle of a firefight b/c you cant see down your sight.  Absurd!!!

I'm going to try and explain what happened withou taking a For or against the war line.



Build up to Gulf War 1,



You can't talk about the Iraq War without first talking about the Iran - Iraq war.



the West Supported Iraq in this conflict providing them with intelligence.



After the War Iraq was in massive amounts of dept with a very large armed forces which they couldn't afford to pay.



Oil prices fell after the Iran iraq war to very low levels, OPEC tried to cut production to increase the price of Oil. Iraq need this because it was the only way they could keep the country going.



There was a few Nations that ignored the OPEC cut in production and increased there production Kuwait was one of them.



this made oil price fall more and Iraq was in big financial trouble



Saddam being Saddam came to a logical Solution to this that he will just invade Kuwait.



this is when some small events took place which turned into massive miss takes.



1. At this point the US and Iraq where allys from since the war with Iran they believed the US would wish not to be seen getting involved with a conflict and would just give Miner support to one side like they did in the Iran Iraq war. (massive miss take on Saddam's part)



2. Iraq thought that  other nations would support them because the majority of OPEC was angree at Kuwait for over producing Oil.



3. Saddam didn't understand how the world had changed since the end of the cold war, he belived that if the US didn't back him Russia would that world had ended 1-2 year before.



4. Vietnam Sadam thought the US would never send troops to fergin war ever again.



5. The CIA failed to discover the Iraqs plan.



This all means that Saddam felt safe in invading Kuwait becuase he didn't think there was any country willing or able to stop him.



So he invaded



Saddam misstakes now come to light.



people in OPEC are more scared of being invaded by Iraq than low Oil prices.



It's a diffrent world now the US are the only superpower in town they can do what they like.



A huge coalistion is formed (US troops where fighting next to troops from country including Syria).



To keep the Coalistion together and agreeing the plan is only to take Kuwait back not enough of the nations wished a full invation of Iraq.



- This was another massive misstake on the US side if they had gone the whole way back then they wouldn't have needed trooops in Sudie Arabia or the rest of the middle east and the terriost may never have been formed.



After Iraqs been removed from Kuwait sanctions was place on Iraq to stop them from being able to attack anyone again (this same misstake happend at the end of the first world war with Germany and we got WW2 for our trouble)



- histroy as shown after you beat a country in a war you help that country show them how nice you are and don't punish them (this is what was done after WW2 with germany and japan who are now grate allys)



The Years between gulf war 1 and gulf war 2



We punished Iraq with air Strikes and Sanctions because they wouldn't do what the UN wanted.



9-11 happened



the US mindset changed again War had come all the way to the US



there was lots of questions asked



- How did we let this happen



- Who did this to us



- Why did they do this



- etc....



now here where people arguments change



1. some people suggest we went on a war path for revenge (not likly really)



2. others say it was for Oil (nrrr not likly invading Iraq was only ever going to increas the price of oil which it did)



3. WMD's i don't buy this resion either



4 a more likly resion which doesn't get much press



- The US reslised what misstakes it had made in the first gulf war



1. not finishing the job



2. punishing Iraq instead of helping it



3. having troops in Sudie



The desion was made IF we want to win the WAR on TERROR we need to correct our misstakes so a plan was drawn up.



- Invade Iraq



- Remove Saddam
- Turn iraq into a grate democacy in the middle east



- Invest lots of money and help iraq prosper



Sadly it proved very difficult to do the latter 2 because things had been allowed to get to bad without anything being done about it.



Now we face the problem that we either stay in Iraq and finish the JOB (the thing we didn't do the first time)



Leave iraq (the same misstake we did the first time)



There wuld be a third option to use other country troops to finish the job but which counrtys would they be i know of none.



to SUM up



the conflict in 1990 did start over Oil not the control but the price of it, the US made misstakes and are trying to put them right if they are able to put them right is anyone guess and i expect we will know the answer in 10 years time



if Iraq is a democracy then the US managed to correct it's misstakes



if iraq is a failed state the US would have failed

The original reason was that Iraq was a 'threat to the world' and that Saddam could deploy a WMD (weapon of mass destruction) at will. US and UK governments basically started an illegal war by bypassing the UN and bombing the cr@p out of Iraq anyway, even though millions of us protested before the war.
When it became apparent that Iraq didn't have any WMDs they changed track and the reason for the war was 'to save the Iraqis from Saddam' who was a brutal dictator (much like the tens of other brutal dictators in the world that no-one bothers with).
So now, years later, we are battling insurgency and terrorists (who never existed in Iraq in before the war) and hundreds of thousands of innocent people are dead. And for what? So the US and, to some extent the UK, can get a strategic Ally and military base in the middle east and so that US businesses can get a hold on the country's massive oil reserves.
Horrendous, Bush, Blair and everyone else involved should be tried for war crimes.

Hung H is right it was because Saddam thumbed his nose at the UN and refused to let weapons inspectors do their jobs.  He was hiding 50 tons of "yellow cake" Uranium that we later found as evidence of the weapons of mass destruction. Saddam was given an ultimatum by the UN that said he either let inspectors in or force would be taken.  He failed to comply so we had to use force or else prove the UN an impotent organization.  It was the right thing to do, and the right thing is not always the popular thing.



By the way to those who said it was about oil, if it was then why aren't we taking the oil you allege we want to take?  We have yet to take one barrel of oil out of Iraq.  Also there were at least a dozen other countries in Iraq with us in a joint force.  We didn't go in alone.

First time yes, if it was to prevent Iraq from invading Kuwait. And the reason Iraq wanted to invade Kuwait is to do what people THINK we are doing to Iraq, kind of funny really. Iraq wanted Kuwait's oil. So they invade Kuwait and we drove them out and put some sanctions on there oil, as in how many bbl's of oil they could sell a day.



Secound time. I think is a huge mistake. Weapons of mass destruction were not found. So makes us look like idiot's.
It would be similar to say Russia of China helping the south win the cival war and saying screw the north. You cant just help people over throw there goverment and think you can continue it without being a prime target for 9/11 style attacks.

Well this depends how deep you want to go the offical line was that they wanted to help the people of iraq to be free from Sadams dictatorship. However Most people believe and rightly so that the war was launched so that the british and yanks could get cheap oil from them.

They don't care that it is legal in that country.  They would treat it like any other test positive and rule you ineligible to join the military.  While some countries have laws that allow some things the UCMJ defines what is expected of you and how you should conduct yourself in such places even though it is legal.  That is one of the rights you give up when you join and they pretty much own you lock, stock, and barrel and it is their standards, which are more stringent, that you are expected to meet and follow.

<question>



If I want to be a police officer after the Air Force do I have to do Security Forces?



I'm thinking about becoming a police officer after I get out of the air force. Right now I am choosing my jobs for when I enlist. They are:



1) Aircraft Loadmaster Apprentice
2) Fire Protection Apprentice
3) Aerial Gunner Apprentice
4) Security Forces Apprentice
5) Services Apprentice



I WOULD put Security Forces as #1 especially because of the Criminal Justice degree you can get... but what makes me not want the job is that I hear it can be very boring and it's one of those "bottom of the food chain/if you fail out of tech school" jobs.



So I want to know:



Will your military experience always benefit you when applying to become a police officer, or does it have to be security forces specifically?

It would help to have Secuirty Forces as a background.
I worked as a correctional officer before joining the Air Force Reserves. I went through training and applied to become a police officer after my Air Force training (Aircraft Maintenance). I was hired as a police officer, thankfully for my correctional officer background.

I was a Security Forces member for 22 Years. YES, you will be on the bottom of the food Chain when you first join the Air Force but this goes for any job you get until you get rank and time in Service. Look, being a Defender is not for the Weak of Heart, we have a tendency to chew up the young airmen who join our ranks and the ones that are still standing become the Core of the SF Leaders. I received 3 degrees when I was in the Air Force 2 in Criminal justice and one in Law Enforcement. The good thing about doing your tech school as a SF member is that your Tech school training goes towards your college degree in Law Enforcement. But, be honest with yourself, as a SF member you are every likely to go to Iraq or Afghanistan the minute you hit your base are Tech school. Yes, SF duty is boring but if you want to be  a Police officer in 4 Years do 4yrs as a SF member or even Law Enforcement K-9 which will almost guarantee you a civilian police job. Every one wants K-9 Specialist. Good Luck!

Not still on active duty in the USN. The reason being that because of the PC syndrome, an "old salt" would not be allowed to stay in. The days of "work hard and play hard" are gone. We had to be responsible for our actions and accept the consequences if we screwed up. It wasn't everybody else's fault. But if you were a good worker and knew your job, generally, your superiors would stand up for you but then you learned it was best not to push the issues again.

Changing the decision.?



I signed up for the Army Reserves I've been to one drill and I'm waiting to ship for basic. In this short month and a half that I've been waiting I've come to the conclusion that I can't leave I have too much here at home going on to leave. Family sickness: mother and grandfather. I don't care what you think of me so you can say what you want about my reasoning. As you know the Army Reserves don't have a DEP program you just sign up and your in. Although you can get a entry level discharge by not reporting to basic. It's not a honorable, dishonorable, nor general discharge it's just known as an entry level discharge. Only thing that it hurts is my future enlistment may be tougher. I'm making sure that I have my facts straight I have a meeting this morning with my recruiter.

How to find out where a soldier is assigned:



When a Soldier first arrives at Fort Jackson for Basic Combat Training they are assigned to the 120th Adjutant General  Battalion (Reception) where they begin the basic training process.  Soldiers can spend from 7 to 10 days in the reception process before being assigned to an actual training unit.  During their time in the reception battalion they are afforded the opportunity to call home.  We understand this is an anxious time for a Soldier's family and friends - but this a very busy time for the Soldier and staff preparing them for their journey from civilian to Soldier.  Please allow at least 7days for your Soldier to settle in.  If at the end of this time you haven't heard from him or her,  call the Fort Jackson Installation Operations Center at  (803) 751-7671 for assistance in determining their location. You will need your Soldier's full name and social security number.  Soldiers in training are very busy. They are not allowed visitors during the basic training cycle except during Family Day and Graduation (usually on Thursday and Friday of the last week of Basic Combat Training.)



How to contact a Soldier in the event of an emergency:



If a family emergency arises and a Soldier is needed at home or simply needs to be informed, contact your local Red Cross Chapter. The Red Cross will contact the Soldier’s unit and make appropriate notifications and arrangements.



The American Red Cross 24-hour emergency contact number is 1-877-272-7337.

Probably because they feel that McCain represents what this country does not need now given the problems the country is facing and the situation it is in.  Foreign policy wise we are at war in two places one of which shows no good end in site, and countries throughout the world despise us and our views and actions.  Economically this country is hurting and its going to get worse before it gets better and we certainly don't need to be spending all this money in Iraq while at the same time tightening our belts at home and also bailing out a bunch of banks and financial institutions that have been giving extravagant bonuses and salary packages and bad loans all at the same time.  Four more years of this and we will really be in the toilet!

Changing the decision.?



I signed up for the Army Reserves I've been to one drill and I'm waiting to ship for basic. In this short month and a half that I've been waiting I've come to the conclusion that I can't leave I have too much here at home going on to leave. Family sickness: mother and grandfather. I don't care what you think of me so you can say what you want about my reasoning. As you know the Army Reserves don't have a DEP program you just sign up and your in. Although you can get a entry level discharge by not reporting to basic. It's not a honorable, dishonorable, nor general discharge it's just known as an entry level discharge. Only thing that it hurts is my future enlistment may be tougher. I'm making sure that I have my facts straight I have a meeting this morning with my recruiter.

SSGT I don't take your feelings offensive at all but when your family is lying on a death bed and I'm just leaving at a bad time. I'm far from a ***** and I don't have to serve in the US Army to be a man. I'm going to college without interruptions and be here for my family when I'm needed like now.

I would caution you to rent a movie called Stop-Loss. Its based on real interviews with real men and women who joined the military and went over to Iraq. Do not necessarily believe what your recruiter says to you. Their job is to get you to sign up and stay in, at any cost. I would honestly say, don't worry about it being dishonorable. It is much more honorable to be there for your family when they are sick. That is what really matters in this world. On your deathbed you will regret not being  there for them more than you would regret not going into the military...I'm guessing...Good luck to you.



Also, I doubt it would be hard to get in again. There are not enough people signing up as it is..and many are dying...so I cannot say this for sure, but wouldn't it be common sense that if there are so many hard-core recruiters out there doing whatever they can to get you to sign up, that there is probably a very good chance they would take you in the future? THEY need YOU, not the other way around.

Listen man, everyone has the same feelings you are having.  I didn't realize them until I was already at bootcamp and I wanted to leave so bad.  But you have to realize, you need to break off from your family and grow up.  It's very tough but if you stay at home you'll most likely end up working a dead end job for what?  Your parents are grown, they can take care of themselves.  There is nothing you can do for them, they would want you to get yourself a career and the free college offered while on Active Duty.  Ok, next I am going to tell you like it is, not meaning to be harsh or an as5hole, but to tell you the 100% truth:



Pop your mouth off your mommas teet and grow the fk up!  Stop being a little beeotch and just do it.  You must over come these feelings and ya know what?....if you don't like the Army, then get out after your first enlistment.  But you will be leaving a man, you will have had the oppurtunity to go to college for free.  You will have learned a job that is useful in the civilian world, you will have leadership instilled in you, you will be grown and have the discipline to succeed in everything you do in life if you just listen to what they teach you and quit trying to stay at home with mommy and daddy.  Again, I am not trying to be an as5hole but simply telling the truth.  If you can't accept it as a fact then perhaps you are not cut out for our military and should live at home in your moms basement playing computer games for the rest of your life.  Good luck.



EDIT:  PS.  Karma....the person above me....quit filling the boy with your crap, this country needs brave men and women to fight for YOUR freedom, and this young man has it in him he just needs to dig deep.  So take your shenanighans somewhere else.



Again, Karma is speaking ou tof her as5.  She has obviously never been in.  Although the military does need us but in many/most peoples cases they need the military more than it needs them, they just don't know it.  I promise you man, if you do it you will not regret it!  If you don't you'll never know what you could have turned out to be.

When you go to MEPS on the day you ship out, you take the real oath of enlistment.  Until then you don't get paid, have no benefits, no UCMJ obligations, no commitments....



The national guard changed my MOS on me before I went to basic, so I just didn't ship out.



8 months later I was an officer in the USN.



I dont think there was a discharge involved at all.

In response to the young man if you leave now you're leaving for good while I understand what you're saying, you have to understand you commited to the service not when it's easy for you but when you're needed. If you can't go when it's hard I don't want you here when it's easy, now that's a personal choice for you. But don't expect to come back. $19,210 is the amount of money it costs the government to put you through the recruitment process. So you took a good chunk of my change before you woke up. Personally I think you need to decide if the Military is what you want, if it is go now or try to postpone your ship date (your recruiter should be able to do this) if not then you need to get out now and not even think of comming back. Not trying to be mean just realistic. All in all good luck.
Cheers
