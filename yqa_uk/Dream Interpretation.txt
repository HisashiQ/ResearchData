One in particular I have had twice now about male rape and real horrible details and wake up sweating n crying.



I am a 28yr old female, single and work in asylum. I was in a relationship with an alcoholic for two years which was quite abusive- is this just a follow on from this?



</question>



<additional details>



P.S. i do not watch horror films & only read books that are easy going girly love stories or comedy books(and trashy magazines!!)



I have never done a search it's not something I have thought about looking into for ny reasons!

This could be the result of trauma either from the relationship OR from something you may have witnessed either directly or indirectly.



Dreams are our minds way of playing out scenarios...the difference between a day dream and a sleeping dream is that in a day dream, if it's unpleasant we can stop thinking about "it".
Night dreams we're asleep and don't awaken until our heart rate is escalated or we've been brought to a point of such anxiety that we awaken ourselves.

I'm no Professional, but I think you need help. The fact that you were in an abusive relationship for two years says something is wrong. The dreams are just a manifestation of your problems. If you work in an asylum then you probably have health insurance. Call the insurance company and ask about counseling. I'm sure you can get it for little or no cost to you. Good luck.

First of all, you  have a history of an abusive relationship with someone and that is a fact.  That can stay in your subconscious for a very long time.



Projecting being raped could symbolize insecurity, lack of confidence.  Regardless how normal you are in reality, that kind of dream could pop out any time in your subconscious mind.



It could be due to media effect, it may be more than movie.  A word "rape" or any word about "alocohol", "beer", "ex" and so on can also trigger this bad dream.



The experience you had will not be washed away since it lived in your life.  Projecting yourself being rape and feeling horrible basically reflect the emptiness, in need of heavy attention, and low confidence in you.



Perhaps, you should focus on something more and talk about your past with someone more and this kind of dream will go away slowly because of suppression.

First, "torture" and "rape" aside from the horrific images (real and perceived) these concepts evoke, are conditions of constraint -physically and emotionally.  As such, beyond the obvious physical viciousness those acts engender, there is the burden of our intellect and emotions trying to make sense over something that, renders our sensibilities as "helpless."  That feeling alone can be frightening and paralyzing.



Based on that, it seems reasonable (to me) to begin the assessment and discussion about your dreams from the framework of suppression and repression where "suppression" is the temporary discarding of intrusive thoughts knowing that -at another time- you will welcome the thoughts back for further analysis.  And where "repression" is the total removal of the thoughts or as the dictionary aptly states, a "state of forcible subjugation" where the thoughts "go away" only in that they are pushed down away from our conscious state into our unconsciousness.



As you know by profession as well as personal experience, repressed thoughts -no matter how far removed they may be- are always ready (at a moment's notice, so to speak) to be triggered by a circumstance, an event, even something as insignificant as an odor or fragrance ... and then, whoooooosh, those repressed thoughts are front and center.



In the absence of that rush from unconscious to conscious state, these thoughts do have a bit of "play time" in our dream states.  That, in my view, is what is happening with you at this point in time.



Your working conditions (and bless you for having the ability and compassion to work in an asylum) are most likely a fertile ground for "triggers."



That is, beyond the obvious and, even possibly, expected day-to-day situations that arise, there is probably an undercurrent of expectation that governs your intellect and emotions (if, for no other reason, as a "failsafe" to protect yourself from the psooibility of the hooror that may come to life via your work) and, when a particular event, situation, circumstance, etc. is presented (you may not even be fully conscious of witnessing the triggering moment), your mind registers that and, in order to continue your role and responsibilities as an employee, those triggering events are pushed back and down into your unconscious.  If so, because of your work, you don't allow those thoughts and issues to be present (conscious) and then, the opportunity for "review and consideration" is only able to be manifested through your dreams.



If possible, counselling is a great way to get these issues out for open discussion and, since you mentioned you had engaged counselling in the past, I'm hoping that if it was a positive experience you're already aware of the benefits of such an intervention.



I hope my perspective is somewhat helpful -good luck!

All of the answers above sounds just right but, apart from your past relationship, etc. you might want to consider your work.



Metaphysically speaking, you work in an asylum, which means mentally unstable people emanating "abnormal" feelings and thoughts. Have you considered that you might be a "sensitive" person who is picking up this energy from the environment.



A friend of mine had a friend who used to work in an asylum and he meditated everyday just to be ready to help all those people, but "block" all of the negative emanations from them. In turn if you don't protect yourself you might even be physically affected by this "vibes"



Find someone who can teach you to meditate, think positive thoughts, pray to your deity and feel protected. You will emerge victorious.



Blessings.

This probably has quite a few meanings, Partly I am sure because of where you work, partly I am sure too because of the relationship you had.  I think it is about not feeling as though you have control over what happens to you. There is some stuff you have to deal with regarding your ex relationship, like the way he treated you was not your fault, but something in you and your expectations of how you want to be treated made you stay regardless of his behaviour to you. Maybe there is a situation around you now where the feelings of being needed are coming up. You know this is unhealthy in a personal relationship and ends up with resentment on both sides.

particular problem then  those things will show up in your dreams, usually in nightmare form.

It often takes a whole day for me to shake the memory of these nigh mares and dreams. You have had more than your share of trauma. I bet the counselor can help you.  Sweet dreams

Fear, responsibility and abandonment. dear answerers, i need your input?



Two dreams two nights in a row. I remember bits and pieces. first dream I was in some big store and i was bare foot when i noticed a huge brown snake. i freaked out and started running the stairs to my uncle telling him that am afraid because i saw a snake and i'm bare foot. when i reach up to him, i look down to see a huge black dog attacking my mother. i scream: "mom is in danger" and i run down trying to help her. I take a big stick hoping i could hit the dog with it. suddenly the dog turns to me. it and the snake start chasing me and it takes me a while to realize that i have been left alone. not my mom nor my uncle nor anyone else is around. and i start running away and looking for someone but no one was there. the dog and the snake at one point turned to human (but it didn't surprise me as usual in dreams) however, i still recognize them as the dog and the snake. and miraculously, i find a spot to hide from them but then i wake up before the end of the dream.
second dream, second night: two of my aunts, one lady i don't know, my mom, my sister (or someone else) and I are sitting chitchatting on the floor in a circle. suddenly this strange woman (perceived in the dream as my aunt's friend) chokes or something. and because i'm a medical graduate, I know that they are looking at me to do something. so i start doing CPR. thinking that the definitely are calling ambulance meanwhile. only then, one of my aunts starts to develop epileptic symptoms. and in my mind i think she's faking (in real life she would for attention i guess). but when i see her diluted pupils i realize it's for real. i start giving her slaps hoping she'll get out of it while i'm still resuscitating the woman. suddenly i realize that no one else is around. they just simply disappeared and left me to deal with it. they didn't even call any ambulance or anything. i was freaking out and handling two ppl at the same time. at one point i managed i guess so i ran away from the scene hoping to find a spot to calm down away from my crazy aunt who was acting still weird and talking non-sense (as part of her epilepsy). and i look for my mom but i wake up before i find her..



So, points about me, I'm 26. finally managed to leave my country and live abroad as i always dreamt of. my father is chronically ill (cancer) and i don't have anything going on with my mom at the moment.



thanks a lot!

Dolphins are often depicted as saviors. They rescue people when they are stranded and have no other way out. Also, water can mean a few different things. In the middle of a great ocean it could be describing your solitude and lonliness, but with waves crashing over you it could represent your helplessness in life, a feeling of vulnerability while needing change. Charging through the water on the back of a dolphin is almost like having a life raft thrown to you. It is a good dream, help is on its way in the form of change. My email is askcharliefirst@yahoo.com if you have any further questions. Good luck :)

FREEDOM! You want to be free from the world's cares and you want to get swept away from it all.



You know that can't happen in this life, so it's best to find the truth and adjust your mind according to it. Might I suggest reading the Bible and praying? Ask God to reveal Himself to you, and as He does, direct your life as He sees fit. Trust that He will make all things right as you surrender to His will.



Romans 12:2 (NIV)
2Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.



John 3:16-18 (NIV)



16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.



Also, ask Him to tell you what these passages mean. Depression comes from not doing God's will. Give Him a chance; open your heart.

QUESTION:



I am curious about the symbolism of dolphins. I often have dreams about water and water creatures, such as whales and other sea-life. But one summer I had a dream where I was playing with dolphins and having so much fun. In my dream I am lying on my back on the floor of my living room with my arms crossed over my chest. I feel myself transforming into a dolphin, my arms melting into my body, my body gliding in the water. I woke up having the sense that I would have become the dolphin if the dream had continued. I was terrified but also felt seduced by the feeling of my metamorphosis into this other creature. It was so real that some part of me still believes I would not be here as a human if I hadn't awaken when I did. Do dolphin dreams mean something special?



ANSWER:



Dolphin dreams are not only quite common, but usually quite delightful for the dreamer. Although the particular meaning of your dream will be unique to you, some examples of dolphin symbolism through history may enrich the dream image. Not only are dreams, dolphins and dissolving a part of the symbolic grouping of the Greek god Dionysos, but there are found dolphin and dream stories throughout Western history. Dolphins are found in many grouping of the gods, including Apollo, Poseidon and Athena. Generally speaking, the dolphin is seen by the ancient Greeks as a guide to worlds unknown.



It doesn't escape observation that since dolphins keep people from sinking too deeply into the sea in waking life, that they can also do the same in dreams. The exploration of the boundaries of what it means to be human and non-human are commonly mediated by dolphins.



Researcher Trisha Lamb Feuerstein has been studying the connection between dolphins and dreams for years and has noted several interesting themes. One is that dolphins will often communicate they will *always* be there to protect the dreamer. One dreamer reported dreams of dolphins (and whales) when she is going through a crisis and finds they soothe and calm her.



This kind of communication is often reported as deep, wordless, telepathic, profound, reassuring and anciently wise. It can extend to other deeply moving experiences which can put the dreamer in contact with a deep spiritual nature. Awakening from these dreams is often described as serene, peaceful, happy, energized and blissful.



In some of the dreams, the dreamers become a dolphin and feel what it is like to have a dolphin body, but not usually dolphin consciousness. They are accepted as a member of the dolphin social group and invited to return.



Dolphins seem to emerge for humans in countless forms and offer us many opportunities. Dream dolphins allow us to feel connected to the world of nature and spirit, and can guide us into waters that would normally be to deep for us to travel.

Can someone please help me interpret this?



This is more of a reality interpretation, but its an interpretation nevertheless. Please read and answer -



This happens to me 8/10 times. Whenever I feel sexually excited & I'm reaching my peak while masturbating, someone always has some work in my room. They always knock at the wrong timing, ALWAYS!



I'm an Asian & everyone here has more of a conservative mindset so I cant really be jerking off in full view of ppl, neither can I tell my parents to quit coming at the wrong time cause I'm jerking off. Moreover, "casual sex" isn't really the norm here and very few people indulge in it. All I find solace in is masturbation and with all these interruptions time and time again, I end up being sexually and mentally frustrated. I'm worried that I might completely start hating sex due to all this bullsh*t, turn impotent or suffer from sexual dysfunction.



I'm 20 and I don't really know what God is trying to indicate. Can someone kindly help me out as to how I'm supposed to interpret this?

"Cally, what are you staring at?"
Savanna knew what I was staring at. She was just toying with me.
Elaina turned around, spotted Jayden and turned back to me.
"Y'know, on Friday he and his sister called me. He was asking a bunch of questions about you! He remembers you!"



"He does?" I asked.
"Yes!" The both exclaimed.



The next day, the teachers had us all sitting in different seats in the cafeteria; we were working on some sort of activity.
I pulled out a little baggy of candy, and Jayden, who was nearby became ecstatic.



"You got any candy?" He asked.
"Yes."
"Oooooo! Give me!"
Jayden leaned over the table in attempt to take some candy from me.
"Jayden, get off of the table!"



Jayden followed my directions and got off the table. I handed him a tootsie roll and he scampered away to another table. That kid had an addiction to candy. I had an addiction to him.



The next thing I knew, Edgar Hernandez was trying to get my attention.



"Aiy! Cally! Do you like him?"



He pointed to Jayden, who was sitting next to him. Jayden was staring attentively at me.
I glared at Edgar and turned away.



The next day, I sat next to one of my best friends, Emily. I forgot to grab my lunch as we went downstairs to the cafeteria, so I got permission to go and get it.
I went through the lunch line because apparently, that was what I thought was the exit from the cafeteria. I ran around in circles, and eventually, I got my lunch from the classroom and by the time I got back to my seat, the substitute teacher was taking role for the class to go on a field trip, and lunch was over.

Why do I have dreams of tornadoes 3-4 times a week? EVERY WEEK!?



For the past few years.. probably 3-5..I have had dreams of running from tornadoes. I am always seeking shelter in strange places I have never been and usually do not know the people there with me. I know tornadoes in dreams are a sign of danger, but for 4 years? Almost 3 times a week? That is a little extreme.. anyone else have these dreams this frequent for long periods of time?

I dream of them very frequently, too.  I don't think they are a sign of danger, but more of a fear in your life.  I have these dreams more when my life is stressful and chaotic.  The tornado represents the fear of things "spiralling out of control" and causing harm to us, our lives, and our emotional well being.  I, too, seek shelter in odd places---homes of people I've never met, libraries, dormitories, etc.  Sometimes I think these places we hide are clues to what is causing us the turmoil.  When it is my college classwork that is making me stressed, I usually am hiding out in a dorm or another college building, so try to see if this gives you a clue to the source of stress in your life.



Also, it may have to do with a plain, out-and-out fear of tornadoes.  Sometimes fears in our dreams are just blatant manifestations of real fears we have.

Tornadoes: disappointment is about to blow into your life, especially if you have been banking on some long-laid plans coming to a successful fruition. Tornadoes can also be seen as a suggestion that the dreamer feels threatened by a surge of emotions that could blow him off course. To stop the dreams, increase your confidence and 'get your feet firmly on the ground.'

I killed my grandfather?



I had a dream last night,
that I killed my grandfather.
He was talking about something and it got me mad,
so I grabbed a knife.
It took me a while to decide what to do with it, but then i finnaly stabbed him, near the heart.



He fell on the ground and started to laugh, and started to sing this song.
Then I stabbed him once more, and blood came oozing out. He continued to sing.



I stabbed him once more, straight in the heart.
He died.
While trying to clean up the mess my aunt came over.
I went outside to try to get her to go back to her house,
but when she rudely barged into the house,



my mom was there, and the mess was gone.



Actually he was just under some pillows, but the blood wasnt there anymore lol



I pulled my mom to the side and told her i was sorry



but she didnt really seem to care.



This dream quite disturbs me.
I have nothing against my grandpa,
and the last time i saw him, i was giving him some cake that I made.



What does this dream mean?

To dream that you kill someone, indicates that heavy stress may cause you to lose your temper and self-control. Since you feel no rage towards your grandfather, consider this: you may be trying to kill or put an end to an aspect of yourself that is represented by the person killed. Identify the characteristics of this person and ask yourself how you do not want to be like him or her.



The knife signifies anger, aggression and/or separation. There may be something in your life that you need to cut out and get rid of.  It could also refer to being tempted to cut ties or sever some relationship.



On the other hand, to see your Grandma/Grandpa in your dream, symbolizes love, security, wisdom and protection.

There are some issues in your family between the women in your family, including yourself, and your grandfather. Notice in the dream how your aunt shows up and helps you clean up the mess, and notice how your mother doesn't seem to care that you "killed" your grandfather.  When you stab him, he laughs and sings:  to me, that is an image of someone who doesn't care about anything; someone who is cruel and cold. You stab him near the heart: your subconscious knows that he is heartless.

Can a dream kill you?



I'm sure you've all heard the theory that if you die in a dream you die in real life, is this true? Some theorists suggest that yes it's true because you're body thinks what ever is happening is really happening, and reacts to the shock very realistically which could have killed people. I personally have only had two dreams that I died, and they were both peaceful deaths where I came back as an angel. So, personally I can prove this wrong, but is it the same way for people who are actually afraid of death?

No, its not true.  Sometimes people have a premonition that something bad will happen.  But sometimes a person dying means that you are worried or stressed to where your mind imagines what needs to happen .  I always look at it as a way to continue to live my life to the fullest.

No. When you dream, your body produces a chemical that prevents you from actually doing the things you do in a dream.  For example, if you were running in a dream, your body knows you aren't really running.  Your heart rate does not race, and you may move only slightly.  Dreaming is the body's way of releasing the stresses of the day.

Not as described, but presumably if you have a bad heart, etc., you could panic from events in a dream and stress your heart and die.  But no one would have the answer would they, because the people who had the dream that killed them were in fact - dead.

Wierd dream in Argentina?



Okay this is one of the wierdest dreams I've ever had.



I was in downtown Buenos Aires in Argentina. (I've always wanted to go to Argentina when I was a little child, never went though) I was waiting for a taxi to stop with around 30 other people. After waiting for around 15 minutes I got bored and crossed the road to get a bite to eat, figuring I could still see if the taxi was coming or not. I found a KFC truck (like an ice-cream truck, WTF?) with two people having sex in it. I decided I didn't want to interupt them so I looked at the Mcdonalds store but it was empty. I then realised the people waiting for the taxi have gone, so I rushed back. The taxis have driven away but there was one taxi left driving. I tried to grab the taxi drivers attention, but he said I was  Chinese. (Which I am) One person walking by asked me where I was going, I said "to the casino" and he was going to, then he argued with the taxi driver for me and we both got in eventually for the casino. I thanked him after we got off but he disappeared soon after.



I can't really describe it as a casino, though it was a high-class looking place. Like the ground floor of a deluxe hotel? I was getting a wierd stare from everyone when I was walking. I decided to go in the toilet to wash my face, but then I noticed someone dangerous was walking up to me. I slowly backed away but he looked dangerous, I then "teleported" to a place with lots of drains (Maybe an urban drainage system?). I then tried to escape from the man chasing me. I was also doing stunts like the main character from the game Mirror's Edge which is coming out soon.



The dream ends there. I think this is the most I've ever remembered in one dream lol. So can anyone help interpret it for me please?

don't be scared. i'm doing some research for you and i see the number 11 is a good number and has special meaning. i'm more concerned with the number 9 and what 9 days means. when a person sneezes that means "true words" like if i said i'm going to the store and you sneeze that means that true words have been spoken. a voice telling you "i'll see you in 9 days" and you wake up sneezing then there must be some truth to it. but, the number 11 has positive meaning . so my guess is maybe in 9 days you will meet someone or something or have a revalation.



i just googled 9 and it says nine means the ending of things. now i don't think your going to die.. but i think something in 9 days will end . and then 11 brings me to think something wonderful will emerage. i.e a higher state of mind, better relationship with yourself, others etc.. *see link for the number 9..



hope this helps. if you need anymore assistance let me know. you'll be okay

What does it mean to have recurring dreams about an ex?



I have an ex that I dream about ALOT! Probley at least 3 days out of the week. He was my first real boyfriend and first "true love". But we have been broken up for about 4 or 5 years now. I was probley about 14-15 when we started dating and we dated for about a year and a half. I know have a wonderful boyfriend of 3 years, we live together and things are great. I broke up with my first love, and havent really talked to or seen him much since. But I do know that he was very hurt. Thats why know if I see him, he wont even look at me. He begged me back once, but I turned him down. He was very protective, like he didnt want me wearing skirts, or hanging out with friends, that kind of thing.  About 75% of the time, its me trying to get him back. So does anyone know why I keep dreaming about him? What does it mean?

dreams are the way your mind deals with issues, stress, and emotions ...



you are dreaming about him b/c some part of you feels unresolved ...



you may feel guilty, you may be over-anxious about whether or not you current boyfriend ever displays any similar trait, you could be thinking about your current relationship taking the next step and so your mind has gone back to your first love due to this new emotional milestone you could be dealing with ...  maybe discussing with an impartial third party could help you pinpoint the concern these dreams are trying to resolve ...



figures/people in dreams are often representative of someone or something and their appearance is not always literal ...  ie - just b/c he looks like your ex does not mean he is representing your ex in the dream ...  the whole situation could be representative of an emotion or concern ...

yes... lucid dreaming... its a matter of acknowledging that something occurring in your dream doesnt make sense, therefore you realize its a dream, but keep yourself in a subconscious state in effort to control your actions in the dream

<answer>



I used to be obsessed with doing things like this as I love dreaming. It's called 'lucid dreaming' and I used to strive to perfect the art. I don't really know if it can be taught because in order for it to happen you need to be aware- you can't be taught to be aware, so it's all in your head. But once you are aware, all you have to do is think about what you want to happen. Tell yourself that it IS going to happen and it usually will (for me, anyway). I dunno... you'll usually know what to do when the time comes.

Strange dream, any ideas?



I had this weird dream the other night. I think i was on a bus, and it was really dark. I was alone i think and something grabbed my head like right on top of my head. Then they started shaking it a lot. I could feel it and woke up, it still felt like someone was touching my head. I was really disoriented and dizzy then my eyes came to normal. I thought I saw something kind of hovering over my head. I got really scared and then just closed my eyes and tried to fall back asleep. My head shaking was really real though.



Any Ideas, please help.

Hi hun, this is called lucid dreaming. When you dream something and have real reactions to it and you really feel like it happened. Usually in lucid dreams they are very vivid and you can actually feel/hear, etc things. In special cases, a person will think in two states, in the mind of the subject of the dream, and the thoughts of the dreamer all in one.

hmmm... Spiritualy speaking the black thing could have been a demon. The bus is Lessing u or driving u to the wrong place in life. This demon surprisingly could phsucaly touch u which is really scary cause then he has full advantage tu destroy u or hurt u in really bad ways. I suggest u be saved by Christ cause if u don't that bus will stop and it won't be a place u really want to be it could possibly be a breaking point where that demon has all control of u. Not good! If it comes back again just rebuke it in the name of the holy ghost Jesus Christ. Say u do not belong here u spirit not of God go back to he'll where u came from u demon of darkness! Or else I will cut off the silver chord. The silver chord is biblical it is in Deuteronomy. But I suggest u be saved or if u r pray to god that he will cover u with the blood of the lamb. Or talk to your former pastor about it or find a pastor. Christianity will seriously protect u from this cause really do u want your bed moving thing gallo g out of mid air trying to kill you. Demons possessing u. People trying to exorsist u? Idk just please don't ignore this!

i was at a costume store with my best friend and the lights were flickering on and off then my cousin and mother who are very close to me we're calling our names, a nice woman ,asian looking came up to us and told us not to be frightened that she can lead us to my family.
she lead us to them and she asked us for a ride home my father appeared in the car with my mother and my cousin i don't know where my friend went. The lady was talking to us, we all accepted her. it felt as if we had a connection to her. then she said she must leave she dissapeard in thin air. i cried for some reason. , my father confused said " oh she must have had to leave." then realizing what he said, he had a shocked look on his face. and we were wondering how she poofed. She came back and said if we believe we can see.
we then came to the conclusion she was a spirit.



i never saw a woman like her in my life.
the car we were in was not similar either.

You and your friend in a costume store represents you and your friend's efforts to 'put on' a different identity to the outside world.  The flickering lights represent the distorted or murky day to day perceptions of events around us which can be very disturbing and frightening.  It could be that you are not completely comfortable with the 'costume' you have chosen to present to the rest of the world and your conscience is telling you this in the form of your cousin and mother.  The nice woman represents a person or persons in your life that are not part of your family (hence her temporary appearance) but in which you have great trust for guidance and advice indicated by her proximity to your family (her physical closeness indicates a trusting relationship).  It could be a teacher because you and your friend have her in common.

I'm guessing there's a connection to the spirit and your friend, as they both disappeared in the dream. Has your friend been telling you things that you may not believe, like something related to her family? Since family is so prevalent in the dream, and that the spirit felt like a part of yours, as best friends often do...maybe you should look more closely or inquire to your friend if something is wrong or that she may need to talk about. Maybe she has been trying to tell you/show you in subtle ways but you haven't really been listening fully, and just internalizing what she's been saying, and now your dreaming mind is bringing it to the surface to be addressed? Just some thoughts... Asian women tend to signify humility, obedience, submission--pay closer attention to your friend's mannerisms and habits/actions lately.

it was really nothing, it is true like she says that if you believe you can see. but in our world if we do not have the gift of sight we can see them in our dreams. she was a spirit maybe someone that is very close to your family. remember that just because she was asian it does not mean that she is not connected to you, she is that is why you felt that connection. she must love you and wanted to share that with you that is all. if you except and open your heart and mind, you can see her again. next time remember to ask her a question.

Cutting down my previous question: part 2?



Thank you for following..



second dream, second night: two of my aunts, one lady i don't know, my mom, my sister (or someone else) and I are sitting chitchatting on the floor in a circle. suddenly this strange woman (perceived in the dream as my aunt's friend) chokes or something. and because i'm a medical graduate, I know that they are looking at me to do something. so i start doing CPR. thinking that the definitely are calling ambulance meanwhile. only then, one of my aunts starts to develop epileptic symptoms. and in my mind i think she's faking (in real life she would for attention i guess). but when i see her diluted pupils i realize it's for real. i start giving her slaps hoping she'll get out of it while i'm still resuscitating the woman. suddenly i realize that no one else is around. they just simply disappeared and left me to deal with it. they didn't even call any ambulance or anything. i was freaking out and handling two ppl at the same time. at one point i managed i guess so i ran away from the scene hoping to find a spot to calm down away from my crazy aunt who was acting still weird and talking non-sense (as part of her epilepsy). and i look for my mom but i wake up before i find her..



Again, points about me, I'm 26. finally managed to leave my country and live abroad as i always dreamt of (as of feb 2008). my father is chronically ill (cancer) and i don't have anything going on with my mom at the moment..

Dear answerers, i need your input?



Two dreams two nights in a row. I remember bits and pieces. first dream I was in some big store and i was bare foot when i noticed a huge brown snake. i freaked out and started running the stairs to my uncle telling him that am afraid because i saw a snake and i'm bare foot. when i reach up to him, i look down to see a huge black dog attacking my mother. i scream: "mom is in danger" and i run down trying to help her. I take a big stick hoping i could hit the dog with it. suddenly the dog turns to me. it and the snake start chasing me and it takes me a while to realize that i have been left alone. not my mom nor my uncle nor anyone else is around. and i start running away and looking for someone but no one was there. the dog and the snake at one point turned to human (but it didn't surprise me as usual in dreams) however, i still recognize them as the dog and the snake. and miraculously, i find a spot to hide from them but then i wake up before the end of the dream.
second dream, second night: two of my aunts, one lady i don't know, my mom, my sister (or someone else) and I are sitting chitchatting on the floor in a circle. suddenly this strange woman (perceived in the dream as my aunt's friend) chokes or something. and because i'm a medical graduate, I know that they are looking at me to do something. so i start doing CPR. thinking that the definitely are calling ambulance meanwhile. only then, one of my aunts starts to develop epileptic symptoms. and in my mind i think she's faking (in real life she would for attention i guess). but when i see her diluted pupils i realize it's for real. i start giving her slaps hoping she'll get out of it while i'm still resuscitating the woman. suddenly i realize that no one else is around. they just simply disappeared and left me to deal with it. they didn't even call any ambulance or anything. i was freaking out and handling two ppl at the same time. at one point i managed i guess so i ran away from the scene hoping to find a spot to calm down away from my crazy aunt who was acting still weird and talking non-sense (as part of her epilepsy). and i look for my mom but i wake up before i find her..



So, points about me, I'm 26. finally managed to leave my country and live abroad as i always dreamt of. my father is chronically ill (cancer) and i don't have anything going on with my mom at the moment..



The question is.. Can you help me interpret this?

Cutting down my previous question: part 2?



Thank you for following..



second dream, second night: two of my aunts, one lady i don't know, my mom, my sister (or someone else) and I are sitting chitchatting on the floor in a circle. suddenly this strange woman (perceived in the dream as my aunt's friend) chokes or something. and because i'm a medical graduate, I know that they are looking at me to do something. so i start doing CPR. thinking that the definitely are calling ambulance meanwhile. only then, one of my aunts starts to develop epileptic symptoms. and in my mind i think she's faking (in real life she would for attention i guess). but when i see her diluted pupils i realize it's for real. i start giving her slaps hoping she'll get out of it while i'm still resuscitating the woman. suddenly i realize that no one else is around. they just simply disappeared and left me to deal with it. they didn't even call any ambulance or anything. i was freaking out and handling two ppl at the same time. at one point i managed i guess so i ran away from the scene hoping to find a spot to calm down away from my crazy aunt who was acting still weird and talking non-sense (as part of her epilepsy). and i look for my mom but i wake up before i find her..



Again, points about me, I'm 26. finally managed to leave my country and live abroad as i always dreamt of (as of feb 2008). my father is chronically ill (cancer) and i don't have anything going on with my mom at the moment..



The question is.. Can you help me interpret this?

You seem to have to take on a lot of responsibility with your family members; they put too much on you.  How do you feel about this aunt; could she be the snake/dog from your other dream?  Have you ever heard the story of the little boy who cries wolf?  He cries wolf to get others attention, even when there is no wolf around, but the one time a wolf is there, no one comes to help him because he cried wolf so many times. That sounds like  your aunt. An "epileptic" can be a dream symbol of someone who is out of control.

Cutting down my previous question: Part 1?



I had two dreams two nights in a row. that i think are related. I post here the first one and i ask you to follow up the second part please in my next question.



I remember bits and pieces. first dream I was in some big store and i was bare foot when i noticed a huge brown snake. i freaked out and started running the stairs to my uncle telling him that am afraid because i saw a snake and i'm bare foot. when i reach up to him, i look down to see a huge black dog attacking my mother. i scream: "mom is in danger" and i run down trying to help her. I take a big stick hoping i could hit the dog with it. suddenly the dog turns to me. it and the snake start chasing me and it takes me a while to realize that i have been left alone. not my mom nor my uncle nor anyone else is around. and i start running away and looking for someone but no one was there. the dog and the snake at one point turned to human (but it didn't surprise me as usual in dreams) however, i still recognize them as the dog and the snake. and miraculously, i find a spot to hide from them but then i wake up before the end of the dream.



So, points about me, I'm 26. finally managed to leave my country and live abroad as i always dreamt of. my father is chronically ill (cancer) and i don't have anything going on with my mom at the moment..



Now, the question is.. Can you help me interpret this?

Of course the snake and the dog turn human, because here, they both represent someone who is harmful (the snake) and someone close to your mother (the dog). Dogs are symbols of friendship and loyalty; snakes can represent many things, but here, represents someone who is harmful and betrays your mother. Remember, the black dog hurts your mother, and the snake freaks you out.  It could literally be two people, but I felt it was just one person that you felt was harmful particularly to your mother, but someone you don't like.  Brown snake would indicate someone not fatal, but still someone you don't like; bland and not colorful. Black is the color of deceit, lies and things hidden.

There is nothing unusual about your dream, as far as I can tell. Dreams mix reality and fiction, and often bits of reality that have nothing to do with each other.
You should be glad you can remember your dreams so well. Studies show that people who do are often more creative than the average.

Water is the symbol for emotions, so a big water tower that falls would mean that somehow, you  and your various family members have had a lot of emotional issues to deal with.  I find it interesting that 1) you don't say a flood occurred after it fell down, so there is no disaster because of the emotions and 2) you guys go on with what you were going to do as if nothing had happened.  A peanut is something small, and is often a pet name for a small child.

Dream interpretation: multiple bites from a snake?



I had a dream that I was continuosly getting bit by a large yellow snake.  It was poisonous, yet I kept fighting off death...the snake came out of nowhere and kept biting me in the back and the armpit area.  I was at a library and at the same time work (ever have those two places at one time dreams?).  I ignored the bites/biting for about 10 minutes until I realized the snake wouldn't stop, then I asked for someone to call 911.  I went up to a weird room and lied down, hoping to not die.  Can anyone make sense of this?

Library is a place of knowledge.  Snakes can represent many things, but here, it represents someone who is "biting you in the back" or backstabbing. You are aware that this person is doing this, and until you take measures to protect yourself (in the dream, you call 911) it will continue (the snake wouldn't stop).

I have been having weird dreams lately?



This is really personal, I haven't even told my twin sister this. I read a book about a girl getting raped and killed, and I was thinking about how awful it would be to be in her position. A couple nights later I had a dream that I was raped. I could feel EVERYTHING about it! I remember it hurting and I saw everything. Then I had another one about that. But the thing is is that I didn't want to have sex in the dream, but I kind of just gave up and let him do whatever he wanted. I had another one of those dreams, and each one has a different person. I told my friend, and that same night I had yet ANOTHER rape dream-and I let him do whatever he wanted because I gave up-and it was with my step-dad?! He would NEVER do that!!! Why is this happening? I have had four dreams in total about this. I'm thirteen, so I don't have rape fantasies or anything.

I agree with the other two........but i think just like they said your coming into ur sexuality right now.....and ur afraid....ur at the point where its coming out in your dreams .....i had crazy dreams about stuff like that at ur age....i still do occasionally its normal don't think your weird and don't think its some kinda of warning....not that you should not care about stuff like that cuz you should always be on your guard..but its just away of your body releasing ur sexual tension and the recent sexual visualization u had was in that book and it stuck with you and that's how ur brain released it

You might be really into the book. Believe me ! When I was reading Anne Rice Vampire Chronicles I had this dreams of me being a vampire and sucking other peoples blood. But like real I could feel the blood in my mouth and how i swallowed it.



But anyways a rape dream means:
vengeful feelings toward the opposite sex.  You are feeling violated in some way. Something or someone is jeopardizing your self-esteem and emotional well-being. You feel that someone or something is being forced upon you. Dreams of rape are also common for those who were actually raped in their waking life.

Your mind is trying to decipher the difference between what was real (new Jersey) and what is real (egypt) I'm sure there are many similarities between your old life and your new life that you can reminisce about, but there are some things from your past that are long dead and you can never go back to them.



You could go back to your cousin, which I assume live in NJ, but in your mind there's a chance that life you had is dead and would just be running from your past.



You have already started a future now, enjoy and make the best of it.

When you take on a third-person perspective in a dream, that usually means that the events depicted are out of your control, or at least that you feel as if they are.

Meeting my best friend's crush and trying to seduce two prison guards - what does this dream mean?



Tonight I had a dream about seeing my best friend's crush for the first time (this guy is like the "love of her life". She likes him most despite her current crushes and affairs). I found his voice to be quite more Caucasian in the dream despite him being Mexican. We did something together, like traveled somewhere, but I don't remember for sure.



The second part of my dream was of me in some sort of basement-looking prison where I tried to seduce two guards. I almost did but an event on-site (prisoners escaping) stopped me. I've felt "horny" and self-confident like I never do in real life. All I had to do was catwalk and put my legs apart and they were by my feet, whereas in real life I never even had a boyfriend.

The first part is probably taking an interest in your best friend and maybe a concern as to whether or not this guy is deserving of her attentions ...  kinda wanting to meet him and see if you want to give him your stamp of approval ...



the second part probably has to do with some ongoing exploration or revelation of your own sexual nature ...  are you in high school/middle school, noticing all of the things puberty has caused in your body, or on the verge of a new relationship?  any of these (and others) can cause this kind of dream ...



dreams are our mind's way of dealing with emotions and changes and how we feel about ourselves and the people in our lives ...

Dead grandmother communicating in my dreams.?? HELP?



I had a dream of my grandmother who passed away in 2004, this was not the first dream but the last dream i had about her about a month ago was like this. I only remember one part of the dream and it was her asking me if there was anything i wanted to say to her as this would be the last time i saw her (in my dreams) since then i have not had any dreams about her. This keeps playing on my mind ebcasue she asked me if i wanted to talk to her but i just said no its ok we will talk again soon. There wasnt anything that i was hiding from her or that i wanted to tell her before she died. Can anyone please help me?

Can someone please help me interpret this?



This is more of a reality interpretation, but its an interpretation nevertheless. Please read and answer -



This happens to me 8/10 times. Whenever I feel sexually excited & I'm reaching my peak while masturbating, someone always has some work in my room. They always knock at the wrong timing, ALWAYS!



I'm an Asian & everyone here has more of a conservative mindset so I cant really be jerking off in full view of ppl, neither can I tell my parents to quit coming at the wrong time cause I'm jerking off. Moreover, "casual sex" isn't really the norm here and very few people indulge in it. All I find solace in is masturbation and with all these interruptions time and time again, I end up being sexually and mentally frustrated. I'm worried that I might completely start hating sex due to all this bullsh*t, turn impotent or suffer from sexual dysfunction.



I'm 20 and I don't really know what God is trying to indicate. Can someone kindly help me out as to how I'm supposed to interpret this?

You could be opening the door to being hurt.  Be careful.

It's a blood dream... the monthly blood dream. PMS is probably no stranger to you. Crazy maid with the poison she carrying out the house? Your body getting rid of 'stuff'.

The dream suggests you have some very conservative friends who do not like new things.



I would guess you do like to experience new situations and these people or individual do not like it when you do to the point they get kind of crazy and want to stop you.



These people are important to you and while you want to do these things you still feel some guilt pain.

The only feeling I  get wth this is a past life memory. I feel you were probably the maid in the dream and that would have been how you died. The pain in your side would have been as you fell probably. It feels like you were probably about 19.

Dreams can mean a WHOLE variety of things.  They can be affected from the dinner you eat to the last thing you are thinking about when you fall asleep.



I would think that if you are dreaming that your boyfriend is cheating on you, then you have it in your mind that he is.  You think about it a lot during the day, so the idea creeps into your dreams.



Dreams don't predict the future.  They simply are showing us what we want / don't want to see

I aint no expert, but i guess your a wee bit insecure about your relationship?Is it a new relationship? Have ye been cheated on in the past? Are you giving more to the relationship than he is? Loads of questions, but if these thoughts are swimming around your head, then its nearly a nailed on certainty you'll be dreaming about it.
But the only way you'll find out for sure is to ask yer bf.
But dont place to much importance on yer dreams. I had a recurring dream that i was having sex with Girls Aloud(including Nicola). Has that happened in the real world? Has it chuff!

It's possible that he may be. Or you are having some trust issues that need to be addressed. Don't waste time, ask the questions that you need answers to. If there is a defense on his part, then you may need to rethink your relationship. Don't allow your questions to go unanswered. Communicate before it is too late. If you still feel that you're not satisfied with the response, try again. One thing I would suggest is that you not go to him angry or upset, that will only put him on the defense. Meditate on it, and ask the Holy Spirit to be your mouthpiece in the conversation.

The dreams suggests at the least that you have suspicions that your boyfriend is cheating on you.  However, it may also be that your unconscious has sense some thing which support this hypothesis.  So, it does appear there are some unhealthy aspects to your current relationship.

It probably means you have unresolved issues from when you were younger when you felt abandoned or left out or that you weren't loved enough to make you feel secure. Split ups in families for instance can make us feel like we have to compete for attention and this is maybe what you are dealing with here, the emotion not the actual thing happening.

Well, I try to find a meaning in everything, so I'd think that your inability to walk might mean that you're trying to move forward in life but something is stopping you and making you weaker. You're trying to pursue a dream or reach a goal but a couple things are overpowering you.

This dream might also mean that you're feeling overwhelmed and are folding under pressure.

I hope I'm not reading too much into this- You appear to be insecure, lacking resources and *support*. Where do you feel you may be lacking?
Is it based on school (grades, thoughtful friends), home (preoccupied parents- only one parent?) Your weak legs are saying you feel inadequate to 'rise to challenges'. When you are aware of the character of possible shortcomings, that's your *first step*. &lt;Keep trying&gt; OK?

when you dream your body becomes immobilised. this prevents you from acting out your dreams in your sleep and keeps you safe. some people actually dream they have been paralysed, which in a sense they have.

It is probably about you struggling with something within yourself. It could be how you deal with a situation, knowing rationally you should do one thing, but wanting with your heart to do something else even tho you know it will not work out.  Its a lesson for you in inner strength and realising that if we do what we know is right, even if the result is upsetting, we are opening a new door for something better to come in, even though it may not feel like it at the time.

What do my dreams mean? Death and fire



I used a interent Ouija board (if you dont know what it is, its a way of contacting the dead only you dont use interent) even though i know interent ones have no effect and it kept saying murder and house fire. I wasnt to scared because like i said, internet ones are not real. Then i started dreaming that my house was on fire. This reoccured about 5 times.Then i dreamt my house exploded from some bomb and it was onfire and i was inside the house. Not long after(in real life) my mum forgot about my toast in oven, and fire alarm went off but it was because it was smokey.Then i dreamt my grandad died and my last dream was that i tried to commit Suicide by hanging myself? It's giving me goosebumps because in the past i have dreamt things that have come true. Help? =[

I think you have terrified yourself. You may try and convince yourself you're not worried but inside you are.  The trouble is, because of burning the toast the dreadful noise of the smoke alarm has only added to your fears. Please try and calm your fears. Nothing bad is going to happen to you. Ouija boards only have the power you give them.  You won't dream of your own death I assure you, I am  a medium and I have never known it. You have to put this behind you  now, when you go to bed, imagine yourself surrounded by a beautiful white light, which will keep out all the bad dreams. Dreaming about things that have then actually happened and these sort of nightmares are not related honestly.

Well here is one thing don't miss with Ouija boards but it is to late for that. Warning: DO NOT DESTROY THE OUIJA BOARD IF YOU HAVE USED IT! If you destroy it after use its evil will be much much harder to get rid of its evil but with an online one I don't think you have to worry about it being destroyed. And as well you should contact your nearest paranormal investigators or a priest that knows the ceremony to protect you and stop the being.

You made a mistake. Ouija boards are not a toy to be played around with. You may think I'm a nut case for saying this, but evil spirits can manipulate people through these. By using an ouija board you've allowed an evil spirit to latch onto you and is giving you these dreams. You'll start thinking that the ouija board is right and you're giving the demons power to give you the bad dreams. There is only one way that I know could possibly give you escape.

EX BOYFRIEND DREAM - HELP!



I am 21 years old and I have a boyfriend who I have been seeing since September. Before him I went out with another guy for a couple of years but before him whilst I was at school I went out with a guy who was my first love, first sexual expierences etc.



The dreams relate to the first guy who I don't really think I've ever got over and I honestly don't know why. I've had boyfriends who have broke up with me and all the rest of it but for some reason I still find myself thinking about him and checking out his new girlfriends and comparing myself to them - even though it was 5/6 years ago! And I know I should have moved on a long time ago!



The dreams started last week when I had one about us meeting and having a meal and some wine. He was talking to me about things and being REALLY nice (I thought I was angry at him but this dream seemed to alleviate it all), and he was telling me how it was ME who gave him the advice to sort his life out and settle down with this new girl who he is seeing now. He also said he always wonders how I am getting on at uni and if I have a boyfriend. - (this was weird because I honestly thought he would not really care about me now). Additionally, I ended up having sex with him. It was easy, straightforward and nice I suppose - even though he had a girlfriend whilst in the dream.



The second main dream was last night when I was sitting in a bar with my best friend and he came in and sat down. Instead of sitting infront of me this time he sat behind me and I didn't want to turn round to talk. I just knew he was there and carried on talking. My friend and I went outside to this canal barge and he followed me and as I got on one of the canoes he put his hand on my shoulder from behind REALLY HARD (I could feel it in my dream) and tried to turn me round but I got on the canoe and off I went!



I never woke up from either of the dreams feeling unsettled but it is a bit weird as I haven't seen him in years and don't plan to see him. What on earth do these dreams mean?



I hope you can help!!

Basicly the first dream means that you had a nice past. You loved this person, and you loved being with them. Having sex represents the bond between you and your past. The second dream is yoru brain saying that you need to stop thinking about this dream. In the dream you leave in the canoe even though he's asking you to stay. Your subconcious is recognizing the fact that you had something good but, now it is time to let it go and move on.

First loves always hold a special place in your heart and more so if this also included the first sexual encounter. Dreams are just dreams and often don't relate to reality. 5/6 Years is a while and he may have moved on but if you are still keen on him things may be different now if you ever got back with him and maybe for the better who knows.

I am in an even worst position than you Darling for the love of my dreams was separate from me. We have a daughter and things got so baddly between us that she blames me for our separation and I cannot find her. I know where our daughter is but not her mother. I also dream about her and in my dreams she runs away, I try to catch up with her but she just fades away. You see? You are not the only one suffering without knowing the answer! By the way, we split 12 years ago and i stillhave not been able to see my daughter, only over the phone! my priest told me that I had to move on, as if it was so easy! The reason of our separation was our families and all I have left is wrriting it down as a tragic love story which I am doing unfortunately i have needs and have to work hard so i just wrrite a bit in my spare time!

The dream suggests you have some unfinished emotional attachments to your previous boyfriend.  The fact that you had sex with him indicates there is something missing in your current relationship.  It was "easy" to have sex suggesting maybe there is something difficult about your current relationship.  Your unconscious might be showing you a comparison of the two relationships.

The second dreams suggests there were problems in the past relationship and there were some things in it that was not easy.  As a result you left the relationship.  The dream seems to be a reminder of the negative of the first relationship.

It seems now you need to look at current issues in your relationships and make some choices.

I think the person with whom e had our first sexual experience with is always a little bit special. Although to say you still haven't got over him is a bit different. Perhaps there is a bit of pain associated with him you need to deal with. Whether you felt abandoned if he was the one who finished it or something like that. the result of which will be still affecting your relationships now. You may be worried when you haven't heard from them for a while or whatever because he called you less and less just before you finished if you see what I mean. I think the dream is trying to help you sort this. the fact that the first one was happy is i thnk so you remember the good bits and then in the second you ignored him, means you know it is time to let it go and move on now.

Can someone help me interpret this dream?



i had a dream about this guy that i work with and think that i might like.

anyway it went like this...

i was over his house and im guessing we were 'dating'. and the first part of the dream we didnt talk too much and he was on his computer while i was on the other side of his room and then his friend came in and said something (i dont remember what) but it had something to do with us not sitting together and talking. so then i went over to him and we started talking and stuff then my mom texted his phone telling him that she was coming to pick me up at 4:30 and i didnt want to leave so then my mom called me told me she was comming to pick me up then decided not too and hung up.  then he started walking out and was like "lets get out of here" so as i was walking downstairs i said goodbye to his family...but it wasnt his family it was people i never saw before. and then i began to walk out the door and thats where the dream ended.



i know its really long but if someone could please help me figure out what this all means.

thanks!!!!!!!!

You like him is the short answer. You did not talk to much because you really don't know him, and you can't imagine what he might be like, or say. You know that he is into his computer, maybe to much, and you are concerned he may ignore you, or spend more time with his computer than you. His "friends" represent your desire to get to know him, and "they " wonder why you don't try to get to know him. Your "mother" is concerned about this person, and you are concerned how your mother will react to you gettting to know him. His wanting to "get out of here" means you think you/he want this to be just between you, and him, not him, his friends, and family, and you. You did not recognize his family because you really don't know them, they are "unrecognizable", or unknown to you. That's my interpretation.

Can someone please interpret my dream?



I occasionally have a dream whereby I sell my home to release the equity and then end up living in rented accommodation.  As soon as I have done this I am really frightened and feel lost. I have lived on my own for ten years and am always relieved when my mortgage is paid each month!  I have moved about a lot as a child and adult.  I have lived at this address for 6 years which is the longest I have lived anywhere.  I support myself financially with no help.  I also had another dream whereby I sold my perfectly good Micra and part exchanged it for a yellow reliant robin (which did look nice in my dream and yellow is my favourite colour) but as soon as I picked up my reliant robin I was frightened as I lost my Micra.  I hadn't had a drink that evening prior to going to bed.  This is serious as well - I am not making it up!  Thank you.

There are a few things that stand out to me in these dreams. The first is about your home. The home is security and protection, your own space. In the dream you sell your home but get scared once this is done. Maybe this reflects a fear of losing security in your life, and because it's the longest you have stopped in one place your mind may be preparing itself mentally for it to go wrong because its too good to be true.

In regards to selling your Micra for a Reliant Robin, this maybe be a sign of frustration in your life. You are perfectly happy with the Micra but still exchange it for the Reliant Robin. The Reliant Robin may symbolise an urge to try something totally different. More uncertain but more fun, as this reflects with that it's in your favourite colour and doesn't initially look so bad. Also the Reliant Robin is quite a big feature of Only Fools and Horses TV comedy, which could show an emphasis on fun and humour as well as the bright yellow. You could be searching for a release from the mundane to the fun but uncertain future.

This is I feel just your natural security concerns. Its almost like playing out the worst case scenario to see what would happen.  This is probably due to what you say about moving a lot, it takes a long time to feel the roots beneath you. The dreams aren't an indicator of you having to do those things in real life, so do not worry, just your subconcious mind rumbling around your thoughts and issues. What  might help is painting a room red or a earthy colour and keep an onyx or  obsidian crystal on your window sill, this will help you feel grounded and more secure.

You had to make a choice, or felt like you did, when you were small. In fact you didn't have to, but the pressure was bad, so you did what you thought would cause the least pain. That is not a decision a child should have to make. You have an attitude of s*** happens, because you know it does and there doesn't seem to be a lot you can do to change it. that is no longer the case. We make our own destiny, it is not a chance thing, it is a choice thing.  The pain thing/palpitations in your chest is your heart starting to heal, allow it to happen, let someone in, thy have been sent for a reason, good luck x

What does it mean to keep dreaming about babies?



I have had 4 dreams over the past week that I have to take care of other peoples' babies... they aren't new born babies as I know this is supposed to signify death. 
During the dreams I am always very anxious of the baby getting hurt and therefore have to be with it continuously (even whilst sleeping) on one occasion in my dream the baby was really really tiny (about the size of the palm of your hand) perhaps this exaggerates it's fragility?

I am really interested to know why this is happening any help would be appreciated (please do not make up solutions).

Thank you.

I am 14 years old. I also forgot to add that the babies are always very peaceful and always have their eyes shut.

It could be you have some kind of untapped creativity or talent that you are afraid of putting to the test, like some kind of stage-fright. I suggest you look into taking a class to develop your artistic side.

In my country it is generally believed that dreaming of babies and children means that you have/will have some kind of problem, difficulty, that you are worried about something. 
I guess, since your dreams are about taking care of other people's babies, it could mean that someone else's problems distress you very much. Or, somebody's acts may cause you a problem. 
I had a similar dream when my best friend was ill and I was very sad and dreamt of taking her child for a walk.

Babies are great responsibilities.  That's what it means for you.  You have varying degrees or burdens of responsibility that you take upon yourself.  You involve yourself in others' concerns and thus are burdened with their business.  If the babies are boys, the effort you exert is futile.  If the babies are girls, you will gain much bounty and success from your effort.  Newborn babies do not signify death nor a new beginning just a really big burden and responsibility as that's what babies are.

My freaky deaky dream! What does it mean?!?



Its pretty random. The beginning is weird and confusing, i'm stood in a long, thin, beige corridor and i'm looking through a glassless window  into another beige square watching a short guy with shoulder length curly brown hair but no facial features in comfy beige clothes and hes just kinda stood there.
Then i turn around because i can sorta feel someone else is in the corridor and there is.... Whitney Houston when she was younger is stood about 10 feet away from me, the music from the movie bodyguards starts  and in a kinda comical way she begins to sort of float towards me (like the alien in mars attacks that dresses up like a lady), whilst she sings to the music. She gets about 2 feet away and i woke up... what in the world does it all mean!?!

I'm no dream interpreter, but I'll try;
 The long thin corridor could suggest you don't see many opportunities in life, (due to only being able to go back and forth). The man could indicate a person from your past who you have left behind, forgotten about ( Because he is behind you, and has no face.)
 Now Witney represents an ambition you may have, perhaps being a singer, the fact she is floating towards you says you want the ambition to come your way.
 Or perhaps you eat too much cheese.



BTW I'm sure you have lots of opportunities in your life, perhaps you have to go and find them, rather than waiting for them to find you, (You did after all wake before Witney reached you.)

Do you do or have you been considering doing meditation? This feels all about calming the mind and relaxation. I feel you are being encouraged to use these techniques. Its about going within and finding answers. You may not even be aware conciously of the questions, but on some level you feel a restlessness that nothing outside of you can understand,  Its a time to begin to understand the bigger picture and your life purpose.

This is largely copied off Carl Jungs ideas, and I'm hardly a doctor BUT this is what I think it may 'mean'.

The dark, windowless corridor and the presence of the 'Shadow' (an archetype which symbolizes all the hereditary and negative aspects of ourselves which we repress. In your fream, the Shadow indicated its presence with the appearence of the faceless figure-are you sure it is a man though?) indicates the presence of deeper unconscious realms of the mind. The more sexual, extroverted, tempremental and vibrant parts of your 'Persona' (the mask of personality and behaviour which you present to the world) are projected and appear as Whitney Houston. However, you fear over-identification with this false persona. What struck me was this bit:

she begins to sort of float towards me (like the alien in mars attacks that dresses up like a lady)

where Houston acts like something which you recognize as only APPEARING to be a woman.



You yourself fear that, in over-identifying with your persona, you will lose a sese of 'inner self', but dread to confess to being anything except for what you tell people you are, determinedly seeing yourself through rose-tinted specs.



It is also possible that you repress more insitnctive, bisexual habits of the mind. If you continue to do so, these repressed qualities may burst forth at inoppurtune moments, leading to possible homosexuality-or at least indicating your fear of homosexuality, which is becoming an overpowering and blinding influence. Basically, in fearing homosexuality, you may find yourself succumbing to it.

Crazy stuff.

I believe it will. If you think dreams are just the random firing of neurons in your brain turned into visual images - then if we can convert electrical signals to images like we do in TVs, then if we can find a way to harness the neural patterns of dreams I'm sure in the future our eyes will become video cameras and dreams and thoughts will be recorded.

as for as i know right now there is no way to record dreams. but the way science is going in maybe 20 years or so it may be a possibility.
i don't believe that dreams are for the most part random. i am in the process of writing a book on dreams and i have not found anything that supports that idea. also as a dream interpreter i have done to many interpretations that do not suggest that idea either. as for taking away our sub-conciousness that would be a dangerous thing to do.we need our sub-conscious to hold information that we can't hold in our consciousness all the time. our sub-conscious holds onto information that protects us from bad things that happen to us in our lives that without it would make us  literally crazy.

How do you mean record dreams? You can with practice remember more and more and write them down and keep them ,they  make fascinating reading a few months or years ahead and sometimes if you work hard you can see a pattern.  Most dreams aren't random. they are our subconcious and higher self giving us guidance and help with things we don't even realise sometimes we need help with. We also astral travel and some dreams are the memory of where we have been, what we have seen etc. It is easy to dismiss them as they like a lot of the most interesting things of life can't be proven, but are as real as anything else we encouter in our waking life.

Paul is right, in theory we will be able to decode what each set of neurons 'mean' in terms of sensory or memory imagery, and thus can play someone's dream. [Though dreams will. I'm guessing, have very sketchy detail in, which the rest of our brain then "fills in"].

And i agree with Paul that dreams are the brain randomly sampling memories and images and possibilities. They are not significant in the way that Freud etc thought.

Like a cat dreams of chasing a mouse. That dream doesn't "mean" anything deeper about the cat's personality or inner psychic dramas.

When my husband closes his eyes, its like turning on the tv, and invariably next morning, he opens his eyes and sez,
 "I had this really strange/weird/daft/silly/scary/ dream, last night"(only the discription varies, according to the type of dream)
.I'm usually like, "oh yeah, another one?"
I never dream, and just cant understand it. Forty-odd years ago when i was a young child, i had a dream about my mum and dad (who had just had a huge row, in my ear-shot), they seemed to be made of plastercine and as i watched them, their heads rolled back and fell off. Ive never forgotten this dream, it was my one and only.
My husband thinks I am odd.

I was givin a banana gun & the detenator from the batman film, we had to shoot the other side of the class at the class mates.
Not hiting them directly but movin them further & further back, almost like a war game.
To fire the gun, I had to blow in it, until the bubble gum bubble appeared.
Then I had to pop it!!
I fired at the computer, it crashed.
One of my weird class mates (alex thornton) was unconscious.
As I turned behind me, there was a clock on the wall.
It was Mr Ball.
However this clock, was the same clock I’d wanted to draw in art.!
My old food tech teacher Miss Unsworth was there.
Sepperating the two sides of the classroom was a long red wire.
Which gave me a small electrical shock!!

This is were my dream changed….

I was in a science lab and was givin the toca phone!

I was at home, sitting on the sofa, 
for some reason, there was a baby gate in the door way.
A large black & white collie dog jumped over it and rested it’s teeth in my dog’s neck.

Yet again my dream changed…
I was near glenburn
the joker was there
as was rex off big brother
a girl with blonde hair was pushed down the cliff.
The end!!



The dream-- interpreted.

1. Mr Ball bein a clock - He’s an art teacher & I wanted to draw a clock from the display for my coursework.

2. The red Wire-  my internet conextion



3. The joker & detenator - I’m obsessed with the film!

4. The phone & science lab. - my last lesson was in the science lab, & I really wanted that phone!

5. Rex & the cliff- rex Is off big brother. The cliff off casualty

6. The war game - I had discussed war films with kirstie the day before

7. The bubble gum- I ate pink bubble gum at the cinema a few nights before.

8. A collie dog-  my old dog, however with black & white fur. I seen a collie yesterday, and a black and white aggressive dog lives nearby.

9.the baby gate - I was talkin about how much I didn’t want kids, and my ex had a baby gate for his dog.

10. Firing at the computer, so it crashed, - my laptop crashes!



ESSAYY!! haha =]

How Long Do You Dream At Night?



There are nights when it seems like you have dreamed for hours; maybe even the whole night.  But I have heard that you only dream for just minutes at night.  Anyone know anything about this?  Thanks!

I remember reading somewhere that you dream for a few minutes each night.  Dreaming usually only occurs in REM sleep which is the shortest and last part of the sleep cycle.  So if you sleep for a short time, or really long time, chances are that you will miss out on the dreaming cycle.

What does this scary dream mean?



I dreamt I was being chased by a giant golliwog (like, the teddy bear ones, it was 10 foot tall and was running about after me) I was hiding in these bushes by an old abandoned house, and I ran inside to stay out of sire. Then all of a sudden this woman appears and shoves me into this dirty, rusty bath and tries to drown me. I'm struggling to breathe and I look up at her, clawing at her hands but she's too strong. But when I look at her face, I see that it's me - at least the woman looks just like me.
What the hell does this mean?

One interpretation:

The giant golliwog is your animus, or distorting of your masculine self/side.
The woman is your sense of purification re the gg side of things.
The dirty/rusty nature in effect tells you, you need an upgrade or purification after your distorting of your masculine nature.

Men are typically 60% initiatory, 40% completing; women are the complement:  40% initiatory, 60% completing.
Hence, there's some distortion in how you initiate things?

In your dream, you're running from something that obviously scares you, which signifies that you have a problem that scares you.



The fact that you run into an abandoned house means that by what you're doing about this problem is something which is what you don't know what you're getting yourself into.



The fact that you're drowning in the dream means that you feel overwhelmed by this problem, whatever it may be.



And the fact that the woman drowning you is, well, you, means that the problem lies within yourself.



Good luck!

You are clearly not comfortable. That is what this dream is about. It is a small nightmare that only focuses on how uncomfortable you feel.

There probably is a reason for that but that you will have to find out yourself. That it actually has to do with bowel movement is unlikely.

The dream is pretty self-explanatory--you're stuck in a rut.

According to Freudian psychology, you have an anal fixation



* The Anal retentive personality is stingy, with a compulsive seeking of order and tidiness. The person is generally stubborn and perfectionist.



* The Anal expulsive personality is an opposite of the Anal retentive personality, and has a lack of self control, being generally messy and careless.

Your privacy settings and answer output indicate that you are anal retentive.  Your subconscious is prodding you to break out of your shell and live a little.

Largely what 'Nina C' says, except I think you might also have a wish for some creativity-poo is, after all, the very first thing a youngster will creatively 'produce'. Perhaps you dread your creativity being exposed to the world, fearing the failure and punishment from authority figures that a youngster gets when he 'does a big 'un' in his pants-but your unconscious is telling you to give it a go anyway.

sounds like a pretty **** dream. (Boom-boom).

Repeat every night before you go to sleep; "I will have a lucid dream tonight." Actually keep saying this until you sleep. Have a post-it or something hanging over your bed top remind you. Reminding is the key in all this.

Be sure to have a trigger. Something you do in your dream to make the lucidity stick. Looking at your hands is a great and simple one.

This may take a while, months even,  before it works. I hope you can spare the time. ;-)

Take Vitamin B before you go to bed.  This will help you dream intensely and with frequent wake-ups.  Intense emotion will cause you to wake from a dream and have a clear memory of the events, mood and a desire to re-enter or exit the dream you just had.

If re-entering, hold onto the fondest memory of the dream as you drift off to sleep.  The emotion should carry you back to the dream where you should begin to develop self awareness and the knowledge that you can act as an independent agent in your dream.  The dream itself continues as if you are in a movie with stuff going on all around you.

If departing a dream, tell yourself that emotions of the previous dream are not real and that only your sense of self is truly real.  Dismiss any lingering emotions or thoughts from the last dreams as fiction and remind yourself it was just a dream and wasn't real..  You should journey into an entirely different dream with an increased level of self awareness.

Have fun with this.  Don't try too hard to make things happen--they'll happen on their own once you get into the habit of remembering and forgetting.



You may wish to keep a tape recorder or note pad on your night table if you come across something you think you might forget by morning.  Record the message to yourself in the dark and take no more than 10 seconds to record your thought.

Sweet Dreams!!

I keep having different bad dreams but at the same time each night, what does that mean?



So for the last few days I've have very different bad dreams but always around 4:30 in the morning. The dreams range from being raped to seeing someone kill themselves with a drill bit, and being cheated on. These dreams wake me up and a few times I've been unable to go to sleep because I was so upset. I am curious why these dreams keep happening at the same time of the night, and why are they so bad?

Are you on any new medications? sometimes these can change the chemicals in your brain and cause these nightmares. 
Sometimes it can also be anxiety and if you're thinking a lot lately, you've maybe got a lot to sort out and get back on tracks.

The dreams suggest there are some issues in your life which make you feel threatened.



You should explored these issues and likely you find something much milder in a nature than a rape or suicide.  Hopefully, you were not abused as a child as this would also elicit such dreams.

If they continue you might want to talk to a professional counselor about them.



If you can not figure out anything they can help you.

I think the time thing is just because we have the certain time of sleep when we dream after being asleep for so long.  I think this is to do with you being quite empathic and people turn to you for help or at least a shoulder to lean on. This is going to be happening more and more and I think you will have to consider doing something like this as a job. If not this, then a job where you come into contact with people who need help in one way or another and you listening to them and their problems will help them no end. You probably haven't considered this type of work, although you may have felt unfulfilled.Life has a strange way of showing us our life purpose if we haven't discovered it by a certain time.

Usually when people are doing me wrong and don't care but any dream with a swimming pool in it ALWAYS turns into a nightmare. Either the cubicles turn into a maze, the swimming pool gets split into two sections - the fun side and the side thats going to die, the slide has a trap door and you fall into a room with a low ceiling that's all white or into a bucket of puke, you lose someone, someone drowns, the slide has a crocodile at the beginning of it, the swimming pool is above the cafeteria and is about to collapse on you, the pool is split by a glass panel and you can't reach the person on the other side. The pool is a training pool that's really deep and you're the only one in it, you can't get out the pool, ETC.!! These all sound trivial but when you're actually in the dream it's very scary! Believe it or not I'm not afraid of swimming or swimming pools in real life

my worst nightmare was absolute total blackness. i mean so black that you could not tell front from back.left from right. up from down. i have actually been in that situation. when i was in Rome 34 years ago i took a tour of the catacombs on the appian way. my candle went out and i was trying to find my shoe when it happened. i got lost from the rest of the tour. i kept yelling for someone to come back and find me but my dad and mom did not know i was missing until they got to the chael which is where our group was headed. i was so terrified. i had nenver been in that type of darkness before,not even in caves. i had repeating dreams of that incident for years and years. i was 18 at the time and i am 52 now. but i will never eever forget the incident or the dreams that followed.

I dreamed I thought I was awake and getting out of my scary dream, but I WASN'T AWAKE I was dreaming I was getting out of bed, so I THOUGHT IT WAS REAL....it was so realistic, I felt my way across the dark room as if I really was awake and was heading out the door for help.....I kept being frightened and over and over again I would be so scared I'd dream I was getting up and REALLY ESCAPING the dream.....well I walked out into the hall and thought it was really happening, and I saw that my husband's bathroom door was shut because he had been taking a shower.....I was trying to get to him for help from my fear, and so he came out the door and I was relieved thinking I would be saved......suddenly as he was close by me, I looked at him and realized IT WASN'T HIM, it was a demon that looked like him, like an evil twin.

my worst dream would have to be when me and my family went and visited the tomb of an ancestor and there was a spell that when chanted or read they would come back from the dead. and they turned the whole town except me and my family into zombies. a while later my parents disappeared and they became zombies and all that was left was me and my siblings. Then they became zombies and i was the only person in the whole town that was still alive. Sort of like the movie with Will Smith called 
"I Am Legend" where a disease spreads throughout the whole world i think that what it was. i dont know but yeah it was like deja vu cause i saw the movie with some friends one time.

Get an office job at a small airline.  You'll have the opportunity to take a lot of free flights and can hang with the pilots.  A 10 year old can legally fly a plane once they are licensed to fly?

Well, i used to have that problem..One way is to think of flowers in the garden or your happy place. If you can't do that or it doesnt help then watch a little tv. like mabey a really kiddie show to help culm your nerve. In the day time dont watch scary shows that would give you these dreams. Or if their your favorit tv shows or movies watch them when you just awake.. so then in the day you can have better things to think about at night like more fun things that you've done or fun things that you've done a while ago. things that make you feel good!

Change your waking thoughts. You are in control of your dreams, just as you are in control of your waking thoughts. Stop hanging around with someone who drags you down too, that doesn't help either. You are not here to help them, the situation they are in is of their own making, so let them get on with it.

Crazy dream, but I ask myself what it meant....



I dreamt my mother who is over 40 was pregnant, but she had womb cancer when she was younger so that would be impossible, my stepfather also can't have children. In my dream my parents told me that my mom was pregnant and I pointed at my mother and said "but you can't have children" and then I pointed at my stepfather and said "and you are infertile". Why would I react like this in my dream?

Perhaps you generally are very careful not to hurt people's feelings but sometimes that is at the cost of actually telling the truth. Not in the case of your parents of course, but that is just the point of the dream. Maybe it is time to speak your truth, witholds are a great zapper of our own energy, they make us resentful and wish we had said something, say it! Not to hurt, but when someone asks your opinion, tell them. Instead of telling them what they want to hear, go for it, they asked! I think you are renowned for being kind and thoughtful, but sometimes that is at the cost of our own peace of mind.

The dreams suggests that you have wanted something from your mother but you realized she is unable to give that to you.



The same is true for  your stepfather.  It is likely there was some type of emotional support that you desired from them but that you never received.  The dreams indicates that you realize they do not have the ability to give you what you want or wanted.  It is likely the only person who can give you want you want is you.

There are two types of Dreams:
1) Those that are surreal and have a meaning because the subconscious mind is communicating with the conscious mind.
2) These dreams that have no meaning and are just random memory cell that ' fire at random'. 
Your dream was of type 2 and has no meaning, it is very bad that you choose to publicise this dream on a public forum, your should think about how your parents feel about you making this dream a matter of public knowledge, would you want people to make public; 
dreams (If any) in which you appear in a bad light.

You can learn a lot more about dreams and when they are 'speaking to you' start by familiarising yourself with the work of Carl Jung.

I wish you all the very best of good fortune in your quest to better understand dreams and their meaning.

Dream about deformed baby



I dreamed that I was on the phone with my friend since highschool (who was in the form of Holly from Girls Next Door) and I was pregnant. Suddenly I told her, "Hang on, I gotta have my baby real quick, let me call you back." Then I squatted down in the tub and basically squeezed out the entire amniotic sac. Apparently this was how I gave birth. Then I had to open it and pull the baby out. There was a healthy baby girl inside and she wasn't breathing. I squeezed her a little then she spit up and was fine.



My mother appeared at this point, then I squeezed out a second sac and there were 2 more babies. The first one literally looked like a small adult figurine version of my husband, but then I realized that it was all deformed, similar to the bones and muscles showing on Two Face in the recent Batman movie.



It was at this point that I noticed the third baby and pulled him out, he was very badly deformed and had like 6 legs and his bones were all showing. My mother took the baby and said "This baby will have a terrible life and will be too hard to raise," then took it away and went to throw it in the trash. I think she was going to throw away the first deformed one as well. I cried and cried and then took my healthy baby girl out of the bathroom and snuggled her, but then I realized she was a doll.

I doubt this is about babies though baby dreams tend to have that emotional effect on you very much when you wake up.

Babies seldom represent actual babies. Usually they are about new in general. New start, new ideas. Good and bad ideas. I think this is the case here.

You get an idea while on the phone that is not fully formed yet. You work on it and it is an amazing idea. You have some more ideas but they turn out to be not 'that good'. Specially because your husband helped you with that one.



Your mother in this is... how shall I put this .... your muze.... the mother of all ideas so to speak. Bad ideas need to go. Good advice.

In the end your amazing idea turns out to be 'just' an idea.

Your dream masks a suffocating fear that you have of the future.  While things may seem well at the present time, you have a feeling of impending doom that you and your husband will experience together.  It will happen within 1 year and it will leave you & your husband traumatized.

The third baby indicates that your future will be grotesque, horrifying and will result in death.  The realization that the first baby was a doll indicates that deep down you know what you and your husband have now cannot last.

My advice is to sell everything you have, pull up your roots and move to the other side of the world.  I'm deadly serious when I say this.  Death will come knocking at your door.  Don't be there to answer it.

You had, have or will have, I cannot place the time, alot of responsibility.  You were or are a heavily-burdened individual with many responsibilities which have come or will come upon you all of a sudden. There are three major responsibilities you attend to.  One is a source of contentment and bounty for you.  Your undertaking in this first endeavor is fruitful initially and though later your effort in this undertaking, whether it be work, study, will not longer prove beneficial as it was initially but will simply continue because you find this burden you have undertaken endearing more than beneficial.  Your second responsibility involves your husband.  You undertake a great deal more than he.  You feel your obligation to him as well a burden, some responsibility you must manage. The state you've seen him in in the dream tells me that there is some deformity in the person of your husband.  This is according to your dream.  There is some incompletion about him, something lacking, not fully-developed.  Perhaps that's why you bear the burden more. You may have tried or soon will try to take upon yourself another endeavour, requiring more work and more of your energy, however, through the assistance of your kin, your burden will be alleviated.  You will be relieved from some great burden requiring much of your energy.  That's as close as I can come.  More power to you.

Go to Dream Dictionary - and you can "decode" your dreams by typing in related words to your dream.

I think that some dreams have meaning/predict stuff and some dreams don't mean anything. You should try finding some books on the subject.. There are several out there. Have you ever had that when you dream something but when you wake up you can't remember any of it? Then sometime later you get deshavu? I think that deshavu is the dreams that you can't remember.. Very interesting stuff to think about..

Dreams have a lot of meaning for the dreamer but they do not predict the future.  Only in the sense that a dream can reveal some action one should either take or avoid and may effect your choices which will then effect your future.  Many people dream things that come true but all this means is your unconscious either knew it was a likely probability or you made it happen.  We tend to only remember those dreams that did appear to predict something, not all the others that did not.

Most Dreams do have meaning to them. But not exact meaning. The are like a web of thoughts. Dreams are your brains way of showing you your repressed thoughts. It is very intricate and delicate. When you see something in a dream everything things means something else. VERY CONFUSING. Like if you were to dream about dogs, it means that they can indicate that the dreamer is feeling lonely, unloved and not accepted for themselves. And lions can mean your inner strength is blooming. And yes. I have had a dream oddly containing a rooftop and I was on it looking too the stars. And that means I feel pressured by my significant other in my waking life. And it was right. My boyfriend really wanted me to make a quick decision about something and I felt very pressured. See? Dreams mean a lot!

The only thing that I can say that ever happened in my dreams is that I saw a place I had never been to in the dream before I actually got there.  The first one I recall is when I was in boot camp 13 years ago.  The dream was one of those non sense dreams that you have that makes no sense.  What I dreamed was that myself and a few other recruits had to sneak out of our barracks and get a message to some one in a different barracks and sneak back without being caught.  The other barracks was set up different than ours.  I was amused by the dream and didn't think anything about it until after we graduated boot camp and went to our school.  The barracks we transferred to was set up exactly the way the barracks in my dream was set up and I hadn't been in that barracks until then.
The other dream I had was that I was walking down this street that had interesting house on it and I was amazed at how beautiful they were.  Well, after I got stationed on Guam, my now soon to be x husband and I moved into together.  One afternoon, I decided to go for a drive to learn my way around the back streets around where we lived on the island.  All of a sudden, I found myself driving along this one road and looking at the houses and thinking how beatiful they were.



Mind you, this was the first time I had ever been physically on the street.  Then I stopped the car and started thinking to myself, that the houses on this street looked familiar some how and then it dawned on me that this was the houses in this dreaam that I had deamed of.

What do you reckon this dream - with a cicada in it - is about?



This morning, I dreamt about a black plastic bin bag on my bedside chest, and there were flies (grey-spekled house-fly sized and black ones about as big as this asterisk *).

Then in the middle of the floor on the rug was a creature that looked like a yellowy-greeny-brown cicada from the front, but from the back, looked like a dragonfly (Or it might've been a cicada and the 'dragonfly body' was actually its back legs).

Then I went out into the upstairs hall, where Mum was there too. I asked her what the creature was and she said she didn't know.

Then she threw a massive cube of Oasis  (that gritty greeny-blue foam you put plants in) by the stairsand it rolled about like a dice (but didn't fall down the stairs and stayted pretty much in one place as it rolled) .



The cicada climbed on it as the Oasis rolled and evetually got stuck inside a hole in it. The tips of its wings, its back legs and its abdomen were poking out.

I'm terrified of insects - less so of cicadas as I like their singing - normally, but the flies didn't bother me much (I did feel grossed out seeing the bin bag, though).

I was a bit afraid of the cicada but I sort of instinctively knew it didn't mean any harm.

In previous dreams, it's just 'sat'/'stood' on one spot and the room/landscape it's been in has never been as vivid as the one I dreamt about last night. In fact the room has always been pitch black with a lone spotlight on the cicada.

I'm sure the cicada means something, but I don't know what. More later on

It's a simple revelation-of-fears dream. You are secretly scared of being alienated from your friends. Not uncommon at all.



What to do about it, just consider what might make your friends hate you, and take preemptive steps. Or just ignore it. Consider this: everyone loses friends. Being ditched by your crowd is not the end of the world. If you're ever going to amount to anything in the world, you have to be able to stand apart and be yourself.



So probably the best thing to do is not worry about it. If your friends start acting like that in real life, ditch them before they ditch you. Friends don't act like that, just go get better ones.

No not really.

Seeing a burger in a dream is a good sign. Specially if you see the bun.

But the rest of the part of the dream signifies that you will face some problems and you will not get help. You have to solve the problem on your own.

If you see the bun, then the problem is minor. If you did not see the bun, the problem is complicated but temporary.

My suggestions to you is stay calm and be patience. Not to think about your problem too much, It will pass away.

I have had similar nightmares for the past two days.  Can anyone tell me what they mean?



I've bought a new car (in the dream, not in real life) and I've lost it on/near my high school campus.  I really can't find it and can't get home (my real high school campus was not that large; I'm 24~!).  I search and search inside the school (asking if anyone has seen it) and outside (looking for the actual car).  People are rude and, in some cases, abusive (pushing me and using foul language).  When I go to my mother's office to ask her about the situation, her secretary tells me she's not there.  At some point, I fell down a long, long hole.  It was pitch black, but I could hear voices (like from a radio).  I fell out at the other end and was covered in dirt and bits of plants.

I had a similar dream yesterday.

***Real life:  I'm 24, recently married and planning on moving to the USA  soon (I'm American, but have been living in South Korea as a teacher for the past 3 years).

I agree with barb about the car representing your life, so the new car represents a new life.  You've bought it, i.e. made the decision to change your life... but you can't find it, i.e. you can't quite picture yourself living the life you've chosen.  The other people are all parts of yourself.  You're hesitant to move forward in this new life, symbolized by the people not helping or even getting in the way.  Your mother not being available symbolizes your feeling that you are very much on your own and will have to rely on yourself to make the best decisions.

The hole imagery reminds me of a seed being planted.  Maybe that's how you picture yourself, having been uprooted and reduced to the role of a tiny seed which must now try to take root, starting all over in a new place.  Alternately, since you fall out the other end, maybe the hole is the mythical "hole to China" that we've all imagined, only in this case, it connects South Korea to the USA.  Or maybe it's both: you fall all the way to the other side of the world, where you now feel like you must start all over again like a newly planted seed.

Can someone interpret this dream?



I had a dream the other night that I was dating an Indian (from India) woman and that we went to the movie theatre. There, the servers at the snack counter and some of the customers were being really mean to her (because of her nationality) and I wound up flipping out and cussing them out.



Then we go through several theatre auditoriums, none of them were seeming to play any movies, and some of them were even completely empty. Soon we find one theatre and sit down and the movie was going to start (no title, no genre, nothing mentioned) and then the dream ended.



What does it mean?

Theater

To dream that you are in a theater, signifies that you will derive much pleasure from new companionships. Consider also how the performance parallels to situations in your waking life. Observe how the characters relate to you and how they may represent an aspect of yourself. You may be taking on a new role.



Movie

To dream that you are watching a movie, suggests that you are watching life pass you by. Perhaps you are living vicariously through the actions of others.  Consider also how the movie parallels to situations in your waking life. Observe how the characters relate to you and how they may represent an aspect of yourself.

It's easier if you interpret your dream into symbols so go to this site. It's very helpful.

To put it bluntly, if you're not into women, but could be, an Indian chick would be one of the best ways of starting. They have a long ancient history of being very skilled at pleasing a man.

That you defended her and cussed out the customers would probably have impressed her.

Why were the theaters not showing any movies? because the date wasn't about watching a movie, at least not for her. That's why when you finally found a movie, there was nothing on the screen. She didn't want no movie.

What do you honestly think about...?



For the last week almost every night i've been having horrible dreams of my boyfriend. In the dreams he couldn't seem to care less about me, is very ignorant to me, and is very miserable.



Im confused because in "real" life things are going REALLY great with us. We did get into an argument about a month ago and when he got into that argument he was sorta acting like he was in my dream. But the fight was a month ago and these dreams have been just lately when things are now great.



Can someone tell me what having dreams like this could be?



Thanks so much in advance!

BTW- There is also alot of heavy rain, dark skies, and thunder and lighting in these dreams. There's always this HUGE storm

I believe this is more a fear or insecurity you have about the relationship, instead of something that is actually going to happen. When you are in a great relationship, many people worry that something could go wrong. I would pay this dream no mind, because if your relationship is going well then you have nothing to worry about :)

Dark skies and thunderstorms are just "setting the mood", so to speak. I think our subconcious can be overly dramatic at times, but it's just trying to make a statement. If storms are scary for you or symbolize something bad happening, that's why they're there.

I bet your heart must have almost stopped, though, when you got into the fight, if you were having these dreams before then. I'm sorry :(

For ME i would think it would be your subconscious mind. Things ARE going great you say and i assume you want them to stay that way SOOO bad that your subconscious is worried because you don't ever want that happiness to end, so it plays out in your dream.

I find that happens with me all the time. My worries and my fears effect my dreams. Even if its the opposite in real life.

A strong figure in your life (represented by the tree) has been hurt by some harsh words are an argument. You know everything is going to be okay ( represented by the sunny and beautiful) it will just take a little cleaning up.

Ok, first, in the dream at least, your girlfriend is dumping you. She sends you to go get your hat out of her house (you can't "hang your hat" there anymore) then you see the guy she's replacing you with.

To explain the next bit, you have to consider how in modern society, you can't just legally kick the living hell out of a guy for stealing your girl. It's crazy but there it is...

So because he's legally protected the guy laughs at you. "What are you gonna do?" kind of. But of course you still have to process the violent reaction that has been part of the human male since the caveman. That's the transformation to the movie.

So the fight you actually have in the movie, that is a sign of the no-win situation that you're in. Your inner caveman wants to fight the guy to the death and take back your woman. But the real world, that's the guy who you're fighting in the dream, has got your number, even if you kill the guy and take back your woman they will send you to the pen where you'll run into people who might try to stab you, and who want to fight you all the time.

What does it mean... there is a chance, I won't say for sure but maybe she's already gone and got herself another dude, in which case the dream is a warning to control your inner caveman cause the law will kick your butt then thank you for the pleasure.

Or else it's just a paranoia dream, revealing to you that you have trust issues with your girlfriend (and what man doesn't when you're not allowed to beat up the guy she cheats with? j/k)

I think deep down you are insecure. You are worried that your girlfriend may not be faithful & honest with you. You love her so much though that you would fight to keep her, & away from other men.



Unless you have any evidence to suggest that your girl has slept around behind your back, you need to keep check of your jealousy & insecurities because if she decides to leave you for it, no amount of fighting will win her back. X

I have been able to recreate dreams before.  One time I went back to a dream the next night and picked up where I left off the previous night.  If you have a strong will and desire, you can do this.  Tell yourself you want to go back to that dream because_____.  If there is some unfinished business, your sub conscious just might let you.
Good luck.

ok, it was one of those dreams that you had before.------ me an d my brother are living at our old apartment complex so then i say lets go find some odd jobs to do. =]]] so then somehow, even though he's 14, he drives us to a lake. when we get there, a lot of people show up. but me and my brother have already been to  this lake before and discovers a secret place in the back. somehow it changed though, but there was our old house with a fountain in the back. the fountain was on the place where we buried our pets that diedddd. so then everyone comes to our "seecret spot" and starts looking at the fountain. it turns out someone was buried there (not in real life) and me and my brother knew about it for,,,, 2 years i think. so then everyone wants t o have a proper burial for the little girl buried there. so then we go  to a big factory and get food ready, get people to come, and other stuff. thing is, even though its not real, i feel guilty for not telling anyone that she was buried there... what does this mean?
