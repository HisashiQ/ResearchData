Emerging Markets are smaller countries that have a better prospects of growth.  With that growth also comes risk.

A Global Emerging market fund could put you into anything from a Chinese or Russian Energy company to an African diamond mine.

There are some funds which are more specific (like a BRIC fund, meaning Brazil Russia India China) or regional funds like a Southeast Asia fund.

Simply put, Emerging Market funds are riskier funds that are investing in markets and securities that are up and coming.
Good Luck.
P.S.  You can always check the prospectus or the holdings of a fund to see exactly what stocks or other securities that the fund holds.  This will give you a better idea of what you are investing in.

The EEM is an etf that trades these. 
GLOBAL means that the countries are all over the world.
Brazil, China, S Korea, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, India, and many others.

The world is in a slow down now, so it might be too late or too early to invest in these. But when the world's economy improves, these stock markets tend to outperform because their growth is so strong.

No. The volume is the days volume at that time or total volume over the day. The figure you are looking for is market cap divided by share price= number of shares in issue.

You can buy and sell stock online through an online discount broker.  The service is not free, but most discount brokers are relatively cheap.  I currently use Firstrade ( http://www.firstrade.com/ ).  They are cheaper than the big name brokers like Scottrade, Etrade, Ameritrade, and Schwab.  There is one broker that offers free trades, but there's some fine print that comes with that.  Zecco offers 10 free trades per month, but you are required to deposit at least $2,500.  Customer service there is horrible and their website is not too great either.  But I guess you get what you pay for.

Or is there more to come?



I saw a programme today, saying that each time they lend money, they take out a kind of insurance with a hedge fund.



But that the hedge funds are under such pressure for the increased amount of claims, that they may default.



What do you think?

Much will depend on the time horizon you are looking at. In the short term, consensus is felt that the markets are not through the worst and that in the UK we might see the FTSE 100 fall below 5000. So many managers and investors have higher levels of cash holdings than they would normally. The most popular areas have been commodities and emerging markets – however, these by nature more risky and I would urge caution.



Over the medium term to longer term, there is general consensus that far east and emerging markets will continue to grow at a higher rate than US or UK economies and that investors should be looking to increase their exposure to these areas especially to China and India.

The reason you're even asking the question is on account of all the promotion re forex trading. IMO, forex is just another commodity. It doesn't stand out. And forex is no easier to make money at than any other commodity.

Forex trading might be profitable as long as you do some learning beforehand. I'm, personally, not a big fan of forex (somebody already metioned it that it's just one of many available markets). I use financial spread betting as wit spread betting you could deal with currencies, shares, commodities, indices and more. Check out http://www.independentinvestor.co.uk , they compare lots of spread betting and CFDs accounts. Some of them are actually cheaper than forex.
Good luck and don't forget to do some learning and research before any deals.

As in any type of investment, one needs to practice due diligence before putting in hard earned money.

7 out of 10 online forex brokers are legit and help people participate in this huge market. What you need to look for are firms that have been around for some time and are more than adequately capitalized. As you know, goverment regulators are strict with these firms and require them to have a capital threshold or they will be shut down.

There is an online traders forum that rates these brokers--http://elitetrader.com/br

One of the highly recommended brokers in that thread is OANDA, averaging 4 stars with over 85 ratings.

Trading Forex online is legitimate.  I make my living partly on trading forex for myself.

When there's money, there will always be scams for people who are not aware.  Scams can be in the form of fly by night brokers who run away with your money or others schemes you put your money into.



It is up to you to weigh all the factors and risk when you put your money somewhere.  It also happens in forex or stock trading outside the internet.

I RESPECTFULLY disagree with the previous responder.

JL is still valuable today. He was a trader and simply believed he wanted a stock to move potentially a certain amount in a certain direction.  He is suggesting that a stock must move 10 dollars per share.

His statement about 3 or 4 points is a statement about having a stop loss point and getting out of a stock when it moves against you. Some people might use a percentage loss, some an absolute number of points.

JL is in tune with charts, thus his tips you've cited, and thus my disagreement with the first responder, whom I feel is legitimate, but who has an alternate approach in that he is more concerned with what is called "value investing."

A value investor--a follower of Ben Graham-- today would probably be buying like mad, since the current market is priced at bargain prices. If you can sit for months, perhaps years, on a losing investment, this may work fine.

One of JL's principles that I think is particular worthy--he stated that one of the best qualities of a speculator is simply the ability to sit and wait. One should have a feel for when to act and when to just sit things out.

When reading JL, note that he went broke trading at least once in his life. His is a cautionary tale. And cautionary tales are what you need under your belt when trying to understand the markets.

Buy stock in a company whose products you use (look in your refrigerator and cupboards for ideas).  That way, you have a natural interest in the company and you are somewhat intuitively aware of how strong the company is.  Shares in a company can be bought and sold.  There is a fee attached to both buying and selling - look at various brokerage sites to see how much they charge (search 'brokerage sites' ?).  Companies can go out of business or be bought by other companies, so, no, shares do not necessarily last forever.  If you want to invest in the stock market you must do some work - regularly - to keep up with what you own.  Be aware that the stock market goes up AND down.  The most stable companies don't move a lot in either direction, but when the whole market is tanking, most stocks will go down with it and vice-versa.  It's easy to open a trading account online, but you can also go to a broker in person.  Your investments should always be Your Decision!!  It's your money and you worked hard for it, get a clue before you start.

You do not have enough to start trading, and without a decent amount of understanding of the market, you would almost certainly be loser. Forget it for now; do some research, then pick out a few shares, (without actually buying them), and track their progress. It is easier to make gains in a rising market, which is not the case at the moment.

OK, so you want to start buying stocks in the shortest, easiest definition possible:

The first step:

First step is obviously picking the right stock. In order to do this, you will need to learn Fundemental Analysis. You can start here:
http://www.investopedia.com/university/f...

Fundemantal analysis is basically helps you find good companies that are currenty out-of-favor with the market. In other words, good companies that are currently undervalued and under priced. You are expecting that their financial statements are healthy enough to increase their current low price and make future earnings.



Step 2:

Work on your personal finance and determine how many shares you want to own. Determine your time frame. Are you in this for the long-term? Short term? 1-5 years is considered relatively short. Time frame is important because it will help you manage your portfolio better. Develope a strategy by slowly educating yourself on how to and when to enter, manage your share counts, portfolios and learn how to diversify.

Step 3:

Check out all the discount brokers on the internet. Tdameritrade.com, e-trade.com and many, many others. They offer different fees and different services, but all of which will allow you to pick-and-choose the stocks you want to buy.

There is a lot more to buying stocks, but I hope this helps gets you started. Email me if you need any help. Good luck!

There are a number of things to consider before you invest your hard earned money--your risk appetite, your present financial situation, and future cash flow expectations.

Try to consult with an independent financial advisor to find an investment that suits your needs.

So basically I need a brokerage to be able to buy in?
Thank Mr Matian for all the book recommendations - definitely sounds like a good idea to do some more research before I start throwing my money away.
I wish I could give you all 10 points!

Microsoft is a Blue-Chip. A Blue-Chip is a stock which is very well established and has relatively stable earnings. So in that case, if you are more risk averse, then I would say purchasing a stock in Microsoft.

Of course that isn't my opinion at all. If I were in your position, I would purchase some books on investment vehicles and start from there. Once you escalate yourself up, practice on something called a Stock Simulator which is simply put, a application or online feature which allows you to invest in stocks without actually doing it for real (more like a game).



Books I recommend:
- Rich Dad Poor Dad is the very first I recommend. That's what got me to acknowledge the foundations of investments. 
- 5 successful tips for stock investing by Morningstar Inc
- Stock Investing for Dummies
- Real Estate for Beginners
- Mutual Funds for Dummies
- And the granddaddy of them all, The Intelligent Investor.
You can find the books on your local book retailer or a site like Amazon. A great stock simulator I would recommend is that of Investopedia's: http://simulator.investopedia.com/home.a...

Once you feel pretty confident that you know a thing or two about the investment vehicle you'll be primarily going into, then it is safe to invest (for real). You wouldn't walk in the motorway blindfolded so why do that with your money?

Hey Hm,
First, congrats on starting your investing career! I think you should start by studying discount brokerages (you'll need a place to trade) and strategies (choose one that is in-line with you think your investing style will be and your risk tolerance). Most beginners are pretty aggressive, and there's nothing wrong with that as long as you choose a strategy with long-term potential.



To choose a brokerage, I would start at http://www.money-and-investing.com/Share... You can read detailed reviews on 12 major brokerages. I'd suggest Scottrade since they have some nice trading tools, great prices and cater to beginners.

To choose an investing strategy, start at http://www.money-and-investing.com/Stock... This is an introduction to 8 of today's most popular investing strategies. You'll get to learn the major goals, investment selection methods, strengths, weaknesses, risks, and long-term outlook for each.

Good luck to you, Hm, and post back here often so we can watch your progress! It's fun to watch someone on their wealth-building journey.

Cheers,
Odd Lot

Much will depend on the time horizon you are looking at. In the short term, consensus is felt that the markets are not through the worst and that in the UK we might see the FTSE 100 fall below 5000. So many managers and investors have higher levels of cash holdings than they would normally. The most popular areas have been commodities and emerging markets – however, these by nature more risky and I would urge caution.



Over the medium term to longer term, there is general consensus that far east and emerging markets will continue to grow at a higher rate than US or UK economies and that investors should be looking to increase their exposure to these areas especially to China and India.

Hi Why not invest a bit of it in an on line business so you got regular cash coming in rather than one big splash out .

For example you could have an automated estore that makes you money even while you sleep.

http://www.softe4u.com/estore/

Or why not have a web site that makes you cash from advertising.
Google pays out millions every month to sites that show their adverts.

http://www.softe4u.com/portal/rs1/

Or invest in yourself with a self improvement programme that unlocks the secrets on how to become rich .

Thats completely based on what type of laptop you want.  Do you want a gaming laptop, a word processing laptop, a laptop for programming games or other programs?  Alienware makes very nice gaming laptops although they can be a little expensive, dell makes nice all-around laptops, most websites also allow you to customize your laptop, if you want a gaming laptop Nvidia Geforce video cards are the best to go with in my opinion, also you are going to want a processor that can keep up and lots of ram, if you are just want basic functions then any run of the mill laptop is fine.  TigerDirect.com or Newegg.com are great websites for setting up a laptop because they tend to be completely customized computers.  They both also offer support if you get lost and aren't sure what you are purchasing.  In the end its all up to you though and how how much you are willing to spend.

When Kuwait was invaded by Iraq, those who had the foresight to buy Kuwaiti currency before the US forced Iraq's army to exit made incredible multiples on their investment. This causes others to consider - wisely - if the same pattern would appear again, would the net result be as profitable?. A lot will depend on the strength, pace and economic impact (positive or negative) of the transition. Because of the slow, high-risk transition of governments to their own full autonomy, this speculation might pay off, but you also run the risk of the currency being devalued, replaced or rebased. The Kuwaiti episode paid off because of the abrupt speed, surprise and finality of the situation. I doubt the same opportunity will arise with Iraq - but, if you can afford to lose the funds with which you're speculating... only time will tell.  I would not get involved with this.  There are too many better opportunities to invest your money.

Have a word with Malcolm Glazer. He owns them.

It is not a question of 'where will it let me buy shares'
Shares are owned by people or institutions. If the company is listed on a stock exchange, you buy and sell through that exchange through a conventional or an online broker.If the company is privately owned (not listed) then you would have to approach the shareholders yourself . Obviously a private company does not want a long list of small shareholders therefore it is not possible to buy small amounts. If you were interested in buying a stake in Manchester United and maybe also have something to offer the club then possibly you have a chance.

How would you invest 1 million pounds?



I know what you would "buy" but I'm interested on what you would invest in to generate more money.

Bonds, savings account? Maybe open a business, maybe an idea? Thanks.

Having just moved back from france I would suggest investing in fine wines. I have seen wine that was bought in 2005 sell for 3 times it's price this year. I have some excellent connections for fine wines if your interested. I know what you think 1 million invested sounds like alot of cases of wine but it could be as little as 50 cases.

if i wanted income: corporate paper until interest rates start heading up a bit, then TIPS (the TIPS yield is actually NEGATIVE right now!), and re-invest the CPI part of the coupon.

if i wanted capital appreciation, i'd probably just throw it into a broad-market indexed ETF.  in 50 years, the etf would be worth about 150 million pounds (@ 10.5%, the historical average of the S&P500), which would make for a nice retirement/inheritance.

With that amount of money, it would be best if you first consulted with an independent financial advisor. Anybody's financial circumstances are always dramatically changed by a million pounds. In order to have that much money working to provide for you in the future, you need to have a diversified portfolio.

Good luck with your efforts!

Save it buddy; you never know when you might need a LOT of money, and that $300 will help. Of course, if you come up with something you'd really like, you have that $100 saved already.... by the way, I'm impressed with someone your age saving $400; how did you do it?

If it's burning a hole in your pocket, I suggest a digital camera. The FujiFilm FinePix f45fd is a great camera around $160 and works just as good as the $300 cameras.

If you don't need anything, and there isn't something you want a lot that you've been saving for, then save more of it than $100 - then later on when you really want or need something you'll have the money to buy it.

Well, it depends on what you like. you have several options.

1. Save it. You could possibly want something in the future that you need that money for.

2. Blow it. If you have had your eye on a expensive item, like a video game system or something, you could spend it all at once.

3. Spread it. If you have a lot of hobbies and you want to get new stuff, you could spend $20 here, $5 there, and spread it out. You could end up saving more than $100 this way.

This question is very broad, but I suggest that the term "unrestricted market " refers to one positive aspect of "globalisation" which helps to remove the barriers for smaller poorer nations to invest in and trade with more "developed" countries in other parts of the world. This in turn stimulates international trade and aims to promote a system of fair trade--sometimes successful and sometimes not!

why? you would have to refine it into gasoline and do all sorts of stuff. it is useless straight from the barrel unless you are stockpiling them for some odd reason. I would rather buy solar panels and get myself off of the grid

No i wouldn't buy a BARREL of oil. I would, however, buy 150,000 barrels of oil @ $80 per barrel* and sell it back at $115 tomorrow BEFORE the market crashes completely.



Source(s):



my special rate is $80 per barrel. since i can get it at that price, as far as i am concerned THAT is the real price. Y'all can buy it from me at the NYMEX or ICE price of $115 if you feel so silly.

No. It just means 74% of the shares are owned by Institutions and the rest by individuals and directors (non-institutional). If the institutions are sellers then you could buy that 74%
You would normally expect institutions to be relatively firm holders and if one institution wanted to sell, their holding would, by choice be placed with another institution.

Preference Shares will outrank ordinary shareholders (most common type of shares) should a company wind up. They carry no voting rights usually and also allow a preference in dividend payments should one be paid. These would usually cost more than ordinary shares due to better “guarantees”.

Bond holders would get paid out firstly and thereby offer greater security although capital is still at risk. These would produce income by ways of coupons (interest) and also chance for capital growth.

Why is an increase in tax due to inflation an additional burden?



I get that when inflation occurs, accounting profits of businesses tend to be exaggerated and that although it shows that they are earning a lot nominally, they are in fact earning nothing

And I know that an increased reported profit results in increased taxation

But I don't get why increased taxation is an additional burden, because then shouldn't the real value of the tax be constant, as only the nominal value increases? If the increase in nominal profit is worth nothing because of infl., then shudnt the increase in tax also be worth nothing?

thanks so much guys



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



When inflation occurs, the value of each dollar as a store of value declines.  So any cash assets decline in value.

Also there is "bracket creep".  For an individual who was in the 10 percent tax bracket before inflation, increased nominal income due to inflation (but no change in real income) could put him/her in the 12 percent tax bracket.  This is 2 percent more tax and no more real income.

Since you haven't mentioned the interest compounding period, the maturity amount with interest would vary under different interest compounding periods.

However, your investment of Rs. 2,000/= per month for 5 years (60 months) @ 8% would get you the following amount at the end of 5 years:

With Monthly Interest Compounding: Rs. 1,47,933.40
With Quarterly Interest Compounding: Rs. 1,47,723.73
With Half-Yrly Interest Compounding: Rs. 1,47,416.68
With Yearly Interest Compounding: Rs. 1,46, 827.96

Not the most thrilling - put it in your pension find (you have got a pension fund, haven't you? If not start one, it is never too soon.)  That way you can claim even more back from the Taxman cos he'll have to pay back the tax on that amount to your fund.



People think their home is their most significant purchase - the reality is that it should be a pension fund if you are going to be able to afford to do stuff like go on holiday, when you finally have the time to do it.

I was just wanting to know, I've recently bought two metal bars as an investment, do you think I made the right move?

I bought a .999 pure silver buffalo bar for £12.51 (if you include postage and packing), aswell as a 2009 .999 fine copper maple leaf bar for £7.16 (including postage and packing).

Both bars are 1 troy oz.

Do you think I've made the right move? And what are the prices of silver and copper at the moment, if anyone knows?

Thanks alot.

One troy ounce of silver on the spot market Aug. 4. = 8.64 GBP
One troy ounce of copper, spot price = 0.11 GBP

If you bought these as a bet on the price of the silver or copper, they are probably not good investments.
They may have some collector value, but based on the metal content and current spot prices, there are better ways to make investments in metals.  Sorry for the bad news.

All jobs do not offer direct deposit.  It's not only major chains though, it's based on the company and where they bank.  Some banks charge employers fees for direct deposit if they don't have a certain number of employees so if really depends on each individual employer.

Of course not. Even the best minds are 50/50 on whether we'll avoid this one (by the skin of our teeth) or engage it.



The events of the last 6 months have illustrated well that the "decoupling" theory was prematurely identified.  The world is not there yet.  However, the commodity volatility demonstrates more than anything the fallacy of believing any one thing/person/group is "in control".  That view will cost you money in the long run.

Is gold a good investment at the moment?



From what I've read it will most likely stay at about the same rate as inflation so for a long term investment, is gold the best way to go?



</question>



<additional details>



I'm thinking more in terms of low risk saving. Say I have £5000 and put it into a bank, in 10 years time inflation would mean this amount won't be as much. Gold on the other hand will go with inflation so I will have the equivalent amount in 10 years time rather than £5000 which will be the equivalent of say £4000. Investing to make a profit seems risky to me so if I just have some gold set aside for emergencies then would this not be the best option?

Hello,

(ANS) Its a well known & recognized fact that Gold Metal holds its price unlike any other commodity (substance) and this is especially true in times of economic turmoil, chaos, crisis or war. Everything else financially may be going up, down, sideways or stagnate but gold ALWAYS holds its value no matter what.



**NOTE: If this wasn't true why else would the British Government & the Bank of England have several massive basement rooms stacked floor to ceiling with solid gold bars i.e. Millions of £ in pure gold. The UK has a Gold Reserve its especially to guard against economic hard times or chaos.

**I think the current gold price is £1,000 an ounce at the moment. This is a the highest its been for several decades and shows no signs of falling at present. So gold is seen as a good investment still.

**The more the chaos & turmoil the higher the gold price goes.

Ivan.

I wouldn't recommend putting all your money in gold as it is
a) less liquid than a cash account.
b) you lose money to buy and sell it.

That being said putting some money in it is not a bad idea even with a hyper conservative investing approach like you are talking about you can still diversify with Bonds, Gold, Money Market.  etc.

I'd say that at the present time silver is a better investment than gold.  Because silver prices have recently gone down a lot more than gold prices.  And now you can buy silver for a much better price than you can buy gold.



I'm not sure if inflation will be a big problem during the next 10 years.  But the economy probably will have some serious trouble for a long time.  And during such times people often put some of their savings into precious metals, including silver.  The price of silver probably will go up substantially during the next few years.  Although there is no guarantee that this will happen.

Gold is not an investment as such, but as you have surmised, it will hold it's value well during times of inflation.  I think it is an excellent long term investment.  If you want to physically hold gold, visit a local coin shop, and tell them you are interested in Krugerrands, Maples, or Pandas, all examples of "bullion" coins, valuable because of their metal content, rather than their rarity.

Your question should have been this:

"What should I do so that the value of my money can keep up with, and even do better than inflation?"

In hindsight, anyone can say that gold went up (or down) by this much, hence they think it will do the same in the future. No one knows what the market will do next.

Not one asset class can guarantee a good return over time. You might want to diversify and allocate part of your portfolio to different assets, or find a money manager you can trust.

Good luck!

I would be curious to know the answer myself.  I assume the reason might be because it had dropped so much during the past 5 years.  Perhaps now that GWB is going to be put out to pasture, there is some slight hope that the next administration might be an improvement.  Hope springs eternal.

It is that the problems of the American are more transparent then the problems of other countries. There are plenty of countries in more financial trouble than the US. It is said that the European Banks are in for a shakedown. The transparency of the American economy is why the dollar is strengthening.

grysmn is probably right.  In addition real GDP was up 3.3 percent in the second quarter compared to 0.9 percent in the first quarter.  And falling oil prices means lower inflation..  Both of those should have a positive affect on the dollar.

This is because the debts US borrow majority are from other countries especially from China and Japan.
When US banks go bankrupt, all debts due to these countries no longer need to be paid but the assets when under these banks will be taking over by US companies. Therefore US financial crisis will be transferred to other countries which put their money to US banking system.
As a result US dollar will be strengthen because other countries (money burned in US "financial crisis") will be actually suffered in these intended financial crisis not US.
Hopefully, these countries will learned their lesson and rethink how to set their own new rules and regulations in this global financial games to protect their rights and assets. Not just follow whatever US set. 
To ensure a fair games, all players must participate in setting-up rules and regulations of the games. If the existing game is unfair, create new games, new rules, invite other players.....

It's £35,000 {see link}, but I agree with DB. The Lloyds merger/takeover seems to have stopped the share slump and it is apparently well capitalised, so it should be OK.

I believe it is not going bust. The huge share price movement is caused by short selling by hedge fund managers not by bad fundamentals (e.g., no money.)

If it did go bust then you can receive compensation from the FSCS for the first £35000 of deposits. But this is per person, per organisation so if Lloyds TSB and HBOS merge you might need to move funds somewhere else to get maximum insurance.

Halifax is not, and never was, going bankrupt (and nor is its parent company HBOS plc). In any case, as others have said, individual savers are covered by government guarantees up to £35,000.

What happened was that because falling property values mean mortgages are riskier than they used to be, and the Halifax is Britain's biggest mortgage lender, so Halifax is seen as a riskier investment and may have to pay more to borrow in future - even though it had about £4 billion cash in the bank - and some people sold shares on that basis.

Then the hedge funds smelt blood as prices fell. They short-sold HBOS in the hope that they could undermine the company sufficiently that they could buy shares back more cheaply. This tactic worked so well that it became impossible for HBOS to continue to exist as a separate company, and Lloyds TSB has stepped in to buy it.

Having succeeded in this case, the hedge funds will move on in the search for fresh meat, fresh profits to be made from the misfortune of others. Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester will probably not survive as separate companies. Abbey, Woolwich and C&G have already been swallowed up, of course.

When the banks have been butchered, they will move on, probably to insurance companies (as with AIG in the USA). They will continue to rake in millions and small investors will be wiped out.

As I've said, savers in the Halifax will not lose out. Investors such as myself, however, will. A year or so ago I owned shares in the Halifax worth about £6,000. I'd be happy to come out of this with £1,000 :-(

In "good" to "fine" condition the average price a collector would pay is about $2.50 to $3.00. In "uncirculated" condition the bill would be worth about $18.00.

If the serial number of the bill includes a star the bill will be worth more, maybe two or three times as much, particularly if the bill is in "extraordinarily fine" condition or better.

Safety is the key.



Amounts under £35,000 are guranteed  by the UK Government in the event of failure; this is all the UK Banks and Building Societies.  One should always have an element of suspicion for non uk Deposit Taking Bodies operating here.
At the present time, a safe realistic rate to get is 6.5 to 7% and you would be advised to save it in a Fixed Term Bond for 1, 2 or 3 years.
I therefore suggest that you try one of these; Co-operative Bank plc, Nationwide Building Society although there are others with similar rates. Just tap these names into your search engine for their websites.
If you have no need for the funds in the longer term then you can consider £3,600 in a Cash Isa which gives tax free interest and can be increased by this amount each year.
Outside of the above if you would like to venture into the area of capital gain with a good interest (yield) rate then how about buying Barclays Bank shares?



The Bank's are out of favour at the present time which is a good time to buy; the low price results in the higher yield.  In 3/4 years time when the economy is more buoyant you can elect to sell or continue to receive the higher yield.



It is however usual to spread your money when investing in the stock market.  Again you could spread more widely in the safer area on Unit Trusts.

£12,000 takes a long time to save so don't spend it;

I would think that the pound and the dollar have peaked. The FED and the Bank of England have so far hold their interest rate unchanged. I'll be more optimistic to predict that their values may move upwards. Both countries are importers of good and services with inflationary concerns. Strong currencies can ease inflationary pressures.

Given that the US will have a new President (and new hope?) sooner than the UK will get the chance to elect a more competent government, I see the pound falling further.
By the way, I don't see much hope in the other parties. The Tories seem full of college boys with little experience of life outside of politics, the Lib Dems talk some sense, but are too pro European Union and stand little chance of winning power under the current electoral system. But at least both of these parties are pledged to scrap the ID card and database system.
Sorry about the political rant!

When investors buy stocks they are buying shares in individual companies--hence the phrase the Stock Market. You take your money and buy shares in XYZ company in the belief that the value of the company will rise and so too will the value of your holding. The converse also applies, a falling value company sometimes becomes unattractive to  invest in but not always so--businesses and economies are cyclical and hence values of stock goes up and comes down --the art is being able to buy when stock is out of favour and sell when its value is on upward momentum.

Buying commodities is a high risk investment strategy--whereby investors buy either directly or more usually indirectly into such things as nickel, platinum or oil or wheat. The demand/supply chain has a huge impact and influence on price and consequently the gains and losses investors make in this sector.

<question>



Are you an experienced financial markets investor, broker or trader who can generously help me?



Provided you have a little bit of spare time to share with me and to thoroughly explain to me how I could start making money from a minimum investment into the stock markets, I would greatly appreciate it if you could reply to this posting and also enable me to email you back with any of my crucial or key questions whose answers would ensure my complete understanding of all your guidance and instructions related to the matter.
Some questions:
How to recognise an opportunity of making money on the stock markets?
How to effectively read the financial reports of companies' shares prices and indices and properly utilise it before making a decision of either buying or selling? In other words, when to buy, when to sell and when to put a stop order?
Can I hire anybody to do the whole process for me from day 1 until closing a profitable trading deal?
In terms of buying or selling shares, how to recognise or what kind of companies I should look out for in order to either buy or sell their shares?
What is the simplest or easiest way of speculating or trading on the oscillations of major foreign currencies for me as a beginner?
Apart from the Financial Times and Yahoo! Finance, what are the other sources of updated finacial markets information and knowledge that you could warmly refer me to?
If I have missed to ask anything else, I would greatly appreciate it if you could add or emphasise it in favour of my final profit success from speculating on the financial markets.

Many thanks in advance and God bless you.

You are asking people who have to make a living from giving clients advice to spend time answering your questions and giving you free advice. Does that seem to be an imposition on your part? There is a place called a library. There are several volumes in the section named " Investing ". Go through those and find the answers you are seeking. You will be better informed. You will learn the basics of evaluating investments. Then put your money where your knowledge is.

Let me answer your questions one by one:

- How to recognise an opportunity of making money on the stock markets?

some people use fundamental analysis, others use technical analysis, a few more rely on other's advice and a select few rely on their "gut feel." You need to invest time and resources to learn any of the above methods. You can learn them from books, websites, and more importantly, by learning from experience.

- How to effectively read the financial reports of companies' shares prices and indices and properly utilise it before making a decision of either buying or selling? In other words, when to buy, when to sell and when to put a stop order?

You can use indicators, support and resistance to tell you when to buy and when to sell. There is not one perfect method. Some of the profitable traders I know, only 40% of their trades are winners. The key is to limit your losses to no more than 1% of your trading capital.

- Can I hire anybody to do the whole process for me from day 1 until closing a profitable trading deal?

I'm not sure what you mean here--are you asking if you can find someone you can pay to tell you when to buy and when to sell? If so, google "trading signals". These are professionals who issue buy and sell recommendations. Some are good, a lot more are not that good. If you are going to get trading signals, you are going to have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince.

In terms of buying or selling shares, how to recognise or what kind of companies I should look out for in order to either buy or sell their shares?

It depends on what kind of trader you are. I trade volatility breakouts and momentum. Naturally, I look for stocks showing either decreasing volatility, or stocks that are starting to gain momentum.



If you are a fundamental investor, read up on financial reports and find a stock that's "undervalued."

What is the simplest or easiest way of speculating or trading on the oscillations of major foreign currencies for me as a beginner?

There is no easy way to speculate in foreign currencies. You have to learn as you go. Pick a trading method that you are comfortable with and learn/finetune that method each trading day.

Apart from the Financial Times and Yahoo! Finance, what are the other sources of updated finacial markets information and knowledge that you could warmly refer me to?

The only times I read on financial news is when I want to know why the market behaved as it did the day before. Those two you mentioned are good sources of information. If you need more, you can always google it up.

Feel free to contact me if you need more help in these matters.

Good luck!
Jim

1. There're many other financial markets information sites. One of the best one is obviously http://www.bloomberg.com. http://www.reuters.com is also very good. There're smaller and niche websites as well. Not a big fan of foo.co.uk as it's for fools (name says it all).
2. There are many to invest in the UK. Financial spread betting, cfd, share dealing. If you're not sure how they work then visit http://www.independentinvestor.co.uk they explain the different investment vehicles and you could book free investment seminars from big companies like CityIndex and CMC markets.

Shares are contracts so you must be 18.

It can cost £15 for each transaction (before commission of there is any) and so if you only have a small fund it is very hard to make profit!

Example: $1000 Fund
VMED (Virgin Media) = $9.26
Transaction cost = $25 approx
Available = $950
Shares bought = 102

To break even the share price must rise 5%

Were you happy with the way your IRA accounts were invested? Was the growth to your liking? Now, you hit a bump in the road and you want to jump off the truck? If you are not of retirement age just buy more for each increment you put into the IRAs. If you are about to retire don't panic. Just buy more for your contribution. There has to be faith in the system. Do you think credit unions will do better ? Forget savings banks unless you are happy with 1/2 of 1 % return.

The safest way would be through the High Street Banks, but because it is safe, the interest rate will be lower. For best rates check out the website below for the latest deals.

If you want more interest on your money, you will have to take a higher risk and it is best to seek the opinion of an independent financial adviser (so not a bank). What you pay in charges, you will doubtless get back easily within a few months.

You can't. Not at the moment. 15k will get some shares, but they won't rise fast enough for you to get rich. Property USED to be the money-maker in the U.K. but not anymore.
The best thing to do is keep it and wait. Wait until there is a real thing to invest in. Banks, Oil and Tesco never lose money. Just not enough.

The interest is calculated daily or monthly but paid annually so you won’t lose out any interest.

Its dangerous to buy shares at the moment. 
If you want though you can buy they online, its cheaper than goin to a broker, yahoo has a link on there homepage where they sell shares



I recommend you practice on this www.bullbearings.co.uk

P.S avoid banks and insurance firms, and airlines. Buying in new business ventures might be risky as well. Check out a company called lonmin and tullow oil, gold oil as well.

Why bring Bush into this mess, the failure of the mortgage business rest solely on the back of the Democrates since both Fannie & Freddie are products of the Democratic party.

Under Clinton, Congress dictated that the banks must provide mortgages for any one who wants one and there should be no discrimination and that Freddie & Fannie will guarantee the paper.  The CEOs of both organizations are not advisors to Obama.

The dollar is having problems mostly due to the oil industry, an industry that the democrates do not want to increase production to prevent the US from paying forgein nations.
And since the oil industry makes 8% profit after taxes, Obama wants to take more away from them.

If you think it's bad now, wait for Obama, it will get much worse.

BB's are basically the biggest firms on Wall St.

The term comes from M&A advertisements.  The names of the large firms that handled most of the underwriting for an offering would be printed larger, and higher up on the page than the other firms.  This part of the advertisement was called the "Bulge Bracket," and the word came to be synonymous with those firms.

There used to be fairly strict rules about which firms were even eligible to run an underwriting, and how much each of the various firms was allowed to participate in the placement process.  It's not quite as strict anymore, but the legacy has largely continued as a gentleman's agreement.

I recently sold my house and now have about £190,000 in a sainsburys savings account until I buy another house which is not likely to be for at least a year.  I know the compensation scheme only pays up to £35,000 for each bank you have savings with - am I ok to leave the money with sainsburys or should I split it between 6 different accounts to be on the safe side?  i'm in the UK

Split up into £35,000 slices.



Also be careful you don't inadvertently ruin the protection as some organisations share the same banking license and therefore you only get one lot of protection.  For example RBS, Saga, Birmingham Midshires are all on the same license so only 1 x £35k between all of them is protected!!!!!!

If you do decide to split it up then make sure you have it in different banks.
The Halifax is part of Royal bank of Scotland so if you were to put £35,000 in each...you can only make a claim once from the parent company ie:- the royal bank of scotland and NOT on both accounts.

I would say to go ahead and split it for now. Six isnt too many to keep track of as long as you dont lose anything or too much when you take it out. Mine is all in stock, so I would lose too much if I took it out now. But in a savings type account, it shouldnt matter unless you have a penalty to take it out. If there is a total collapse of the world economy, it might not matter what we do. I think we are just on a rough road for awhile, hang in there and dont worry, we have done this before. Spend less than you make and dont go too far in debt.

A financial advisor is someone who can advice you on financial products (eg investments , life assurance) and guide you in terms of your financial options. There are two main types – independent financial advisers (IFAs) can advice you on products from whole of the market and tied advisers can usually provide you with access to products from one or several companies. All UK based advisers need to be suitably qualifed and regulated by the Financial services Authority (FSA).

The government is bailing out these financial institutions is because of the immense counter party effects that these financial institutions have on the economy.

Banks lend money to corporations and they also borrow money from corporations.

From 2 perspectives
1) Creditors of the banks (corporations that loan money to banks)
2) Debtors of the banks (corporations that borrow money from banks)

From 1) if bear stearns collapses, the creditors claim on the bank will be worthless and this means that many companies that lent money to Bear Stearns will have to report massive write offs of their financial assets due to bear stearns collapse.

From 2) Corporations that need to borrow money from banks, the collapse of bear stearns sets off a panic situation where other banks see it as a bad sign and will start to preserve their capital thus for corporations that need money, it will be very difficult to obtain capital from capital holders such as the other banks. And this would cause the economy to fail as corporations cannot obtain capital to expand operations (for example)

Also when bear stearn collapses, the assets of bear stearns will sell at fire sale prices and often the assets held by bear stearns will be similar to assets held by the other banks. So if the assets are being sold at very low prices, this also affects the assets held by other banks, the mark to market mechanism requires them to record their value at the latest transaction prices.



So this domino effect of these organisations failing have very serious repercussions throughout the whole economy, thus the government sees that it is required to bail out some of these large institutions.

Its not so much what will the government get out of it but what will the Federal Reserve get out of it...
As seen, 
Bear Stern went under and was not rescued by the government.The reason that the bank went under in first place is the federal reserve stops the flow of money given to the government, and they start to withdraw the money lent to to US government.Hence, there is less money around and the prices of stocks fall.Thats the reason why there is this credit crunch.Nothing to do with the government and all to do with the federal reserve.
As you might have seen.Another example is the government asking the federal reserve to help to save AIG.
Now the government asked for $85 million to help save a fund that was in that situation because of the lack of funds(seeing as the Federal Reserve had been withdrwing funds from the economy).
So the FR then says ok, we will bail you out by giving you $85 Billion, Do you know that for every dollar that is printed by the FR and "loaned" to the goernment , the FR charges 20 cents on every dollar.So they cause the panic and the crash in the first place by withdrawing capital then agree to "loan" $85 Billion at a price, and the price that the government, i.e The American people have to pay back.......$1700 BILLION DOLLARS.....
So now you might ask, who owns the Federal Reserve???

A trust is created when a legal provision is made for gifting assets from one person [the settlor] to another person(s). A trust fund in the case would refer to the funds held within the trust.

I would buy, its all a scam by the federal reserve to accumulate more profits for themselves.
Seeing as the Federal Reserve have bailed out AIG they are not about to let it go under, seeing as they have a chance of buying the whole company at a really cut rate.So buy while its low and you will make a killing when the feds start to allow more money to be printed.

Why would they "loan"$85 Billion dollars unless they want something out of it, How about $1700 Billion in national debt which is picked up by the taxpayer.Not a bad scam if you can get into it !!!

Yeah, agree. They gave loans to everyone going, some borrowing 8 times salary income, they know damn well that people would struggle, and low and behold people can't repay so the banks have little income coming back in to repay their own debts to other financial institutions who lent it to them in the first place.

As the bank suffers, the other banks who lend to them will only do so at a higher rate of interest (if at all) which the troubled bank simply cannot afford, and so on .... until it goes bust, or bought out by a larger secure bank.

It's the avalanche effect.

A few years ago, banks could make huge profits by lending on slightly dodgy mortgages, packaging their mortgage books up into securities, selling them to hedge funds and using the proceeds to borrow some more.  This gave increasing gearing (leverage in the US) since the banks kept the liability if the mortgages defaulted.

In their rush to lend more and more money, they offered large commissions to mortgage arrangers - reducing the quality of the mortgages.

Then America ran up a huge budget deficit.  2 wars and no new taxes.  That meant that the wars are being run on credit.  The Fed sucked up all the money in the money markets and suddenly the whole dodgy mortgage deal started to unravel. Someone's got to lend the money - why put your savings in mortgage banks when you can lend to the Fed.

Banks pay huge bonuses to their top staff.  They seem to get these whether the bank does well or badly.  So banks were making big losses on their mortgage books and having to pay out massive bonuses.  Some of them ran out of spondoolicks.

Real Estate is the big cause. Banks loaned money to buyers who don't qualify. There is a income ratio formula used to qualify buyers. The insurance companies buy the mortgage notes as a safe investment with a steady return but the bad loans they bought are now failing. Get jobs and real estate going and the economy will turn around.

According to www.palmoil.com, you probably need to find someone who has a Reuter's link.

I certainly haven't been able to find one.  It's possible that Bloomberg might have real time quotes, but who can afford a Bloomberg terminal at $25,000 a year?

Good luck!  Toughest question I've seen in awhile.

Yes. Obviously the ideal time would be just before the Stockmarket rose sharply upon the news of the Government bail-out, but timing the market has been likened to catching a falling knife.
If you take a medium-term view of between five and ten years, then you should do well, seeing that share prices are still undervalued, in my view.



Buying the shares of individual banks can be dangerous, as the shareholders of Northern Rock discovered. An alternative would be a Unit Trust, where the Manager's job is to invest in a wide range of banking shares on your behalf, where there is no internal Capital Gains Tax due, when they buy and sell your holdings.

the banks that are in trouble are the ones that were net buyers of credit default swaps. therefore, it stands to reason that there are banks that were net sellers of credit default swaps. these banks are stronger now than before but their stocks have been pulled down by a negative market sentiment. i, personally, and i am speaking for me and not giving financial advice, would seek out these banks (look through the call reports on the fdic website) and invest in them.

Until the bailout I steered clear of RBS big time but did buy some shares today at £0.54.  They have already gone up to £0.66 which is an increase of more than 20%.  I am not looking to sell but sit on for a year or so and see what they do.



The government own 60% of the company if you are in for the long haul then yes it is a good place to invest.  If you want to get in and out quickly it is a bit more risky but I cant see them going much lower so you wont lose a lot.

Probably not. The bail out from the government is early days yet and there needs to be some confidence on the High Street really before any activity begins by investing.
