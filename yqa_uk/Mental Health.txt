I am 13, and depressed...  I think...?



O.k



I am 13, I have self-harmed in the past and I still do. I live in England. I hate me, who I was and am.



When I was 7 my parents split up, then aged 9 I was sexually abused.



It was horrible, I hated every second of it. Thankfully it only happened twice. In year 6 I got teased and bullied for being fat, ugly and "emo". I later realised I was not fat. I did not and still dislike the idea of being emo. I do not think being emo is a good term. I like to think of self-harming as a good thing, as it helped and still helps me through my darkest times.



At the start of this term, I ate in the canteen, and I hated it. My history and my old P.E teacher used to watch me eat. It was horrible.



I begun to not eat breakfast or lunch. I still don't eat either...



Recently I went to see the school counsellor, but she couldn't help me.



I have no idea who I am, or what my purpose is...



I am so confused.

OMG this is so sad. In two ways, one your so young and this heartbreaking, and two, i feel your pain because I've been there but i never could hurt myself. I'm not a certified psychologist but i believe you need to sit down and find the root of your problem.



Do you believe your parents separation is your fault?? And if u do I'm pretty sure it wasn't.



And believe me self-harming can NEVER be a good thing. You should never harm yourself...you are worth WAY more than that.



As for who you are, your a wonderful person who just hasn't found focus in your life...you need to find out what it is you like to do and take that and magnify it into something magnificent

Oh Jesus, when i was 13.. i wouldnt have even thought of harming myself :(



Not eating, is certainly not the answer!  Bullies say things to me the horrible ***** they are, yet themselves need to look in the mirror because usually the faults they put on you they have themselves.. IGNORE those horrible people and act as though it doesn't bother you to them :)



Im sorry that your parents split, mine did too when i was younger have not seen my dad for years however in my opinion it will make you stronger in the long run and seeing my mum cope with two kids very young on her own makes me proud of her tbh :)



You are you, no1 else and you dont have to be like anyone else be individual its better lol:) Bullies can hurt with things they say but in the long run you will always be higher than they ever will be

Listen, self harming is, well, wrong and dangerous and no solution to any problem. As for the abuse, if you ahve not already I would suggest speaking to the police. I know the whole parents splitting up thing all to well, I wass 5 when mine split. And the bullies, just ignore them...they will get bored and leave you alone. Eating at breakfast and lunch IS important, and you can faint if that continues( I ahve had that about 5 times now).

Do you imagine morbid situations?  You need to get your depression sorted out first - go to your GP and ask to be referred to a specialist - Lustrol are tablets which can be prescribed and are not like Prozac - they help to ease stress.  Some stress is good for us all, but when it gets too much it turns to anxiety and when that gets too much it turns to depression.  People without any stress at all are usually boring and dull - you are probably quite intelligent as you are aware of what has taken place in your life - but you should change your user name from 'teehee' or nobody will ever take you seriously.  I even wonder if this has been a waste of my time!

i am so sorry all of this happened to you. i know it will scar you for life. it will always be different. no one will know exactly how you feel. but i would defiantly get some help and STOP hurting yourself. i know things have been really bad for you in the past but you are just making it worse by hurting yourself. just because you feel like crap and been treated like it. don't do it to yourself purposely! i was rapped when i was 12 by my uncle. i told my parents but they never believed me. i never forgave him. this past year he was diagnose with cancer. i was really happy. he finally got what he deserved. then he came up to me last year. cried right in front of me and apologized. i forgave him. to this day i don't let hardly anyone touch me. but i moved on. once again i am sorry for what you have went through. to learn such a hard lesson in life so young. but please stop what you are doing.

See a therapist, first of all. Do some research, too - read books about what you're going through and Google symptoms.



It's terribly sad because you're young, but that's also a good thing. If you begin dealing with your issues at an early age, the likelier it is that you will overcome them.



Good luck to you, and be well.

Forget what everybody else thinks, you are still a person. It is OK to be different. I used to think I had to try so hard to fit in. I stopped and tiring to fit in with everyone else and did my own thing. Nobody made fun of me, I just gave me more power being different. I set an example for other kids, who became my friends. I too am 13. Don't harm yourself, is is not your fault at all. Also, try to be a little open minded. See what other kids like, be friendly and positive.People will like you more or they will be indifferent towards you if you take the interest in them that you would like to have. Good luck!

I'm scared of growing up - scared of life in the future?



I'm in 6th form at school atm, so i'm doing A Levels.
whenever i think about the future i panic. i panic about university cause i'm scared of leaving home and going somewhere that i don't know, scared of not being with anyone i know.
i panic about the idea of proper work (i have a small job, but it's not the same is it), i panic about the idea of bills and the fact that everything is so expensive - i see myself failing all my exams and ending up on the street cause i won't be able to afford a place to live, let alone electricity, tax etc etc
i'm scared of the idea of bringing up kids, cause i know nothing about anything.
i don't understand banks and tax and bills and everything, i don't understand how the economy works and how the government works - i really know nothing about the world, and it terrifies me cause i'll be leaving in only a couple of years and i'll be on my own and having to take total responsibility for everything!
i'm on the verge of tears while typing this, it panics me so much.
i have depression and i'm barely coping with things now, how on earth am i going to be able to cope in the future?

Ok you're just getting a little overwhelmed, it's normal to have these worries. Lots of people are scared about moving out on their own and going to uni and getting a proper job, but everyone else at uni will be in the same boat so you'll have lots off support.
You just need to take everything as it comes, one step at a time, nobody knows all this stuff at first.
Just don't freak out about it.

Take some comfort from this--- the mere fact that you think about these things puts you head and shoulders above the mooing masses that haven't a clue.  Look at the idiots around you; if they can manage to stumble through life, surely you can do at least as well.

A story that will hopefully help:



"There was a little girl who came home from school very excited because she had just learned to add numbers.  Her mom said, "That's wonderful, honey, soon you'll be able to multiply, divide, do fractions, and long division. . ." Then the little girl started crying.  Her mom asked, "What's the matter, sweetie?" and the girl replied, "I don't know how to do long division!"



The point is don't worry about not knowing skills right now that you'll need way in the future.  You'll learn them in time.

We all go through this though I am not sure we do it as young as you are.  You are going to be fine, just like everyone else when they make it out into the world on their own.  Don't worry about this so much now.  You have plenty of time before you'll experience it and most often than not you're not thrown out there to sink or swim.  You'll have time to adjust.

Nobody understood any of this at your age don't worry. You learn it all as you experience life.  Im old and there's still a few things on your list that i don't really understand.
You don't need to know everything all at once, when you need to know simply ask. with the internet and this site you'll never be stuck.
Being scared is very normal too, but dont forget, life is also great fun you've got great experiences ahead of you so don't panic about the negative things and enjoy making mistakes

take everything one problem at a time, don't worry about things that haven't happened yet, and focus on the things that are right in front of you. dont be scared about failing your exams, i thought i was going to, and it worked out fine, even if you do, its not the worst thing, you can do them again, and not all good jobs need exams. and seriously dont worry about university, i just started this year, and i was so scared, coz im really shy, but its really easy because everyone is in the same situation. dont let all the stuff like bills and kids get to you, you normally just figure it all out as it comes along. you wont have to deal with all this new stuff all at once, it will come gradually, so its more manageable. the future always works itself out in the end, dont be scared and just try to enjoy what you've got now.

Okay, first slow the bum down.
Points that will help you:
1. I'm 14 and act like a 5 year old sometimes...it makes me happy.



2.You will always have the inner child in you.



3 Growing up is part of life, everyone has to do it but you can either choose to act all mature and drink red wine, or you can have fun and throw your Bop It! game out the window.



4. You will be able to cope with the future, your family and friends with support and help you.



5. People will always put you down and be-little you so you might as well act all childish and listen to Barbie Girl just that one more time.

I graduated from high school a couple of years ago, and right before I stepped out into the 'real world' I was extremely nervous about the practical stuff of life. I had no idea about money and still have very little grasp of the technicality of it, but I'm functioning just fine. And I live in a huge city, where so much could go wrong. Nothing, to this point, has. (Knock on wood.) Life is essentially a crapshoot. Things could go wrong, yes, but you might as well deal with problems as they come. As far as your depression, you should definitely begin seeing a psychologist if you aren't already - and potentially a psychiatrist if you are genetically predisposed and would benefit from medication. Good luck to you and don't worry. Things will be fine.

I'm in sixth form too, and it scares me to think about leaving home and leaving the stability. It's because I don't like change, like I hate it so much, but life is all about change. As for worrying over your parenting skills - we learn these things. Your own mum probably didn't have a clue about motherhood until she had you, and the same for your father. You'll learn about bills and everything like that as time goes on; ask someone older in your family and seek guidence. You'll be okay. Don't panic so much. Growing up is all about life, and when you have your own children, they may come to you with this problem and you'll be able to help them, too.

Im so depressed. i cant cry, i feel empty, i cant do anything?



ok, im a 13 year old girl and ive been suffering severe depression for over the last 2 or so years for Various reason such as school and at home and my mental health. i look back at when i was Truly happy, that was for the first 6 or 7 years of my life, then my parents split up, i felt sad all the time but didn't know why, then when i came to secondary school it all spiraled down, i was only happy then because i was young, and didn't know anything about the world, i look back now thinking, when i was ok i would normally think of stuff in *this* way, but now ive realized that that wasn't how i would usually be thinking, that was the very beginning of my life, its not going to be all my life, im growing out of what has been normal for me all my life



i just don't see how you can be happy, i look at other people and think what are they doing that stops them being so bored? what have they got that makes them happy that i haven't got? i have what they have, so how are they happy? am i going to carry on doing the same thing for 70 or so years?? i don't know what life is, what makes us conscious? what is time? where did everything come from and how can we act the way we do when nobody knows what we are in,and what scares me the most is what death is . . is it like being vegetable? no senses, you cant feel, taste, smell, see or hear, your just consciousness with no body? im so sick of my dad, ive been taking his crap all my life and i used to actually believe it was my fault, i cant live in his house its almost suffocating me . . .



i fell tired all the time, i cant concentrate, my legs,arms and back ache non stop, its so bad that once i could hardly stand at the end of the bus journey to school, i feel dizzy when i get up, i cant cry anymore, i cant feel anything anymore, i cant do anything . . .ive been suffering for so long that sometimes i think what is reality? and does it really matter? im worried im going to completely lose control . . . sometimes when im alone i swear i can here people moving about in my house and i get really panicky that someone is behind me when i know they're not, i sometimes see weird things out the corner of my eye, i don't know whats happening, i find that i cant eat, ive almost got to the point where i just don't care anymore, i don't care if i am late for school, if im left on my own at school, if i get in trouble or if i don't do my work, i don't care how much i eat, when i go to bed everything is so empty and the only thing i have to hold onto is music, i love it so much, if it wasn't here id have lost it way before now, its one of the most important things to me and all i want in my life is something to do with it, i don't care if i never come out of depression, its all that i want.



depression has only helped me sort out who exactly i am, i went through a stage of such frustration, i absolutely hated myself, i was messed up with my image of myself and i got so angry, i guess its a hard way to beat your self into deciding who you are, but i think its the only way . . . sometimes i love that im so depressed because of how it has changed me, and it almost seems like a friend who is always there, but sometimes i hate it . . . its just so confusing i don't know my mind one minute and the next im so sure of myself, i need help. i don't know how long i can go on like this.

There is hope for you, and many people have gone through severe depression, but found light at the end of he tunnel.



There are ways to treat depression, and even if the solution isn' simple, there is help available so that you won't be in pain like this.



Do your parents know about what you're going through?



You need to get help for this.  If you don't feel like you can talk to your parents, you can talk to a teacher, a counselor, a pastor, or priest.



Also, there is an organization called the Samaritans ( htp://www.Samaritans.org ) and they are available 24/7.  You can write to us anytime, including myself.



Please tell your parents, or at least tell an adult that you trust.  I am sure that you have friends, and people who love you and care about you.

try to get through it. Do you have anyone you like at school? you can talk to people that you trust to get past your pain and move on. I'm about your age and I had times when I felt like you when things weren't really going too well for me. Try to understand that we all feel like this sometimes and please dont hurt yourself to think it can relive pain- it makes it worse.
Good luck and try to be positive

I'm sorry to say this, but I can understand what you are feeling.
I also suffered from depression at a young age.
The best advice that I can give you is to talk to a school counselor and your parents about what you are feeling.



After going through puberty thinking that those feelings were normal, a friend finally suggested that I should seek some help. I ended up seeing a counselor and working through most of my problems.
I never ended up needing medication. It was a blessing that I had the ability to speak to someone in an impartial environment.
Having to seek help is not a big deal; it doesn't mean that you are crazy or weak. It just means that you know when you are in over your head.



Above all, please don't do anything that could cause you permanent harm. You WILL get better, but scars are FOREVER.

Sounds like you are caught in a bad, downward spiral.  I teach 9th grade in Mississippi so I've had some experience with kids your age. It's a very, very hard time in your life. Hormones, confusion, self doubt, peer pressure, parents, school, etc all makes for a crazy life! The good news is, it gets better. What you feel is perfectly normal. There is no easy answer. You have to pull yourself out of it. Don't give in to the negative. Don't "love" your depression, emo is so "last year".  If you love music, make that your focus. You have to care. The choices you make now will influence the rest of your life. Care about your looks, your grades, your behavior, your friends. Find things that are positive and make them work for you. Happiness will come from within. We all have to make ourselves happy.  Good Luck!

Technically, we DON'T all feel like this sometimes.  That's bad advice.  You need to get help.  Even if you make up that you have a stomache ache to go see your doctor and then start crying in the office and tell him all about this.  You need to get help.  Understand that there is so much more ahead of you, and teenagers go through chemical changes in the body that effect how they feel and how they are developing.  But everyone experiences those adolescent changes differently.  A lot of mental illnesses are diagnosed around the tween/teen years.  I work in mental health and there's nothing worse than seeing someone suffering because they really don't know what's normal, how to tell someone, or if they'll just "get over it."  You won't get over these strong feelings your having.  You describe all the signs of a mental illness - and that's okay!!  I have one, 1 if 4 people have one...really, just about everyone has some form of mental illness that comes out only in stressful times.  Please sweetie, talk with someone...even I am feeling not like myself and don't know how to call the doctor and say I just am feeling depressed and anxious.  The best way is to say you are having some kind of pain or stomach ache to get you in that dr office - then spill the beans on why you are really there.  Take care of yourself - you are really the only one that can do that, and it might end up saving your life.  Trust me, things will be different in 2 or 5 years.  Life gets easier and more fun.

Begin taking vitamins daily. Specifically time released Calcium, slow release Iron, B6 and B12. This will make you feel more energized and good health promotes a happier mindset and the ability to be positive. ...........For a 13 yr. old you seem to have an above average intellect. With great intellect comes insanity and eccentricity. They just go hand in hand. Once you have more energy do things that promote a positive image of yourself (whatever you feel good at). This recipe will bring your temporary comfortable periods of time, but the depression always comes back. If you seek help via psychiatrist, never try taking the generic of the prescription they provide. It could be dangerous.

dont take this in the wrong way but i genually think that you need to talk to a shrink or something because u may have unsolved issues about your parents which makes you sad and also it may help you with the whole hearing voices and seeing things.



the thing about death and wondering about what it is. i had the exact same thing when i was little and i was so scared about it. eventually i just thought everyone goes through it so why worry about it. another thing that helped get me through it was thinking that more people are born each second than died so in a wierd way think about it as as soon as you die you are reborn as another person and can start your life anew.



as for being sad all the time, if you have friends talk to them and get all of this off your chest to them. go out and have fun with them.



even though you may feel really depressed on the inside try to have a good time anyway and just laugh along- eventually you'll enjoy it and start to be happy.



also if music makes you happy and is your release, i suggest you write a song about your feelings that is your own as it is a way to release your negative emotions in a positive way.



im sorry if this seems a little patronising bt i went through a stage very similar to this in primary school just remember that just because youre sad does not mean your a bad person.



:) try to smile more



dont take things too personally and try to enjoy life- easier sed than dun i know but just talking to people will help



hope this helps

You are certainly expressive and articulate for 13 years old.  You have had a lot going on and have a right to be upset but it will not always be like this.  Your body will be going through a lot of chemical changes and this can contribute to depression/emotional upset, but that too will smooth out. School and doing all the "have to do" stuff (high school,graduation, college etc) can also bring you down but you are a t the threshold of being able to choose your own destiny (careers and lifestyle). You will b able to get into relationships and find someone to love that will love you.  But to cope right now, some of the things that you said indicate that you need someone in a supportive counseling situation.  Can you find a same sex counselor that will help guide you through this difficult time ?  You are obviously very intelligent and very sensitive - you have so much potential for greatness and happiness - please take steps to find someone that can guide/support you. (and I don't mean online - a real person in your area).  Don't procrastinate - you sound like you are true "diamond in the rough".

Welcome to teen hood.



Although. I will add a few words just to let you know that I know what you are going through. My parents started divorcing each other in 06 after 05 in which 05 was the year that I found out that my dad was doing drugs and then took all of my birthday money (which was all I got for my birthday in 05) and spent them on drugs along with my brothers birthday money... As timw went by my dad took all of my thing and my brothers things and my mothers things and sold them for crack. (the things that were very important to me) Well since 2006 I have spent my years in horrible school in which I got treated like sh*t. No friends.... I could hardly even learn because of it and I still had no time what so ever to even complain. I stayed stressed out and Parts of my hair began falling out... I had no money to go to the doctor to find out what the hell was going on. Now me, my mother, and my bro are Living together in hell. We ALWAYS fight and we are in the middle of being evicted from our home. We are about to move to a location of where drug dealers and racist live. So I'm still under stress. There's more to all of this, but I have to get back to packing up. So I wish you luck with life and I'll pray for you cause that's all anyone can do right now. But be thankful for the things that you have... cause you could lose it one day. Never take anything for granted and leave no stone un turned.

Is this enough reason to drive a spike through a child's eye sockets into his brain?



He objects to going to bed, but then sleeps well. He does a good deal of daydreaming. He turns the room lights on when there's broad sunlight outside. He hates to wash. He puts on a sweater on the hottest days and goes without an undershirt on chilly ones. I think it would be pretty much of a shame to wish Howard on anybody."

I know someone who had gone through the AA program and she defined the higher power to me when I didn't quite understand it myself. First of all your higher power can and may vary from the traditional thought of being God in the christian sense. Your personal higher power is a "being" that you feel comfortable with, be it God or someone or something that you consider to be. With any addiction you admit you are powerless over the drug of choice right? Therefore you give "it" over to your higher power whatever YOU consider it to be ? I hope this helps you , it is a concept in your mind and or heart. Best of luck and courage to you !

i have been to open AA meetings. and to alanon.  i am not an alcoholic, but i need help in dealing with loved ones that are.  what do you believe in?  is it God.  is it no God.  what?  in any case, higher power can mean the God that you believe in.  if you don't believe in God, you can still believe that in the concept that you know you have an ego and you know you have a part of you that is not ego, the more sensible part of you that says, _____________.



just because one person believes one way, does not mean you have to.  if you believe in Jesus, no one, but no one will try and change your mind.  AA helps millions in the world that are ready to help.  it is a 12 step program.
many blessings to you.  don't be scared of the higher power thing, please.  if it means nothing to you, then so be it.  it is whatever is in your heart and not the person's sitting beside you.  when you get past that, all the other stuff in there, i feel you will be very comfortable with.
they do the serenity prayer in every meeting.  God grant me the serenity to accept the things i can not change, the courage to change the things i can, and the wisdom to know the difference.  blessings!!

IMO I think it just means you have to consider/accept the fact that you need help from other sources greater then yourself. If you don't believe in a God, then accept the help from something/someone other then trying to do it alone. This higher power could be anything that is around you giving you strength. It could be as simple as a daily walk to collect your thoughts and appreciate your own existence. You just have to accept the fact that you need outside help greater then yourself alone.

OMG I had the same problem.  My higher power ended up being nature. I almost would rather be hiking or  biking than in a mtg sometimes that its sooo calming. Figure out what works for you at some point you will be able to feel it and its not always what the general public accepts such as God or otherwise. For me it took a lot of walks and talking to people about it when finally I found a spot in the woods that chilled me out and it felt real and I could rely on it to be there. Shoot me an e-mail if you want to talk further.

Your thoughts.  Would you leave a suicide note?



I had recently lost a close friend by suicide.  He had been extremely depressed and everything appeared to be failing on him.  I did not know about this because he hid all this from his friends and even his family.  This horrible event has shaken me to the core.  While I feel like I've let my friend down by not being about to help him, I also know that thiswould have happened regardless on what I could have done.  This experience has made me look at my own life, as I have these feeliings myself.  I was told my my doctor that most people during their lifetime will have thoughts of suicide.  My friend did not leave a note.  Would you leave a note behind?  The hurt is already painful for those he left behind, why would you left a note?  Wouldn't it be bettter to let go and more on?  Please, serious responses only.  Thanks.

I can't imagine your grief and I am sorry for what you are going through. Fir someone to take there life, they must have truly hated the world, so therefore leaving a note prob wouldn't be expected.



As for yourself, please seek counseling. You see the impact your friends loss has had on your life, and think about those you would leave behind yourself. Life is Erhartwe make of it...choose to make the best of yours at be an example for those who are also sstruggling

I am sorry for your loss. In regards to your question I really dont know.
I have attempted suicide before and once you get in that place its like nobody's voice can reach you. I might leave a note to the closest person to me but what happens when you go in one direction its like you push people away so that you can hurt yourself. Its very contradictory wanting to connect but at the same time being in so much pain that you just want things to stop. I think from my experiences I didnt even think about writing a note. I just wanted to clock out. I hope you have people around you to help you through this and remember this isnt your fault.

Its pretty simple really, an in-patient is somebody who has been admitted to a ward to spend most of their day there, be assessed and/or treated.  This will depend on if they are there of their own free will or, if they have been sectioned, the type of section that has been placed.



An outpatient is somebody who uses the mental health trust's services but lives at home.  It is often on a very flexible basis.  They might use the hospital's psychological therapies or come to a day centre.  Or they may just recieve letters requesting they come in to see a psychiatrist on a regular basis.

I'm only 12, i think i may have a mental disorder. Either that, or I'm just too emotional. Help?



for the past month i've been so on and off with being seriously depressed and being happy. during school (usually) fine, my happy, peppy, hyper self. but when i get home i spend a lot of time alone, and as soon as im isolated from the rest of the world without a distraction of some sort, i begin to feel sad.



i think too much and usually end up crying.. sometimes i feel really lonely. it seems that when i get home i never have anybody to talk to, i only have one REAL friend but i barely get to see her cause we live in different cities.. and if im not sad about that, i become nostalgic. to the point in which i start crying.



if im not sad about that i just think so depressingly about the world and everything in it.. my mind always finds a way to make me sad! its only when im with people that im happy. but not all the time, my emotions still go on and off REALLY easily~! sometimes i feel like i have so much potential and want to do so much good for the world, and the rest of the time im so aimless, i lack goals in life, i keep thinking about the reason i'm here on earth, whats the point if we're going to die.. AND THEN i get angry at myself for thinking such negative thoughts! im only in the 8th grade for goodness sake!
i wish i were naive.. maybe its because im in the PACE program? "gifted", apparently? i know lots of people with me in the PACE programs who have had emotional troubles.. cutting, depression, etc...



but somtimes i feel so lightheaded and just happy.. i cant stop laughing..



im so confused :S



HELP? :(



BY THE WAY: sorry that i write so much. when it comes to talking about my emotions, i tend to be like that.

OK. Now, what you need to do is talk to your parents about this. What I did was go to my local GP/Doctor, told her my problems and she referred me to a mental health facility.



At the start of my depression. The similar started to happen to me. You do really need to get help because if it is depression or a bipolar disorder then it will get worse and worse.



I got help and my life is on the repair - I am on Fluoxetine (An Anti-Depressant) and I also attend therapy. Please just get help and you will get so much better...trust me.

Maybe you are bipolar. Basically what that is, is that you get tons of different emotions and switch them a lot. EX: You might be happy right now, but a mniute later, you get mad, but after you get sad.
Go to your doctor and ask to get tested for it and mayybe refered to a psychologist or a psychiatrist

I just started taking zoloft, 25 mg, and im already feeling it?



This is my first day taking 25 mg of zoloft.  Never taken it before.  I already feel good, and my heartbeat awareness in my chest is gone.



Is it normal to feel the effects of the drug so soon?

<answer>



It is possible, everyone is different. The drug Zoloft obviously works as soon as you start taking it. However for some people's mental symptoms it takes a week or two for it to start working because their brain chemistry is still trying to adjust to it.



Maybe your brain chemistry easily adjusts to outside chemicals so you feel it right away.



It could also be a placebo effect: you know it should work so you think it's working.

Yes, I am on Lexapro 20mg. It will get better as well, give it a week to get fully in your system. Today you might be feeling it because you think you are :) Mental thing.



Although be aware some depression medications cause weight gain.  Prozac and Zoloft have been known to do this, but so has  Lexapro, it depends on the person.  : )



Lexapro has caused weight gain for me, but It gives me a reason to work harder at the gym! lol.



Lexapro also makes me sleepy when I take it, I always take it at night. So, this way you don't lay awake and worry and cry about random things. :)



IT is a chemical imbalance, I'm sure you've heard this a million times, it simply produces more of this chemical, and just look for it to get better. :)

I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through. One small thing you can do is write in an journal. It used to bother me when people suggested this, but it actually helps, even if you don't enjoy writing. Actually putting into words what you're feeling will help your mind sort them all out. If it's really worrying you, then talk to you parents about seeing a therapist. It's always good to have someone to talk to. If you're not comfortable talking to your parents, maybe try your school counselor. If you don't find a good, healthy way to recognize and deal with your emotions, chances are, they'll show themselves in a number of unhealthy ways.. weight gain, social withdrawl, depression, substance abuse... a number of things. Good luck, and I hope you find some balance soon.

I was similar to that when I was in school and it got slightly better when I graduated but its more than just school. You should go see a counselor soon. The sooner the better. I just started seeing someone and Im 23. I wish I would have got it taken care of sooner. Its anxiety. I do the same things you do. Its strange, i over react, im not happy when I should be. I don't even trust my feelings anymore. Even when Im not over reacting I assume I am. It takes a toll on self esteem. Go get help while your still on your parent insurance.

Alcohol has done nothing but cause misery for those that abuse it and those that they have close contact with.  I come from a family with a long history of alcohol and drug abuse.  You are in denial by saying how much you love to drink. You are using it as a crutch to help you with your problems. You must try harder to achieve your goals. Answers are out there. Sometimes they are just harder to find for some people than others.  Please seek help for your alcohol problem, even if you do not think that you have one.

Skip the nap, (at night you'll be really tired)- and your will be able to get a good night sleep.



Stop going to bed so late. or it will just be a vicious cycle.

Can these be symptoms of caffeine withdrawal?



I quit caffeine cold turkey 3 days ago. I used to drink a lot of sodas and coffee. First day was massive headaches, then it turned into feel lethargic and tired.  Now on top of all that...my head feels like its in the clouds.  Kinda like a foggy feeling not to mention lack of concentration also.  This stinks. Any help would be appreciated.

i agree.  Cutting back slowly is a good/better idea.  You can take like, IDK, there are a lot of over the counter meds that have caffeine in them.  I don't suggest becoming a druggy or anything like that but if you can find one of those you can take it not only for your head but it will give you that slight caffeine jolt you need.

Lots and lots of water, re-hydrate those cells, they need assistance to cleanse what's left of the caffeine away.  Every part of your body  functions better when properly lubricated.



Also, if you can go have a sauna, that will totally help, very theraputic.

I feel the same way whenever I try to ween myself off of caffeine.  I've started eating breakfast, since I barely did this in the past, and began exercising in the park to build up my cardio/heart rate.  I'm down to one coffee and a coke every now and then, but I try to drink more water from the fountain at work and I keep the caffeine at home to avoid drinking it so I won't feel jittery throughout the day.  Hope it helps!

Join clubs on campus.  Get involved in dorm/campus activities.  See the therapist on campus.  They are usually free and have lots of great advice and a ear to listen as well.  I felt the same way when I went away to college, bf and I broke up (highschool sweetheart) and I felt like I was going no where.  I started going out, meeting new people, joined a frat. on campus--it really did wonders for me and I am sure it can for you too--just gotta get out there:):)

It's unlikely you will be sacked. As long as it's not a criminal offences of a violent or sexual nature AND it was a while back and you have not offended since, you will likely be ok. The good thing is that you told your employer about it beforehand

Is There Such A Thing As Free or Assisted Adult ADHD Testing?



I am a student at a University with a pretty decent insurance policy. However, I used to take adderral back in high school and wanted to try it again. My doctor says that I have been off it for too long and need to be retested. I went to the Univ. testing clinic and they told me my insurance would cover 50% and I would have to pay the other upfront (which is $450!!!) I don't have that lying around at all... Is there any other way I could do this testing? I am in Columbus, OH, btw.

Let a few alarms to wake up.  Also avoid all caffeine after 5PM.  Also try going to bed much earlier then you usually do, like a few hours, so your body gets used to laying there earlier--and try listening to soothing music also./

i have done my training 2 be a community care worker and im just waiting 4 my crb check 2 come back. i have told my team manager that they might be 1 caution on there but thats the only thing ive ever done and it was for breech of the peace. can i get sacked 4 it even if it has nothing 2 do with looking after elderly people? i havent covered it up ive been honest so will that go in my favour? i have rung the police station and they said that my name and address didnt come up on the computer does that mean i havent been cautioned?

No, if you have told your employer about it and thats all that will come up i suspect you will be ok.  If they was going to sack you over it they wouldnt have bothered doing the check they would have just let you go

It's unlikely you will be sacked. As long as it's not a criminal offences of a violent or sexual nature AND it was a while back and you have not offended since, you will likely be OK. The good thing is that you told your employer about it beforehand (that's the main thing)



If one lies about any cautions/convictions etc and you don't declare it prior to the CRB, that will look like you have been dishonest and that will likely result in a dismissal as this is not the case, you will be fine.

I had a caution for driving without a licence so I think my offence is worse than yours, but I have also had 2 crb checks done for 2 jobs that I do which are working in a school and an old people's home and all has been absolutely fine. So quit worrying, it won't go against you and your boss should think highly of you for being honest. Good luck.

a caution isn't the same as a conviction, you haven't been found guilty by a jury of your peers or pleaded guilty of your own volition, it's just designed to scare you out of doing the same thing again.  I think you should be totally fine, they haven't let you go yet so it doesn't appear to bother them

I am worried that my brother might be suicidal. Advice? I found this note in his room:?



"Now I have to stay awake and feel and care. One day i will be too tired to care and feel, and so I will sleep - rest, and all of this will be at rest too"



I also found this:
"To me it seems all is living, breathing. There is nothing - nothing natural or un-natural, dirty or clean, music or not music, death or life.
It's all a mish-mash of 'stuff'. It's all God!...and none of it!!"



Should I be worried?
I live with my brother in an apartment, he is 24 years old. He seems to often have mood swings and speaks of feeling anxious at times. He can not hold down a job. He has come to the point where he has only 100 $ left and he seems to have ideas of becoming a wandering hobo. He only spends his time writing and at times drawing, not paying attention to other thngs.

It could be, it could also be a number of other things.
Diet and exercise really affect your mental function.  Do you eat lots of fresh foods and not very many processed foods?  Try altering that.  Lots of fresh vegis and fruits will help - preferably raw.  Also exercising every day - even a walk - will help a lot.
Both of those things affect the production of neurotransmitters in your brain and will affect how your memory works.
Also, getting older does come with some down sides, and that's one of them.
I would get checked out though, my mom had that about age 45 and it wasn't dementia, it was MS - she had a form of MS that develops very slowly and she didn't know until she was starting to have memory problems, then her muscles had problems....
You should talk to your doctor, it may be a number of things and some of them are simple and easy to fix, some aren't but the faster you get them treated the less they affect your life in the long run.

TH,



There are many things that can result in memory loss besides



dymentia for people  to take to supplement their depletion whcih
causes this.  I have linked to a site that explains it in full.



You can supplement your daily intake of the following things
that could be in low supply in your body:



B6, B12, thiamine, folic acid, omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin C & E,
and melatonin.  You can take a multi-vitamin every day, and if
you have noticed sleep problems, you can get melatonin at the
drug store over the counter.



Eating a healthy diet is also important.  You need a diet high
in antioxidants (spinach, strawbetties, for example).



If you are truly concerned you are having first symtoms of Altzheimers,
then you can get tested for this by your physician.



I hope this has helped alleviate you worry about this.  I can
never remember names and that happened in my 20s.  Write
down passwords so you have a record of it.



Good luck.

Certainly they can do.  I have been depressed for the majority of the last 6 years since graduating from university.  For such a long time I felt lost and overwhelmed, sad and lonely.  Nothing mattered to me.  I hit absolute rock bottom a couple of years ago...



Now I'm slowly bouncing back up.  I can start to see how my experiences have helped make me a more understanding, caring person.  I now have the drive and experience to try to help myself and others.  Okay I'm not totally back on track yet, and I have bad days, but I refuse to let myself stay in that tortured, unhappy, self-absorbed and lonely place any more.



I've quit illegal drugs, which I took to try to escape.  They really do not help!  I still drink,but I try to moderate it.  I'm only human after all, I know its not a great thing to do, but everybody needs some escapism now and again.  As long as it does no harm to others, it doesn't matter too much.



I'm looking at going back to uni next year, to study to work in the field of mental health.  Having something to look forward to and work towards is an excellent cure for the blues!



So yes, people can recover from depression.  With the right support, the drive to move forwards rather than living in the past, and the willingness to accept and forgive ourselves, to understand that we all deserve happiness and fulfillment, we can all overcome dark times.

I did and i had depression for 12 years. It just takes time. When i had my children and something to live for and i got better. I feel stronger now for going through it but never want to relive it again! Antidepressant's are good, but be sure to have some form of counselling. Please try not to sort this out on your own. If you have an understanding family/friends please tell them how you feel. Things do get better in time but it may be long and hard and you may relapse. Once you come through it though you'll feel so lucky to be alive and happy you'll never take anything for granted again.xx Good Luck.

It depends on the type of depression and on the person concerned. If the depression was due to a particular occurrence..eg, death of someone close etc then yes, usually. If its clinical depression it might be harder although circumstances in ones life can dramatically affect depression.

<question>



I think I may be a psychopath?



I spend a lot of my time while pretending to listen to other people, thinking about the most likely way they'll die and how I would kill them if I could. When not doing this, I generally find ways to deprive people of something, for example their wallet.



I invent complicated scams to steal things from shops, and have tried these a number of times until I took too much of a risk and got caught. I still think about doing it often, the only thing that stops me is that I don't want to get a criminal record - I seem to have no sense of right and wrong. I've shared some of these ideas with my friends, all of whom commented that I was ''a psycho.''



I like to inflict pain on myself, as much and as often as possible. I've intentionally broken my own foot a couple of times, and my own arm once. When asked about this, I claim it was an accident.



I keep fish and gerbils in my room and I like to catch the fish in a net and watch them flop about until they're almost dead before putting them back. Sometimes, I hold the gerbils upside down and watch them squirm. If my neighbour's cat follows me home, I trap it in my room and keep it prisoner for hours.



This is not a troll post, I am serious. I have OCD and Bipolar disorder also, but I don't feel I can talk to my psychiatrist about this. Thanks for reading x

Unfortunately you do have a major problem here you are what the psychiatric community would consider psychotic , and you fall under it because of your self harming , and willingness to harm others . The obsession with theft is kleptomania , you do need to tell someone this stuff ,medication would so help you you sound like a troubled individual and i hope you'll be ok you seem like a nice dude.

Unfortunately, I don't know your age or how long you have been
dealing with this but I sense the desperation in the way you wrote this. I suggest you get a referral from your family physician for a qualified
licensed psychologist who specializes in psychotherapy.  I have
linked to a phychotherapist's site of someone who gives you the
reasons for psychotherapy and how you can benefit.



Please don't get caught up in the stigma of seeing someone for help.
Thing is *everyone* could benefit at some time in their life with
counselling from a professional.  It takes a strong person to reach
out and get this help.



I hope you do it so you can get back on track and have laugher in
your life again, because that is the best medicine for any problem.



I will be praying for you.

What is your opinion on well-off, Western people who feel depressed because they are lonely and empty?



Young adults with enough money, at university, loving family maybe a few past traumas but that have all been forgotten so whatever.  But they're depressed and suicidal because they feel lonely, empty and completely alone in the world.  Feel that life is meaningless and often think how nice it'd be to kill themselves and end this ****.  Do you think they have a right to feel this way?

Of course they do. Everyone has a breaking point, for some it's being lonely, some find the lack of money or status to be traumatic on this level. It's all a matter of perception. Everyone CAN be depressed, some just deal with what society deems as "more important" or label as "more traumatic".

Do you think obesity is a mental illness?



Okay, this is a serious question and not mean to be snotty.  And also I'm not talking about people who'd like to lose 5 or 10 pounds to look better in their clothing.  I'm talking about people who are obese to the point where it is affecting their health and hindering every aspect of their life.  When you can't go out to a movie with your friends because you can't fit in the seat.  Obviously fat people are aware that they are overweight.  So a clear thinking person would just buckle down and lose the weight.  Maybe there are certain ones who have a physical condition that can't but for the most part, do you think it is a sign of mental illness to not lose weight when you know you may be killing yourself?

I don't think it's mental illness, but I do think it could be another factor than just the weight.
It could be denial, as in the person knows that if you are that fat then you could die, but that is a scary thing to contemplate for anybody, so if they don't address it, they ignore the fact they could die.

No I think a person can be tremendously obese and still be perfectly healthy mentally.  But obviously it is a physical illness and I believe it is a physical illness caused at least in part by the attitude of some fiercely capitalistic societies.  If you're a lazy-hazy sort of person in one of these societies and not particularly looking for gain at all costs yourself, well then, you are getting stuff rammed down your throat all the time.

Obesity does not mean you don't know that your fat, like you seemed to implied. That should clear it up.
Obesity is not a mental illness, it is a disability caused by a variety of things such as genetics, depression, and general over-eating and being in a bad place (or your in a really good place and just really like food, lol.)



I believe there is a medical term for someone who is really fat and thinks they aren't, just as there is a medical term for someone who think's they are ugly when they aren't. THAT would be a mental illness.

I wouldn't call it a mental illness as such (Binge Eating Disorder is, but only a small proportion of obese people have that). But it can have psychological causes.



For example, some victims of sexual abuse overeat in order to make themselves unattractive, so that the abuse won't happen again.



Others eat to compensate for other things which they lack in their lives.

You know, I was talking to someone about this recently. In the building where my husband works there are people who need to ride around on carts because of their weight and they can't walk the halls all day, but yet they gorge at the functions on cakes, candies, donuts. This is a mental issue.He told me of one man who needed his pc worked on. My husband was so repulsed, this guy was morbidly obese and had food stuff all over the keyboard and his desk. That man died of a massive heart attack about 1 year later. There is definitely something missing in the logic department. As soon as I gain 5 pounds I say "Uh-oh" and get to work on it.

ABSOLUTELY! people don't seem to like to work for the things they want or need. so they let whatever happens to them just happen, if it feels good, they think they're doing good! (ie. eating) rather than just finding the things that feel bad and fixing it so it doesn't hurt anymore. the more problems u sweep under the rug, the more weight u are going to carry with u through life. when people overeat to fulfill other needs they carry the weight literally. when people get angry or depressed they carry the weight mentally. eventually (either way u look it it) it becomes a disease and it ruins your life or simply takes it away. life is not a game and u must work to achieve success!!!! a lot of people don't believe (for whatever reason) that they have the ability to be successful, so they just indulge and spoil themselves.. LITERALLY!.

I think for people more than 5-30 pounds overweight, it's not a mental illness, but more using food to fill a void in their lives. Rather than eat for nutrition, they're eating for comfort or something that gives them pleasure for a while, because their lives are unhappy or stressful. When you see large people, it's not that they choose to be like that and enjoy the negative effects on their health, but because they have a unhealthy relationship with food. If their lives were to change and the relationship with food was to change, they'd probably weigh less and most importantly be happier. Also, for some it's a medical condition why they're overweight. Maybe they can't exercise. One thing is for sure, the American diet is high fat meat products, cheeses, junk sweetners like high fructose corn surup and chemicals added to the food aren't helping anyone's health.



When you see someone 50, 100, 150+ pounds over weight, rather than judge them, think about what could be going on in their lives and have some compassion. I feel sorry for people like that and hope they'll get help to improve their health.

I'm on a similar antidepressant, and I'm so glad my doctor suggested it! I was at the point of a nervous breakdown before.



My mother is on prozac, and has been for around 3 years. The only side effect was that she put on weight, but this is not a big deal for her as she's always been slim. I believe she's taking 100mg per day.



Make sure you start on the lowest dose and move up from there, as it can make you feel tired and sick to begin with until your body gets used to it. Remember, it can take 2 - 4 weeks to work, as it needs to build up in your body, so please don't be disappointed if you don't notice any change straight away.



Hope this helped, I'm sorry you're feeling down and I hope prozac makes your life a lot better!

No side effects, no anxiety. Very good. Of course everyone is different. I'm 32. Age , gender, your personal situation, your genetics and all that stuff have contributing factors as well. 20mg is the lowest dose. I haven't needed to increase mine.

I have never been to any kind of counsellor or therapist, and I'm not diagnosed or anything, but I know I have symptoms and stuff of Depression and Psychosis (including anxiety), and I do believe I have phobias.
Every now and then I feel really bad, normally when I'm out in public but it happens around the house too sometimes, and I'm anxious and clusterphobic and I feel naked and weird and just... ew, it's horrible, I hate it.
But if I felt like that, or similiar to that, almost all the time.. I'd go even crazier than I would be already.
That's why you need MEDICATION. And a THERAPIST.

<question>



I think I may be a psychopath?



I spend a lot of my time while pretending to listen to other people, thinking about the most likely way they'll die and how I would kill them if I could. When not doing this, I generally find ways to deprive people of something, for example their wallet.



I invent complicated scams to steal things from shops, and have tried these a number of times until I took too much of a risk and got caught. I still think about doing it often, the only thing that stops me is that I don't want to get a criminal record - I seem to have no sense of right and wrong. I've shared some of these ideas with my friends, all of whom commented that I was ''a psycho.''



I like to inflict pain on myself, as much and as often as possible. I've intentionally broken my own foot a couple of times, and my own arm once. When asked about this, I claim it was an accident.



I keep fish and gerbils in my room and I like to catch the fish in a net and watch them flop about until they're almost dead before putting them back. Sometimes, I hold the gerbils upside down and watch them squirm. If my neighbour's cat follows me home, I trap it in my room and keep it prisoner for hours.



This is not a troll post, I am serious. I have OCD and Bipolar disorder also, but I don't feel I can talk to my psychiatrist about this. Thanks for reading x

Unfortunately you do have a major problem here you are what the psychiatric community would consider psychotic , and you fall under it because of your self harming , and willingness to harm others . The obsession with theft is kleptomania , you do need to tell someone this stuff ,medication would so help you you sound like a troubled individual and i hope you'll be ok you seem like a nice girl..

Are you happy at home?  Do you feel loved by your parents?



You seem to have the capacity to differentiate right and wrong (since you have listed all the wrong things you do).  I think it is the feeling of compassion that you are lacking, and maybe you are lacking a whole spectrum of emotions.  You don't seem to use a lot of words that describe emotions. You describe events, but, not what you feeling inside.  Alexithymia is a name commonly used by psychiatrists to refer to a lack of capacity to feel and understand emotions.  Some psychopaths do have defficiency in processing emotions.

yes, its nice to have an older sister, if you find someone to fit the job, then take them up on it...but dont let them rule your life, as my older sister did, till I got married and she could no longer boss me around.



dont get me wrong, love her to death, but bossy, man she can take the Oscar on this subject.



yes, it is nice...

I have had problems and my older sister wasn't always much help. She's cool and all but. . . yeah. I kind of don't want to burden her with my problems either, or have her know them, even. I never do, but I asked her for advice and wasn't much help. But that's not weird at all. It's normal, a lot of people I know wish they had an older sibling. My little brother does too. He wants an older brother but he got two older sisters instead. =P

i have always tried to fill the void of my father and older brother. my dad drank a lot and traveled a lot when i was growing up and my brother was abusive to me, threatened me and i just wanted both of them to love me. it directly related to my relationships with men and the type of man i chose and how i acted in the relationship. i have been able to change that behavior and fill that void with myself and my own good thoughts, respect for myself, and love for myself.



i've had a lot of past issues too and i am 15 months free of those issues. i do a lot of work to change my thought patterns and behaviors but its so worth it.



you can't change the cards you're dealt..just how you play the hand. you can't change that you don't have an older sister, but you can start changing how you try to fill that void.

I'm not sure if there is an official name for it (yet), but I think anything done in excess that interferes with getting necessities accomplished in your life can be considered an addiction.



Try limiting yourself to a certain number per day and see if that helps.  If you find it difficult you might try talking to a counselor.

Denise,



First of all I am sorry for the loss of your mother.



Grief is a process.  It takes at least 5 years to get through a day
without thinking about the loved one, then something will happen
that will trigger it.  It is important to recognize these grief triggers
and deal with them.  I have linked to an excellent article on grief
triggers.  Please read it.



It is the anniversary coming up and that is why you are bummed out.
You have every reason to feel this way.  Don't let people tell you
that you should be better by now after 7 years.  Everyone deals
with grief in their own manner which makes it normal for them.



If you feel overwhelmed by it and very depressed, please seek
the help of a qualified licensed psychologist  who specializes
in grief counselling.  Also there are groups you can go to meetings
of for support who have lost a loved one.  Call your local mental
health center for information about that.



I am so sorry for your loss and I hope this has in some way helped.

it depends on the type of depression.  I suffered terribly with post natal depression after having my children.  I was prescribed citalopram which did help relieve the feelings of depression, but I also found that gentle exercise and making myself get up and go out of the house even if it was for half an hour really helped turn me around.  CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy) is also a good way of dealing with the depressive thoughts that can overwhelm you - helps you look at things in a different way and help you put a positive light on your life.



Good luck

Yes, there are other things that can help your depression other than anti-depressants.  They are not designed to cure all your problems but to lift your mood enough for you to do the rest of the work needed for you to feel better.



If you arent currently recieving some kind of talking therapy then I would suggest you go to your GP and ask to be referred to one like counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy.  This can help you work on the way you think, identify negative thought patterns and stop yourself spiralling into them.  Waiting lists can be long for cbt though.  Your GP should also be able to give you a list of recommended self-help books.  There are a lot of them out there that claim to be able to cure depression but have little evidence behind them.



There are various other things you can do to help you keep on top of your exercise like eating healthily and excercising if you can.  See if there are any support groups for people with mental health problems in your area.  Being abe to spend time with people who understand can be a big help.  Lots of people find meditation very helpful in calming their mind.



Good luck.

If they are severely depressed then sadly, meds are their best way. Someone mildly depressed can learn new thinking techniques and try to establish more positive thoughts, counting ones blessings each day, smiling at things my kids say, capturing  the sunlight and seeing nature up close in the country , a small walk each day even if the weather is dull gives a boost to seratonin levels even in miserable auld Glasgow. Happy movies, good times ,going bowling or a fun day out, and  reading amusing books. Painting ,even as it needs a relaxed mind to  be able to do artwork.



There are many ways to lift a mild case of the blues. To relieve really bad lifelong depression is to uncover the reason you have it  , if it is a chronic ailment it can be relived but never cured I think and a Dr would have to advise that person further than a novice such as myself.

I went to an ECT consultation. The Dr recommended Cognitive therapy (which I notice others have mentioned) It helped me a lot.



Also, I was actually misdiagnosed and didn't have depression. i have Bi polar 2. I have looked for a site to show you but I couldn't find a suitable one. Bi polar 2 is a lot milder that bi polar. I didn't even know I had a hypomanic episode til I realized I was exceptionally happy, chatty and energetic on vacation 2 yrs ago. Most of the time I felt depressed. Anti-depressants will not work with bi polar, only mood stabilizers. It is definitely worth a look.

ECT is pretty much a last option. It is a surgical procedure, requires general anaesthetic and is used if anti depressants do not work. ECT works by using electricity to change parts of the brain, and causes a seizure to try and "reset" a section of the brain, in much the same way a defibrillator resets a heart in fibrillation.



There are natural remedies such as St Johns Wort that are good for depression. Just check with your doctor that this is not going to interact with other medications. Exercise is also great, along with drinking tea.



Before we go too far, lets determine the difference between chronic (clinical) depression, and acute depression (known as the blues).



Clinical depression is a long term illness caused by imbalance of serotonin in the brain. The modern antidepressants, such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) work on this by interfering with the reuptake process of serotonin. This slows down the degradation and reuptake of the serotonin leaving more available in the brain. Serotonin is the feel good hormone. Clinical Depression is long term.



Acute Depression (the blues) is caused by a multitude of factors, and can be stress, having a bad day, financial strain, etc. This is short term and generally resolves itself once the source is resolved.



There is a new treatment here in Australia that is being used in the US that is showing promise for patients with clinically diagnosed depression is Deep Magnetic Resonance Therapy, that uses magnetic waves in much the same way as ECT, but it is a lot safer and does not require a general anasthetic.



Speak to your specialist about other options if you feel that medications are not a good option.

If you love the time-proven natural way...
I'm going to provide you with the real secret to get rid of depression forever.
Depression only happens in the subcortex,never in neocortex. Remember this. And you must learn how to wanish your brain to get rid of the depression in one minute a day, usually in the morning as a first thing you'll do. The secret is literally brainshift you out of your depression anytime it comes down upon you. How you'll do it ? Simply, leave subcortex thought"I am depressed", enter immediately into neocortex by thinking any think you want or comes spontaneous to you.



Brain swich can save your life.
I put below a short extras from my article about this subject , to inspire you. Take from it what you like.



Here's proven natural remedies for any kind of depression once forever...
Ten ways to successfully get rid of depression.
1} Important defense mechanism has spinach, , beetroot lettuce with much lemon juice and olive oil.POWER BENEFIT: In depression your blood has tendency to be acidic. You need to try neutralize this situation What I said above has high nutritional value and alkalizing quality. As a result, you'll start to feel energetic, useful to yourself and others.
2} Blueberries. Fresh or frozen, not to mention it tastes absolutely delicious, two servings daily for two weeks. POWER BENEFIT: struggle against feeling of guilt and loss of interest in ordinary activities.
3} Carbohydrates, and vitamin B-complex supplement. Depression is a cruel killer that shape cyclic human hormonal reality into delicious desert. The more tryptophan enters your brain, the more serotonin will be produced to kill that killer. Get rich tryptophan eating banana, apple and kiwi. POWER BENEFIT : combat thoughts of suicide and irritability.
4} Get Omega 3. This makes sense physiologically since omega 3 works on neurotransmitter pathways in the brain. Also, omega 3 keeps the blood wessels of the brain free from blockages It also helps in boosting up the nerve cells to function at a higher level. Because omega 3 is found in Oceanus fish and eggs and if you want only fruits and vegetables then take omega 3 supplement.
5} Daily walking in the sun. It produces a brain chemical called dopamine which help maintain mental equilibrium But before you leave your home eat milk, yogurt or salmon,tomatoes,cucumber and /or broccoli.
6} Out, find a place where you can express your emotions aloud . For example cry if you feel inside like crying. This is an act of courage and in the same time, shows your progress. Immediately after this, it can't be less than a big happy moments.
7}Selenium,vitamin B 12, for the" feel-good " brain receptors. The take away from it is that you need eat brown rice,nuts,seeds and liver.
8} Drink a lots of mineral water with pH above from 7.4
9} Breakfast cereals .Don't forget it.
10} Breathing exercises on daily basis,the most powerful line to cure depression because a high need of brain for oxygen.
I hope I helped you a bit.
Good health to you.

I really think you need to speak to a close relative or friend or even a good teacher. No one should have to suffer abuse like this from anyone especially your own mother. Do you have a favourite aunt or uncle you could confide in. I so feel for you having to go through this as it will impact on the rest of your life and any relationships you have. If she is hitting you then go to the police, this is a criminal act. If you are marked in anyway take pictures as evidence.
My heart goes out to you. I hope you find help very soon.

The only reason why a religious fanatic would say that alternative medicine is evil, is simply because they do not know or understand how it works. And unfortunately those kinds of people almost always refuse to educate themselves on such matters, staying superstitious and close minded. How could something that deals with the inner working of someones mind be evil? It's not like the therapists are telling people to worship the devil while they are in trance. To find out more on what it is and how it works, just go to wikipedia.

i believe the root of the belief in hypnotherapy being evil comes from the fear of losing control



i have never heard people say this,



i think we should not be so quick to call people stupid, you are putting control of yourself into another persons hands, while scientific studies have shown hypnotherapy to be beneficial in some cases, there is still a lot to be wary of.

Several reasons:



1) You need to catch up on sleep from the day before.
2) You are ill.
3) You have to work off-shifts at your job.
4) You are depressed.
5) Regular nap time.

It could be for a number of reasons. Maybe you did not have a good nights rest, maybe you are bored or maybe you are unwell. How long do you sleep for during the day? How old are you?

I am never under stress. I sleep VERY well. Stress comes from a realization that we have lost control. I understand control is an illusion, so, I choose to accept challenges that are mine with enthusiasm. If a challenge is brought to me that is not mine, I simply refuse delivery...

I was in an abusive relationship~ which ended up leading me to have post traumatic stress disorder.  I compared it to a nervous breakdown.
This is caused from somthing horrible happening personally to a person~ its an after-effect.



Years later I got Fibromyalgia. One of the symptoms that goes along with the fibro, is chronic stress disorder. This is because the hormone that handles my stress' tolerance is lowered, actually in my case its depleted. I found out through blood testing. Its from being sick, that I have the imbalance and will always have the chronic stress disorder.



Hope this helped you some~

Just being there for when he needs you and listening to him when he wants to talk. You seem to be very supportive of him. Don't treat him as an invalid just treat him as normal. Don't let him dwell on his condition or start to feel sorry for himself. there are lots of other sports he can try like swimming, maybe he could even try horse riding. Good luck and bless you for being his friend.

Tell him that you can't control what happens to you, in life, to a large extent. What you can control, however, is your attitude to it. You can either choose to let it get you down, or make a conscious decision to rise above it, look at your options, and make the wisest decision possible, preferably by sleeping on it.



Maintain a positive outlook, and be determinedly optimistic, even when the circumstances don't warrant it, for the benefits it will bring, later. People who do this live happier, healthier and longer lives. If you become aware that you have backslid into your former internal monologue, (self talk) use the technique for reprogramming negative thoughts, in section 2, and 2L, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris and see MAKE GOOD CHOICES! HOW TO MAKE CORRECT DECISIONS, in section 28.



Nerves outside of the central nervous system have the ability to regenerate, to some extent, which can be maximised by keeping on trying to activate the functions of the area which was affected. Good nutrition is helpful in building nervous tissue.



Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it.

hiya hun i had a baby 12 months ago!



sounds like you maybe depressed you should speak to your health visitor or gp they will help you.
i am recovering from post natal psychosis (i heard voices, was cutting myself etc) so i dont think you have that but i believ i got post natal psychosis because i didnt get help when i had post natal depression.
post natal depression is a hormone inbalance so it is an illness, it can be easily put right with some medication (which you can take if your breastfeedibng) are you still with your partner? talk to him, tell him how you feel and ask him to go to the gp with you.

All those are symptoms of depression. With a 9 mnth old baby you are probably suffering from post natal depression. Go to the docs, dont do what I did and think " it wont happen to me" My son is 6 now and I still have problems because I didnt get it treated soon enough. I was always in tears, and thinking everything was my fault.
Good luck, I hope you feel better soon, and Im sure you are a brill mum so please dont worry.

Talk to your Dr or health clinic about your feelings.  Discuss what you are feeling and how you feel on a day to day basis.  They will be able to help you more than anybody as they are equipped to diagnose the symptoms and then help sort out the problem.



Depression can be caused by having a baby and it doesn't necessarily start as soon as you have the baby.  Things can be going along quite fine and then all of a sudden you have irrational emotional swings and you can't explain them.



Please seek help from a professional - not self help on the internet.  It is much better to talk to somebody about this on a one to one basis.  Then and only then will they be able to determine what help you need.

i had a horrible experience with concerta(extended release ritalin to treat add/adhd) that kinda messed me up alot.since i stared takin at a young age, i never really socially developed well. I stopped takin it for 2 years.Last saturday, i started taking it again, i got rlly happy and focused the first day, but the next was like a trip through hell, i was twitchy(my legs wouldnt stop shaking, stiff, angry, confused,paranoid, scared of everything around me ,hallucinating(rare side affect of add/adhd drugs).I was on the lowest dose available, a dose givin to 70 pound first graders, and im 130 pounds.That was 2 days ago, and im almost back to normal.I would rather have something "wrong with me mentally than ever be some inhuman medicated drone.In the end its the affected persons choice, not their parents, and i feel that many parents fail to realize what medicating their children may do to them.



and kathryn R, have u ever been medicated for a mental disorder, dont go around talking about something that u may know nothing about, and by the way, add/adhd meds have only been proven safe and effective in short term studies,and in combination with the fact that adhd is a complex and varying disorder, medicine is a hit or miss

Yes!! if that's what it takes to make someone stable and able to deal with the rest of the world.  Why are people questioning this?? If someone had cancer would you tell them not to participate in chemo if that's what it took to get them well???  There's a reason that the most affective treatment for depression and other psychological illness is a combination of talk therapy and medication.  Because it works!  We need to stop denying the effectiveness of medication in treating mental health.  This is the 21 century not the 19 and we know a lot more about the way that the brain works than we did than.  We need to use what we have to make life as comfortable as possible for people who suffer from mental illness.

topamax is a good one i have been on it for 7 yrs know and it actually helps people lose weight.they use it for a mild mood stabilizer for fat people to loose weight and it is an antiseizuree medication i am on it for being bipolar it helps my moods.it has worked great for me so ask the doctor about putting you on topamax.at least try it see how it works for you.i have been on the prozac and all the others topamax was the only one that really helped me.

<question>



Diagnosis? Could I be Bipolar?



I'm sixteen.
And mostly this year I've been feeling a little down and things, and I think it has got worse. Since August I have noticed it a lot more, and am starting to get worried.



I've always had little self-esteem and no confidence, but I was okay with it, it wasn't too bad.
But since not getting the exam results I had hoped for and not getting into college it has really knocked my self-esteem and confidence even more.
I cry at little things, sometimes I even feel like crying in public and I don't even know what at. But I never have cried in public, I don't like to it makes me embarrassed "/ I guess I don't like showing weakness. But usually when I'm at a party or whatnot and I'm drunk, I cry, and I have no idea why, I never have a valid reason.
I don't have a job or go to college or anything yet because I haven't found anything.



So I've had days where I just stay in and don't go out "/
And I'm tired like all the time. I normally stay up until like 4 in the morning, go to bed and wake up at 2pm. So that's 10 hours. And even then when I've just woken up I'm tired. And then I can go to bed at midnight, just 10 hours after I woke up and still stay in bed until midday.
Two days I've stayed in bed nearly fourteen hours.
I don't think that is normal, is it?
But mostly I've gotten REALLY angry, like all the time. Someone says one little thing to annoy me and I just get so angry and throw something near me, not caring what it is.



Today, I got really angry at my mom for not even something that big and I went up to my room, slammed my door and knocked over my shelf thing that has all my dvds, cds, etc. on.



So it like proper crashed to the floor, it didn't break through thank god.
But I just don't care at the time what I'm throwing, sometimes I get urges to just throw my phone at the wall when I'm angry, but I don't. I just punch the wall instead.
It really gets my parents down and I just don't know what to do about it.
Help?
Thankss.

I'd say you should go to a dr. about this asap, from what you just described here you're going through major mood swings that might be out of hand to control, infact while your young it'd be best to get looked at by a professional in time, wish you luck.

first of all any meds are going to bother you if you read the side effects etc.  if all you hear is neg you will look for it. plus you just had a baby, that is a challenge emotionally and phsically so chill out and let the meds kick in for about 3 weeks and if it aint right see the doc there is definitly no shortage of meds out there.  i take cymbalta and i like it

Some doctors prescribe Celexa and small doses of Xanax together. This has worked for me and I have had no side effects other than some weight gain. Each antidepressant works different on each person. If one makes you feel strange, have the doctor try another. Paxil worked best for me but there was weight gain also. That's why I switched to Celexa and recently went back down to 20 mg. It is not supposed to cause you to gain weight but with me, I believe it was the Paxil taken prior that started it.

How do you know if you're mentally stable?



the fact that i'm asking the question probably suggests that i'm not. i'm bipolar and have had two manic episodes the past 3 years, and now i'm "fine" (read:stably depressed). so i'm asking you normal people out there, how do you know you're mentally stable. what defines mental stability?

Does this sound like borderline personality disorder?



I was recently diagnosed with BPD, however the psychiatrist diagnosed me after spending only 10 minutes with me. I was just wondering if anyone else diagnosed with BPD experiences any of these symptoms.



- can't handle change, the smallest thing that i can't control makes me really anxious.



- contradict myself whilst i hate change i get so bored and long for something new
- feeling everything magnified,



- feeling restless and empty
- whilst every emotion feels magnified i also feel dead, like there is nothing in my life and life is too slow
- find it hard to interact with people, always feel trapped with men and like i need to be liked best with friends to the point where i like other friends falling out as i feel it makes me look good.
- get close to people and then push them away, not deliberately but to the point where they can't forgive me.
- mood swings for no apparent reason, sometimes really depressed and can't get out of bed, other times really hyper
- v. self destructive, self harming, drink driving
- constant uneasiness within my own skin
- get obsessed with people and dependant on them
- difficulty distinguishing between real life and dreams and tv.



Any insight you could give will be greatly appreciated.

bpd and bipolar are actually semi linked. they can have many symptoms in common such as the manic and depressive phases. a sign that it's bpd though is what you described as "feeling dead" and having trouble interacting, that shows periods of disassociation common with bpd.

It could be BPD or depression, simple depression can cause all these symptoms, but you can't be diagnosed over the internet either. Try counselling and see if that helps. I think too many people are titled with having a mental illness, when all they really need is help and support. You may be able to find a support group in your area that can help you cope with simple things. Do you actually have anyone to talk to? That can also be a problem if you don't feel you can open up to anyone about why you have these anxious feelings!

It's unlikely that you have BPD, most of those symptoms are true of anyone to a certain degree. Psychiatrists are diagnosing all manner of disorders from Asperger's to BPD at the drop of a hat and it's very wrong. It is a worrying new phenomena and it needs to stop. An in-depth analysis of the patient (including observation) is required to determine a serious mental condition but it's rarely done seemingly.

if you don't die you will mess up your liver permanently and die a slow painful death.  you will gain no respect and if its self inflicted I doubt you will get much support.  so i suggest you don't contemplate it.  if you have problems talk to someone official not anyone on here.  if you've taken these tablets already I suggest you get down to the hospital asap.  once they start absorbing into your blood stream then its too late.

because you have just woken from a night sleep.  your body is wide awake and so are you.  refreshed.  as the day draws on you are going to get tired.  i find i crash around 3pm. i perk back up but once tea is done and i sit down in fron tof the tv of a night i useually cannot not get motivated!



i find that if i eat something sugary it will help perk me up. or a red bull!  but getting tired in the evening isn't bad you know,, its human nature!



perhaps you need to eat something a bit healthier and more carbs for lunch..?  go for a walk to strech your legs.  if you are stuck in an office all day its understandable that you are going to get tired.

This question has been asked here on yahoo answers many times so I'm sure if you browse through those it will help. Otherwise, simply googling "bipolar symptoms" will bring you many sites. No site is an awful lot better than any other site because the information is the same on most. However, if you find a site that quotes the DSM IV TR that will be the most accurate. Good luck!

ahuh try looking up the DSM-IV-TR it has all the symptoms of all mental disorders.
But i know about Bipolar a little



Okay there are types of Bipolar i know there is atleast 2 which are simple I and II.  One involves a Major Depressive Episode and a Manic Episode and the other a Major Depressive Episode and a HYPOmanic Episode.
Basically you have to have both with a certain time period.  Its usually more like you are sad for maybe two weeks then really agro another two weeks not as most people think angry one minute happy the next.
Anyway you just look up DSM (don't need the IV-TR its just stands for fourth text revision) Bipolar and criteria.  it will give you the criteria that most psych's use to diagnose patients.
I used it to diagnose Hamlet with Bipolar Not otherwise Specified for a Oral!



Hope that helps

Why has everything suddenly changed?



Last year was fun- maybe my favorite year of school.
Until around the end, and a lot of bad things happened.
More happened during the summer.
It came to the point where I might have been depressed.



I feel better though.
Still quiet-always have been.



This year, my people skills are incredbly low.
Like last year- I rocked out LOUD at subtle flirting.
I can't just randomly do that this year.
And I hate that.
=/
lol



Anyway, I /am/ thirteen, but I did most of this "teen maturing to someone...a little more mature' like two years ago.
What's wrong with me?
Am I still depressed, are my people skills just to low or what?

Hormonal changes at your age can cause different attitudes or make you feel insecure. You are probably fine. But if you are really concerned I suggest you talk to a parent or if that is not an option, talk to your school councilor.

It seems high, yes.  I am on 20mg, and that was bumped up from the smallest dosage of 10mg.



That said, if your partner is happy to take them, and as long as you and he have enough trust in your doctor, chances are he does need that dosage.



In my personal experience of Citalopram, it's quite an ineffective drug anyway, so perhaps 30mg isn't as strong as you might fear.

i used to do it and i stopped by myself. i used to love the feeling of being in control of something by myself.  no one could interfere or tell me what to do.  i used to love the feeling of pain, it used to make the real pain of life go away.  i used to bleed and soak things and i used to think wow look at that my blood.



i decided in the end that it wasn't getting me anywhere, i wasn't gaining anything from doing it.  nothing bad in my life was changing because i was doing it. what was the point.  no one knew i was doing it so it wasn't like i had people running around me going ooooh what have you done silly girl...how can we help.  nothing changed.



i'm glad i did because i have scars to show for all my stupid efforts.  i am a mum myself now and a lot of the scars have healed.



my biggest bout of happiness came when i left school and left home.  that changed everything.  i became happier within myself.  i was in control and it was MY LIFE.  i started smoking which probably was a lot better than self harming!  i began to drink of a night out.  i gained friens and i became more confident because of it.



so things can turn themselves around.  you just nneed to get your self out of the rut your in and change the way you think.  everything happens for a reason and you will find that its good that you have learn't some negative things in life.  if everything was good all the time it would set us up for a great big fall.  take the rough with the smooth and we can all be ok.

You would lose friends faster.  I had a friend that was extremely obnoxious on Prozac.  Once in a while he would go off of it and well...........I haven't talked to him in years.  You could look up the word obnoxious and there was a picture there of him waving at you.

I dont know what the side effects are of just stopping your Prozac, possibly similar to the side effects when you started it if you had any. I would strongly advise you against just stopping your medication, it could cause you lots of problems.  If you really want to come off it, it isnt much hassle to go to your doctor and explain.  He or she will be able to advise you on gradually coming off it, and you can discuss other treatment options.  Take care.

Well it really depends on your situation. If the cause of these suicidal thoughts could be depression or something similar to that, you will most likely be put on anti-depressants.



However, you'd better get yourself a medical evaluation first. They will determine the proper treatment. It could just be some therapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and other treatments like that.)



if your case is serious enough, you will be prescribed some kind of anti-depressant. These could be, for example, Fluoxetine (otherwise known as Prozac) - which is a SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor). There are loads and loads of different types of anti depressants though - ones for different ages, seriousness, environmental benefactors etc.



Well good luck whatever you choose. I'm still not better myself but...I'm getting there

How to diagnose a mental illness?



Because there is so many types of mental illnesses from mild to depression to full blown schizophrenia how can you be diagnosed with the exact mental illness that you have because I feel like I have much more than one illness and the doctor wont make an accurate decision on the type of mental illness that I have, and I fear I could be put onto medication that could make me even worse. In my GP appointments I also miss so much out when the doctor asks me my feelings like I will tell him part of the problem but I never am able explain the full picture which makes me paranoid I may never escape my unknown mental illnesses. However I am keeping a record of my thoughts and feelings on a daily basis so do you think it will be a good idea to show this to my GP even though some of the things are embarrassing

For your confusion, there are so many mental illness out there and each one them with their own characteristic. However there are possibility that one person can have more than one mental illness. Maybe it is why your GP doesn't (or couldn't) tell you what is your mental illness because it is so many (it is a big thick book).



About the mental illness medication, there aren't so many medication group that you can have, there just would be anti-psychosis, anti depression, mood stabilizer. i think that is the major drug group.



However, the medication is depend on your illness severity, so it is a good idea to tell your GP about your feeling, your thought, your paranoid, etc. so that your GP can see how severe you are.

I take it you are under some sort of professional care?  If not, please find some - your G.P should be able to refer you to a Psychiatrist or Mental Health Team.  Sounds like you need some people to come alongside you and give you a hand with how you are feeling.  It's not your fault, and try not to worry yourself sick over the future right now; believe me, I've been in your position, for a much longer period of time.  With the right help and a change in circumstances there is a potentially happy existence for you to come.  Hold in there.

Life is worth living!! We all have trials and tribulations. You can pull out of this! Try to get some help. Maybe work is what you need to pull you out of this slump. Sometimes when we are being productive it works for us and ca pull us out of depression. Please don't do anything stupid. I know you are most likely feeling abandoned right now but worse off one of the people abandoning you is you. Don't give up. Sometimes when nothing feels like it is going right God is working very diligently behind the scenes. Please pray that God helps you find the strength to want to live. You can do it. I will keep you in my prayers. Think about the job thing! You have to do something and it might be just what you need. NEVER GIVE UP. God Bless! Hang in there.

Sometimes being socially inactive actually keeps people in a cycle of depression from which they cannot escape.  If you have been assessed as capable of work then give it a try, it may help your recovery. But you won't know until you give it a go.

Sorry to say this since its not what you're looking for, but from what you have written I don't see what is so bad. We all have $ trouble. I'm sure there is more to it that you haven't expressed here. Depression doesn't make it easier, I know. Try talking to a professional, they may not help at all but then again they might. I just fear that you'll take the advice of someone on here that is ill-willed. A doctor will have your best interest in mind. Take care and stare at the clouds.

Hey there.



Sometimes things can be really tough and it's like you can never see an end to the problems. But, you have to hang in there because you never know what's around the next corner, you never know how you're going to feel tomorrow. Something could happen to make a situation so much better.



Do you know where your depression stems from? If not, hypnotherapy may help. Also, you should ask the doctor about cognitive therapy. If you do know where your depression stems from, cognitive therapy could really help you.



I know it's not easy when things are really tough, but try and be you. Try and change the way you look at the things which are making you depressed. I know it's something a lot of people say, but say to yourself in the morning when you wake up 'today, I am happy, healthy and energised' and keep your focus on that positive trail of thought throughout the day. When the old thoughts of depression creep back in, don't dwell on them, don't even fight them, let them come and let them go and just focus on the new positive thoughts. Try it tomorrow and see how you feel at the end of the day.

I feel trapped and dead and have run out of options where relief is concerned; advice needed please.. ?



I've battled with severe Fibromyalgia for 5 years and find the tiredness, depression and complete lack of energy difficult to cope with. I've seen hospital consultants and my GP and have been put on the ant-depresent Amitripyline (have been on it for a month now). I've noticed positive effects where muscle pain is concerned, but I still can't shake this consistent feeling of deadness and unhappiness.



2 years ago, I felt bubbly and confident, but I just feel like a shell now. I'm getting married next year to my perfect soul mate, so I should be so content, but I just feel numb and void of energy.



I hate my job, where I loved it last year (editing and selling advertising space for a magazine) and hate where I live because of the constant noise made by our neighbours. Weekends are the worst, so I usually spend most of the weekend crying in bed with ear plugs in pretending I'm ill.



We're stuck in our rented house because of financial reasons and I can't change my job because I work for 'the family business'. My mum keeps telling me that the business would collapse and my step dad would have a break down if I left. My mum is unaware that my step dad is alcoholic and spends every afternoon getting drunk in his local while I'm busy in the office. He's a letcherous, sluring idiot when he's drunk, so I pray every day that I can leave before he gets back from the pub.



My Fiance told me a couple of weeks ago that I've lost my spark. He's being so kind and loving, but I can see he's getting frustrated and I'm terrified I'll loose him. I'm desperate to feel normal and full of energy and life again. Please, if anyone has got any advice, I would be very grateful.

My heart really goes out to you. Getting out of depression sometimes isn't easy but it can be done.



First confide in your Fiancé as to how you are really feeling. Don't keep it all bottled up, you aren't alone in this.



Second get yourself some councelling it will help you see the bigger picture and should give you skills to help you cope with things. Then you will be better able to handle all of those other problems.



Good Luck with getting better.

Oh poor you, physical illness has really brought you down low, Go back and see your doctor maybe the antidepressant isn't quite the right one for you and maybe counselling or a pain clinic might be right for you. You may be eligible for a benefit such as Disability living allowance which might improve your income enough for you and your fiance to consider moving to a nicer home. Work is a difficult issue for you, the obvious solution is to change jobs but in the current financial climate that might not possible or the right thing to do. Mum may well know her husband is a drunk but try to arrange it so she is in the office when he is missing and when he rolls in drunk. Lots of luck

Have I got depression?



I thought my low self esteem came from my acne, but now it's gone and I still feel like crap. I constantly live in a fantasy world where I pretend I'm somebody else (in my head) and read Harry Potter fan fiction on the internet, obsess crazily over TV shows and sometimes I think so much my head hurts. I lately haven't been brushing my hair on weekends, brushing my teeth etc. I do on school days, but now I have graduated and am extremely worried. I used to be so active and fit...now I have sleeping issues and feel that every one hates me. I am negative, but am naturally very strong minded and witty. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME? HOW CAN I FIX IT?!



</question>



<additional details>



I also feel nervous when I speak to other people. I never go out to parties or anything either. All I do is sit at home. I get upset when other people tell me this. I have always been very shy, but this is just different. I feel like I've been left behind whilst every one else has changed.

I think that possibly you could have mild depression. Sounds like me on my depressed days. I was diagnosed with it when I was like 12, but I think perhaps you should ask your doctor or perhaps begin seeing a therapist. Taking an antidepressant will also really help you with your self esteem and sleeping issues. Until I started taking zoloft I was super shy and an insomniac. Now I'm really outgoing and I sleep like a log! :D Hope I helped you!

Maybe the combination isn't working for you.  Who prescribed this to you?  You should go to them and tell them its not working, don't just take yourself off you could get withdrawal.  If you do then you have to slowly get off.  Like 1 pill, half, etc... See your doctor.

It may or may not be, but from personal experience, I would say it definitely is. I couldn't take either of them for very long. What dosages are you on? You should decrease fairly slowly, but if they're low enough amounts and you think you could handle the withdrawal symptoms, quitting cold turkey is hard but it makes it easier in the long run. I would highly suggest speaking to the doctor that prescribed you both of these medications and seeing what the best way to come off of them would be.

Yes, it could be the meds.  First, talk to your doctor.  Then, tapering off is always best.  Start exercising because it will truly help with your depression and anxiety if you have that.  Exercise is cheap and has no negative side effects.  The good side effects include weight loss, better sleep, lower blood pressure, lower blood sugar, a sense of serenity and self-confidence.  You have nothing to lose by exercising.  Walking 30-60 minutes a day will net these benefits.  Good luck.

You should get the advice of the doctor who prescribed the meds on this one.  You have to be very careful.  My mother was on Paxil for a while when I was younger and went off of the stuff without consulting her doctor - she got so sick she ended up in the hospital! O_O It was only for a day but it was still pretty scary stuff.



The important thing will be tapering off of your medication and only your doctor will be able to give you appropriate advice on how to do this properly without endangering yourself.

I don't think it is advisable to take suggestions from unqualified strangers when it comes to medications subscribed by your physician.  No one here knows the medical reasons why you are on meds and it might do you more harm to just take yourself off of them.  Call or see your doctor and discuss your side effects with him/her.  It could be that you need to have the dosages adjusted or make a change in the type of medication.

Diagnosed with depression but, Could I be Bipolar?



I was diagnosed with unipolar depression a few years ago and have been on medication since. Recently my mum and I had a chat and she voiced her concerns that I may be Bipolar.



I have episodes of extreme depression often lasting a week or more and also have periods that I can only describe as being really good. There are normal periods in-between.



During the "ups" I can be extremely hyper, very happy or irritable (I can switch between these two emotions very quickly), and experience a lot of creativity (I only paint when in these moods and often can not stop until it's completed). I find it very difficult to switch off and sleep during this time. When in this mood I have been known to clean the house from top to bottom (incl. re-grouting tiles) and I once painted and decorated an entire kitchen on my own - not stopping until very late at night.



I get on at work well - my co-workers generally find me hard working and good fun. I do have days where I fly through everything and then end up re-jigging our filing system or something. The times I have issues are when I am very down and can't stop crying (although this has only affected work once)



The high days only last a few days, never really longer than a week, sometimes they can be very rapid transitions between high and low - I have to say I thought this to be rather normal. But mum says she's noticed it more since I moved out of home and that she's worried about me.



I spoke to my Fiance about this and he doesn't think i'm bipolar but he is always commenting on my changing moods and he fact that one minute i'm up and one minute I am so down he starts hiding medication and sharp things.



I have taken self-assessment tests on various sites and the scores have come back rather high (saying I am displaying bipolar tendancies).



Anyone out there who knows a little more about this, or who has expereinced it - can you please give me you opinions or advice?



</question>



<additional details>



Edit: I have booked an appointment with my G.P for tomorrow. It's playing on my mind a bit - I always thought that the High/Hyperactive stages was just a part of me! Bit scared that it might be a problem. I don't know if that makes sense to anyone.



I know that no one but a professional can diagnose me - I suppose I want confirmation that I'm not wasting the doctors time.

You would need to see a doctor for an accurate diagnosis, but if the "switches" seem to last for a longer period of time, it could easily be bipolar. If they can change in just a day or less and they're very quick mood swings, look into borderline personality disorder. I behave the same way that you do, but it changes pretty much multiple times during just a day.

No one on this site can tell you but if you have concerns then it is best to talk things over with your mental health team. Although we cannot tell you if you are or not, i thought i would tell you about my situation. I was assessed for bipolar and had all the classic symptoms like you but the reason why they did not class it as bipolar is because like you i could function properly at work while on a high. I had the highs and lows although my lows did affect my working life but when i was 'high' i coped very well at work and could go about the day without having any problems. When you are bipolar and in a high mood you would not be able to concentrate at work you would experience too many racing thoughts etc and the staff would be able to tell a difference. Also you are able to function when you had a low day which if you were bipolar you would not be able to do. I had a low moments and ran away from work, which worried the hell out of everyone. Like i said i was classed as not having bipolar but if you do have concerns then get it checked out. Good luck

Should I start taking medication for depression?



My Mom has depression and my Grandmother is an alcoholic.  I spoke to a therapist who told me that depression can run in the family and she thinks I may have it (but I did only see her for 4 visits).



My Mom has been telling me for the past couple years that she thinks I'm depressed and it seems to be getting worse.  I really don't want to go on medication for it because I'm only 22 and I don't want to get dependent on it and have to take it for the rest of my life.  I have looked at a lot of ways to fight without meds- ex: exercise, change in diet and natural meds.  (I have yet to try any of these).



I'm not sure if I should talk to my doctor about getting on medication.  Anyone have an advice or words of encouragement on what to do?

Fear of water [ help needed ]?



Hey I'm 19 year old male and I've developed a fear from water. I have never been to pools in my life and a beach. I remember when I was around 14 my dad threw me in the beach ( he thought it was a joke ) and now I have a fear of going into pool eg puttin my head under water and going in deep water.



I was wondering why is this happening to me, how can i stop this fear of me being in the water.



My friends ask me lets go pool/beaches etc but I tell them I dont enjoy it and that I cant swim ( i cant even float ).



can someone please explain why do i experience this.

You obviously had a traumatic experience. You can try to conquer your fear by going to the beach/pool alone and going at your own pace into the water. Counseling may also be helpful for you to put those fears behind you.

I had that same exact fear. All it took for me was facing my fear though. I learned how to swim before I could walk so that wasn't really an issue. If you go to the Y and get swim lessons there you can get one on one attention which may help you and they don't make you put your head under right away so you can slowly adjust to the idea of water.

The best thing to do is just face your fear. Or just keep going over the experience of being in a swimming pool in your head until you're comfortable with it. Then go to the beach or pool and try your hardest to get in the water.

At first I thought you have hydrophobia - a rabbies disease. Now it is clear you have psychological fear arising from your father's action. He should have continued till you got used to it.



To solve this problem, start going to the pool. First walk in and stand on shallow areas and bath. Gradually sit in with head out, and eventually dip your head. You will overcome the fear. You can do all these in a day. Cheers!

I think you should go to your doctor and discuss these things with him/her. Hopefully they will refer you to a mental health nurse and they will take you to the next step. This may be medication or therapy. I personally think tablets are the last result as i have been on and off them for years (i am 25) and everytime i came off i went back to the way i was and this is because i didn't sort the problem out emotionally which i am doing now in therapy and without tablets. So the best thing you can do is talk to a doctor and see what happens from there. Good luck x

First, I'd suggest you talk to a doctor or get a mental health screening to determine if you really are depressed. Don't just take your mom's word for it, although since she's depressed herself her opinion bears some weight.



If you are depressed, medication is a good idea, in addition to the methods you mentioned and also therapy. Bear in mind, though, that "natural" meds have not been shown to be very effective at all.



Antidepressants are not addictive (although there are withdrawal effects if you stop taking them too quickly). Going on antidepressants does NOT mean you have to take them for the rest of your life. In fact, the sooner you get treated, the less likely you'll be to need antidepressants later in life.



Finally, it is important to get depression treated as soon as possible. People who do not get treated are depressed longer and are much more likely to have severe problems with depression throughout their lives. The earlier you catch it, the better your chances of actually curing it.



You're a good candidate for treatment because you are so young. But again, you need a proper diagnosis first.



Take care.

Sounds as though you don't really want to use medication so talking therapies may be a better route for you to take, though you probably need to have more than 4 sessions.



It is true that certain types of depression have a genetic basis (at least partially) but this does not mean that just because your mother is depressed, you will be depressed too.  There are lots of other possible causes for depression.



It seems that there are some problems within your family and, at your age, you need to minimise any negative influences that come from that source and focus on the positive e.g. you may have a good relationship with your mum. However, maybe it's time to broaden your horizons and get out and about more, having lots of good, positive experiences with friends of your own age. You are right to think about and try different diets and exercise etc. both of which can have positive effects on feelings of depression.



Medication from your doctor, used short-term, can be helpful to get you over a really bad patch, but long-term it's not always a good idea. Having help from the right kind of psychotherapist or counsellor could give you the help you need to recover from the way you are feeling at the moment.  Good luck.

It works pretty well for mild depression, but you can't just take it when you feel depressed, you need to keep a steady level of it in your system. Go to a reputable whole-foods store to buy the capsules; they should have someone on staff who can answer your questions about dosages.

I guess that's why St. John's Wart never worked for me as I never took it for too long as I had prescription meds that worked fine. Studies showed that placebos without any medication worked just a well, so go figure. Anyway, with SRI's I saw a new way to think and eventually got off them. Listening to my intuition instead of my thoughts seemed to be the answer also. Thoughts are hard to control, but dropping negative words can control thought. We can't be negative without negative words. It's a longish journey, but in the end you can get in touch with your genius within, cope with life amazingly, better than the average bear and become the head and not the tail. So it becomes a real blessing in a world living in delusion, deception and backwards thinking. One man realized that his thinking had landed him in the psych hospital so he said that he reversed his thinking and thought his way back out.
The truth is that your thoughts change your body chemistry and even your genes. Wild research, huh? And I have a lot of it working for me. The problem is if you stop studying, as it's a fantastic world out there that we're are asleep to and if we stop studying and we miss out on all the research breakthroughs in every field that lets us deal with all the problems life can through at us forever. Gotta keep up, though. The right Knowledge really is power, first over ourselves and then who knows what.

Be very vocal with your therapist and psychiatrist about how you feel. They need to keep adjusting your medication until they find the right one for you. This is extremely important. Once you have the right medication, you will start to find it's easier to thinking positively.



Hang in there. Highschool can be really tough. Don't feel bad about being shy. A lot of people don't date until college. Also, try to keep your distance from your abusive friend. You're much better off alone than with someone who hurts you.

I would try a combination of exercise and meditation. Exercise...get outside and do brisk walking for 30 minutes a day. The negative feelings and thoughts you are having can be minimized and neutralized by meditation. Look on the net for techniques. The idea behind meditation in to be able to give your whole concentration to the minute you are living. It helps block out all the noise that is in your mind.

I suggest getting into some sort of school group or activity outside school to start making more friends.  I wish I had done the same in high school.



About your 'abusive friend' I've dealt with the same negativity and you need to speak up to her and tell you how you feel about it.  Chances are she doesn't know shes doing it and once you confront her she'll back down.  As for the problem with your sister I would tell her how you feel as well.  Tell her how upset it makes you that she's treating you that way.  (Trust me, I have 4 sisters and two of them are your age)



As for dating guys, I NEVER dated any guys from the high school I went too and don't get discouraged about it, there will be plenty of guys that you will eventually date over the years.  Just be patient and confident (guys love that).



As for the depression meds..I have NO IDEA!  I went to a therapist for depression and didn't feel like it was working either so I stopped going.



Good Luck hun! :)

Omg you are just like me! I'm also in 10th grade and overwhelmed by school, and I'm also shy.I have anxiety problems too. Just because you don't talk to boys doesn't mean you look like a lesbian. It's okay to be shy. Sometimes, boys can cause a lot of drama.



Do things you enjoy doing. Watch a funny movie or read a funny book. If you feel like you need to relax, then there are a few things you can do: take a bubble bath, try meditating, or maybe take a nap. Don't think about the things that bother you. Instead, set aside for yourself one time of the day to worry about everything, and tell yourself you won't worry anymore for the rest of the day (someone told me about that).



As for your abusive friend, she doesn't sound like a real friend. If she's just going to put you down, then she's not worth your time. Find some new friends by joining a club or something like that.



I know, school is very overwhelming sometimes, but before you know it, it will be over.



I hope this helps!  =)

Can you help me?? :( its controlling my life :/ ?



Last week I had a panic attack in maths but i haven't told my parents by the way.
It was because this boy was being a d**k to me :/
Now I have started to avoid maths in fear of having another panic attack :( like today I am "ill" :/
It was really embarressing & I'm afraid of it happening again. :(
How can I get over my fear of going into maths & panic attacks?? :(:(
Because if I keep missing maths I won't get a good GCSE :/
I'm fourteen if that's any help??

I missed a lot of school and I got barely any GCSE's. luckily I still managed to get to do A-levels.



The best thing to do would be to get this boy sorted out. Tell a teacher, go down the disciplinery route with him.



If that doesn't work, and you've told them a lot, Hit him.



To get over panic attacks... I'm not sure, Try telling yourself there is nothing to fear and try getting yourself into a good mood.

the best thing to do is to remain calm, you only start having panic attacks when you're overly worried or stressed about something, so obviously this boy is getting to you too much



try to change maths sets maybe? or move seats and tell your teacher about him
and if he ever harrasses you again just remember to remain calm because it will help



dont worry i would be embarased too if i was in your position, its really scary when everyones staring at you because of what hapened and it makes the situtation worse but i guess you just have to get through this and be brave

Your reaction is a physical problem brought on by too many stress hormones running through your body.  Do NOT label it psychological,,,, just  KNOW that that panicky feeling will stay gone IF you eat properly AND stand up for yourself when others are brats.  Be kkind , but be assertive when others treat you poorly.  This will make you have MORE strength and less stress hormones.

Have you been diagnosed with any anxiety disorder?  Was that your first panic attack?



Most often panic attacks are fight or flight or freeze response gone haywire.  You get a massive adrenaline rush that is not quite enjoyable.  Your muscles tightens (sometime causing chest pain mistaken as heart attack), feel like you are suffocating (high level of carbon dioxide in blood).



ong deep breathe, if you can walk around, do so, or tighten and relax your muscles when you are sitted.

First, you should talk to a teacher or counselor at school if you can't talk to your parents.  Stand up to this boy and tell him to back off.  Lastly, you have to learn to relax and take deep breathes when you feel a panic attack coming on.  Concentrate on why you are at school and tell yourself that you will not live your life by the way other people treat you.  You are miserable because of someone else, that's not fair.  Keep your head up and be strong.  Take control of the happiness you deserve!

Could this be the result of my depression?



I was diagnosed as having depression and I have a lot of the traits (long bouts of sadness, crying, no enjoyment in anything anymore, difficulty waking up, poor eating habits, etc.) I am in therapy but I am concerned about how I felt yesterday which is unusual.



Yesterday, I literally slept all day long. I woke up around 11 am for about an hour and then slept again, finally waking at 5 pm. I wasn't even really tired to sleep all day like that.



Also, when I was able to get up and take a walk outside, I felt so blah. My body had these unexplained aches and pains. It was weird because nothing has happened to me physically to feel that way.



Oh, and I went to bed incredibly early too (I think before 10 pm) and had a full nights sleep.



Do you folks with depression ever have these symptoms I just described?

Yes i think everyone with depression can relate to that. The best thing i found to do was get up, no mater how bad you feel. It will be better than staying in bed all day plus after a while if you continue with this sleeping habit you are doing at the moment you may find yourself unable to sleep when you should be, for example you sleep all day but will stay awake throughout the night. It may sound hard but force yourself out of bed at a reasonable time and go for a walk. But instead of thinking how bad you feel, shut your eyes and listen to the wind or the birds etc. Look at the trees or the leaves falling down. Sounds weird but that will take your mind of the negative things for a short while and if you continue to do that everyday you will find yourself doing it automatically. Good luck x

That happens to me too, when I'm very depressed. Are you on medication? Therapy is important, but if your depression is impacting your life this much, you should consider a course of antidepressants.

Negative emotions (like sadness, stress, anger, etc.) causes your Serotonin production to be low; when your Serotonin level is low, you are more prone to getting Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Depression, etc.



Medication like Antidepressants (SSRI - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) helps to boost Serotonin level.
But there are natural ways to do it without medication. There's this strange herb called "St John's Wort" - it is said to be more effective than Prozac. No, it is not for mild depression only and ignore those sayings. In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John's Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.



The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that "learned behavior" in your mind. You need to break that initial cycle to destroy that learned behavior - Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) does this. A technique that you can use without CBT will be Distraction... There are several other techniques to help cope them!
Ok, to use Distraction: Firstly, try to....

HI Dawn,



I suffer from panic attacks also, they can really interfere with life and make things unbearable.



First off your not a bad mom or wife because of them.



Second, panic attacks are related to depression. So I'm assuming there is some depression in your life.



Get to the bottom of your depression and see a doctor about both depression and panic disorder. Perhaps a therapist and some meds to help with the attacks may be a good start. Stay away from the addicting ones(benzos) as there are many others that can help.



Take care and never give up!

I really think you should seek guidance from either a counselor or a psychiatrist. I battle with anxiety for a long time! It really is crippling! I've learned to handle it for the most part, but lately it's been hard. I think we just hit points in our lives where the panic just returned. But I do think speaking with a counselor helps! Good luck! And hang in there!

I'm not diagnosed with anything, yet at least.. But i have had panic attacks, and my psychologist has said I have really high anxiety levels.



Yeah, panic attacks are a *****. But they usually pass in 15 min or so.



Train yourself to breathe deeply and slowly. Practice it at night when you are not having a panic attack so that later it is easier to apply when you are having one. Breathing slowly forces your body to slow down and will help to counter the adrenaline released with the attack.



But if you are having one, and you can't seem to get passed by your own efforts, just wait it out, really. If you stop fighting it, it'll come quicker, and get it over with.



You could try adding some peaceful and relaxing activities to your life, my psychologist has pushed yoga at me.



Getting enough sleep and generally living a healthy life should help do.



This doesn't not make you a bad mom or wife. As they say, it's the thought that counts, and you seem to care a lot about your son to be trying to overcome this. It's not like you choose to have an anxiety disorder, just like how someone doesn't choose to have cancer or something. It's just something you have to deal with by seeking help.



And on that note, seeking a psychologist may be helpful. But with this being about anxiety, it'd make sense that going to see someone might not seem like a good idea because it could trigger an attack. But do yourself a favor, and suffer through an attack or two in order to get a trained professional's opinion and perspective so they can help you. Seeing someone gets easier with each visit.



I hope this helps some. Best of luck.

Don't feel bad.
You're not a bad mom at all.
You actually have your son involved in extracurricular activities, etc.
That's good.
Not a lot of parents do that, or even care, or dedicate time to their loved ones.
You are making a change.
And even though these attacks may make it hard, the best thing is to face it.
I, myself, have dealt with panic attacks when I reached 21. I felt I was getting old, not doing much, not feeling happy, did not have people to support me.



Just stay busy.
Exercise. Maybe watch your son as he practices. Talk to him. Be his best friend. Don't worry if people may be watching you. You have to live your life, not theirs.



If things, people, make it harder. You have to just try and ignore and go along.

Is it possible to have done great in school, but still have ADHD?



My Sister is 39 years old and has never been diagnosed with any psychiatric problems.



When she was a kid, growing up, she was a straight "A" student, all the way to High School, but, she was ALWAYS a disciplinary problem.  She was actually expelled from one school in the fourth grade for behavioral problems (even though in the year prior, they wanted to double-promote her) and she spent MOST of her High School years in the dean's office or in detention, yet graduated with high honors.  She now has a husband and two kids and seems to be functioning O.K., except that she can NEVER sit still, she runs around the house like a tornado (yet never seems to finish anything) and she drives us crazy with her lack of time management.  She's always late and doesn't seem to grasp the concept of time, and she never has.  She has had EXCELLENT jobs in the past, but would eventually be fired for coming in late or not meeting deadlines because of her lack of concept of time.  Her children show no signs of any of this, except that she's always making THEM late for things now and she seems to get irritated quite easily.  She's just all-around "high-strung".



Our parents were poor and although they kept us healthy, they could not afford psychologists or psychiatrists and just chalked her up to being a brat.



My question is, is it possible for someone with ADHD to be smart and do as well in school academically as my sister has?  Also, she will not go to a psychiatrist, but I have convinced her to at least speak with her family doctor about it, but does a family doctor have the ability to write her a prescription for ADHD medicine?  I've seen other adults begin the medicine regimen and it changed their lives for the better.
Thank you :)



</question>



<additional details>



The ONLY reason I'm interefering NOW is because of the kids.  Her husband is a workaholic and usually oblivious and the kids are OFTEN late for school, activities, etc.....but, it's not just the time issue, the kids have confided to me that Mom is very edgy and flies off the handle to easily. ....Not physically abusive, but she yells.  A LOT.  I'm only trying to help.

In short, yes...it is entirely possible that she has ADHD, but why should you be so involved in her life, seriously, its none of your business, take a step back, let her run her own life and just chill out, your constant interferance here is going to do nothing but push her away.  People are different, some people are strange, accept her for who she is, she doesn't need doctors or medication, she needs a close, loving family who don't judge her.

Of course they can be brilliant and have ADHD. ADHD does not affect the IQ honey!



I'd just let her talk to her doctor about it and see what he says. He may refer her to a specialist and hopefully she will listen.



I know you care about her but she is an adult now honey and you've gotta let her make her own decisions alone. That's very hard, trust me. I dated someone who was bipolar and refused to take meds and there was nothing I could do but encourage positive behavior and let him make those decisions alone.

Yes it is absolutely possible because ADHD is not a learning disorder.
People who have ADHD or ADD.......their brains just work differently, although it may be difficult for them to concentrate. It can also go the other way and they can zone everything out except for what they want to focus on. But if your parents always had good structure and routine in the home, and encouraged good study habits, then that would have complimented the structure at school to help your sister do well.



I have 2 kids with ADD, a fiance, a mother in law, and a brother. And they are all doing well in school, or for the adults, they did well while they were there.



And yes a family doctor can prescribe the medication. My family doctor prescribes Adderall for my daughter, she is 11. And used to prescribe it for my older son, he is 15. He has learned to get along without the medication. In some cases that aren't as severe teaching the kids how to be structured can help them to be able to get off the medicine. For my kids they just seem like they need(ed) just a little help focusing. And the rest is up to the parents to guide them. I am a firm believer that the medicine is only a small part of what is needed to manage ADHD or ADD. The doctors will tell you that too. But I know some people do truly need it for thier whole life, along with the structure, routine, and organizational skills.

I don't know what you saw, but you have to figure out why it disgusted you so much.  Did something happen to you in the past that makes this so hard to erase out of your mind or what?  In order to do something about an issue, you have to understand your own feelings first, because in your life time, this will not be the last time you see something so awful, so you will have to learn to cope and deal with these things in a healthier way.

I think most people are afraid of it due in part because really most people are only a few steps from the line and we are all capable of crossing it. So most will not explore its true meaning so in their minds they could never be "mentally ill". They might also have a loved one who has a mental illness but they use denial as a way of dealing. Bascially it boils down to misconceptions and the fear of the unknown.

You go to see a psychologist when you are overwhelmed with stress  and you cant seem to get your life back on track. You go to see a psychiatrist when you keep thinking or saying  or doing things that you know are not right, but you cant seem to change or stop them. It usually happens because of something from your past that is manifesting itself into your present.

with me, I didn't know. I was having trouble focusing, and I was seeing things other people didn't. I seemed fine to myself. People where trying to take care of me, but as soon as people tried to help, I would take off, and become  taken care of from someone else. It wasn't until I got off the streets, and back under my parents roof that I started to get better, but I was hard, I was really bored and my parents tastes were very old. Then I started making the trip downtown and back that I started making some friends. That was more than 10 years ago.

Hi
i felt scared about calling my psychologist however i did it and made an appointment, i felt that it might be possible for her to help me to relax, as due to family issuses and back problems i was finding it hard and also painful to sleep so if i could relax it might be easier.



she was great and since the last time i saw her she said i was great there was not as much silence as before, i did more talking i knew what i wanted to say and ask, i did feel like walking out before she came out of her office but i calmed down and felt fine and i thought i did pretty well.



i think sometimes you know when you need to talk to someone and when that time comes you will make an appointment. it did take me a few weeks to work up the courage to call but once i got over that it was easy.



hope that helps.

She says it reminds her of her childhood.  I think it's overboard.  Could something else be going on other than just collecting?

Feeling left out with life in general



Hiya im feeling like im way behind with life experiences which is sortof affecting my confidence. I know people who have been clubbing since their late teens and i rarely do it so theyre used to socialising with people yet i get shy with newish people. I hate regretting the past as it doesnt help but i do feel ive missed out on alot of stuff and am frustrated i cant get it bak. I know i need to get out there but find it hard motivating myself ie facing the fear. Funny thing i know its not that bad but still cant get up and go. Any inspiration would help!

Sounds to me like you are still very young.  Take your time.  Go out when you area ready.  Don't ever do something just because others are doing it, you may live to regret the choice.  When you are ready, you wont find it so hard to get out there.

And the first guy is right, there is more to life than clubbing.  Try finding a smaller group that shares some of your interests.  That could be a good first step.

Not all people are into clubbing and not all people are good at socializing. You may be a quiet person who prefers to have just one or two good friends and spend quality time with them.
Personally I never enjoyed the noise and the chaotic atmosphere of clubs and bars.  Perhaps you should try online sites where you can chat with people and make friends online. Or some dating websites if you are over 18.

People look at clinical depression the wrong way.

It's not that you're sad because you don't have things you need (which is just sadness, not clinical depression) it's that there's a chemical deficiency in your brain that is beyond your control that makes you feel things and you don't know why.

There are many causes--genetics, lifestyle, diet

Even people who have everything they need, material wise, can be depressed because they are lacking something else - love. A person can have all the possessions in the world but if they want love, and don't get it, that's all it takes to plunge them into the pit of depression.

I just got done answering a question similar to yours. With some people, or shall I say most people, its not a choice, it is a chemical imbalance in the brain. High or low Serotonin levels along with other neurotransmitters and hormone levels will cause depression. Our body makes these to control our moods, if they are off then there is no way possible that these people can put their minds to being happy. Their brain wont allow it. The body works in crazy ways.

Just because you have everything you could ever want or need, doesn't mean you can't get depressed. It's an emotional discrepancy caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. It's a lot of times (but not necessarily always genetic). Anti-depressants (sometimes) help this. Just as many women as men are on anti-depressants. The idea that having "a lot" or "just enough to suffice" or lack thereof has no impact on whether or not a person is depressed

I'm quite lucky on the financial side and i was in a high school in which not many of us weren't rich. i have friends from various backgrounds and quite weirdly I find my friends who are poorer happier than my rich friends.. Maybe because nowadays it's easier to get what you want .. stupid example: before to calculate, you needed to do it yourself, now there's the calculator; you need to find an info, go on google, no more need to search in books... It's stupid but we don't need to "work" as much now so we get lazier. WAnd the lazier you are, the more your life is empty so people get depressed because they are lazy...
And for those who have everything, I guess they are just bored to hell since they don't need to do anything to have what they want...

simply because they do have everything.  striving to save for something is not a challenge.people need goals in life, not have everything handed on a plate.they need to be gainfully employed, save up for what they want,. work hard & play hard, keeps the mind active & content.you don't need material things to be happy., trust me
as for pills, people who need them  only think they do.

Don't assume that "having things" will give anyone lasting happiness.

People with no goal to work toward will ultimately become depressed.

Humans are goal striving machines. Many people die shortly after they retire and many people find empty feelings when they achieve shallow goals.

As someone who is coming off anti depressants after many years, I believe the reasons are multiple.

1) Genetics.
2) Trauma - some horrendous things happened in my life
3) Self-indulgence/immaturity. No-one is perfect and I hold my hand up to these. 
4) Living in a materialistic, boring, shallow, self-obssessed repetitive culture. There is a fantastic line in a James Frey book, which says that every American should be forced to go to India at least once, so that people can see how lucky we are, and how f***ing stupid we are. I'm British but the same applies. My father was Iraqi, and one thing that always brought him profound pleasure was doing the weekly shop, which most Westeners would consider a chore, because he never got over the sheer range and availability of products in the West.

Hello,

(ANS) I think a LARGE part of this problem is too do with quality of life that many of us experience in this country. Also the way we treat each other in our society. Many are very miserable, unhappy & depressed, why? I think some of the reasons are that money, & the accumulation of ever more material goods cannot satisfy the inner emptiness we feel inside. Materialism & money can never fill up that inner emptiness. The inner emptiness cannot be filled up by traditional conceptions of god or religion either, the inner emptiness is a spiritual & emotional problem, its about love and how we have increasingly lost sight of the importance of good relationships.



Work & work pressures, pressures on time, the credit crunch, etc the very force of capitalism is now the very thing that is ruining our relationships with each other. The lack of quality time to relate, to just be with each other, to sit down & listen, to give time. We have lost sight of the real value of these simple yet fundamentally important things. Relationships require time its that simple in some ways really.

**time that work & capitalism takes away from us, we have a time deficit we have less time than ever before. That's at the core of this problem IMO.

Kind Regards Ivan.

depression is neurological, caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. hence teenagers often go through depressive phases during puberty because of a high level of hormones in their system.  the brain doesn't choose to be depressed. anti depressants help to control and balance this flow of chemicals.

I suppose what you want is never enough, when you've got it it never seems that good. I suffered from major depression for many years, it has all to do with how you view yourself. I hated antidepressants they turned me into a zombie and never made anything better.

I think there is a lot to be said for being positive.

I don't think Depression is new, i believe lots of people years ago suffered from Depression , but nobody put a name to it. Some people were called lazy, stupid, a no good, because they just could not get up to do things that other people did on a daily basis.



Years ago when a family member  was probably in a great depression and they just shut down, the family just referred to them as well you know aunt emma or uncle Fred has always been kind of off for years, because they just stayed in their room.



Now days with modern medical break throughs we know that when an otherwise healthy person suddenly over time becomes sad, and withdrawn, something is  definitely wrong



As for having everything they need, that has no bearing on Depression.  I sometimes wonder  with young people that become depressed if it hasn't got something to do with their home life.So often both parents work and when they come home they don't notice that their child has become  so reclusive lately and spends so much time in their room.  Or the elderly person, that years ago lived with the eldest son  or daughter on the farm and always had a place of respect and dignity in the home up until they died there, surrounded by their grandkids.  Now they are shipped off to senior citizen facilities, where in lots of cases they are all but forgotten by their families, no wonder they are depressed.

When you have to struggle to survive or earn your daily bread, you can't afford to be depressed. You usually don't bother too much with The Meaning of Life or Is There A God or  Why Are We Here, either. Depression in the form we see it is a condition only found in wealthy countries, surprisingly often in otherwise healthy people, and appear when you have everything you need.

Of course poor people can be depressed, too, but it's not as common.

Women are still more prone to depression and anxiety and overall, there are more women who are diagnosed with and treated for depression, but you're right in that the number of depressed men has increased over the past 50 years. I think it's partly because men have lost ground in most areas and don't know how to deal with it. Men generally aren't as good as women at adapting to changes. But the gender issue is really a minor problem.

I think it is because people are never satisfy with what they have, always taking things they own for granted. People with personality type A (ambitious, high-achiever, competitive) are not easily satisfied, they tend to suppress and keep their negative feelings to themselves. Most of the time, men fall into this category of personality. In Asian countries like China and Japan, men are grown up in more conservative society which teach them of hardship and responsibilty as the bread-winner, hence, seldom pouring their feelings to others.

In our materialistic and acquisitive society, we believe that happiness, contentment, lasting joy and fulfillment can be ours if we are rich and famous, etc. But looking at the lives of people who are wealthy and famous, one will quickly realise that very often these things do not bring them the inner peace that poets, philosophers and religious teachers talk about, and to which many common people aspire. Look at how many famous and rich people who have committed suicide or are depressed. Anti-depressants and chemical pick-me-ups are the best selling drug preparations today.

Material things meet our material needs, but they do not meet our deepest psychological and spiritual needs. Unfortunately, having been told that they need to 'go on a spiritual quest', many rich and famous fall victims to scams spun by religious nuts and cults.From this point of view, people like Dawkins, Harris, Hutchins, and especially Karl Marx, are right. They seek the opiate of fantasy and delusion. But worse, many are addicted to pills, although they are useful for short-term intervention.

We are not just merely flesh and blood - material. We all have a spiritual aspect to our selves and unless the whole person is satisfied, there will always be a yawning chasm inside us which we may try not to peer into but into which we will fall one day.  This chasm can only be banished by the True Light of the World. He has said, "Ask and it shall given, seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you." There is a deep thirst in many that can only be slaked by drinking from the True Spring. We are not talking about -isms and movements or organisations. Avoid these as they are there to rip you off. Seek only the Truth.

Thus spake the Lamas.

Behaving out of character... What's wrong with me?



Hi,

About six months ago I was diagnosed with depression. I was as low as I could ever be. I self harmed and took an overdose. Now I'm 'back to normal' although I wouldn't describe this as normal because for the past few weeks I have behaved completely out of character!

At the moment I'm in an extremely high mood, full of energy even though I hardly sleep. I started smoking, even though everyone who knows me knows how much I hate it. I started spending money on things that I didn't even need or want. I'm also gambling a bit. And I think the worst thing is, which is also illegal, driving round with no insurance. I just never think of the concequences when I'm feeling like this. I have so many ideas going through my head... My mind races!

It feels fantastic, but I'm also aware that behaving this way is completely unlike me. i.e the smoking, gambling, driving with no issurance, are all things I'm against. Yet I'm happy to go ahead and do it without thinking. Although this feels good... I'm guessing something is wrong.

What's going on with me?

P.S. I am no longer driving, as my girlfriend found out and I was forced to stop.

Go see a psychiatrist.  You sound like you are hypomanic, a milder form of mania, which is a very big deal.

I'm guessing that they gave you an antidepressant for the depression.  Antidepressants w/o stabilizers can flip ppl with bipolar manic.  That sounds like what may have happened to you.  Seriously, see a psychiatrist for an evaluation.  Hopefully I'm wrong, but I'd be surprised based on what you posted.



I have bipolar and don't say something like this on here hardly ever.

PS - Whether it's your gf, parents, a sib, turn over your credit and debit cards and have them delete any online accts where you don't need them.  Add up what you've already spent and ask yourself what happens if your trip continues on up, you disinhibition increases, and you become more wreckless.  Crashing down into depression AND bankruptcy court isn't uncommon.  While I'm mentioning going up higher, you do know that true mania can include psychosis - hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, extremely disorganized thinking (your racing thoughts times 10+), and you end up the proverbial crazy person.  So, as great as you may feel, go to the doctor, get yourself evaluated, and under control.

You have just described bipolar mania.

You are probably bi-polar.  If you took medication for your depression, sometimes that can trigger a bi-polar mood swing in people who have bipolar genes.

You definitely need to go back to see a psychiatrist and discuss this with him or her.

It really does sound as if you are suffering from manic depression or bi polar disorder as it is also called. This condition gives someone swings of mood from severe depression to feelings of elation and mania. You seem to be having a manic episode.
Reckless behaviour, lack of sleep, irresponsible financial decisions and smoking heavily are all symptoms of mania.
I urge you to consult your GP for referral to a psychiatrist. You will need medication to control the mania.
This condition goes in cycles and the cycles vary in frequency. You need medical help but many people lead normal lives and learn how to moderate the mood swings.
Please, go to your GP.
My sister has had this condition for almost twenty years so I know the symptoms well.
Take care.

Manic depression is a type of disorder in which the brain misfires serotonin. This results in the person having an intense burst of energy one day and a big down time the next. I also suffer from the same symptoms. Before my suicide attempts I was a "good boy." I hated the thought of drugs and cigarettes.  I always respected the law and feared authority. It wasn't until after wards that nothing mattered. I was scum, people didn't respect me, I was unlovable, etc. These thoughts eventually pushed me to myself in the way of harm. I would go on midnight drives, hitting speeds up to 140 mph. I also started smoking, not just cigarettes. I would go online and buy buy buy useless and pricey things, only to throw them away and buy new ones. Even now, I put little value on money. I treat it like air (even though I don't have much of it).



Manic depression is something that needs to be dealt with. Spend more time with friends. Spend more time with family. Avoid being alone. This also means avoid being alone in crowds of people you don't know. Let the people you trust be your conscience. Continue seeing your therapist and tell him/her that you're still experiencing symptoms.

It does sound very much like hypomania. Go see your doctor. It may feel good now but it can and will degenerate into depression or worse. Antidepressants can easily push someone who is bipolar into a manic state and this is often the time when bipolar if first diagnosed. Do not stop taking your meds but go see your doctor soon.

The fact that your on yahoo is a cry for help.  You  need help.  Call your local kids help line, it's free and it's always nice to talk with someone.
I know life seems really awful right now but it won't last this way forever.  You are what you want to be.  You have family even if you are mad at them.  I don't claim to know your situation and it may be very bad, but you can turn it around for yourself.  I know many ppl who have risen up from doom and dispare only to have made a success of themselves.
I hope you consider what life could hold for you if you give it a chance.  Good Luck
Cheers~!

Work related stress?



hello,
i work in a very stressful call center and my stress levels have been building over the past few weeks to the point where over the past few days i have been close to walking out or smashing the place up. i am off work tomorrow and am thinking of going to the doctors to try and get some time signed off work through work related stress. i havnt had my blood pressure checked but im sure it will be very high and i cant face going back into work as its depressing me and i know that shortly after starting work my stress levels will be sky high. i have tried to ask for some holiday time off work but i cant get it for another 3 weeks at the earliest and i havnt had any time off since january. i feel run down, depressed, exhausted and close to breaking point. does anyone have any advice on what i can say to my gp to convince them i need this time off badly. also whats the longest period they would sign me of for? i am  23 and am relativly healthy and i dont smoke so this isnt a factor.

There is a law now, FMLA - Family Medical Leave Act - that allows you to have up to 12 weeks unpaid leave for either yourself or your family.  Check out http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/ for all the details.  By law, you cannot be fired; however, you may be offered a different (comparable) position upon your return.  You'll need the proper paperwork from the human resources department of your company and your physician's approval.  You do not have to "convince" your employer that you are unable to work.  Stress to the degree that you describe is indeed disabling.  See your doctor, get the help you need, and I'd personally look into a different line of work.  An otherwise healthy 23 year old should not be experiencing so much stress.

They are unlikely to just sign you off without taking other steps to sort your problems out.
6 months is a long time without a break though - it does sound like you desperately need that holiday.
I'm afraid though that the real answer is in your hands - the job is making you ill, change jobs.

glenn sounds like you are burnt out- it is a very stressful job- and well done for doing it- you sound like you need a break - defo go see the gp- try to get appt with a sympathetic gp - and just explain  like you have here tonight exactly what is going on and how you feel-  i couldnt guess how long they would sign you off for- if you get ssp- you will probably need a weekly cert from your gp so he/she will assess you from week to week
if you do get time off then make sure you relax-  hope it all goes ok for you

HO YES My DEAR...
Try making this recipe for Aloe Jam....
Its way far worse than death....
Believe me.....
Not so much the jam, but the making of it I mean....

Aloe Jam

Cut the older leaves from the stem where the leaves are thickest
Place upright with cut end to the bottom so that as much sap can drain as is possible. Stand for a day or so...
Trim point edges and tips so that the portions that are left would all be about 10 mm thick, otherwise the pieces are too thin tomake jam from...

Cut the white or transparent pieces in to about 30 mm squares and peel each one from top to bottom
Soak in clean water for a few hours, and rinse under running water when done. There must be no yellowy bits left afer rinsing.



Prick each portion well with a fork
Lie overnight in lime rich water by adding 2 table spoons of lime powder to the water that covers the aloe. Lime is generally available from pharmacies.
Idealy you would dissolve lime in warm water before adding to aloe portions.
Next day, rinse aloe portions again in running water

Weigh out the following;
For every 2,7 KG aloe, you would use 3.2 KG sugar
About 4 table spoons of lemon juice is handy because it would preven jam turning in to sand sugar.
Boil aloe for about 30 minutes in clean water and drain.
In the mean while, do the syrup...
Add the portions of aloe one by one so that the sypur does not stop boiling
Allow to simmer for about 1 ½ hours until aloe portions become transperant and the syrup thickens.
Stand the aloe portion in the syrup over night so that the aloe can absorb the syrup.
Next day, remove the aloe while heating the syrup again. Replace the aloe portions back in to syrup once it is heated.
Bring to the boil.
Place the aloe portions in to hot, sterilized bottles and cover with syrup before sealing.

How can I get over my fear of driving alone?



I know it IS silly to hear. But I am a 21 year old model and mother of 2 and I am deathly afraid of driving alone...
I want to go to college and get a good job and things but I can't even drive my kids to appointments, school, etc. alone.
I used to have BAD panic attacks and I am so afraid that I will have one while I am driving and there will be no one there to help me.
I am stubborn and hard headed and I want to do great things with my life and I want to be able to drive by myself damn it!
Please help!



</question>

<answer>



Is there any early childhood, or adolescence event that you think could have featured in this fear?
If the panic attacks are brought on, only in this situation it is likely it's in a response to a conditioned response of a negative situation you've been exposed to (ie: a car accident), or even the repetitive conditioning of other people stating the possible negative outcomes of driving alone.

Firstly, you need to address this as an issue. Did you deal with it when the event occurred (if it was an event)? Do you think you addressed it adequately, or perhaps there was a need of some form of professional help that you didn't seek?

Once you've addressed the issue, either with the assistance of professional help or solo.... you need to recalibrate your fear response to this situations. Doing this, through the repairing of the situation with positive outcomes.. slowly taking control, and exposing yourself to driving alone. Perhaps starting with a partner.. driving for 15 minutes, then for 30 seconds alone. Doing this for a while... And slowly but surely starting to drive alone.

Whilst taking part in this, avoid situations that can possible interrupt this, ie: going the opposite direction when sights of car crashes are seen, not watching action movies prone to car crashes galore.. and furtheron.

Hope this helps even a little.

Please find your purpose.  I can tell you that you have one, but sometimes its hard to realize what that is.  Sometimes it comes to you when you least expect it, so don't miss out on that moment.  I know you must be stressed out about all the sickness in your family, but you also have to realize that you can't change that nor did you cause it. People who hate you don't deserve you, and druggies aren't in control of themselves. So, concentrate on yourself and making yourself into what you want to be.

Not to be rude, but stop looking for attention online, and get some help if you're seriously feeling suicidal.
Get off Yahoo! Answers, (all we can do is say "nooo, don't do it!") and get to a mental facility, or call 1.800.SUICIDE already, sheesh.Nothing's worth dying over, I would know. We all have our problems, you aren't the only one in the world.

You could be a malnourished African child, with no parents, dying of AIDS, and suffering every day of your life with no showers, food, love, or electricity. You wouldn't HAVE a computer to whine on Y!A. And you most certainly would not have ANY sanitary living conditions or stable medical facilities.

I'm just making a point, things COULD be worse, I'd suggest you seek some Professional help, though.
Good-Luck.

Life has problems, The good news is that THEY ARE ALL TEMPORARY. Suicide is a terrible idea because it is permanent. Just learn to cope with it for now, and Life will get better. Find strength in something. For example: Religion, Education, Hobbies, Friends, etc. It seems that you have a lot of respect for your family members because you care about what they think about you. I'm not saying to disrespect them, but it doesn't seem like they deserve that kind of respect, based on your description above. Just do the best you can in life, and no one can ask anymore. Don't give up, sometimes life sucks, but getting through those times brings a Sense of accomplishment, Happiness, and Strength. Things really do get better, and you will find that life is a rewarding series of accomplishments, trials, and events of happiness. In other words, God put us on this earth that we might experience joy; of course sadness is part of life too, but stay as positive as you can, and do your best day to day, that is all any of us can do! God loves you, he gave you your life, your body, your spirit, your mind, and much much more. Suicide would waste all that you have been given and destroy all of your potential, as well as your future happiness. You can Make it! I have made it through many hardships, and I am a better, stronger, and a more understanding person because of it. Good luck; I hope that things go well for you; email me if you would like to.

i attempted suicide 3 times, rite now im 13
i noe how it feels.
id rather u not, even though it feels so lonely and
so miserable in there,
you'll have to learn to be strong.
im sorry i cant give u any more advice,
cause i personally am not getting help, cuz
im already in suicide tracking program,
but all the counselors there are sio stupid,
they dont understand what we "freaks" are
going throu.
if u really want to, however, its ur choice.
and ur probably wondering what its like on the other side.
well, on my 2nd attempt,
i heard a beeping sound end and a sort of screeching sound start.
i heard someone yelling for a doctor.
after that, everything went blank,
and i was lying face to face with my body.
i was kinda being forced upward,
and i stood up, and saw this empty sort of place,
with gray floors, grey walls, and a glass ceiling.
it was raining, i think, and there were a bunch of teenagers dressed
in black and white, just sitting around.
i heard a beeping sound again, and i opened my eyes to see i was in a hospital room.....

She definitely sounds like a narcissist. Narcissists like your mother often have fantasies of unlimited beauty and often think that others are envious of them. They are also devoid of empathy, and this explains her behavior towards you. Also, they are exploitative, and her marrying a man for his money is an example of this.

Gee, I would have run away too. Sorry you have to go through all this. Sometimes we try to put a label on things to make ourselves feel better. It makes coping easier. I would say that there is at least some narcissism involved among other things. Regardless of the label, your Mom is a very troubled lady. I can't even imagine what this has done to you.

I think it is too easy to just think it is narcissism, when I can see so many other disorders and possible reasons for her behaviour. Firstly I think this all points towards a very low selfesteem. Perhaps a history of abuse, or a borderline personality disorder? Could also be related to autism, and so on and so on. I think the only way to find out what is wrong with her is to know about her youth. But in all honesty, you should ask yourself the question if it helps you knowing what is wrong with her? You seem like a strong enough person, a survivor, redirect your energy to dealing with your own feelings and damage you experience from your youth with this mother. Good luck!

There is a fine line between actual narcissism and vanity. If you are narcissistic then you basically want to have sex with yourself looking at yourself and adoring yourself.



She may well be - she may also have confidence issues and is looking for approval from everybody by stating how pretty she is and how desired she is.Unfortunately it does sound like a psychological impulsion.

So how come no one wants to see disabilities like autism cured really?



I think the Pharmacological companies are making sure real permanent cures don't ever happen, for if that happened, they stand to lose billions of dollars from the drugs being taken by autistic s and schizoids. 
I feel the insurance companies are also encouraging so-called 'autistic culture' along with the greedy for-profit HMOs, whom just don't want to doll out real treatments and/or cures if and when they finally do come out.

I suggest U watch Micheal Moore's latest film 'Sicko' to see what I mean

Keep in mind that a drug company stops making good money off anything the invent after 7-10 years depending on the nature. Anyone with decent manufacturing practices can copy their work.

Also, keep in mind how much freaking money a company would make - the insurance companies would love it if they could get rid of chronic illnesses (as then they don't have to pay to treat them). Hell, the government would probably pay for it.

And to be honest, how would they go about doing this? Your average study on a drug involves several hundred people actually working on it, nevermind all the people who work indirectly to support it. For drug development, there's 50 companies around me, all startups scanning chemicals as fast as they can possibly can looking for something, anything that might be used to hit any system in the body that we know exists.

Honestly, I don't think people realize the rabid, frenzied level of competition in the pharmaceutical industry. Everyone wants to be the one to grab the next brilliant molecule that lets his manipulate something else, some new way to get at some other system in the body.

Keep in mind that autism, schizophrenia, these are NOT simple problems. These affect massive swathes of the body's function in the brain, in metabolism. They're rooted down deep in the parts of the body we still do not understand very well at all. We don't even know what actually causes them quite yet, or how they develop or why. All we know are vague genetic components, risk factors, the end results and some crude treatments that can prevent these conditions from being as terrible as they are otherwise. These conditions aren't strep throat, and they are not going to have an easy simple answer for quite some time.

This is just propaganda and conspiracy theories. If someone could come up with a real cure for things like autism, they'd be a billionaire and a hero. Michael Moore's films don't take an honest look at anything. They simply push his agenda (and make him millions of dollars in the process).



Keep in mind, things like autism are generally considered to be genetic in nature (either passed on or genetic mutations during development). We don't have the technology yet to fix our genes. That takes retroviruses, which are very experimental at best right now. Plus, that kind of thing could do more harm than good.



Other diseases like cancer could theoretically be cured since it's a matter of destroying cells gone bad. However the drug companies are working hard to do so, and making money in the process.



Contrary to what some people believe, I don't think the pharmaceutical companies are withholding cures to anything. First, to do so would require massive coverups (keeping their employees silent, records destruction, etc) or else it would quickly get out by some ethical employee. Second, while the owners may want to make money, I don't think (most) are evil. There's nothing wrong with wanting to make money! And there is no hard evidence that there are any cures out there that are being suppressed. Just hearsay and conspiracy theories.

Michael Moore and his ilk are just lying to people to scare them into believing this tripe. Don't fall for the Wizard's First Rule...

....if you only knew how hard some people have worked on cures for diseases...

A friend of my family worked for 5 solid years on an AIDS vaccine... only to have it not work.  The pharmaceutical company spent millions to try and find a cure, and when that one didn't' work, they started all over again.



Not saying pharmaceutical co's have our best interests at heart.  But I don't think they are doing nothing...Think of how much money the company who finds a vaccine for AIDS will make - I mean, an HPV vaccine that has no long term studies (sorry, I'm unimpressed with their current research) and only prevents 4 types of HPV is worth $370 per person.....

You also have to realize their limitations.  Autism might NOT be curable (I'm thinking like, Downs Syndrome, where it's a gene replication or something we can't vaccinate against) - we're not even sure how it happens let alone how to fix it.... they need to do A LOT of research before they can just magically cure it.

Where do I put the pain?



If I've stopped cutting myself, bingeing, taking drugs and can't drink because I'm on anti-biotics.  Where do I put the pain?
I used to do this things to relieve myself of torment but now I'm stuck with it.  This guy's upset me and I just keep imagining myself beating him to the ground.  It's really vivid.  I can hear his bones smashing as I smack him in the face and kick in his ribs, smash his head against the floor.  I can see the blood trickling from his nose and mouth and this offers some relief momentarily but not enough.  I want to scream to let it out but I live in a flat and can't wake eveyrone up.  I can't sleep and I can't stop crying.  I don't feel like I can go to work tomorrow.  I desperately want to run away, which is what I did when I was a teenager but I'm an adult now and can't.  Besides, there's so many people that would worry about me.  How do I make the anger and pain stop?  How do normal people deal with this?



</question>



<additional details>



I think I just want him to hurt like I do.  I told him to f**K off but the words felt empty.  I've really sad I know but I found a forum he posts on and I can see he's online.  I keep checking to see if he will write that he feels bad about what he did or will ask for someone's advice.  I wanted to see that my showing my anger towards him has affected him in some way.  He's obviously not sleeping as I know he also has work in the morning.  That helps me some but maybe he's having fun.  That would piss me off if life just carried on for him and I had to go through this.

Maybe talking a therapist would help, they can help you to find ways to deal with your anger and pain. I have been using a technique called Emotional Freedom Technique which has helped me a lot. With EFT you tune into the thought, memory etc and feel the emotion about it and then tap your meridian points and the emotion should clear or reduce. It does sound a bit crazy but does work.

Try yoga maybe?

I know what you want is to scream but maybe instead of drowning it out you should deeply breathe and feel your body relax.

Im not a person to preach to you ok but when i was younger and angry i developed a way to let go and i would lay down and say in my head. First of all relax every muscle in your toes...Feel it happen. Feel your body tensness drop away and dont move on until you feel the weight leave and then slowly, ever so slowly work your way up your body tasking care to treat every single muscle along the way. Toes, balls of the feel, heels, ankles etc.

Totally feelin you on part of this.

Getting a punching bag, as mentioned before, can be a highly productive thing, it helps to rid yourself of frustration.

Whatever this guy did to piss you off so badly, write it out, what he did how it made you feel everything.  Then at the end try to write something like... I release these feelings of anger and frustration.  If you believe in God, a good thing to write, say and think, when you're getting this upset, is With love and the grace of God I release ______
(anger, fear, frustration, hatred, whatever emotion you are holding at that time, that you want to rid yourself of).

Sometimes it feels like bad feelings are holding on to you, but feelings are not living things that can grasp you, when you're having them, it's you holding on to them, what you must do is let them go.
If you're thinking, ya, but how am I supposed to let this go, this guy is a huge jerk and i have to hold on to my feelings toward him, because he is a jerk, realize, you feeling like this, is not hurting him one bit, it doesn't cause him any form of harm, it's only hurting you, so its your job to let it go.
Forgive him for whatever he's done to you, forgive yoruself for having harsh feelings toward him and let it go.

Much love and God bless and steady you and make able to cope with the things that go on in your life.

** also with my experience as a cutter, a sometimes quiet way to let go of things, can be by tearing papers, i know it sounds odd, but it's destructive just not to myself.



and a giant high five and congrats that you're not doing that any more, and stay strong and sober, good job you!!!!!

That is great that you have stopped turning the pain on yourself and doing self harm. There is no such thing as "normal". What is normal for one person may be different for someone else. Are you seeing a Therapist? If so can you call him/her? It sounds as though the pain you have is deep and will take time to get over and I would suggest finding a therapist or Psychologist that you trust and feel comfortable with. If you need to get your mind off things tonight, give a friend a call and have them come over to keep your mind distracted. Perhaps watch a positive movie. You mentioned that you were taking an anti-biotic. You may want to call the Pharmacist or your Dr.'s after hours line, if there is one and explain how you are feeling because sometimes some antibiotics can affect mood and you could be having a side effect. I wish you the best.

Painting, writing, creative endeavours to release all your pent up emotion. I know it feels like you're going to be overwhelmed with it all and you can't even move or breathe for the weight of all things pressing in on you, but you can and you will, and you will find a way around doing those self-destructive behaviours that you listed and channelling your rage and pain into something that will help you, not hurt you.



I sincerely think you should see a therapist. This is not a sign of weakness. It's a sign you care enough about yourself and the others around you that you acknowledge that you need assistance to get better. Rather than bury your head in the sand until it reaches breaking point - which is, by the way what most people do. I truly believe there is no normality - just varying levels of f.ucked upedness.

That there's a major rise in Anxiety/Social Phobias and Depression/Bi-Polar questions. What's wrong with you people and why don't I ever see you in the streets and at school/college?

@ hecla 1. But if you have social anxiety/phobia you do tend to look a little awkward if someone looks at you. Bi-polars I guess are more hidden as they put on fake happy masks (I should know all about that)

In the past 5 years there has been a  change in the way people look at mental health issues. As movie stars/ rock stars, etc. admit they have issues-it becomes almost vogue for the average person to have Mental Health issues.
I'm not sure what you mean by where are all you people, I don't think that most people in society stand out. Do you feel like society takes exception on your mental health problems? If you have more personal questions you can e-mail me. Good Luck Reggie

Of course you are going to hear about a lot more people having anxiety, social phobias and depression and mood disorders.  Think about what is going on in the world around you and ask yourself why wouldn't the average person be afraid to go outside.  War, terrorist attacks, the price of food, crime rate, inflation, starvation and the never ending report of what you do or don't do that will increase your chance of getting an illness such as cancer, diabetetes, or heart disease.



On the other hand, I do feel that people want to have something wrong with themselves for the attention or to feel like they fit into a category or to feel they are special.  I can remember a time when cutting used to be a popular thing and now that a lot of people are coming out about it, cutting seems to be losing its popularity which is probably due to the scars that are left are a huge embarrassment.



When I think about all the problems in the world, I want to roll over and just go back to sleep.

If this is a serious question you really should talk to someone face to face - either a close family member or friend or a doctor.  You are clearly depressed and it is impossible to think rationally when in the grips of this illness.  Please seek help and whatever you do, ignore any foolish messages you may get posted here.  I regularly pick fun at people on here but if you're for real, I genuinely think you need support.

Ahem. First of all everyone looks ugly to themselves. We always search for the flaws in ourself while everyone else can see past them. Second of all being tall is a gift. I am under 5 feet and I'm not complaining. Thirdly I don't hate you. I'm sure alot of people don't hate you. The reason to keep on living is so you can prove to all those haters that you are not what you seem. Rise above them. If you die you just give up and giving up never solves anything. Don't give up.

First of all calm the hell down.
Life is hard,it will never be easy... your 19 you should already know that.
Nothing and nobody will ever be perfect and hate to break it to but normal is just a setting on a washing machine.
Killing your self is not going to solve anything.
If your so upset with the way you look, Change it.
It sounds hard but if your passionate about it then it wont be that bad.
and honestly i don't know what will happen if your "destroy" your body but I'm positive it wont help anything, you'll just be a miserable dead person and maybe it's just me but I'd much rather be alive then dead.



Good luck, hope you work this out.

Dear Just,

Choose life.

All people about your age, at least in Western society, seem at some point to look in the mirror and say "who is that?" and "why?"

Trust me on this, there is someone who will recognize your beauty and show it to you. Just hang on.

Why don't you call someone and ask if they are okay?

Do not destroy your body.  I've had this conversation with myself many, many, times.  It does get better.

Do you believe in God.?  I recommend it.  If you can get hold of a Bible, open it in the middle to Psalms.  David, who wrote most of the psalms, had lots of reasons to hate himself.  It helps to read that stuff.

OH I'm so lowtech, I didn't think of the Bible online.  Google it and go to Psalms.

If you can, this would be a good time to tell God all that you know about Him.

Then in the daytime, talk to someone at school or work and tell them you're having a bad time.

god i know this feeling. You re battling some issues of low self esteem and confidence- so I would suggest going to your doctor and telling him how you feel. He may diagnose You with body dimorphic disorder (bdd) or just some stage of depression.



You're 19, and have got so much you could do with the rest of your life- and if you get rid of that life I bet a hell of a lot of people would care. You say you want friends who call? Do you ever call them? Sometimes we have to make opportunities happen for ourselves, and not just sit back and wait.



Get out there and start living your life- and I promise you that in a year or less you'll be having a tonne more fun, and will definitely feel better about yourself- mentally and physically.

dude, it may seem no one cares, but i mean, if I -a random on the internet- cares than definately EVERYONE in your life cares about you.
i know iv been thru it where everyone takes u for granted and it seems they dont care if ur feeling **** and they dont see when ur feeling not ok. 
but sometimes it could be they dont know what to say to you. but they care oh so much.
iv been in ur position and ur friends position before.
what i can tell u is, no dont destroy your body even if u say ur ugly, ur not ugly. i mean, iv had weeks and months of feeling like this and have hurt myself in the past but its not worth it. 
i wont tell u that looks dont matter etc. because uv probably heard it too many times already. but let that thought sink in.
i mean, what is it that u dont like? ur weight? ur skin? certain things? u can always get healthier. but i think if u dress urself right, get a nice hairstyle and whatnot, it will be instant gratification and a slight change to brighten up the day. 
but all it comes down to is how u view urself. it takes hard work to really make it positive, but mean while you can do little transformations.

Your question concerned me enough to check out your profile of questions you have asked and the past, and answers to questions you have given. This appears to be a form of recurring question for you.  Are we not supportive enough in the previous answers you have been given? I also read that you said you were just under 6"1, that is a wonderful height for a guy. If everyone hates you so much, then why would we bother to offer kind words or advice? I believe you are an emotionally disturbed young man, and would do better to ask your parents or school counselor to refer you to someone who can give you some professional help, instead of trying to get your needs met in this forum. Talks of suicide, and thoughts of suicide can end you up in a psychiatric ward.  If someone was smart, they would track down your IP address, find out where you are from and call the police, telling them of your posts in here, and that we are afraid you are about to do harm to yourself. Then, they would pay you a visit, and escort you to the nearest psychiatric ward, which I think is the best place for you right now.  I am being totally sincere, and not trying to be mean at all. I am genuinely concerned for you.

You will get over this, all you need is a bit of confidence.  Start with
baby steps little outings to places and with people you know are
your friends, that won't be too daunting and, then build up the
length of the outings.  All you need is a bit of confidence and remember what is on your mind shows on your face, so think
beautiful thoughts.

Work on it don't just worry about it and you will feel so much better.

Good Luck.

I have the exact same thing. I'm 16. I don't think I'll survive 22. I have to go to college everyday though so I just keep my headphones on and live to the music. Give your life a soundtrack, it helps just a bit.

Of course you will control this, it will take time but you will get there!

You need to realise that it doesn't matter what other people think and that you have a right to an opinion as much as everyone else.



Was there any trigger for all of this? Have you ever been put down in the past that made you feel as though your opinion shouldn't be counted? If so you have to make yourself erase the past and know you can do anything you want to do, it's in your hands.

Have you ever spoken to anyone else about this? Close family and friends are a great start, but also think about talking to your GP who will not turn you away, they will be able to help you explore your feelings and maybe even refer you to someone to help you to work through your problems and help provide solutions for you. Remember they're not just there to hand out medication to everyone, they're also out there to listen to their patients, do give them a try!

Another thing that will really help is confidence groups. You'd be surprised how many people feel the same as you do. You can have group or one-to-one sessions and the teachers are really understanding and have great tips to help you to look at yourself from another perspective and to help you realise how much you have to offer everyone else with your opinions and conversation. They might also give you tips on how you interact with other people, for example your breathing, posture and expressiveness which will give you loads of confidence and help to control your anxiety. As I said check with your doctor who should have details of courses like this in your area or check your local directory which should have lots of courses like this available.

Why do you worry so much about what other people think? Try it from your own perspective, I bet when you see or meet people you aren't secretly judging them and making observations about them- it's the same with everyone else and you are definitely no different!



Try taking things one small step at a time. For example going to the shops. Start off just going down the block and back, then after a week or so aim to go to the shop and NOT CARE about how people are looking at you or talking to you, that should be your goal. Do this for a couple of weeks and then raise your aim higher, for example going somewhere further out, or starting up a conversation with someone again doing your best for that one moment to NOT CARE about what that person might or might not be thinking of you. Try not to dwell on people's comments either, do not read too much into them, because it really doesn't matter what people think of you, just move on to the next challenge you have set yourself.

Also concentrate on yourself. Are you doing any courses you are interested in? Try relaxing courses at your local sports place such as stretching, yoga, pilates etc (if you don't feel quite up to this yet start off with some books and internet sites and then build up to it). Do your best to get involved with personal interests, e.g. reading, music, sports, history- anything. This will help improve your self confidence- and then try booking onto a course in these areas, this will show you how much you have to offer everyone else and show you are good at lots of things.

I wish you the best of luck and I know you'll get through this, you just need to see that you have so much to offer everyone else, it will take time but you'll get there! :o)

Get on Ebay and look for Attacking Anxiety by Lucinda Bassett.  She has a 15 week program you can buy in the form of DVD's. It is a little expensive but worth it.  You listen to the DVD's and relaxation tapes daily and she gives you advice on how to overcome these feelings.  I am in the 5th week of the program and I feel like it is really helping me with my anxiety.
Good luck!

There is nothing to be so scared about i didn't Read everything because im really tired  but just you shouldn't care what other people think about you because they don't even know you!
Honey all im saying is that you should just go out and feel like there is nothing to worry about just keep saying that then go shopping (that's the start) and come back and you'll realise that there is nothing to be scared about! And just liv your life because if you have a husband you are probably making his life really hard to always going out for you or your children if you have any they will always go to the shop for you and they could be bullied at school and they might be bullying them when they go to the shop so don't make it hard and get a grip on your self and go!!
I hope that's ok advice some more advice if your really scared do it with a friend or your husband you will feel more confident!!

Personality disorder?



Ever since my dad passed 4 years ago, whenever I get stressed I switch into this mode where I feel like a totally different person-literally, and I even act different.  I can sort of step outside myself and observe it, but it's still really wierd.  My memories even seem to have different emotional meaning when I'm in that state.



It usually lasts a few days or so, then it goes away, usually after I get a lot of sleep.  I've tried to tell a doctor about it a couple times, but they don't pay attention.  Is this just a side affect of anxiety, which I also get OCCASIONALLY or is it serious?  I have heard that traumatic events such as death can bring out disorders that were lying under the surface.  Hopefully it's not that though.

The problems are genetic, people are carriers and don't even know it. Stress brings these things out in th open, So a death can trigger it, same as if it were other things that caused stress.

Hi there,

Dear Users 123.

I have a severe problem. Everytime I see old ladies I feel utter contempt and distrust.  I feel rage and call them names in my mind.



I hate them so much and I don't know why. I feel they are out to destroy me and make my life a living hell cause I am young and attractive. A lot of older women gives me dirty looks and play games with me without saying a word - it's true; come on you folks know this is true. People can play games without saying a word to you. And old hags do this to me all the time. Not all are bad though. Some are nice and give me cookies. lol

But most of them I get enraged just seeing them. Today I didn't even want to share an elevator with one. So I took the stairs and made comments to myself.

Forgive me for my thoughts.

I am so sorry but what is wrong with me?

I think that there is an under lying cause. Did an older lady ever do something bad to you or offend you in anyway. That's probably where it comes from. Since you are so hateful towards them i really think that you should talk to someone about it. Like a therapist. Some older ladies are very opinionated, but you have to learn to respect your elders.

Why the feeling for old ladies? You must have had an experience at one time in your life with a senior citizen that after that you started to get a rouse of suspicion that it could happen again. And no..not all of them are that bad..remember my friend that your parents either are or will be senior citizens someday..you don't want to wind up resenting them..even yourself will get there..if you see an old person looking at you in such a way..then you gotta feel sorry for them..they may be cranky..whatever..just don't look at them if you feel uneasy.

I would go to this website if you feel like you do not know how to talk to someone. Whether or not this is in your past it is still wrong and it will tare you apart until you speak out and are a victim no longer. Good luck take care. I would also recommend if you have access to a school counselor to speak to one.

Borderline personality disorder SEE'S LEPRICORN PLEASE SEE?



Hi all

I’ve been having bad few days, lastnight it got worse, I started seeing a lepricorn telling me to do things like burn the curtains and kill someone.
I attacked my husband with a very sharp knife, he managed to get it off me and sat me on the bed.
My husband rang my psychiatrist and he said that he would forcable committed me if I got any worse, and that I need to tell myself that there was no lepricorn.
I still was feeling funny so we rung my social worker  as she can calm me down, and I was fine while talking to her on the phone but when she went to talk to my husband I went funny again.
Finally my husband and social worker were going to ring the police and thats when everything stopped and I layed down and went to sleep.

Why did this happen to me? I can’t for the life of me understand why this happened.?

I see my social worker 2 times a week and at the moment she is on holidays but I can ring her at her home.

I see my psychiatrist once a month  I have been put on medication from my psychiatrist  I’m on 20mg of zyprexa and if I need too I can take a extra tablet which leads too 30mg.

I’m also on 225mg of effexor –XR  I was diagnosed with BPD (BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER) And PTSD

Can anyone tell me why this has happened? Any suggestions are welcome?? as I still feel a little strange and I don’t know why as I have taken all my medication ?? I feel very edgy and I can still see a  lepricorn



but I know its not real how do I stop this?

what can i do too stop it all?

Remember that you KNOW the leprechaun is not real. So when it starts talking, keep this feeling in mind. Then you will try to ignore it while getting some help.

You cannot go around with knives attacking people. I think if you do this again, or get tempted, you should go into hospital. That is the only responsible thing, especially if you are still seeing the leprechaun.

Perhaps your psychiatrist can modify the Zyprexa dosage.

Can you think about what your social worker said that helped calm you?  My first instinct when I read your post was that some kind of acute anxiety triggered this.  (the PTSD kicking in?) Have you ever had a hallucination before?



What do you think the leprechaun represents?  For example if we have a hard time managing an emotion like anger we might create a creature that does express it for us(?)  when you are in a safe place (maybe with your social worker) maybe you can dialog with the leprechaun



are you doing DBT therapy? It seems you need some professional help in getting skills.  I go to Recovery Inc meetings... recovery-inc.org is the website, check it out

write out a daily schedule to create structure and so you can anticipate calmly your day.  break task down to 10-15 intervals.  don't isolate.  are you going to a support group.

fyi I'm taking zoloft for the same diagnosis as you and my MD wants me to start taking tripetal.

anyway, this is just feedback from another mental health consumer, so take what I say with a grain of salt.

hang in there and remember that you do have a grip on reality since you know it just a illusion.

What do i have?.. help?



I Cant see a doctor/psychologist/anything, as i dont have medical insurence. but heres whats been going on for the last 2 years.



Going to school and sitting in class i get all nervous and cant sit still im always looking for the exits and where everyone else is looking. For some reason im afraid that something will happen to me and ill be embarressed by the whole class, Example, i get sick and puke, passout, soil myself.., or do something bad that i dont even know what it is. It makes it worse when im in class and its quiet or the teacher is not letting people go out of class, for say the bathroom.. most everyday i fight the urge to just burst out of the class and not come back. I cant listen to the teacher or remember anything that is said because i cant concentrait on anything except my problem. 
I think it has something to do with controll, i have to be able to do what i want to be able to go where i want? As i always get it in school, cars, stores, restruants, Anywhere waiting in line... I dont even go to my first perod class anymore because i walked out once when the teacher wouldnt let me leave and i just couldnt bear it and left crying (sadly im a junior boy). I just cant take it anymore, no one understands or believes me when i try and explain it everyone says im looking for attention or an easy way out of going to school... And its not my fault but everyone says it is..



Anyone have any ideas on what it may be bothering me and how i can fix it, Because im not going to go through life like this.

Well your best bet is medication (and some cognitive therapy as well):

Probably $120 will get you an appointment - maybe a little more for a 1st time visit.  $200 will get you medication for 1 month - maybe less however.  Lamictal is good for concentration (one of the side benefits despite what it is usually prescribed for - which is manic depression - but you don't need to be manic/depressive to be prescribed it).  An anti-anxiety medication would be good too - typically not as expensive as Lamictal either.



I would love to say you don't need any medication.  You might also try a really healthy diet (beans, protein, vegi's and fruits) - no sugar or caffiene.  Get a lot of exercize and get into some type of support system - like a church (even if you are not a believer) - evangelicals will take you in in a pinch but there are others.

You NEED GODS LOVE TO FLOOD YOUR LIFE. That is your answer.



You're experiencing the "torment" that the Holy Bible says fear brings when you allow it to CONTROL your existence. We are ALL living in the consequences of our previous decisions in life. Make sense?

Who you are (right now) is simply the direct result and accumulation of your PAST decisions. Only God and you know your past decisions.  I believe God is calling you back to Him.  Receive Jesus Christ into your heart and repent of your past life.  As you draw close to GOD who is LOVE, the fear will disappear from your life.
*******
*******
1 John 4:15 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.

16. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.

17. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.

18. THERE IS NO FEAR IN LOVE; BUT PERFECT LOVE CASTS OUT ALL FEAR: BECAUSE FEAR CAUSES TORMENT IN YOUR LIFE. HE THAT CONTINUALLY FEARS, HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE PERFECT (COMPLETE) THROUGH LOVE.

19. We love him, because he first loved us.

20. If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

21. And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.

Talk to your counsellor, and search around for free mental health services in your area. It definitely sounds like you have some sort of anxiety problem (generalised anxiety disorder or social anxiety disorder are my guesses). You need to deal with this ASAP, because even if you don't have health insurance, it's going to cost a lot more if it escalates (which these situations often do).

Can I combine my antidepressant medication?



No, it's not as bad as it sounds. ;P

Well, I'm on 20 mg prozac right now, but I only have three days left. I need 5 extra days before my next psychiatrist visit. I still have a lot of 10mg prozac left so I'm wondering if I can just take two 10mg prozacs.

Does it work that way? two 10mg=20mg prozac

I don't want to call for a refill because I don't want to waste another $5 for extra medication(that I will only use 5 pills out of the whole bottle) when I just need to hold out for 5 more days. I don't have a job, my social anxiety makes it hard for me to get one. My parents don't support me and my "crazy pills" so I don't want to waste too much of their money on the medication. If I hold out for five days, I will have saved them $5. =D

So, can I take two 10mg to make it a 20mg prozac? or does it not work that way...

It does work that way. I am prescribed the same 20mg prozac, and I have to take 2 everyday b/c each pill is only 10mg. 
Please consult your doc if you are still worried though.
But I promise taking two of the 10mg will not do any harm-- it is exactly the same as the 20mg!!

Two items: one directly related to this question, and one point that has to be made.

Directly related to this question: if your 10mg pills ARE NOT EXPIRED then you should be okay. Check to make sure that they're still in date.

One point that I haven't seen covered: what to do when you need to go the "other way" - e.g. splitting 1 20mg pill into 2 10mg pills.

It's important to cover this, and we have a reasonable venue here. DO NOT "split" larger pills into smaller ones, especially if they're marked "CR" or another designator for "controlled-release".

It sounds like a panic attack. I get them if I don't keep up on breathing exercises every day for about ten minutes.
Lay down on the floor with a book on your tummy to breathe using your diaphragm. Take a deep breathe, hold for 4 seconds and slowly release. Repeat this for the next ten minutes and remember to do it every day and you will likely get some control over the anxiety you suffer, hopefully. I know if I get lazy because I improve, I wake up feeling like I'm in danger and will die. 
At least try it for awhile and if all else fails, see a doctor; I know it's frightening.

It's happened to me before once after a nightmare but sometimes it's been during a period when i've had something on my mind.Have you got any money worries or had a problem at work,fallen out with someone and felt guilty?There could be no real reason are you getting enough sleep or do you wake a lot during the night?This is something you could talk to your doctor about to make sure you have no health worries and set your mind at rest.
I find the problem solved by listing everything i need to do and ticking them off when done,asking if there's a problem is there anything i can do about it,if there is i do it if not i tell myself not to worry.i budget my finances to make sure bills are paid.I know it sounds boring but it helps me.

what kind of bad thoughts?  Bad thoughts can be killed through a process of self talk.  Tell yourself you're good.  Tell yourself all sorts of good things, especially things you like about yourself.  Tell yourself you're going to okay.  Bad thoughts can be killed by activities.  Get out and do something you like.  Bad thoughts tend to vanquish in the middle of an activity as your focus shifts to what you are doing.  Good luck I hope you find happiness in what you do and know that you are a good person =)

What kinda "bad" thoughts? 
Harming yourself or others? If that's the case I'd say call a doctor or police station and tell them the thoughts you have and that you want to seek help. 
If they are bad thoughts, you already know that you arent to act on them. 
Talk to someone you trust and be honest, and seek some help from an actual person rather than the answer's section.

Watch your fav movie, and think about that movie all day.
If it doesn't work, it's prob. because you're thinking to hard about NOT thinking about it.
Just don't think about anything to do with it.
When I wanna clear my head, I run down to the arcade and play some games. Keeps my head thinking about the game, and not the other stuff.
Hope this helped!

sometimes u cant and sometimes you cant help the bad thoughts they jsut come 
alot of people benefit from therapy and meds when they r cursed with bad thoughts 
you can try posotive thinking ...that is when the bad thoughts start taking over you make a decision to stop them and think of something else. This is usually only a temporary fix if you are genuinely plagued with bad thoughts you probably need to seek the help of a counselor or therapist.



sorry i couldnt help you more 
good luck in your quest for happiness.

You should really try writing down everything that is bothering you just get it all out.  Im assuming that you are freaking out because you cant really talk to anyone about this situation so if you at least write it down its out of your head and you do feel a little more relived.  After you do that go for a jog around the block a couple of times.  Good Luck

heya !
i went through a stage of this once before.
i felt like i wanted to off load all my thoughts and feelings someone but couldnt as they had become soo strange. 
some were about death and things of such. i found that i was having panic attacks and i was really scared.

but after a while things seem to grow off. i went to see a doctor and they tryed to diagonose the problem. 
in the end it just grew off me, i think it was something to do with my hormones as i was just 13.



talking to people really helps, so get someone to talk to. i felt when i talked to people about my promblems that a bubble of problems had burst and i was free.

sorry this is a bit of a weird reply

but theirs nothing you can really watch or read to help. you just need to overcome it naturally with help from friends or family.

what kind of bad thoughts? if you mean like muderous bad thoughts you might need psych help. if you have like depressing thoughts "nothing's good, i'm a bad person" stuff like that, watch some philosophical movies, "waking life" is a good one, might need a few viewings to understand but it presents you with a life view that is sort of relaxing and exciting at the same time

I have mild OCD, so I can fully identify with this problem. They're called intrusive thoughts. I am seeing aCognative Behavorial Therapist, and this is what she says:

95% of people have intrusive thoughts, but certain people fixate on them. So many people have them that they are perfectly normal, it's just that most people forget about them straight away. Having them does not make you a bad person, it makes you normal.

She says that the best thing to do is to challange these thoughts. Each time you have one, remind yourself that it is only an intrusive thought, it's not a reflection on you or your personality, it does not make you a bad person. Once you have convinced yourself that it is not you that's bad, you can relax slightly.



What I find helps is distraction. If I get an intrusive thought, first I tell myself that it is only a thought, it doesn't mean that I am going to do it. Then I deliberately think of something else. Reading a book, watching a film, or thinking of a story, anything to make your mind focus on something other than the thought. Once you've distracted yourself, the thought usually goes away, and you'll find that you're no longer bothered by it.

I have so much experiance of this, I know it makes you feel like you're a bad person, but honestly you're not. It's perfectly normal, even if it doesn't feel like it.



Hope that's helped.

Hey there!

Nice to know I'm not the only one :D

Anyway, you should watch TV shows like "8 Out of 10 Cats" and "Mock the Week" as the comedians on the shows just make you laugh about the things happening around the world in today's society.

Try YouTube.com for clips of these shows and maybe try searching for a few of these:

- laughing baby
- extreme funny (click the second one)
- animusic
- whose line is it anyway (pick a few clips)
- sexy mouse (a mouse mimicking lyrics to " I'm too sexy... " with a twist)
There's loads!

And please try "Dave Gorman's GoogleWhack Adventure", my auntie showed me when i was down and i was rolling on the floor killing myself with laughter!

That ought to do it!
=D

After a bad thought comes to your mind , think about it and think that its no big deal, just your mind playing tricks on you...just your mind.



Remember that your mind can AMPLIFY the smallest problem and make it REALLY BIG. Why suffer when the problem is so small ? Enjoy the little things life has.
So, whos in charge of your mind ? YOU are.

When a bad thought comes to you. STOP.THINK: DOES THAT REALLY MATTER ? OF COURSE NOT, ITS JUST MY MIND.

Think "Everything is cool, its just my mind. Im going to go out and enjoy life, life is beautiful. Im going to do something good for myself: new haircut, a new piece of clothe, gonna take a nice warm bath."

I think it's better than the older Carbamazepine, for the liver. It can reduce body sodium, affect the oral contraceptives, and affects fetal development. It can cause impulsive behaviour and concentration loss, but generally has good effects on mood/anxiety disorders in epilepsy patients.

Try to remember that you are unique and special and you deserve to walk on this earth and enjoy your life.

Try not to be so sensitive.  If you can remember that you cannot help what other people say to you, but you can sure not have to react to rude or insensitive people.

Also, try positive self statements like " I am capable, competent caring person" and "I like me just the way I am."
