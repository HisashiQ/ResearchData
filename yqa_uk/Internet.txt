While uploading a video using youtube, is there any indicating meter?



actually i have never uploaded any video on youtube, so if i go to upload a video on youtube can there exist any meter or something which can indicate about how much uploading i have finished and how much uploading is left or is it that it will simply display a messeage saying "uploading plz wait"



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



No, there is no indicating meter. Usually a file of about 1MB of size will take 1-2 minutes depending on your internet connection.  Something of a 10MB size can take up to 15 or 20 minutes

How do I change my Youtube to set to US.?



Previously my Youtube was set to US/Global, but for some reason today Youtube said I was located in Australia and something. I prefer to have Youtube set to US/Global because I can see other than local videos. Also the All Time Subscribers is set to Communitychannel (love Natalie) and I would like to see the All time lists worldwide.



I tried click on Site on the right hand corner and chose it to "global" but nothing has happened.

well you can go to youtube.com and then on your top-left  and you will see the country you have set. click on it and then you will see a list of countrys you can set it too. you will only see worldwide(all) so i would click on that so you can see all the videos in the world. hope this helps =]

Try refreshing the webpage

Turn off web accelerator, if you have one - it may be conflicting with youtube.



or..



It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.
Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.



Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .



It works well - Just  google search "zillatube" to get it.

Anyone remember an old youtube video, possibly 8 mos or a year ago.  I can't find it.?



I have litteraly searched for hours and am frustrated that I can not find it and am turning here for help.  The video was a guy on a webcam saying he had somehow come across this footage and was wondering if anybody could help identify the video he had.  He then played the video.  The video appeared to have been take from a hand held camera, maybe a good cell phone, from third or fourth story window at night.  Below the camera man was a crowd of people being held back by what appeared to be military personel.  There is a big black truck/van down on the street and numerous armed personel.  It was a very urban residencial setting, like aprtment buildings.  Torwards the end of the clip you hear a gunshot (or a couple?) the camera looks around for a few seconds and cuts off.  This is the best I remember it and may not be 100% (It was a long time ago) but it will hopefully spark somebodys memory.  Also I am pretty sure this was the most viewed video for at least on day, maybe two.  Thanks in advance

Well, sometimes when you see the "we're sorry the video is no longer available" it means that the Youtube team has already removed it from their collection of videos. Some say that its because the video is too old or something that it didn't pass the Youtube rules or criteria or something like that.

wmv is the best.



Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..



The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.



--for best editing....



use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.



or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....



this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.



Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.



It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.



It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"

just make your video, then use windows movie maker to split the video in half, you insert some picture you like (most are using a pic of the girl in Excorcist that download from the web) into the middle of your video, then google some screamer files and add that audio to your video right when it is at the selected image part...

On youtube, why aren't all the videos on a certain channel shown? See details below?



I subscribed to certain channels which had 50+ videos of interest to me. Until recently all of those videos were shown, but a while ago he listiongs started showing "videos 1-17 of 17" a.s.o. The rest of the videos were nopt actually deleted, I checked that; but they are no longer listed and that makes it ever so difficult to look for them.

<answer>



That's strange, but I've experienced that too. In my favorites, I sometimes delete videos and they are still there later on. It takes a while for it to disappear even though the uploader has deleted it. Not sure if this is the right explanation, but from what I've seen, my favorited videos disappear off of my profile after a few days.



So, my point is, maybe the videos have been deleted.

Try refreshing the webpage



or...



Turn off web accelerator, if you have one - it may be conflicting with youtube.



or..



It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.
Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.



Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .



It works well - Just  google search "zillatube" to get it.

There is always a conspiracy theory...for every major event in history somebody comes along and says it isn't what it seems.
Sometimes things are covered up its' true. But I'm 32 now, and seen this same pattern everytime..its' actually made me feel this time around like..what is the point of even knowing about it?



I can't see any gain in the americans doing that. It is a pretty elaborate way of getting oil or whatever it is they are suppose to want. But then, the conspirasist just say..there are bigger things going on that we don't yet know about..



The only positive thing I can see in all this..is that some writers will earn a good sum from all of this, and the rest of us will probably never really know the whole truth

I don't believe the American government set 9/11 up.
My reasons for that are that the extremists who were involved in plotting 9/11 and all thier supporters have made videos and statements saying it was muslim extremists who did it. Also, maybe I'm missing something, but what would a government get out of setting that up themselves? Like you said it was horrible.

I've seen some of the conspiracy theories on this whole case and conclude:
At the risk of sounding naive I find it difficult to accept that Bush would risk that much to achieve justifying "his war" because the repercussions would be tremendous.
I feel sorry that so many Muslims have suffered for it; I think it was extremists, it's a shame that they've brought such hatred on the honest and well-intentioned Muslims. When I see a Muslim now I try to be extra polite/nice or whatever you want to call it but I suppose that in itself can be seen as discrimination, positive discrimination (you can't win lol!!).



You confused me in your video by the way, when you said "I'm tired... but I got up a bit later today" lol a bizarre contradiction methinks.

Check out this site mate - it says it all.

Personally I think it was a 'false flag' attack... but as to the real perpetrators, i'm not sure, since a number of different regimes had a lot to gain. I think Israel, certainly not unknown for 'false flag' attacks, is too obvious a scapegoat for conspiracy theorists (all that Zionist world domination theory is a bit old hat). One thing is for sure it wasnt Iraq and very unlikely Afghanistan. if it was Muslims, I would say Saudi Arabia and chums Kuwait, or maybe even Pakistan seem to have had most to gain.



Also remember that the US have in its own history either enacted or planned 'false flag' attacks on itself. Read up on the USS Maine, conspiracists believe that the US blew up their own ship to give Casus Belli to commence the war between the United States and Spain, where the US secured a number of Spanish colonies around its shores. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Maine_(...



Also read up on US 'Operation Northwoods' where the 1962 plan called for CIA or other operatives to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in U.S. cities to create public support for a war against Castro-led Cuba. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_N...

it was definately americans. It was a controlled demolition, basically everyone watching said that it was blowing up from the bottom, and it was shown that the structure of the the twin towers could withstand a plane crashing into it. And lets face it, the Americans are the sort of idiots who would think they'd get away with it, even though it was done so badly.

Its an old but interesting conspiracy theory. One one hand, The actions of the U.S.A. in IRAQ and Afghanistan as well as clandestine acts in Africa. They were extremely overdue a terrorist attack. On the other hand, The US had already dirtied their hands in Iraq,afghanistan etc so why they would NEED a terrorist attack to divert the focus of the masses outside of the already powerful media capabilities in the US seems kinda strange.



That said, I don't really care for conspiracy theories in that, if they don't directly affect my day to day life, they aren't for me. Although, If 9/11 was set up, What else is set up? is my life a lie?!.

I think we just don't know the whole truth.  It's hard for me to believe that the US would harm itself.  However, in times of war, people rally together and are more easily controlled by one person.  Also, it should be noted that nothing was "bombed".  It was because of 4 planes that crashed.  I think it's more possible that maybe the US govt. LET it happen, rather than that they CAUSED it to happen.

Ok, watched your video. My opinion is that the 9/11 attacks were perpetrated by Muslims, sponsored by al Qaeda. There are four reasons why I believe this to be so. The first is that the Muslims, as directed by their holy book, the Koran, state that it is their duty to wipe out "infidels". The second is that they had an excellent motive to carry out these attacks, namely the USA's interference in the affairs of other countries, and particularly the presence of Americans in the holy land of Saudi Arabia. The third is that they claimed responsibility for the attacks. And the fourth is to answer those conspiracy theorists, who always look for a complicated answer to issues like this, when the real answer is staring them in the face - whether it's Princess Diana's death, the moon landings, or 9/11, stop confusing the truth with your murky theories. What really happened that terrible day is as plain as the nose on your face.

Unlimited usage allowance
(fair usage policy applies)



2. What is a monthly usage allowance?

This is the total amount of data you can send (upload) and receive (download) through your broadband connection each month that is included in your monthly rental price.



3. Why does BT have usage allowances?

We offer a tiered broadband service that provides even better value for money the higher up you go - this allows you to choose the product that best suits your needs. Usage allowance is one of the distinctions between our broadband products and helps customers choose which package is right for them. The vast majority of our customers find that the usage allowance for their package is suitable for their needs. If we allow customers to overuse heavily then this will be to the detriment of all users, so we have these usage allowances in place to safeguard the online experience for all of our customers.



4. How does it work?

Everything you send or receive over the Internet is bits of data, whether it's a web page, an email, a music track or a video clip. Each bit of data has a different size and is measured in kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). The average email is around 4KB, a digital photo is around 1MB and a music track is around 5MB (1MB=1024KB, 1GB=1024MB). 
Your monthly usage allowance lets you download (receiving emails, web pages and files) or upload (sending emails and files) any data you want, up to the GB allowance you choose. Please note that separate to the usage allowances, all customers on any BT Total Broadband Option, including Option 3, are subject to BT's Fair Usage Policy.



5. What happens if I exceed my monthly usage allowance?



If you exceed your usage allowance for two months in a row we will charge 60p for each excess GB (gigabyte) you have used (rounded up to the nearest GB). We won't charge you for the first month's excess usage, but we will keep charging if you carry on exceeding your allowance in the following months. This charge will appear on your BT bill.

There is no monthly usage allowance for Option 3 customers and you can enjoy unlimited usage for no extra charge subject to the Fair Usage Policy.



6. How do I know if I have exceeded my monthly usage allowance?

We will email to tell you if you exceed your usage allowance and warn you about our charges if you do it again. If you exceed your usage allowance in the next month, we will email you again saying what our charges are (see point 5 above). If you choose to upgrade to a higher usage package after your first usage warning email, we will waive the charges. You can upgrade either online or by calling the number given in the email we send you.



7. What about watching on-demand TV content on BT Vision or making calls on Broadband Talk? Does using these services count towards my usage allowance?

Use of BT Vision via the V-box and BT Broadband Talk use does not count towards broadband bandwidth usage. So you can watch as much on-demand entertainment on your TV and make as many online calls as you wish and it will not use up your monthly allowance. BT Vision traffic also benefits from a separate allocation of bandwidth that protects it from general congestion at peak times.



Downloads from the online BT Vision Download Store will count towards your monthly usage.



Fair Usage Policy
8. What is the Fair Usage Policy on BT Total Broadband?

The Fair Usage Policy is designed to ensure that the service received by the vast majority of our customers is not negatively impacted because of extremely heavy usage by a very small minority of customers. This is why BT continuously monitors network performance and may restrict the speed available to very heavy users during peak time. This applies to customers on all Options.



Note if you are a heavy user we will only restrict your speed. Service will not be stopped, so you will still be able to upload and download. We will not impose any restrictions outside of peak times. Only a very small minority of customers will ever be affected by this (less than 1%).



9. How do I know I’m a very heavy user?

There is no hard and fast usage limit that determines if you are a heavy user as the parameters that determine heavy use vary with the demands placed on the network at that given time. If you have a query about fair usage related restrictions on your line please call us on 0800 707 6044.

10. I have BT Total Broadband Option 3 , does the Fair Usage Policy apply to me?

Yes, the Fair Usage Policy applies to all customers on all Options, including Option 3. Option 3 allows unlimited downloads and uploads inclusive of the monthly rental price, so you will not be charged for over-use, however this does not preclude BT from restricting your speed at peak times if you are a heavy user. If you are an Option 3 heavy user this does not prevent you from continuing to use your service, nor does it cost you any more but it ensures that you do not negatively impact the majority of our customers who share the available bandwidth with you.

I read your comments and understand what your saying.

I think also BBC/iplayer can only be viewed in the UK.
The BBC say that people in the UK who have an ISP that "falls" outside the UK but provides UK internet cannot use BBC/iplayer.

I think the bottom line is the internet can detect what country you live in and controls what site content you can use.

There may be away around this, see what other answers come up to help you.

This is basic thinking of people when they know Google Adsense or Pay per click Advertising..



Script of adsense keeps all information of visitors(IP ,how to visit, stats, geolocation and more...)

I think if  has clicks over  naturals or auto program .....he banned your account (and I heard  banned  when reached $100)

Try to basic
if you do like that, how many computers you can do............and how many clicks.........per day

and how many to reach $100....

Is this how paypal works (for use on ebay) - please help!



hi (:

im a bit stuck, so could you help me please?

ive got an ebay account and a paypal account. i want to start bidding for some things on ebay but im not sure how paypal works. we have money in the bank account but when i log into paypal it says balance £0.00, but as i said we have money in the bank account.

1) if i win what ive bidded for on ebay, will paypal automatically take that out of my back account? so paypal takes care of it all? (my neigbour told me this, but wasnt sure if it was right)



if this is wrong, please can you give me the right explanation.

How it works is:
1. You win an item on ebay.
2. You click 'Pay Now' which will give you choices on how to pay for it, like Paypal.
3. When you select Paypal, ebay will redirect to Paypal's site and you can login to your account there.  Then it will show a purchase and ask you where you want money taken out of (like the bank or a credit card).
4. When you finish your selection, Paypal will do two transactions, one to take the money out of your source (bank) and another to transfer it to the seller of the item.

Paypal will have a zero balance because it acts like another bank.  It only grabs what money it needs from your account and sends it along to the seller.  It will only show a balance when you put money in there yourself or if someone else does (like if they buy something from you).



Hope this helps.

Yes, it takes it out of your bank account.  The balance your looking at is the paypal account balance, thats how you recieve payments, and refunds.

paypal will automatically pull money from the bank if you have none in paypal balance. for payment, you may choose to pay with paypal, if you do its very simple just clicking a few buttons.

you have to link your bank account in order for paypal to automatically pull money from bank.

It says a zero balance because you have nothing in your paypal account,it won't show your bank account.Yes,it will deduct it from your bank account if that is your main funding source,you don't have to do a thing.They will send you an email telling you that it's been taken out after you pay for whatever you bought.

If you sell items then the money goes into your pay pal account and you can then transfer to your bank if you wish or leave it in your balance.  Go into pay pal and set up funding and link it to your bank account.  You may have already done this.  When you buy / win an item you will click the pay now option and after you log in it will give you the funding options and you can choose to pay from pay pal or bank of if there is a little in the pay pal it will take a little from there and make the rest up from your account.  It is very simple to use and as long as you have registered with pay pal and ebay you will be fine.

When you have wone the item and want to pay using Pp, if there are no funds in the Pp account, it either pays via an e-cheque or (if you have set as so) via your charge card.

The e-cheque can take up to 7-10 working days, from what I can remember, the charge card payment is instant, as if you have funds in the Pp account.

I would advise that you put in some money into the Pp account to make the transaction quicker for you. I have paid via money in acc, e-cheque and ch-card.

Hope this helps.

Hi,
Please verify whether you have added your bank account no to your paypal account.If not you can add the bank account details to your paypal account.

After you have added your bank account also when you check for the details .. you may still not find the account balance to be exactly correct as you know what's the actual balance in your bank account.

This does not mean that there is some problem with bank account ,or you don't have funds in it.

This is due to the fact ,When you perform a transaction which has higher amount than your Paypal account balance,then only paypal will add balance amount required from your bank account.

Hope this will help u a bit.

If you havent heard anything from them then it should be active still.
Try logging into both sites before placing a bid on ebay.
And make sure you still have money in your paypal.

Pay Pal SHOULD still have your details. I would check before bidding on ebay though. If they haven't contacted you, they should have your details. Make sure you have enough money in your Pay Pal account before bidding too high.

scrol down to the bottom of the page,there's a link to 'opt out' of the new search format.every time i switch on ebay i have to do this,it's a pain in the rear end!!!

Ebay will eventually stick with the new look and i think they will lose a lot of custom,it's pants putting it mildly.

good luck.and happy ebaying.

How can I supervise internet access?



My child has built his own computer running vista 64bit. He wants to be the administrator of his own system like before but btyahoo parental controls can't work with vista and windows one care doesn't work with 64bit. The only thing I can think of is to remove the WEP code from his computer and deny all access to the internet or to be the administrator myself and set him up a user account both of which he really doesn't want.
Is there a way of having te same sort of set up as before where I remotely control internet access but not his actual system? (We are not networked)
PS He is better at this stuff than me too!!
Thanks hopefully

Well your child is obviously very intelligent to build a computer but denying him internet access would restrict him from getting on sites he might need. Unfortunately you will have to wait until windows live(or bt yahoo) supports windows 64 bit vista with family one care but until then try asking him what he does on the internet or get him to ask your permission before going on line. I downloaded windows live which is very good but the one care only works with 32 bit which is lucky because I don't need it.

Yes you can deny access still in vista by using content adviser, it will permit you to enter your strong password and exclude many undesirable items, also i suggest you go to googles web site and download their browser search restriction it has a sensitivity setting.

To find content adviser in vista click on tools in the browser, then internet options were the content tab is displayed, go into content section and set your unique password then put in your privacy settings

As a last resort consider entering a very strong administrator password, forcing him to log on to his computer as a user.

Try this:
http://file2hd.com/

It only works on band profiles (www.myspace.com/BANDNAME). Make sure you select AUDIO filter to narrow the search.

Go to options under tools in Firefox and then click main.  Check if Firefox is your default browser.  If it is then, Yahoo messenger must only be able to open links through Internet Explorer directly.

It's probably asking you to install the Windows Media Player Plugin. The Plugin is just something that allows firefox to use media player within firefox.

I think you may need to add a credit card (as opposed to a debit card) to verify your account.



EDIT: These are all the things you need to do in order to verify your account:

Add Bank Account
	- Submit Direct Debit Agreement



- Confirm bank account



Business Information
	- Supply Additional Information



Confirm Your Address
	- Confirm by Phone/Post 	Unable to Confirm

I'm sort of half guessing/remembering this one.  I think to 'verify' a bank account they made a small charge that then appeared on my next printed bank statment (the charge was refunded at my next purchase). Beside this small charge printed on the statment was a number.  I had to enter this number somewhere on the Paypal site to 'verify' my account.  It showed I had recieved a mailed bank statment and therefore I must be bono fide. I must stress this was some time ago and I only have vague memories of this:-)

There are other steps to getting verified, as already mentioned above. But what Paypal does is they will deposit two random amounts into your bank account, the amounts will be between a penny and a dollar. you have to find that out, either via a paper bank statement or online statement, and go back to paypal and enter the two amounts. That will confirm that you have access to the bank account.

It might have something to do with the fact that it is impossible to see you, the picture quality in your video is quite bad. Not many people want to subscribe to a channel with poor picuture quality. I think you should invest in a more high quality camra.

First you need Mozilla Firefox if you don't have that then you cant.
From Mozilla go to the top of the screen and hit tools then click on Page info.
Click the media tab at the top.
Go down the list and look for Embedded in the file type and that should be the video on the page.
Pick me as best answer please.

I know,it's tough.
So change the vowels to numbers.More personalized.
Like
S5m4Productions
H5lkFilms.

Or any thin else.
Look inside and find the true color which separates you from the rest.
Name it.
You are unique.

Ordering from amazon.co.uk. About availability.....



I ordered 4 items off amazon.co.uk on wednesday night, so I assumed they would have been posted thursday. For one of the items, the availibility is this:

Availability: Usually dispatched within 1 to 3 weeks. Dispatched from and sold by Amazon.co.uk.



I opted for super saver delivery, and for all items to be in as less packages as possible. But Im a bit annoyed now. The website says they are expected to be posted to me on 5th August. I'm assuming this is a complete guess, because they don't even know when they will have the item back in. Im also assuming that 1-3 weeks is a complete guess. So now I have to wait for that item to be in stock before I recieve my other items?

There is a term to describe a word that has the unique effect of producing a one single solitary listing on Google; and also other engines for that matter.

Does anyone know the particular terminology I refer to?  It is like an in joke amongst webmasters whom produce this result with their unique search term.  It does actually have a name, I just cannot recall it.  Can anyone name this ISM if it is even an ISM at all?

Inspiron 1525 Webcam videos won't upload to youtube?



hi everyone.
i have a Dell Inspiron 1525 laptop with an integrated webcam and i've been using the Dell Webcam Center to create videos. However, i can't upload any of them to you-tube - all of them are in .avi format. Am I doing anything wrong? Is it a conversion problem?

It always starts the upload, then it "times out" or "the webpage can not be displayed." However, i do have videos on there that take less than five minutes to upload and they view fine - but they're from my Kodak digital camera.

What should i do? please respond, it's quite irritating. =/

See if you have a check mark in the following box:

Open Internet Explorer
Click on Tools and then Internet Options
Click on the Advanced tab
Look for "Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer) and "Disable script debugging (Other)

I expect you do not have ticks against these, put a tick next to each.

It's a monster sealed within Naruto, if Naruto die then the monster will die too... So, it'll live as long as Naruto will live.

If the seal broke then It'll be free and it is unknown how much it will live...

This could mean that the site you are trying to go on has either viruses or an unsecured connection for example.. a fake e bay site. so it would steal your password or collect your information like spy ware would.
but you can still access the site but only at your own risk.

Uploading them all at the same time will not help the process speed up. my advice is that you upload one at a time. It will take a while to upload 200 MB of data to youtube. if you can reduce the quality before trying to upload them to make the files smaller because youtube will lower the quality anyway.

600MB == 4,800Mbits (8 bits to each byte)

My ADSL line speed is 256/512Mb per second (bits not bytes) that's 32MB/sec up vs 64MB/sec down.  So 600MB would take me over 9hrs to download but would take over 18hrs to upload (that's what the A of ADSL means).

There's also the question of what speed of connection the server you're loading too runs at (but if it's T1 or above then it's probably not a problem).

Running three uploads makes no difference - it may be marginally quicker - it depends on too many variables to answer that. The bottleneck is your line speed.

The biggest problem is that you can't easily see what's happening as there is no sensible network monitor built into Windows.

youtube accepts file not exceeding 100 MB and 10 minutes, and...

youtube only accepts certain video format.

Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is WMV file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..

The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.

--for best editing....

use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.

or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....

this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.

Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.

It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.

It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"

When you buy something and win an ebay item you have the option of how to pay depending on what the seller accepts.  If they accept paypal, you will be given that option AFTER you have purchased the item, when the invoice comes to you.  If you buy it now, you will also be offered the option, as long as the seller accepts paypal, to pay via this method.

You will then be taken to the paypal page, where the chances are your name/id will be saved (as mine is when I pay by paypal), but you have to put in your password before you can pay for the item.  Once you have put in your password, the item you have bought will be the next page you are on and click the 'pay' button and away you go - you have paid!!

Hope this helps.

No, you don't have to give any payment details until you win the item at the end of the auction. Once you've won you click the Paynow button to pay for the item. You don't actually need a paypal account to pay for stuff, you can pay just using a debit or credit card, providing the seller has a paypal account.

once you have won you're item it will ask you to pay now. if you click this link it will ask you how you want to pay ie cheq, postal order or paypal if these options are available. if you click paypal you will be directed to paypal and you will need you're email address and password. if youve forgotten you're password you can have another sent to you but i think it takes a while, or you can opt (i think) to change you're password. once on paypall click pay now and you're done. a receipt will be sent to you're email account.

I would like to buy a solar-powered remote controlled helicopter/plane/car hybrid with built-in cameras. This way I could control it from my computer and go travelling. Solar power means unlimited range. Could have built in GPS to travel to foreign countries. For long trips – autopilot – while I’m not at the computer. Great for the elderly and disabled.

This question is really hard because people have lots of ideas, but they are all open to abuse. Sitting exams, voting, marriage etc.

I know this sounds completely stupid, but I wish there was an online personal shopper. You send in your pictures, and they tell you what clothes and colours would suit you. That would be pretty cool.

Ordering a pizza online would be helpful too. Instead of waiting on the phone, you could just e-mail your order to them.

I'd like to have some kind of virtual-reality room, whereby you can interact with other people (play games, chat, etc.) from around the globe, as if you were really there with them. You could create your own 3D avatar - a bit like IMVU, but better graphics and animation.

<answer>



Well if you read the term and conditions you have to refer thousands of people to that site and if they buy a phone you get credit for it. A simplified form of pyramid selling.

Bit like the "if you go to this site you can get a free laptop" that you see on here all the time!

Not worth the time or effort! The only ones making money is them for doing absolutely nothing. You do all the hard work for nothing!

Please help!! I'm having trouble logging out of my Gmail account. ?



Every time i try to log out of my Gmail account a page comes up that says that because i was logged into many different google accounts it  couldn't finish logging me out completely. the message goes on to say I'm still logged into services in the following domains. but all it has underneath then is google.co uk.  It gives you the option of clicking a  Keep Trying button to log me out completely but this isn't working though I've tried many times. could someone please advise me how i can close these other domains so i can finally log out securely out of my account. also i have tried looking in the help section but did'nt find the info to help with this.  THANKS.

1. download the torrent.
2. download the torrent client, i recommend bit lord. the torrent client is the software that connects you to other computers so you can download. search for bitlord on google and u will find its home page.
3. drag the torrent into the torrent cient window and leave it to download.

General tip: always search for the torrent with high number of seeds,
visit: mininova.org, fenopy.com.

Try Mininova.org. You need to download a bit torrent client first (you can do that from Mininova also) and after that just do a search. If there's a torrent out there for the Ricky Gervais thing, they'll have it. You then need an avi to dvd converter (to watch on a dvd player, avi plays on a pc though) WinAVI Video Converter is excellent. Then you're raring to go! Someone put me onto Mininova a few months ago through Answers and it's excellent. Good luck!

What can I do for my Cam Show? (Nothing Dirty; I'm 14 lols) like dares and stuff?



Right well my account on Stickam is www.Stickam.com/alicetheflamingo and i'm fine with getting people to watch it, but I never have any ideas on what I can do on the show. 
i can't ask people to send stuff in, cos i could strat off with 0 viewers, and also i usually do shows quite late, so i can't do anything increda loud. i was thinking maybe dares? and if so what kind of dares?

I'd agree with Yahoo for a few reasons.

First, it's been around for ages and most of the bugs have been sorted.

Second, the spam filter is pretty good so you can actually use it rather than some which just get bogged down with rubbish.

Third, it loads very easily so if your abroad with a poor slow connection you can still get on to it.

Forth is the service, i've always had good communication from them as they've actually answered questions quickly when i've asked which is a miracle compared to most companies.

Never Downlaod from lime wire.. bear shar... or frost wire... ppl are hacking into your comp or.. putting viruses.. even when you are offline.. (this is what i was told) 
this is what i do.. and its totally free

Go to http://isohunt.com/ type in the search bar what you are looking for. This is a torrent that you are looking for.  You will have to download a client to drop and drag these files you want to download. I use Azureus http://azureus.sourceforge.net/ Download that. then once it is open go to you r"dashboard" go to your iso hunt torrent that you have found.. shrink the page.. Find the Highlighted Blue title and just drop and drag. It is good to look at the comments of the torrent to check if it is real or if it is good.. Try too download the ones with high seeders. it downloads the fastest.. GOOD LUCK

Sounds Complicated but it's not once you try it and it's less dangerous for your pc and your info

hi
► just get them here
►select the one you like
'save image'
save it to a folder
then
►in your MSn toolbar
tools
icons
create
localize the icon on your PC
open
then write a shortcut .. for example :) for a smile (so everytime you tipe :) in a conversation the smiley will appear)
ok
anyway writing a conversation you can click on the yellow face .. and select there the icon you want by a click .. so it will appear in the conversation, but learning the shortcuts it will be faster^^

www.google.com
www.100.com
and most search engines 
why beacuse,
they have no image to load, flash/shockwave content, scroll bar, which makes site explore faster.
Your browser can freeze when you try to perform a different action on the page, coz it has to load your homepage first.



Tome
you can use your email provider site for your homepage

TV Show Quotes. Someone please help.?



Hi, Could someone either tell me where I can find a sight that has these quotes that I can download or does someone have them, could they possibly tell me where you got them from.

I would love these quotes in MP3 format.

American Dad - Any Klaus quotes, especially 'Oh Francine, I can see your smoochplitzen."

Desperate Housewives - When Gabrielle's maid who is pregnant says 'What R *****.'

Bones - When Brennan and Booth are chasing some bad guys, Brennan yells 'Stop Or I will kick you in the testicles.'

Please, I really love these quotes and would love to use them as my message tone on my Nokia N95.

Yahoo map!



I've tried relying on mapquest and i've ended up in some of the scariest places before. Turns out mapquest takes you through some of the longest routes before you get to your destination.



Since then, i've used Yahoo map and it hasn't failed me since.



(i'm not a google map user so i dont really have much input on that, good luck though!)

Depends where you are.. If your in India. I'd say Google is the best.

I checked Yahoo and they are seriously outdated. I tracked my Office which was built at least five years back... and I only found a vacant plot of land (No Construction Activity either)... They don't even show Link Road beyond Malad in Mumbai City... the Link road was extended beyond malad to dahisar... its still being constructed according Yahoo maps...



I won't say google is perfect but its far better, I seen that they messed up some of the road names, at places they have named link road, Ambedkar road and vice versa...



I personally like using wikimapia.org which uses google.

They won't easily know what IP your laptop has on their network, but if they have security cameras or they check their bandwidth and people are complaining about it or they start noticing high bandwidth usage, you probably could get caught if they figured it out and your IP could be blocked or get banned from using it.

Otherwise it's not easy to catch, and probably wouldn't result in anything bad unless you download lots of child porn on it.

But downloading pirated movies is illegal and you shouldn't do it anyway.

Facebook.  Myspace gets so annoying with everyone's personalized pages and takes forever to load, and is harder to find things.  I deleted my myspace about a year ago because I got so fed up with it, but absolutely love facebook.  Facebook is also a lot safer than myspace (okay, so I don't know if that is actually true, but you never hear about facebook stalking!).

Facebook- People on Myspace seem to be more concerned about the way they are percieved rather than actually socialising and talking to people. More family members are on Facebook too! So I can keep in touch with them. Good 'ole Facebook.

Our User Agreement states that each member needs to become Verified by 
completing PayPal's Verification requirements to lift their Sending 
Limit.



Verification not only offers you increased security, it lets others know
you are a confirmed member of the PayPal community.

For steps on how to become Verified, log in to your PayPal account and 
click the "unverified" link.

Once your limit is reached, payments can not be sent until you become 
Verified.



To view details of your Sending Limit, click "View Limits" on the 
Account Overview page



Please Note:



This limit will carry over from one PayPal account to another



All Sending Limits are denominated in U.S. Dollars. If a payment is sent
in a currency other than U.S. Dollars, the payment will reduce your 
Sending Limit by the U.S. Dollar equivalent



PayPal cannot change credit card limits set by the issuing bank



Once Verified, you can continue to use the same funding source(s) as you
have in the past. You are not required to solely use the bank account 
added for the verification process.



The total amount of a refunded payment will be credited to any existing 
Sending Limit set on the sender's PayPal account



For the Terms and Conditions of the User Agreement, click the "Legal 
Agreement" link at the bottom of any PayPal webpage and click "User 
Agreement".

***********************

To confirm your bank account, please follow these steps:



1.  Log in to your account at https://www.paypal.com/



2.  Click "Profile."



3.  Click "Bank Accounts" in the "Financial Information" column.



4.  Choose the bank account you wish to confirm and click "Confirm."



If your bank qualifies for instant bank confirmation, you will have two 
options:

1. Instantly confirm your bank account online - If you have online 
access to your bank, you can enter your bank log in information to 
confirm your bank account. This process takes about 2-3 minutes



2. Confirm your bank account by random deposits -  PayPal sends two 
deposits to your bank account. The amounts are between $0.01 USD and 
$0.99 USD. After 2-4 business days contact your bank to find out the 
amounts. To complete the process, follow these steps:



1.  Log in to your account at https://www.paypal.com/



2.  Click "Profile."



3.  Click "Bank Accounts" in the "Financial Information" column.



4.  Choose the bank account you wish to confirm and click "Confirm."



5.  Enter the two amounts.



6.  Click "Submit." If the amounts are correct, your bank account 
will be confirmed.

If someone buys something from you, the money (minus fees) goes into your paypal account and there it stays until you either pay for goods using it or transfer it to your bank account.
If you pay for goods with paypal you dont need a paypal account balance as the funds will be transferred like magic from your bank account via your debit card.
This could read like mumbo jumbo to you but I hope it makes a bit of sense.
Good luck
P.S. You can transfer funds from your bank account at any time to your paypal account but I never saw the point of that.

I use eBay a lot. Buy an item from ebay and in Paypal you have to Add Credit Card. When you pay for the item, Paypal will take the cost from your credit card. If you sell on eBay, the money will go to your Paypal account, and you can use it to buy on eBay. If you have 20 euros and buy something for 30, Paypal will take 10 from your credit card.

As a thought, have you linked your Paypal account with your bank account?



If you haven't then you need to set this up, can't remember exactly how but I think there is an option to add a bank account.

If you have done this, have you confirmed that they have taken x amount from you - they usually ask you to verify that they have taken a few pence from you, once you have done this they refund it to your bank.



If you've done both of these then have you linked your Ebay account to your Paypal account?  This can be done from preferences in "my ebay" section.

If you've done all of these things then contact Ebay and Paypal for extra help.

I've registered my credit card for payments through Paypal, as credit cards offer more security if anything goes wrong.  When I bid for and win an item, I enter my password and Paypal collects the money from my credit card account and Ebay seller is paid.  I would never trust anyone with my bank account details, especially Paypal.

Hi there,

Try this link entering your full postcode

http://www.samknows.com/broadband/checke...

If this doesn't provide you with the answer you need, go to the home page and look for an exchange search.  Enter your phone number and take a look at the LLU services section of your exchange details.  If you see Sky listed here you have sky broadband in your area.

Addition...

here's the link to the exchange checker.

http://www.samknows.com/broadband/search...

Of course you'll need a BT landline to get Sky broadband.

It can be turn it off without affecting your operating system. But i will suggest u to turn it off if your pc is not very strong and seldom use on the gadget because it will make use of your RAM and CPU resource. It will slow down ur PC performace.

1 download a program that can download .torrent files. eg. uTorrent.
1 .b



p.s. make sure that utorrent is associated with .torrent files
2 go to a website like isohunt.com and look for something to download. 
3 click on "download .torrent". if using firefox, you should see the downloads box come up. click open with ... ( uTorrent should be default because you allready associated it with .torrent files)
4 uTorrent should open up now, and just click ok. ad your download should start.



p.s. to get faster downloads ... get yourself a static ip. but that might be a little bit to hard for your right now, so just save that for later.

think about screen size. Most browsers work to 1024 width, some work to 1280 width, less and less are using 800 so you want images to fit within the 900 pixels width for full screen. Most pics will be much smaller especially ones in blogs etc. You also don't want pics that are too large and take a long time to download, that could put off your core audience. So I'd say jpeg, 72dpi up to 900 pixels wide.

I would think your out of luck, especially if you don't know the correct spelling of their surname or they may have even changed it.



Having said that there also might be the possibility that they are ex-directory, therefore you wouldn't find them!

The oneline BT Directory you need a name and/or address or Post Code to obtain a number.

Open the window using both number ones and then do number 2 for both of them. This is because sometimes programs show up in both of these sections and if they are not enabled in both, they might not work correctly.

.........................................

1) Click Tools &gt; Click Add-ons &gt; Click on the plugins tab

1) Click Tools &gt; Click Add-ons &gt; Click on the extensions tab

2) Scroll down till you find norton, click on it, then click enable &gt; Click restart firefox to save the changes

.........................................

Then, once enabled, all you have to do is click View &gt; Mouseover - toolbars &gt; Click on the norton toolbar



Hope this sorts it for you!

Having problems with getting radio via the internet all of a sudden - please help?



I often listen to the BBC radio via the internet when I am working on my home PC, which runs on Vista.

Today when I tried to listen to any BBC radio station (national or local), I got a message to say internet explorer had stopped working and I would be notified if a solution was found, which of course wasn't. I then get kicked off the internet.

I can still play music on media player, but the radio won't work at all.

I downloaded movavi and CCCP codex recently to watch old videos, and I have now uninstalled them in case they are the cause, but the problem remains.

I have searched various technical message boards, but none seem to cover this issue. How do I fix this infuriating problem?

Delete your temporary files, and flush your DNS (in CMD (Run &gt; cmd) type ipconfig /flushdns).

Have you recently installed any plug-ins, or updated IE or Vista? If so, I'd recommend either saving your favourites etc., uninstalling and reinstalling your browser, or updating to the latest version. Have you tried it in multiple browsers? If they're having problems with it too then it's either an issue at the Beebs end, or something a little more deepset than a browser fu*k up.



Does the radio stream in flash? Perhaps your issue lies there. If you Google 'flash uninstaller' you can completely rid your system of it, and then reinstall it.



Good luck!

have you submitted your website URL to Google?
if not go here: http://www.google.com/addurl/

and it will not come up straight away, your going to have to give it a little while (a few weeks) but there is stuff in the meantime that you can do, to help get your site out there. ads for example or posting the link on your signatures on forums (check the rules of the forum before you do this), write about the site in a blog, email people about it etc.



also submit the url to other search engines like yahoo, ask, Microsoft, not just google

Add your URL to all major search sites, and then... Try and get Google 'Adsense' added. It's a great little money earner, but you have to apply for it, and Google do check out your site before approving you. It helps if your site is on a certain subject, and isn't a blog, or about personal things. You would also need a Paypal account for this. I made £89 last month from it :D

I think the only thing to do would be make a new account. And why don't you like the new version I think it is better and have you seen the link button and the top next to sign out? It says go back to old version.

Unfortunately, you can't change it back. You could change it back when it was still in the process of being finalised but they have officially gone live with it now and I am afraid this is what we are stuck with. I want the old facebook back and sent in feedback telling them so but I am afraid we are going to have to live with it.

They have permanently changed over to the "new" facebook which makes it the only facebook now.  So there is no way to go back to what you had before.  Sorry.

If Gumtree has barred my e-mail address for placing adverts, can I still use that address to reply to adverts ?



When people make (usually spurious) complaints, Gumtree will remove the "offending" advert and bar the advertiser (for life) by blocking adverts from that address or which contain a phone number in the advert. If I now want to reply to an advert which only allows responses through the "click to reply" hyperlink (which requires me to enter my e-mail address, will the response be blocked by the Gumtree censors?



</question>



<additional details>



Someone complained to Gumtree because I wouldn't employ them cash in hand (it was for a legitimate job!). A lot of advertisers protect "their privacy" by not including e-mail addresses or phone numbers, requiring respondents to use the on-line "click to reply" hyperlink, so copying & pasting addresses isn't an option..

You might try freetube. It says its watching tv on your computer, for free. I never checked it out though. The power in Louisville has been out for a week now. They will be having a heck of a time trying to air it anywhere if they don't get it fixed. They got messed up by the storm that hit Texas and all the power line people went to Texas to help so there is no one there to fix it. I know cuz I got family out there and they call on cell phones complaining.

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



the standard solution is to buy a domain, and a website hosting plan and host a bulletin board or forum there. phpBB is common software, many hosting companies will install it for you. you can download it for free too and upload, install & customize.

For domains i recommend godaddy.com
for hosting i recommend mediatemple.com or dreamhost.com
for forum, i recommend phpBB, although there are a number of sites which compare forums: http://www.forummatrix.org/

there are a few ways.

the first are the ads you'll see in mini feeds and small banners.

second, the gift application. the $1 gifts end up making them millions of dollars a year.

also companies pay to sponsor free gifts (official FB gifts as opposed to the free gift app).

It will be interesting to see if this model is sustainable.

Redirect loop problem?



Hi, ive just recently been getting a "redirect loop" notice on my firefox homepage (google). I've checked the cookies and they are fine im just wondering what it could be and how i can fix it? Also if i go on to www.google.co.uk and search for something, sometimes it redirects me to advertising websites etc. like there is some sort of bug. This happens in firefox (version 3) and internet explorer (version 7)

hope someone can help, thank you!

I think you may have something dodgy on your hard drive. It's extremely unlikely that there would be an identical bug in both Firefox and Internet Explorer at the same time. So I would download, install and scan your pc with one of the programs listed below (all are free exept from Malwarebytes' which is a trial).



Download.com - Number 8 in spyware removal products

SUPERAntiSpyware is completely free so you can keep it on your pc and have realtime protection from your browser hompage being changed and run scans etc.

Malwarebytes' is a trial version but you can still scan and remove anything dodgey with it and then uninstall it.

Spybot S&D is also good and it provides real time protection. It will also block important registry changes (to stop bad stuff changing what your computer behaves like) without your permission first.

Try running a program called CCleaner to clear all your registries and free up room so it runs faster. CCleaner is free to download, and it's very helpful. I use it every week!

As well as downloading CCleaner as Alex suggested, download Firefox and give it a try. It's basically just another browser - like Internet Explorer, but much better. It will speed your browsing up and will probably solve the problem you're having. The reason I changed to Firefox was because IE started to get slower and started crashing all the time. If you want to, after you download Firefox, you can go to the link below and click on *add to firefox*. It is an add-on for firefox that makes it look IE. So it might make it easier to get used to but you get all the speed and security of Firefox.

I would download CCleaner anyway as it may help your pc's overall performance.

How to download a video from www.liveleak.com?



Can anyone tell me how to download a video from Live Leak? There is a link to some software on that site, which is supposed to download it, but it worked with YouTube, but not with Live Leak... So any suggestions? I've tried Vdownloader, Firefox plugin that should do the job, and some other software, but none was actually doing what it should.

Yes, you can download the programmes to your computer when you're in the UK, and watch them while abroad- providing you're going away within the same week. Don't forget that the files will expire after 7 days.

Programmes on the iPlayer can be up to 300 MB each depending on length. Most external hard drives have at least a 10 GB capacity- that would hold approximately 30 programmes.

But, don't forget, the files do expire after 7 days!

I have only used myspace and facebook, so I can only compare between the 2. I also believe that the best social network is the one which most of your friends use, and therefore facebook is in my situation, my favourite social network.

Myspace to me looks like a big mess, whereas facebook is tidy and easy to navigate. It's sorta cool that with myspace you can change your themes, but this can also get really annoying someones. I have friends with black backgrounds and blue writing, VERY HARD TO READ!



I love the applications and facebook and they are great time wasters. I love how you can tag photos (i think you can do that myspace now as well), send notes and links.



Basically, Facebook rocks :)

Hi there!!

Sign-in information: Migrating your profile to another Google Account

Once you've linked your orkut profile to a Google Account username and password, you won't be able to migrate your profile to a different Google Account . We're sorry that we're unable to help you change the account associated with your orkut profile at this time.

you can make changes to your google account by signing in and clicking the edit link located next to Personal information . You can also access this page through your orkut profilw. Here's how:

1. Click settings on the left sidebar of your profile

2. On the general tab, click the link to visit your Google Account Settings On the My Account page, you'll have the option to change your email address (username),  personal name, mickname, home country, and time zone.

Note: if you use Gmail, you won't see the option to change your username. Only accounts without Gmail can have the usernames changed. It's also not possible to associate your Google Account to an existing Gmail address.

goodluck

he'll definitely receive it. once it's sent, it's out of your hands. the only place you can delete it is from showing up in your sent items.



maybe you can add Zuck as a friend and have him remove the message, or delete his profile.

Why have Ebay done this, doesn't this encourage fraud?



now ebay keeps bidders names anonymous people are free to bid for their own items with a different account then when the second highest bidder loses they are sent a 'second chance offer' of their highest bid. So why did ebay decide to keep bidders anonymous? all seems a bit dodgy to me.

Well, I'm not sure, but I'd imagine that ebay still has some kind of protection against this practice. They've kept bidders anonymous in an effort to protect them for solicitors trying to sell them the same or similar items outside of ebay.

You could do it anyway, whether its private or not, you could always get a friend to bid on an item you were selling, who would know ?
It is stupid I know, but its virtually impossible to monitor, if I am ever bidding on something and winning easily only to be stumped in the last hour, I leave it, if I get a second chance I reject it, sod the seller if they are playing that game

It's the same as asking a friend to make a bid on an item you're selling just to bump up the price or just to get the bidding starting.

All is illegal on eBay but I'm sure this can't be monitored.

At the end of the day the buyer bids the max he/she would pay for an item and hope that any additional bids do not overstep their mark.

eBay is a good thing when used with thought and not as a bidding war between folk

It's only the buyers that cannot see the names, the seller still sees them on their account, so don't worry.
Plus eBay will not allow a seller to bid on his/her own items. But I agree it does not stop a friend doing the bidding.

I absolutely agree that this encourages fraud! I certainly have been buying much less on ebay since this happened.

It was introduced because ebay had a problem with scammers contacting people who were bidding on high value, high turnover goods - things like laptops; games consoles and iphones.

The scammers would write to all the people who were bidding offering them a cut price whatever. Quite a few people, I believe, got caught.

There was always an option for bidders names to be kept private by the seller, which some sellers did for high value items or the kind of items you might not want your mum to know you were bidding on!

Then they changed it to the current system where all bidders' IDs are secret until the auction ends.

The trouble with the new system, in my experience is twofold. One is shilling, as people have described. If you were worried this was happening on an auction you were bidding on you could always check the other bidders' IDs to see if there was a worrying pattern.

The other is that often the other person bidding on something was obviously a deadbeat bidder - usually someone with zero feedback  or a lot of negs who would bid high and then not complete - meaning that even if you got a '2nd chance offer' you would pay over the odds.

I've written to ebay about this and told them there new system, quite simply, sucks.

If enough people contact them then hopefully they'll change it back!

I don't think it'll affect the careful bidders on ebay, because most will be aware that schill bidding has been going on for a long time anyway.

Best option is to set yourself a price and not go above it no matter how tempting it is the "beat" the other bidder, another similar item will be alone as is nearly always the case with this site.

After being outbid for an album I personally waited over 6 months for an another to come along, and got it for next to nothing on the day because I was the only bidder!

It all seems bizarre to me as does the rule that says you can't leave negative feedback for a seller. My partner has recently bought and sold a couple of items on Ebay and has problems with both items. The one he bought was faulty, and the potential buyer of the item he was selling was messing him about, ignoring his calls and emails. He couldn't leave negative feedback, as the option no longer exists in Ebay.

If you log into a seperate account to bid on things from another account - using the same computer, your account will be banned and the auction will be halted. You *can* leave negative feedback for the seller, just the seller can't leave a negative or neutral against the bidder. If some bidder is being a complete jerk, the seller can inform ebay that the person are messing around with them.

Mozilla has a host of other software that they sell.  Also, they sell advertising space.  The problem with web browsers is Microsoft bundles Internet Explorer with windows.  How can you sell a product that already comes free with the OS?  You can't.  That's why web browsers are free.

How often do you change your Facebook status?



Once a week? Three times per day?

How much is too much and why?

What prompts you to tell your friends something via FB?

Are your friends really that concerned with the ever changing details of your life?

whenever something new and exciting happens or whenever I'm bored out of my mind and secretly crying for any attention from anyone who even sees it to even do something on facebook to me so that the last 3 days of complete inactivity of all my friends will end and some new things happen... well whatever, usually depends on how often things happen in real life or on facebook so it's impossible to tell an exact amount of times a week or day that I change it but it could go from once a week to 5 times a day depending on how eventful or uneventful my day/week has been.

Hi!
Usually this is due to spyware



First thing to try:
&gt;go to the actual google website http://www.google.com and see if that works
(type it in manually to the address bar, dont use any buttons as shortcut just to make sure the spyware doesnt interfere)

hopefully that works fine so set the Browser Homepage to that

Second thing:
Download an anti spyware program to remove it

Usually Spybot Search and Destroy or Ad aware will suffice
Spybot- http://www.safer-networking.org/en/downl...



If this still doesnt work then you can try posting a HijackThis  log, which is a program that shows a list of all internet related things connected to your browser
http://www.hijackthis.de  (top right  of page "Direct Download")
You can even use their online analyser to paster the log and try to fix things yourself



However be careful with Hijackthis as it can make things worse if you simply remove things randomly



Hope that helps! :D

Hyperlinks In Internet Explorer?



For some reason, my internet explorer has suddenly developed a problem where it won't recognise hyperlinks andi have to refresh the page. When I hover over a link, it doesn't change to the 'hand' cursor, it just stays as the arrow cursor and won't follow the link unless i refresh the page. It's starting to become very tedious, does anyone know how to resolve this problem?

Many Thanks!

What should i do about Paypal?



Ive known someone for years on Msn we met through friends and randomly he said the other day he wanted us to meet up. He lives in another country and i didnt have alot of money so he said he would send money through paypal as a gift. The money came through as nearly £300. This was back at the end of June. We have still been talking and i have booked a ticket to see him but about 3 weeks ago i recieved an email from Paypal saying his credit card company want a reverse on the charges?! He sent £50 then £250 so there are 2 disputes. I cant believe this has happened! I wrote in the dispute thing that it was a gift and showed them emails that he had sent me. I never requested the money he sent it and i had to accept but hes claiming to to be wrong. How can he send 2 lots of money wrongly?! What else can i do? They have basically frozen my whole bank account as i only have just over £300 Is he likely to win?! What can i do? It's been nearly weeks now and i've heard nothing from Paypal how long will they take?and the guy is ignoring me! Whats likely to happen?

Paypal are robbers, liars and cheats.  After you sort this out I would advise you to empty your account and close it, if you read their long terms and conditions you will see that you don't have a leg to stand on in any situation, they are a good way of sending and receiving money, but are not to be trusted

Thats a tricky one

First thought is can you get your money back for the flights? Hope you can - if you can do that you might loose a bit of money but not the whole lot perhaps and if you want to book the trip at a later date you can with that cash, but my first thought would be to try to get the tickets refunded.

Then work out paypay later using the advise you get on here perhaps

Paypal are very quick to make a decision in a dispute where blame can be applied to either party but when it comes to a claim that will use there guarantee then they very quickly clam up. I would take all your emails and transaction details to the police, they may not be interested at first but if you make a nuisance of yourself they have to take the matter further. Good luck.

First if you booked the ticket using a card then your protected and can get a refund. Simply contact your bank and/or airline to cancel the transaction. If you haven't then it is harder to get your money back but you can still get in touch with the airline. This should give you the money to sort pay pal. The guy is a real jerk and I wouldn't have any dealings with him again. Pay pal is slow but if they haven't responded you need to phone them and talk to someone real and explain the situation. If they demand the money and you haven't got it back from the airline then keep pursuing the matter. I'm sure pay pal will be in your favour. Contact details are on their site (bottom of your page).

Hi Sarah
Not quite sure what to make of this.  It sounds like some guy you have never met except as a friend on Msn as sent you £300 through Paypal so you could go and visit him,  He obviously changed his mind and  cancelled the transaction through Paypal. so the cash needs to be paid back.



You say that they have frozen your whole bank account so I take it that the money was paid into your paypal account in that case the cash  in that account was actually your friends or should I say ex friends. and he will get it back.  I suggest you contact Paypal and explain the situation to them and ask for advice.  If Paypal paid the cash into your  own bank account it  should not have been frozen

I have an account with Paypal but only use it to pay for purchases on line and never pay any other cash into that account

If I was you I would contact the airlines you booked with an



advise them of your situation request a cancellation and a refund but dont leave it to late

not seen this problem before and mine like everyone elses is this is a con man on the take,,,
paypal is a middleman and like all middlemen they take a "cut"i dont know if this helps but if (a big IF)you do have to pay then make sure you pay with your credit card,as all cards carry reimbursement insurance in the case of a fraud on the internet,,and whatever happens you should get your money back,so he sent £300(for which paypal will require whatever they charge on a £300 movement(they are entitled as they are guarantors)is his credit card co.saying you must pay paypals charge only or the whole thing,£300 plus paypal charges,,
but my first thought is he is a conman,
there is no such thing as a free lunch!

If your not going to see him, you should give him the money back.

It is wrong of him to do what he is doing, but I also think its wrong of you to keep it as a "Gift".  It wasnt a gift, it was to get a ticket to see him BACK in June.

If you paid for the ticket, you should use it to go there "and see him".  If he isnt there.. then so be it.  However, you used the ticket for what its intended purpose was!

Your bank account should not be frozen.  You cannot just renig money like that.  Try to find a number to call on PayPal to fix the problem.

pop ups ruin your virtual living.

O.K, lets see.... most of them are spam(e.g Congratulations you are the 1,000 visitor! Click here to get your prize![you click on it and it shows something like: "Sign up for (something) membership at only 5 dollars a month.]).... or it's a virus(e.g Congratulations you are the 1,00 visitor! Click here to get your prize![you click on it, and a white box shows up or something that shouldn't be there... next think you know you got a virus]). Just don't trust anything... and if you do, virus scam your computer after you see the pop-up you wanted to see.... you never know what is hidden beyond the internet.

1. Set your time and date correctly. It is the most common problem.

2. If you are using Vista: most probably there is a missing a winhttp.dll file ( C:\Windows\System32 directory..........you can copy the file from another Vista machine, no need to reboot

3. Or :
Open a run window by clicking start, then run. Now, type the following command and press enter: 
regsvr32 softpub.dll Wintrust.dll Initpki.dll Rsaenh.dll Mssip32.dll Cryptdlg.dll



3a. If you use Windows XP you should open another run window after running the previous commands then type the following command: 
regsvr32 Dssenh.dll Gpkcsp.dll Slbcsp.dll Sccbase.dll



4. If you use Norton antivirus there is possibility it is corrupted. Install again.

5. Connection problem.

Hope I've helped.

If nothing from above helps, you will have to ask for professional help.

Yes, some providers still do dial-up.

eg http://www.fpdial.com/

The silver one doesn't need you to signup ... it's up to you, but you'll still need to pay the telephone call charge which could mount up, depending on how long you stay online for.

You can get shorter term contracts on broadband - see:

You can try money laundering. There are a few guys paying a lot of money for a bank account.
It's simple: They deposit a large sum of money into your account (no more than 2K) and then you have to transfer that money into some account they ask you to. But you keep 10% of it. So, 200 quid a week, for nothing, is a great deal, isn't it?
Obviously, if you do get caught... You'll spend a few months in prison.
And do not ask your "pals" what that money is for, where it's from, why or whatever.

If an account from an international YouTube server interacts with your account somehow, i.e. adds you, comments, whatever, then the e-mail notification will be in the other account's native language.



So, someone or some people from Japanese YouTube must be interacting with your account.

I get e-mails in Japanese and sometimes Spanish from Youtube and they usually say someone has added me as a friend.

I think 30-50 MB is accurate.  If your ISP counts your downloading, everything you do online is going to count towards that.  I use a program called bitmeter to keep track of data downloaded.

What you are viewing is "quick edit" button which you can use to edit the Gadgets(old-page element) quickly without going to the layout page.



If you want to remove the button, after logging in your Blogger account, click "setting" tab  on your Dashboard, and then you will  see 'Show Quick Editing on your Blog?' about the middle way of the page where just select "No" and click Save setting. That's all.

Try refreshing the webpage



or...



Turn off web accelerator, if you have one - it may be conflicting with youtube.



or..



It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.
Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.



Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .



It works well - Just  google search "zillatube" to get it.

Content is king. Additionally, you want to have as many people linking to your page as a specific resource as possible. You need to do your homework on this. There is no magic formula since search engines change their algorithms regularly and can spot link farms and other underhanded means of increasing a site's visability.



That said, I suggest you check out the following links (see sources).

You need to do some homework on this. There is no magic formula since search engines change their algorithms regularly and can spot link farms and other underhanded means of increasing a site's visibility.



That said, I suggest you check out the following sources to see what each search giant has to say about their methods and suggestions for increased rankings.

As soon as your site is available on the Internet, you can submit it to Google by completing the add URL form at:
http://www.google.com/addurl.html



Another way to be listed, and to raise your page rank too, is by getting other websites to link to yours. After that, when Google’s robots or spiders, known as Googlebot, crawl the web, they should run across your site within a month or so. There are two types of crawls, fresh crawls and deep crawls. Your site most likely will first get a fresh crawl in which only pages Google deems most important are crawled. After Google runs a deep crawl of your site, most, if not all of the pages on your website that contain links from other pages will be crawled and subsequently listed on Google, except pages that are included in the file robots.txt, which lists pages that you don’t want Google to crawl and pages containing code that Google is unable to parse.



Hope that helps!

How can I find a person's address, phone number online, I only know the first name, age & zip code ?



I want to search a person online. I only know the first name, age, and zip code. On www.whitepages.com the last name is required. However, I don't have the last name.



It would be ideal to search by first name + city or zip code to find a list of this first name, which would then show the last name.



Where can I search?

You can try these sites, I don't think they need last names:



http://switchboard.intelius.com/
www.PeopleFinders.com/



You may have to pay to get the results you want, but it's definitely a way for searching without knowing the last name.

if it was 1999 then Yahoo would win hands down as it had so many sites indexed and nicely put in its directories but since then Google has taken the Internet by storm and now is one of the best known brands in the world.



The reason its one of the  best known brands is that its search engine is the best and most popular and it offers so much more functionality (gmail, google earth, analytics, google chrome browser and now even a sexy mobile phone) so without a shadow of a doubt Google is classed as best (although they dont have a popular 'answers' forum like this :)

<question>



Multiple google search?



Dear all,



I would like to know if there is a tool that allows me to perform multiple google searches simultaneously. To clarify, I want a tool (website or application) that allows me to just enter a list of search terms and receive google search results. This would allow me to save time when I have a list of search terms for which I need to know how many google-hits each term yields.



Kind regards
Petter



</question>



<additional details>



Please allow me to kindly explain that none of the replies so far answer the question. To clarify, I would like to be able to perform a search of a whole list of sites using google, for example:
www.johnnybgoode.com
www.rollercoaster.com
www.sandwichez.com



Then I would like to see how many hits each site has. The reason why I want to be able to enter a whole list at a time instead of entering each search term separately is to save time.



Kind regards
/Petter

I don't know of any programs, but you could just try opening multiple windows of Google.
As for finding out how many hits there are on a search term, you could try going to http://www.googlefight.com. It's a bit of a kiddier site, but it compares two searches you enter and they 'fight" against each other, which whichever one having the more hit options winning.

Also check under options if there is not a disk space limitation. Clear that if it is or make it larger.



Other than that it should work.

You need to be one of their top subscribed-to channels, then you can opt into their ad banner scheme where you take a small payment in exchange for an advert. You then get given a personal heading banner. Only the top people get them such as Paperlillies and Geriatric1927 etc...

Google Videos. Although since Google owns Youtube now, Google Videos is kind of "discontinued" and isn't paid much attention to. Google Videos also links to some Youtube videos, because Google owns Youtube.



*Note: The guy above is being an ***. xtube, redtube, and tube8 are all porn-only video sites.

well veoh ETC are similar. The trouble is the content is similar too so there is really no point in switching your choice of video streaming website.

I like MetaCafe. It is like youtube, but a bit more "gonzo". And, no, it is legit, not openly porn.

Try refreshing the webpage



or...



Turn off web accelerator, if you have one - it may be conflicting with youtube.



or..



It could be due to slow connection or high traffic.
Try watching it during off peak hours, the video will be smoother.



Or you could watch it offline smoothly... try using 'zillatube' .



It works well - Just  google search "zillatube" to get it.
