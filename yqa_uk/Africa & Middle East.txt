kenya has the same plug sockets as the uk,and also the same power out put as the uk, if you are from the us, you may have a voltage ajuster on your electrical implements, you can purchase any type of adapter in kenyan supermarkets, in places like nakumat, the same as our tesco or asda.

Kenya uses the British style plug so you will need an adapter that fits 3 prong outlets. Remember to also bring a converter. Otherwise, your appliances will burn up if they aren't made for international outlets.

First of all, cheap quality is an oxymoron !
You either pay for quality or simply don't get it.

From my personal experience , I can recommend the Eureka Hotel and Comfort Inn in Deira, both around 100 USD per night( after hard bargaining)

My passport is with my employer, they will give the passport at airport after getting stamped on cancellation paper and they said it is not possible that I can exit from another emirate, because they have to get the stamp on my cancellation paper and it is possible only from the same emirate.

After cancellation of your visa you have 30 days time to vacate your appartment and can leave from any Emirate. It's not up to your employer to decide from where you leave. Your employer has to cancell your passport and return it back to you.

Take care.

check with a travel agent and/or a doctor.  I believe there is only one shot eneded (for yellow fever) and the option of one for traveler's diarrhea.  But you may also want to talk to them about anti-malaria pills.

How long does it takes to process mission visa to Abu Dhabi?



i got an offer from an offshore industry in abu dhabi. as i just passed out from NIT Calicut in april 2008 and i dont get my degree certificate attested from UAE embassy, hence i couldn't get any employment visa according to the new rule, though i have all my provisional certificate and consolidated grade card and other necessary stuffs. my company guys had already told me that my mission visa is in process a week ago but still i didn't get any confirmation from them yet so far. so i was wondering how long does it take to get it done? so, it would be highly appreciated if anyone can help me out regarding this issue.

I'm glad that Israelis are living in such peace.. If  they are loving in such conditions, then why don't they get over the Nazis already and leave the Palestinians alone, let them live in peace without imprisoning them to their houses and hurting them... If they already have land, then why do they steal land illegally from the Palestinians, which is now called the illegal Jewish Settlement?



And if Israel is such good friends and soulmates then ask them to give you one of their states and lets see if they will give it to you? Probably not... And that's why the Arab countries such as Palestine are generous enough in the first place to let the Jews immigrate from Europe to Palestine, big mistake Palestine did..

You are generalizing, there are some Muslims that hate all the non-Muslims and there are some Christians that hate all the non-Christians too... Jews don't torture, imprison, and murder people because they are non-Jewish, they do it because they don't want Palestinians living on what they claim as their land, the other side also imprison soldiers although I'm not sure about the torture part and if they do do it then it's very little compared to the torturing done in prison to the Palestinians...

<answer>



the country you are referring to is israel, it has been like this for 60 years.
Its not the israeli's that are taught to be racist, its the palestinians.
More than 20 years ago, it was true that some Israeli textbooks used stereotyped images of Arabs; however, the books in use in public schools today are very different.



Israeli texts go out of their way to avoid prejudices and to guard against generalizations. In one seventh grade lesson, students are given the following problem:



"Many people think: The dove is a bird that pursues peace. This belief is incorrect; it is a prejudice: people believe it without checking it. There are a lot of prejudices. For example:



1.The Jews control the world and exploit all those who live in it.
2.The blacks are inferior; they are incapable of being scientists.
3.The Arabs only understand the language of force...



Be ready to explain orally why these are prejudices." (I Understand, 1993, p.259)



In an elementary textbook on reading comprehension, students read how a Jewish girl was saved by an Arab woman. The book notes, “The Arabs are like the Jews. … There are nasty people among them and there are decent people and … they should not be labeled” (What is the Interpretation? Comprehension B, pp. 184-188).



Contrary to suggestions that Israelis do not accept the idea that Palestinians are a people, Israeli textbooks explain the origins of Palestinian nationalism. For example, a 9th grade text observes that “during the 1930's, Arab nationalist movements evolved all over the Middle East. Many of the Arabs of Eretz Yisrael also began formulating a national consciousness — in other words, the perception that they are not just part of the larger Arab nation, but are also Palestinians” (The Twentieth Century - On the Threshold of Tomorrow, Grade 9, 1999, p.44).



While Palestinian texts omit references to Jewish contributions to the world, the Israeli books recognize the achievements of Arabs and Muslims. One text highlights the Arab role as creators of culture: “...they were the first to discover the existence of infectious diseases. They were also the first to build public hospitals. Because of their considerable contribution to various scientific fields, there are disciplines that to this day are called by their Arabic names, such as algebra.” Islam’s contributions are also acknowledged in the same passage: “The Islamic religion also influenced the development of culture. The obligation to pray in the direction of Mecca led to the development of astronomy, which helped identify the direction according to the heavenly bodies. The duty to make a pilgrimage developed geography and gave a push to the writing of travel books. These books, and the Arabs' high capability in map drawing, helped develop trade. To this day, merchants use Arabic words, such as bazaar, check and tariff” (From Generation to Generation, Vol. b, 1994, p. 220)



Palestinian textbooks also negate the Jewish connection to the Holy Land while Israeli texts show respect for the Arab/Muslim attachment to the land. “The Land of Israel in general, and Jerusalem in particular, have been sanctified more and more in Islamic thought — as Islam has developed and spread, both religiously and geographically. As Islam absorbed more and more of the world conquered by it, so it adapted and Islamized the values that it absorbed, including the holiness of the Land of Israel, its flora and its water, living in it, the sanctity of being buried in it and the like. All these became from that time onwards part of orthodox Islam” (H. Peleg, G. Zohar, This is the Land - Introduction to Land of Israel Studies for the Upper Grades, 2000, pp. 161-162.)



Israeli textbooks contain a plurality of views, including those that conflict with conventional research and are critical of Israeli policies. Controversial topics, such as the disputed territories, the refugee issue, and the status of Israeli Arabs are covered from multiple viewpoints. For example, one book quotes historian Benny Morris’s unconventional position attributing the flight of Palestinians in 1947-1948 more to the actions of Jewish forces than the instructions of the leaders of Arab countries (From Exile to Independence - The History of the Jewish People in Recent Generations, vol. 2, 1990, p. 312).



The Arab point of view is also represented. For example, a history text notes how Israel’s government treated Anwar Sadat’s 1971 peace proposal “with scorn out of the feeling of power and superiority that had taken hold of Israeli society following the Six Day War. After his proposal had been rejected and the political stalemate continued, Sadat decided to go to war” (K. Tabibian, Journey to the Past - The Twentieth Century, By Dint of Freedom, 1999, p. 313).



Israeli texts also use simulation games to help students understand different perspectives on an issue. In one, students are told to divide into groups representing Jewish and Palestinian journa

The majority of tourists to Egypt (from anywhere) survive their visits. If you do go, drink only bottled water; always check that the cap seals are intact.



Beyond that, it depends what you mean by "eventually".
Recently, Israel had to issue a travel advisory, warning Israelis to avoid Egyptian travel, particularly to Sinai. (This is due to intelligence info. about planned kidnappings.)



The real issue is that if, G-d forbid, something happens in Egypt, the medical evacuation and treatment are generally slow and unprofessional. Every time that something occurs there, tourists describe how the injured were left to die or were improperly treated. [In addition,  the policy of communication by Egyptian government officials is problematic. Note how  the government minister falsely claimed that the hostages had been released! http://www.arabianbusiness.com/531943-co...

They are not the smallest nation. Get your facts right, Palau is. Australia has a small population, only about 25 million, China has over a billion and both occupy the lands near same size.



So, this si not raping of lands. A nation is not determined by it's number of people. ALSO, you're information is wrong, if you check the CIA database.



A nation is a nation no matter how small, they have their traditional land. Also don't forget that many Jewish people are in different palces, but are still Jews, overseas Jews are in palces like New York and such so... they would conut as a Jewish popualtion though.

my answer to you, is that you have it all wrong.
its not the israeli's who want to steal (rape as you put it), the land. Israel, belongs to the jewish people,has always belonged and will always belong to the jewish people.
It is the arabs who want to steal israel to be theirs and it does not belong to them.
The jews own the land rightfully
Also get your facts right, Israels population is not a few thousand, its On the eve of Rosh Hashanah 5769 , the country’s population stands at 7,337,000, according to figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Some 5,542,000 of the population (75.5 percent) are Jewish Israelis, 1,477,000 (20.1%) are Israeli Arabs and the remaining 318,000 (4.4%) are immigrants and their offspring who are not registered as Jews by the Interior Ministry, including some 200,000 foreign workers.
Also it is not the smallest spot on this earth.
Israel is here to stay.

The beach in Bat-Yam is definitely awesome!!!

EAT!!  The produce in Israel is unlike any I've ever tasted...and the hummus....and the skewers...and the ice cream....And, I always seem to come home without gaining any weight!  After the food, I'd have to say that the nightlife in Israel is also far better than anywhere else I've been, even if it's just sitting on the beach with a watermelon and friends.  There's something about the joie de vivre of the Israeli personality....
Of course, the beaches are incredible, but I love how Israel incorporates American and European fashion at reasonable prices.  Bottome line: everything

Was president Wilson right to support the Greater Syria plan in 1919?



This would have created a huge country consisting of Syria,the Lebanon, and Palestine including the East Bank region. Think of the security and ease of travel,as well as the economic potential. Isthis one of the great what-might-have -beens of history or could this construct be revived?

He never actually saw the King-Crane Commission Report which is online and contained the recommendations you reference. He suffered a stroke the day before it was submitted to him. Yes,from the vantage point of 1919 it would obviously have prevented a tremendous amount of suffering and created a large nation with three major ports and five major cities. The havoc done by the Zionists could have been altogether avoided; the Commission was extremely ill-disposed to zionism. The zionist rape of Lebanon would not have occurred. The persecution of the Palestinians would not have occurred and would be happening today. The economic balkanization of the region would not have happened. It would be a major state today.



Would it be possible to revive the plan: yes,on the basis of historical/territorial claim. Both the  Lebanon as it was known until the French severed it from Syria in 1920 and Palestine have been considered a part of Syria since at least 500 B.C when Herodotus wrote of the region. To this day they have a homogenous language and culture: the al sham culture,or what the French dubbed "Levantine". Religiously Greater Syria has been about 85% Muslim and 15% Christian since the advent of Islam. In Syria the Syrian and Armenian Orthodox Churches do not suffer the persecution they do at zionist hands in Occupied Palestine. There is a party founded in 1933 in Syria called the Social-Nationalist Party that promoted the Greater Syria agenda. I support it. Check out their website. They were banned for many years until Bashir Assad rescinded the ban in 2002. I  think unification along the lines proposed by the SSNP is practical and desirable.

Yes. He did not actually have time to come out in favor of it,this being the conclusion of his own King-Crane Commission report. But he suffered a severe stroke and the U.S. failed to enter the League of nations,hence we were not able to obtain the Mandates for Palestine-Syria as the region was then known. Obviously from today's perspective a great deal of violence and bloodshed could have been avoided by establishing a single unified entity out of the region instead of permitting the British and French to carve it up. It would have meant stability,economic vigor,freedom of movement and foremost we might have been spared the devastating conquest of Palestine 1948-67 plus the endless attacks on the Lebanon,originally a part of Syria. The region had a common language,culture and economy. Could it still be done? Unlikely but an attractive notion; however there would be many hurdles to cross.

Yes,I wish he had not been felled by a stroke. The King-Crane Commission derived this proposal from the wishes of the Syrian and Palestinian leaders of politics and commerce they had interviewed. It is still possible,particularly since Bashir Asad has lifted the ban on the Syrian Social-Nationalist Party. I wish them the best of luck. Only Syria has stood faithfully with the Palestinians during their long and continuing ordeal.

That is considered to be a personal subject to talk about in public places.

The Palestine Solidarity Movement -- an arm of the infamous pro-terror "International Solidarity Movement" (ISM) -- supports terror, including



suicide bombings. This group overtly advocates the destruction of the State of Israel. (Their propaganda is careful to call for the murder of civilians in phrases such as "armed resistance”.)
PSM's anti-Semitic goals quickly become obvious to all bystanders. For example, at a conference (at the University of Michigan in October 2002), PSM members and supporters shouted  "Kill the Jews" in Arabic. http://home.comcast.net/~jat.action/PSM_...
They not only use Hamas slogans in their rhetoric, but some PSM members travel to Israel disguised as tourists. They have been discovered in ISM's offices harboring Islamic Jihad and Hamas terrorists.

israel belongs to the jewish people.A common misperception is that all the Jews were forced into the Diaspora by the Romans after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in the year 70 C.E. and then, 1,800 years later, suddenly returned to Palestine demanding their country back. In reality, the Jewish people have maintained ties to their historic homeland for more than 3,700 years.



The Jewish people base their claim to the Land of Israel on at least four premises: 1) the Jewish people settled and developed the land; 2) the international community granted political sovereignty in Palestine to the Jewish people; 3) the territory was captured in defensive wars and 4) God promised the land to the patriarch Abraham.



Even after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and the beginning of the exile, Jewish life in the Land of Israel continued and often flourished. Large communities were reestablished in Jerusalem and Tiberias by the ninth century. In the 11th century, Jewish communities grew in Rafah, Gaza, Ashkelon, Jaffa and Caesarea.



The Crusaders massacred many Jews during the 12th century, but the community rebounded in the next two centuries as large numbers of rabbis and Jewish pilgrims immigrated to Jerusalem and the Galilee. Prominent rabbis established communities in Safed, Jerusalem and elsewhere during the next 300 years. By the early 19th century — years before the birth of the modern Zionist movement — more than 10,000 Jews lived throughout what is today Israel.1 The 78 years of nation-building, beginning in 1870, culminated in the reestablishment of the Jewish State.



Israel's international "birth certificate" was validated by the promise of the Bible; uninterrupted Jewish settlement from the time of Joshua onward; the Balfour Declaration of 1917; the League of Nations Mandate, which incorporated the Balfour Declaration; the United Nations partition resolution of 1947; Israel's admission to the UN in 1949; the recognition of Israel by most other states; and, most of all, the society created by Israel's people in decades of thriving, dynamic national existence.



“Nobody does Israel any service by proclaiming its 'right to exist.'



Israel's right to exist, like that of the United States, Saudi Arabia and 152 other states, is axiomatic and unreserved. Israel's legitimacy is not suspended in midair awaiting acknowledgement....



There is certainly no other state, big or small, young or old, that would consider mere recognition of its 'right to exist' a favor, or a negotiable concession.”

I agree with "Beautiful Sunset" but I like to remind her that not all "jews" as she always loves to write about, support Israel.
As a matter of fact, I am a "Jew" but I hate what Israel is doing to the rest of us, the Diaspora Jews.
I also believe that "Israel" and the "Land of Israel" is a spiritual kind of land that it will be created after and only after our Messiah will come and lead us all there.
Israel should not be an "ordinary piece of land" just like any country on Earth.



I also hate those bad things the Israelis are doing to these people that happened to live there for so many years and that's their only mistake.
So to me Israel will not be a country of this world and has nothing to do with what's going on right now in Palestine.

It appears that you are attempting to turn 1948 into George Orwell's 1984. True is false and false is true.
There have been various Jewish states from King David through to the present. There has NEVER been a Palestinian state. That's a fact 'rabbi' for ewe'.

I think the jews would be welcome anywhere to form a country if only they had some brains.
How can they insist on "forming a country" and everything they do is Nazi-like or based in racism or apartheid tactics?
Getting all of those Billions of dollars every year from the pockets of the average American person and spending it among corrupted politicians like Mr. Olmert (PM of israel !!!) is just plain disgusting.
The jews get something around 10 Billion of dollars each year.
Look what my country did with only 5 million of dollars.

We did this only to protect our planet from people like the jews that they only have in their minds bad things for our future.
So I don't care where the jews want their country as long as they try to be civilized and less money-greedy.
I sincerely hope that the jews will become more civilized and stop killing little Palestinian children along with their pregnant mommies, turning the paradise land of Palestine into a concrete building jungle only to fool the Americans into giving them more money.

I do not think that there is any part of our planet that the Jewish people are welcome.
Not even in Israel.
No, it's not that everybody hates them.
It's the opposite.
They, hate everyone and they always listen their pockets instead of their hearts.

The majority of tourists to Egypt (from anywhere) survive their visits to that country. If you do go, drink only bottled water; always check that the cap seals are intact.



Beyond that, it depends what you mean by "eventually".
Recently, Israel had to issue a travel advisory warning Israelis to avoid Egyptian travel. (This is due to intelligence info. about planned kidnappings.) Obviously, there have been problematic instances recently.



The real issue is that if, G-d forbid, something happens in Egypt, the medical evacuation and treatment are often unprofessional. Every time that something occurs there, tourists describe that many were left to die or were improperly treated. Do not expect "first world" conditions during moments of crisis there.

Exodus 19:5-6 "and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.' These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel."



This is Judaism my friend! These are suppose to be the chosen people. The people who guide all humanity into peace and serving God. Today, they are nothing like kingdom of priests. We don't have to mention what is going inside the occupied lands today, because everyone knows! If someone here can prove me wrong, please go ahead...



Israel country was vomited out from this land long ago, and so are Jewish people because they failed their job which God chose them for :
Leviticus 18.28: "And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out the nations that were before you.



These Europeans today, who call themselves children of Israel, came with new religion. This religion is not from God. I dont know where it is from but it is not from God.



So i can say that Israel country is based on Zionism and not Judaism which are two different things today even if some shallow people think they are same. All you have to do is, look under Zionist protocols and what they say, in order to understand the ideology that Israel state is based on.

It often makes people uncomfortable to refer to Israel as “the Jewish State” because it suggests a theocracy and, therefore, the demise of Israel as a Jewish state is viewed by some people (even in Israel) as a positive development. Israel is not a theocracy; however, it is governed by the rule of law as drafted by a democratically elected parliament. It is informed by Jewish values and adheres to many Jewish religious customs (such as holidays), but this is similar to the United States and other nations that are shaped by the Judeo-Christian heritage and also have expressly religious elements (e.g., church-state separation in the U.S. does not preclude the recognition of Christmas as a holiday).



Israel has no state religion, and all faiths enjoy freedom of worship, yet it is attacked for its Jewish character, whereas the Arab states that all have Islam as their official religion are regarded as legitimate.



The Jewish people are a nation with a shared origin, religion, culture, language, and history. And why shouldn’t the Jewish people have a state? No one suggests that Arabs are not entitled to a nation (and they have not one, but twenty-one) of their own or Swedes or Germans, or that Catholics are not entitled to a state (Vatican City) headed by a theocrat (the Pope). To suggest that Zionism, the nationalist movement of the Jewish people, is the only form of nationalism that is illegitimate is pure bigotry. It is especially ironic that the Jewish nation should be challenged given that Jewish statehood preceded the emergence of most modern nation-states by thousands of years.



It is also not unusual that one community should be the majority within a nation and seek to maintain that status. In fact, this is true in nearly every country in the world. Moreover, societies usually reflect the cultural identity of the majority. India and Pakistan were established at the same time as Israel through a violent partition, but no one believes these nations are illegitimate because one is predominantly Hindu and the other has a Muslim majority, or that these nations shouldn’t be influenced by those communities (e.g., that cows in India should not be treated as sacred).



In the United States, a vigorous debate persists over the boundaries between church and state. Similar discussions regarding “synagogue and state” are ongoing in Israel, with philosophical disagreements over whether Israel can be a Jewish and a democratic state, and practical arguments over Sabbath observance, marriage and divorce laws, and budgets for religious institutions. Nevertheless, most Jews take for granted that Israel is, and must remain, a Jewish state. Arab citizens also understand that Israel is a Jewish state and, while they might prefer that it was not, they have still chosen to live there (nothing prevents Arabs from moving to any of the 180-odd non-Jewish states in the world). Both Jews and Arabs realize that if Jews cease to be a majority in Israel, Israel will no longer have a Jewish character or serve as a haven for persecuted Jews, and that is one of the elements underlying peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.

To the best of my belief, Israel is a Jewish homeland but it gives freedom of religion to all. Unlike Saudi Arabia that has an official religion, Israel does not. The closest it could be compared to would be India that is predominantly Hindu but gives freedom of religion to all. The model of Turkey would be close to Israel's. My country Australia is predominantly Christian but all religions are welcome.
