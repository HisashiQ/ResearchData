well after the 5th inning the game becomes official and so it looks like the astros are gonna get a break tonight. The cubs bats usually don't wake up until late in the game and unfortunately late in the game isn't likely going to come.
Is it really six innings? I always thought it was 5 innings for a game to be official.

yes. There has been a tornado warning for Wrigely Field. 
According to Chron.com



"The public address announcer has just recommended that fans seek shelter in the concourse."

EDIT: I take it back. But I think it should have been called a game.

5 innings, because thats over half.

The last game to be called after 5 innings was on Thursday, May 11, 2006, 7:17PM.

They might. I'm looking at wunderground.com, and there's several warnings (tornado, severe t-storm, t-storm watch, flood advisory). 'Stros will probably get a break. Sucks in a way, because Dempster is on my fantasy team.

Yes I think because I looked at a weather radar and there is a big storm on top of wrigley that doesn;t look like its moving too fast.

I have a feeling that they wont call the game

I think they will either play the whole game or just suspend it because the Cubs are in a pennant race.

god was it pretty bad here me and my mom were stranded at burger king for at least and hour because you couldn't see anything there were tornado sirens everywhere you should of seen wrigleyville god was there sirens. And what sucks is that what happen in just 15 minutes of becoming a dangerous storm it was like the scene from twister where there at the drive up movie and everyone is going to die. Some scary stuff. That would suck if the came got called.

they have to play 6 innings for it to be called a complete game. They will probably go to a rain delay. If the rain does not let up after a while, they will probably call the game.
