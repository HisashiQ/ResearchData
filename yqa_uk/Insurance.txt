WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT FROM AN INDEPENDENT LOSS ADJUSTERS HOME VISIT?



I have recently lost a valuable ring which i was lucky enough to have thought to insure! The loss was reported to the police etc and my insurers offered to replace the ring to the full ring value which was agreed when i took out the insurance. I already knew i did not want a replacement and wanted the cash settlement. So now they have instructed an independent loss adjusters to come out to see me. Can anyone one tell me what i should expect from this visit? and why they do this?
Many thanks in advance for you replies and help.

They basically want to see if the claim is genuine.They will thoroughly go over the circumstances of the loss. They will also, presumably, check your financial status to try and guage if you need the money more than the ring!
They may also try and find out if you took good enough precaution to mitigate the loss. Remember thay are independent from the insurers although they are being paid by them. It may be that they suspect some foul play or just that the claim is fairly substantial. Nothing to worry about if the claim is genuine, which I am sure it is.

The loss adjuster is just that - independent. He is there to see fair play. If you claim to have lost (say) a £2000 ring he will form an opinion as to whether you were likely to have had a £2000 ring in the first place (he can make that judgement from other jewellery that you may be wearing and the quality of the furnishings in your home - that why he comes to see you.)



Don't worry - the adjuster is not there to catch you out - just to see that the claim is handled properly and that you do not make a profit from your loss.



He will ask for receipts/valuations and the police report  - he may ask if you can show him a photo of you while you were wearing it.

As previous answers have said, this is pretty standard procedure and you have nothing to worry about. It’s a reflection of the sad fact that many people do attempt fraud for ‘lost’ jewellery sometimes for jewellery they never even owned (and ask for cash instead), not a reflection on you personally.



Geoff has given first rate advice on what to have handy… receipts, valuations, police report, a few photo’s which show you wearing the ring.



However it is worth bearing in mind that ultimately they work for the insurance company (they aren’t THAT independent, they know who pays their wages) and whilst they aren’t the secret police and they aren’t trying to catch you out, they are employed to make sure the insurer pays out no more than it has to, not to help you get as much as you can. It’s a minor point, but just one worth remembering.



Just be honest and you’ll be fine….. oh and a cup of tea never hurts !

Unemployment insurance?



When I take out a loan at the bank, they ask if I want insurance that will pay if I lose my job.  The same with my mortgage, car loan, and credit cards.  They all add up premium wise.  Is there any kind of un employment insurance I can buy on my own that will do this without have to buy them one at a time each time I borrow that could save me money?

Landlord wants me to pay damage to house but he has insurance?



My car burned up in my drive way 2 weeks ago and i didn't have insurance on my car(couldn't afford it). I hardly drove it because of that reason. There was minor damage to the garage door. My question is am I responsible for damage because I don't have insurance. And also I had a guy check out the damage and gave me a quote to fix it, but my landlord went with the higher cost and wants me to pay for it. any advice would be helpful

Let me take a different angle on this one. The one thing nobody else has mentioned is the word negligence. That is what is important here. You have to be negligent for either you or any insurance company to legally owe the landlord a dime. You are NOT automatically negligent for not having insurance or just because you owned the car that started on fire.



Even if you had car insurance odds are they would deny any claim that the landlord made because you to be negligent in order to legally owe. I have denied similar claims like this over the years. If you had no forewarning of potential fire hazards with the car then you probably wouldn't be found negligent.



Keep in mind that whether you have insurance or not the landlord has the legal duty to prove you are negligent. He would have to show that you did something to cause the fire or that you knew of the fire hazard and DIDN'T do anything about. If he sued you he would probably have a tough time doing that. My suggestion is to politely decline to pay and see what he does.



Good Luck

Two primary issues:



(1) Actual or constructive notice of defect (affirmative defense).  If you did not know there was anything wrong with the car (could not forsee the loss) then it is unlikely that there is a reasonable argument of negligence here.



(2) Implied co-insured doctrine.  In many states, unless the lease with the landlord has contrary language and it is enforceable, this doctrine makes you an implied co-insured on the landlord's policy.  My recommendation is to suggest that the landlord put in a claim on his/her own policy and tell him that they can attempt to subrogate (seek recovery from you).  When they do, ask them if this doctrine exists in your state.  If it does, then they will not be able to recover from you (basically, part of your rent is construed to cover part of the property insurance on the rental property).



Good luck, dude. :-)

Being it was your car and you didn't have insurance you are legally responsible for it. If you had insurance on the car your insurance company would pay for it.

Why should your landlord be out of pocket because you decided to have no inusrance on your car?  Yes, he may have insurance, but his deductible may be higher than the damage and he would have to pay out of pocket.  It's you responsibility pay for the damage.  Thank God, you didn't have an accident while you were driving your uninsured car and hurt someone.

Your landlord would have no problem whatsoever proving negligence on your part, it's your vehicle! Cars do not normally catch on fire unless someone set it on fire (since you never mentioned arson we can ignore this) or the vehicle was in serious need of repair (or if it was new it had a major design flaw), especially if the vehicle wasn't even on when it caught on fire. There isn't a judge on the planet that wouldn't rule for the landlord. The fact they did or did not have insurance is completely immaterial.

Not having insurance, does NOT get you off the hook for being responsible for damages you caused.



However, in order for you to be liable for the damages, legally, you have to have contributed some way to the fire.



So if it was really an accident, then you are NOT mainly responsible - you'll have to take a look at your lease.  Just like if his building caught on fire, you have to see if you assumed responsibility in your LEASE, regardless of fault.

Your car burned up how?  If the fire happened at the house or in the garage and your landlord does have insurance, he can claim it to his insurance.  Every state is different.  I've watched Judge Judy a lot.  I am not a legal expert but home insurance can possibly pay for it.  Get quotes from three different places and present them to him.  Search for advice on line or google it and you should get some legal advice.

Sorry Byron, you're going to pay for it either way. Even if he did file a claim on his insurance, the insurance company would come after you for the damages. I would try to work up some kind of a payment plan with the landlord to pay them back.



FYI- Auto probably wouldn't have paid for this anyway. If you had renter's insurance, it would have paid for this. It's pretty cheap too. Around $100 a year.

Previous answer, nice try, but…. Oh dear



Burning down your house because you can’t afford the repayments, how will that help?
Even assuming you can get away with it (which is unlikely, fire services are very adept at spotting arson), the purchase price of a house (especially in the UK where NU operates) is nearly all about the land, not the building which is what is insured (land doesn’t burn).
As a (real life) example say a house in London worth £400k burns down, the insurance will only pay out the rebuilding cost of around £100k, not £400k and anyway if you borrowed £300k to buy it… you still owe £300k burning it down won’t get you out of the debt



It’s not like dumping your car in the docks, claiming it was stolen and collecting the insurance to pay off your car loan!  Anyway if people are that desperate they are more likely just to let the mortgage company repossess the house than burn it down!



Committing suicide because of debt?  Unfortunately this does happen, whether in a credit crunch or not, but the sad truth is most people stop paying the premiums (because they have no money) before they get to that stage… no premium… no claim. I know that sounds heartless, and trust me I’m really not, but that is the fact of the matter.



Anyway to be quite honest, compared to a major hurricane, earthquake or terrorist attack, claims like those add up to peanuts.



Anyway to answer your question, Will the current crisis hurt insurers… yes and no.



In the short term, they may lose on



- Investment income:  AVIVA (of which NU is a part) made £10bn in investment income last year, about 25% of its gross income. If the economy slows and/or interest rates drop investment income goes down.



- Premium income: economy slows down premium income slows, business look for ways to reduce costs, they take bigger excesses (deductibles in the US), maybe shut down some branches/ factories/ warehouses… shops sell less so they hold/order less stock. Less stock means less transport, fewer sales means less Extended Warranty. People take fewer holidays. Fewer holidays… less travel INS and so on and so forth.



- Claims: not ‘personal lines’ stuff as above (which is a fairly minor deal really), but surety claims … investment guarantees, (It was this type of insurance that caused AIG all its woes) mortgages etc.



In the long term they may gain through



- Capital: Insurance is currently going through a ‘soft market’ phase; very simply put this means there is a lot of capital floating around the insurance market. As with any market supply and demand says when supply is high prices are low. As the credit crunch kicks in available capital is likely to decrease (all insurers borrow money one way or another) and consequently prices (premiums) will rise.



- Acquisitions: The next year or two could be a nice time to buy other businesses. For example AIG have already said they’ll be looking to sell off at least some of their empire. Well reserved and financed groups like AVIVA are well placed to takes advantage and may get a business for a lot less than it would have cost even 6 months ago.



Sorry it’s a bit of a tome… but hope it gave you some ideas.

You need a trusted adviser to help you through the process of purchasing health insurance so that you understand what you are purchasing. Some may suggest going on line to get a quote but you probably already know that there is much more to health insurance than price. Some might even suggest a discount plan which is not insurance at all.



Ultimately, you are the one who determines the affordability of your health insurance plan by deciding how much you will participate in sharing the cost of your health care with your insurance company.



If you choose a plan that covers everything i.e. doctors office visits, prescription drugs, preventative health benefits, maternity coverage as well as low deductibles and low copays your monthly premiums will be significant.



On the other hand if you are young and healthy and rarely use the health care system you could consider a plan that covers only the major health catastrophe which will result in a relatively low monthly premium. You then can use the monthly premium savings to pay for the occasional doctor visit and still come out ahead.



Check with the agent that writes your home or auto insurance he/she can provide you a health insurance proposal that takes into account your budget and health situation. They can answer questions as to what is and is not covered by the policy, explain deductibles and copays and show you the hospitals and doctors that participate in the network.



Use the Internet to educate yourself but use an agent to purchase the coverage.

It depends on where you live to some extent.  Health insurance advisers are licensed by state.



You can always view sites like the one below that will allow you to anonymously view plans with several companies.  Or call the agency and have them email you a few health insurance proposals.

Call a local agent. The policies available depend on where you live. An experienced agent can narrow down your options to one that best fits your needs, and that you can afford in just a few minutes.  Avoid the online shopping, there is just simply too much information, and too many scams to watch out for. Also, be open minded about an HSA type of policy.

What can an individual buy from Aetna in the state of Indiana?



I want to qualify for an Aetna Healthy Living Visa card, but one of the requirements is that I have to be an Aetna customer.



Is there anything that an individual (not company) can buy from Aetna in the state of Indiana? Preferably something cheap like a term life policy or one of those child-life-insurance-policy things. If so, how do I find an agent that sells Aetna?



My reason is that the card offers 3% cash back on medical, and I charge a LOT of medical, and could mean a lot of cash back.

As far as I can tell, they don't sell individual life insurance - it's health, and medicare supplemental plans.



You can contact them, though - here's the website:  http://www.aetna.com/members/individuals...

That's an amazing diet plan!  You could sell the bejesus out of that!



Just kidding.  You need to look over your contract and consider the underlying crediting instrument.  Nobody should ever "promise" you more than the contract says.  If it is not performing as your contract says, the company may be liable.  If it is not performing as the agent says, he or she may be liable.



Buying insurance as an investment tool is not always a good idea, and yes I give new clients that same advice.  For long term investments with little to no liquidity, consumers should be especially wary.

Wow. I feel ya on this one. I am currently a nurse and have also been a victim of the "no insurance" plague many times.
Here is the run down. First ask your doctor about cheaper diagnostic tests that may provide insight to your pain. Did a physical injury occur or is the pain related to something else? Does it hurt worse at certain times of the day or during certain activities? Have you had previous problems with this shoulder? Do you have any heart problems? Angina, CAD, Atherosclerosis? A thourough phyical and history assessment can eliminate or narrow down diagnoses and won't cost you anymore than an office call.



You can always request that your doctor refer you for an MRI, it is your right. If he refuses, (but not due to contraindications related to your health status) you go get a 2nd opinion and request again. Most Drs and hospitals/diagnostic offices will have no problem performing one for you with no insurance. Downfall to this is that you will be responsible for the WHOLE bill, which will not be cheap. It is a very expensive proceedure.



Another option is to apply for a local or federal insurance policy such as medicaid or county health plan. Even if you think you may not qualify, apply anyway and keep your refusal letter in your "important papers file" or wherever for awhile. (Sometimes you may have to prove your denial to one program inorder to qualify for another)



If these ideas don't pan out or work for you, go to your local "city" hospital to have the proceedure done. Most of them do not require insurance to treat and even can not turn away patients due to thier ability to pay/not pay for their services. Many times you can set up payment agreements with them, even if it is $5 a week or month, whatever. As long as you are showing an effort, they will work with you. If patients absolutely can not pay for services by any means or programs, the hospital, unfortunately, ends up eating the loss. Which is why so many City hospitals have budgets in the red. Most of these types of hospitals are also "teaching hospitals" so they have many talented healthcare professionals that are there for the "right reasons", as well as, many young, eager, up and coming talents that have been educated and trained on the newest technologies, research, and concepts.

Well, if you're looking for someone else to give you assistance, you'll probably have to wait until you qualify for medicaid, or turn 65 and can get on medicare.  Many churches have an assistance program, but it's really aimed at one time assistance, not ongoing stuff.



My best recommendation, is that both of you should start looking for new jobs, that will give you access to health insurance benefits.  Even an extra part time job at Walmart would get that for you.

Unemployment insurance?



When I take out a loan at the bank, they ask if I want insurance that will pay if I lose my job.  The same with my mortgage, car loan, and credit cards.  They all add up premium wise.  Is there any kind of un employment insurance I can buy on my own that will do this without have to buy them one at a time each time I borrow that could save me money?

<answer>



You automatically get access to STATE unemployment benefits.  There is no private insurance you can buy.



I would NOT buy that insurance, because it only pays the minimum balance on the debt, and only to the creditor.  It will only ever protect THEM.



Why buy insurance that won't benefit YOU, only the Creditor?  You're doing them a favor by buying it, and they're raking you over the coals to pay for it.  BAD DEAL.

How do health insurance companies decide when to apply costs to one's annual deductible?



It seems they randomly choose when they will pay in full & when you will pay in full because they decided to "add it to your deductible".  For example, they'll pay for one x-ray in full this time but next time make you pay for it.  (I'm not referring to a car accident that cost $20,000 in surgery & they make you pay the deductible up front before they pay costs).

They don't 'decide,' it should be pretty clear.  Sometimes if you get lab work done in the doc's office it might be covered by the office copay (assuming you have one), but if you go to a facility it would go towards your deductible.



Regardless different plans work differently.  You just need to call and ask how your plan works, because it's not random.

There are two issues that have to be answered in your question. First, does your policy cover your liability while operating a rental car. I would say that it likely does because the policies I am familiar with cover your liability in any vehicle that you are driving.



The second issue is physical damage coverage. (i.e. comprehensive and collision). Is your present vehicle covered for physical damage? If not you will definitely want to purchase the CDW (collision damage waiver). If you do carry physical damage on your car you still need to check with your agent to see to what extent your coverage transfers to a short term rental.



The other option available to you is your credit card. Many credit card companies have coverage for physical damage to rental vehicles.



I always waived the CDW but that was based on the coverage my policy provided. You need to check with your agent to make an educated choice as to whether or not you can waive the CDW.

No it's not just if thing are stolen, as you obviously have worked out you can get accidental damage cover as well. You can also extend this so it covers items whilst not in your house (such as laptops cameras etc). If you had had accidental damage cover of that type and you dropped the laptop, or spilt coffee on it it would probably be covered (there's an excess of course) for repair or replacement, but beware they don't always pay out new for old, you might only get what your Laptop was worth when you broke it, not what a brand new one would cost.



Obviously you pay a lot more for that kind of cover, but if you're in the UK nearly all insurers offer it as an option. It's a personal decision, I've had accidental damage cover for years and never claimed, but I like knowing it's there.

Contents coverage protects your belongings in the event of a covered loss.  You'd have to contact your specific company (and probably put in a claim to get a final decision) to know for sure if you have coverage.  Typically, a homeowners policy would not cover accidental damage you caused yourself (ie, dropping your laptop), but only the perils listed on the homeowners insurance policy.  Basic perils insured against include:



Fire or lightening,
Windstorm or hail,
Explosion,
Smoke,
Aircraft or vehicles,
theft,



falling objects,
discharge or freezing of plumbing,
power surges.



Not all policies cover those things, but most do and some have even more perils that are covered.



Typcially, you'd have to have a personal inland marine or personal articles policy from an insurance company to cover damage you did youself by accident...or else you would need the additional warranty that you can purchase from the store you bought the laptop at.



Check with your agent, they would know or else they could put in a claim so that you could find out for sure.

The main part of the policy rebuilds your house if it burns down. Then the contents pays for your "stuff" if it was lost in the fire.  It might cost extra to cover for theft but it is possible..

Yes, but i've seriously considered dropping it to save money.  My employer does not offer it so I have to buy it on my own.  I have a high deductible so that I can afford the monthly premiums, but considering that I only go to the doctor 1x a year for my annual check-up, i really feel its not worth keeping.

Yes.  I live in Ontario, and have OHIP.  Virtually everyone in Canada is covered under a provincial government health insurance plane.  We have to pay for it a small part of it now, depending on our income, to a maximum of $300 a year.  I ended up paying nothing, as I have a fairly low income.  You need to be making a lot to pay the max.

Yes, I do.  I live in Canada and I still have personal health insurance.  It's unfortunate that most people in Canada don't understand what is covered and what isn't covered.  If you are seriously ill, there are still a lot of costs that are associated with illnesses in Canada that aren't paid for.  Think of lost wages (for you and the person that is taking you to your treatments or staying with you in the hospital), parking at the hospital (it's $10 a day where I live), extra costs for a semi-private room, cost for a phone or TV in your room, medications/perscriptions, physiotheropy, travelling to your treatments.  Over and above that think of the wait times in Canada...where I live the average waittime for surgical procedures is 28 weeks.  There are people that have litterally died waiting on waiting lists in Canada.  And if you have group benefits I gaurantee you that it doesn't cover everything either.



As mentioned by someone else, I am happy to say that I have full control over my health care rather than depending on what the government decides for me.  My insurances will cover me if I have a serious illness and I will have the money to make sure I get the fastest treatments and cover all the additional costs.

In response to the first answer, she should consider dropping it and just buying right before she has a heart attack, cancer, stroke or gets hit by a drunk driver to make it more worthwhile.  If she doesn't 'know' when these things will happen then perhaps just keeping the coverage is a good idea.



You don't buy insurance for little items and you don't cancel your homeowners because your house never caught fire.  With that set of logic nobody would have life insurance.

19 year old student - health insurance with 1 million lifetime max enough?



I don't currently have a job; I'm just a student, so it's doubtful that I will even keep this insurance the rest of my life.  I have a $750 deductible with $2k max out of pocket and no deductible on prescriptions, but the lifetime max is only 1 million.  I know with a chronic condition that would be eaten up, but is it sufficient for now?

At age 19 1 million is adequate. Statistically speaking you have very little chance of capping one million. However, depending on the carrier you may be able to extend the lifetime max for very little additional premium. I have been a health agent for 15 years and chances are  that if you have medical expenses in excess of $1 million, you would not survive the accident/illness in question anyway.



Having said all of that however, you may want to seek a reinsurer who will come in and accept risk for any medical bills in excess of one million. The premium should be next to nothing, and for obvious reasons.



In my opinion you have ample coverage. My only suggestion would be to see if your policy has an aggregate. ( a per sickness/accident limit) you could have a one million lifetime max, but you may have a per illness/accident cap of only say $250,000 for example....this is important to know.



Also in response to Kay's comment....NEVER rely on insurance from your employer. EVER. It's YOUR responsibility and not your employer's (or your government's for that matter) to protect your financial assets. Employer based policies ALWAYS end. Termination, job change, etc. An individually owned plan is yours as long as you pay the premium, and gives you much more control and freedom. what would happen if you worked for a company who offered health insurance, but then you had a heart attack or got diabetes? Then you would be FORCED to stay at that job just to have coverage. Whereas if you had a private plan your job would not be slave to your benefits, etc. You need to look into an HSA (Health Savings Account) which will not only save you monthly premiums but also assist you in paying less taxes AND saving for retirment.

Thank you. I decided to get it because it's very affordable to me as a student and is something I can keep even when I'm not a student.  I called and there is no per illness/accident limit nor a prescription limit.  I appreciate your advice it made me feel more at ease.

For your current status, it's a standard. When you begin to work, hopefully your employer has a good group insurance policy to offer you without having you to contribute to the insurance premium.

The over fifties are at a disadvantage in the workplace because many employers are too stupid to realise that older people tend to make better employees.

If you are clever and/or very good at your trade or profession then you are at another disadvantage because many employers are so insecure that they can not abide employees who are cleverer and more knowledgeable than they are.

I am 55 and was in the same boat as you so I successfully started my own business last year, perhaps that is the way to go.

this is a tricky one,first of all you need legal representation if the second party i:e the employer accepts full or part of the claim it can sometimes be settled out of court.this will take anything between three and twelve months.if it drags and the second party argues the case it could take up to three years to get to court.the insurers can drag there feet over partially to blame reasons.If your solicitor has advised you on making a claim you should stand a good chance of winning as they don"t normally take on a case unless you have a solid enough claim.

Work injury - should he be paid??



k right, my boyfriend works for a small company fitting bedrooms.
it's the type of place that doesn't particularly care for its employees and if you're off sick, you don't get paid.
now, on Wednesday he dropped a 3 metre work-top on his foot, cleanly breaking his big toe.
he can't walk so he's looking to be off work for at least 2 weeks I'd guess. 
considering this happened at work, and there're no policies about wearing protective footwear or anything, should he be paid while he's off work?

He should report the accident to his employer and ask the name of their "Workers Compensation Insurance Carrier".  This is a work injury. He also needs to be sure the doctor knows it's a work injury.  He may have to contact the Workers Comp. company himself.  His employer should know all this, but a lot of the small ones don't.

This can vary state to state, but he'll have to fill out some forms, and possibly be seen by the Insurance company's doctors.  He won't get paid, unless a doctor says he's unable to work for (generally) more than a week.  The insurance company should pay for all his bills for this, also.

Now, tell him to get some of those steel toed boots when he's better.

You boyfriend is only entitled to work comp benefits if his doctor filed the claim or if the company filed it on his behalf.  Your boyfriend will not get any money until one is filed by either parties or both.  Law stats that you must have an off work slip to provide to the work comp adjuster to get paid any temporary total disability.

So if your boyfriend decides to take a few weeks off, he won't get paid.  If his company won't file it than he should file it through his doctor so he doesn't get billed for it.

Your boyfriends employer MUST have Employers Liability Insurance under the Employers Compulsory Insurance Act 1969.  Within this legislation their are several duties on an employer and one is to provide safe systems of work and a safe environment.

As he has broken a bone RIDDOR will also need to be contacted.

Was your boyfriend working on his own initiative or was he instructed.  If he was instructed to lift the item and too big or cumbersome then entitled to pay.

If your boyfriend was larking about or told not to lift and did you could struggle.  He should however have documented training on how to do his job.

You can schedule your camera on your homeowners, condo or renters policy.  This will probably be the best way to get you the most broad coverage.  By scheduling your camera you will be avoiding the deductible.  This is probably the best coverage for the most reasonable amount of money.  Good Luck.

The best way to cover the camera is as an extension of a home or business policy.  This will provide All Risks cover world wide.  This will cost between £2-3 Per hundred sum insured of the camera and will include all cover i.e. theft, accidental damage.  Call your broker for a quote.  If you don't have contents it will be cheaper to take out a contents policy and add the camera rather than trying to find a specific policy simply due to the number of insurers who do specialist insurance.  (UK Anyway)

Your solicitor should be pushing for your cheque.  If the delay continues I would get your solicitor/broker to start advising that you will be charging for lost interest.  You can charge an average of 6%.  Chase your solicitor and make it clear you have accepted their offer and want your "consideration" ASAP

Student possessions vs Home insurance: I'm moving into my own flat - which do I need?



I had student cover when I lived with other students, now I'm moving in to my own "home" do I need something extra?



Student possessions insurance is, on average, slightly/a lot cheaper.

<answer>



Generally a student possessions cover is for students living away, their main home still being with Mum & Dad. It covers small stuff against theft, fire, flood, accidental damage etc.
A household contents policy is usually for people who have set up residence away from home. That is to say left home with no intention to go back in the summer, Easter, Christmas etc.
Contents cover will include costs for alternative accommodation if your flat becomes uninhabitable due to an insured peril, personal liability (if you let the bath overflow & damage a flat below etc) , better cover (usually new for old) and a host of extras.
It is up to you but I would take the contents cover as it will cover EVERYTHING belonging to you in the flat as opposed to specific things specified under a students policy.
Hopefully you wont need it.

If you are a student, then you need to list 'student' as an occupation which some home insurance providers will decline to quote on. However, If you OWN the flat, home insurance would be best.

Being that student insurance is cheaper, and some cover thefts where people just walk in when the door is unlocked - I'd go for that.

In the US - the money is held in trust until the minor reaches that age of majority (18).



If the settlement exceeds a certain amount - you have to have a judge approve the settlement.

As a child has no income, settlement can often be difficult to determine as no measurement.  Dependant on the age of the child and what they have lost will determine settlement but the payment will usually go to the parent or guardian for a number of reasons.  Mainly you will have a bank account a child may not.  2 the additional expenditure you may have to incur i.e. tutors if school cannot be attended will be incurred by the adult not the child.  If no additional expense and simply  a benefit payment you may find a limit within the policy for a minor.

Hope this helps

Claiming on the insuarance for a garage roof (UK)?



My garage roof is made from bitumen corrugated sheets and the rain fall drains into the gutter along one side of the garage. When looking out of the window there are pockets of puddles in the corrugated sheets. Towards the side where it drains the sheets have lifted causing the water to be trickeling into the garage. The draining side of the garage has been filled with expanding foam to stop leakage and I presume this has resulted in the draining edge lifting, causing the pockets of puddles/leakage.



The inside of the garage is quite damp along the leaking side and the brick work isnt to great because of this. When the weather is at its worst the rain drips in onto the light switch, so I really do need to sort this.

I hadn't thought of claiming on the insurance as I put the roof down to wear and tear, however my neighbour informs me that the previous owners had to claim for the roof 3 or 4 years ago. Could I make a claim?

it sounds like wear and tear - the claim previous owners made could
have been for something like storm damage. if you put in a claim and
they send someone out -and you are declined because of wear and
tear , your insurance is likely to go up following year as it's counted
as a claim.
personally i would just get it fixed.

You can always claim.

Typically an adjuster will look at a flat roof claim and ascertain the wear & tear. I have seen many a claim settled where the adjuster or me, as the insurance company employee, have detected storm damage but aggravated by wear and tear. We agree a settlement with the owner eg 40/60% and get settling.



You don't get if you don't ask.

It applies to the working environment relating to admin. For example, there should be no trailing wires from photocopiers, computers and other electrical appliances. Desks should not be so close that you cannot get out in case fire. You should take breaks from computers to avoid health problems with arms and eyes.

Admin is always responsible for making sure the laws are upheld.  Health and safety regulations, are laws.



For example, they have to make sure that the floor managers aren't locking the factory workers into the factory, because if a major fire broke out, no one would be able to get out.

This is a very specific Occupation.  Do you want to insure the animals or the vet practices?

The best way would be to approach insurers and ask about schemes, however they will want a proof of income you can offer, best way there is to contact a trade association in the vet world for some commitment.

Van Insurance is more expensive than car insurance because it is presumed that the van will be used for work and so on the road more often than a car.

You need to call an nsurance agent.



Premiums can depend on if your car or van is safer than a small car or more danagerous.

But there are too many factors to consider.



Call around for some quotes.  It will be more expensive because of your age.

A Bedford Rascal will be cheaper to insure than most commercial vehicles.

It would depend a lot on the use of the vehicle, if it's for commercial purposes then some insurers won't give you cover if your under 25.

Best thing to be would check out a few insurers websites and get a few quotes.

If you want cheap car insurance at 17 you need to select a British made car (cheaper parts) a vehicle of a reasonable age (age of vehicle discounts in car insurance range from 5% - 50% off a premium,  Low engine size (you won't be able to go as fast)  Take your pass plus (this could earn up to 10% off your premium with some insurers)
and always check Comp cover as TPF&T not always cheaper and sometimes makes it cheaper to add on a parent or older driver.

Hope this helps

Help! I've lost my retainers! what do I do???



for the second time I have lost my dental retainers. I wore braces for 3 painful years and I now have a great smile. However I haven't used my retainers as much as I should have. I lost them 3 monthes ago but replaced them. we managed to claim them on insurance so it only cost £60. however we dont think we can claim again. I feel extremely guilty to my mum who cant afford to replace them but we dont want to waste 3 painful years of braces. I'm completely f***ed up about this and I know my orthodontist will make fun of me for losing them again. what the hell shall I do??? please please share your financial wisdom on insurance, tips on raising money, finding things, anything. we will already being reducing the amount by using the NHS but its still gunna cost around £150. thank you so much for your time.

I don't think there is any companies that offer that discount.

Most homeowners policy do offer a discount if you have a security company like ADT or Brinks.



You just give them copy of your bill.



It matters because it helps prevent claims from theft or someone breaking into your home and vandalizing it.

Do i have to declare my modifcations to direct line?



Basically I bought a direct line car insurance (UK) They never asked about Modifications etc... Although i have changed the bumpers on the car and tinted windows with alloy wheels.

Some sites are saying i dont have to tell them as they are covered in my policy.

Advice please.



</question>



<additional details>



You dont understand what i mean.

When i signed up online for the policy they never asked about my modifications.



Can someone goto directline.com and check the policy summary. I cant understand it but i think its saying im allowed modifications but they will only cover a certain limit eg £1000

Thanks



Im only 17 btw my premium is £2800

Adding mods will rise so much.

You only have to declare modifications if they alter the value of the vehicle, i.e. if u make improvements which increase the cars overall value.  Any modifications which change the cars performance also have to be declared because you could be insured on a 1.2 litre engine but have a race car, unbeknown to direct line! Such modifications which alter the cars performance include an induction kit, which is basically a glorified air filter.  I know its long, but have a read of their set terms and conditions to see if it is vital to declare your particular modifications, as they sound cosmetic rather than performance changing.

Although i agree with some of the other views expressed in other peoples answers, that insurance companies will try to squeeze every penny out of u, its also worth remembering that should something happen, your insurance company will only pay for repair or replacement of parts which they were aware of at the time the policy started.  you therefore have to consider whether the risk of you damaging, for example, your lovely alloys and having to fix them at your own expense, is worth the amount of money your premium will increase by.  i reckon this will be circa £20 - £50.

the best thing to do is to tell them of the changes anyway. if they don't need to know about them then it doesn't matter, but if you needed to tell them about the changes and don't, then they can refuse to cover them.

good luck xx

EDIT - if you don't add the modifications and they require them then they may void your policy under grounds of misrepresentation/fraud and you may never get insured for anything again. the premium may go up another couple of Hundred pounds, but not declaring them could cost allot more in the long run

What the bank means is any official goverment letter that states your name, address and national insurance number. So could be a council tax bill or a letter from the benefits agency if you claim any benefits - tax credits/income support .... Anything you have thats official really, the council itself can't give you anything because they don't know you from adam. They don't know if your actually the person you stating etc.

It should not affect your mortgage unless you are running a full time business from your home.  You should increase your liability coverage and maybe look at an umbrella policy since you have an increased liability exposure (to protect you if someone says they got hurt coming to your home for lessons).  Talk to your agent.  Important to do before you start to figure out the increased cost and adjust your rates to cover this business expense.

It has nothing to do with your mortgage,  as for the liability, you can add an endorsement to your homeowners policy to allow liability coverage for incidental teacher liability.  Unless you have income of 5,000 to10,000 per year this should be adequate.  Talk with your home insurance agent.  Good Luck.

You cannot cover the liability for this risk under your homeowners insurance policy!!
The liability for your homeowners insurance covers if people visit you and something happens, but not if you are conducting a "business" out of your home. 
The type of policy you want to get is a commercial policy for General Liability. I would suggest you get $1,000,000 per occurrence coverage.
Most brokerage companies, or surplus line broker will have a market for this. 
Since you are going to be considered under the category "teaching/school", it might be a little tricky to find a carrier.
I suggest you google surplus line brokers in your area and contact them. Its very important that you carry this liability, just in case that you get sued by one of your students. Especially important since you are conducting this business out of your home.
Will not have anything to do with your mortgage.

I assume you are talking about Travel Insurance?
There is no insurance company that I know of who will cover your wife as she has a pre-existing health problem. They will give you only basic coverage but most likely will not cover treatment in the USA. 
I would think twice about taking that trip - medical expenses are very very costly and you could end up loosing every thing you worked for all your life if she gets sick in another country.
I wish your wife a speedy and healthy recovery.
Good Luck

Putting pension funds into a trust is a way to guarantee that they'll be there (within the limitations of any investments the funds may be put into).  A trust isn't covered by the FDIC rules because a trust is always there.  If trust funds are invested in the market, however, they can lose value but if the bank keeping the funds goes under, whatever is left in the trust will remain regardless.  A life insurance policy kept in a trust is not guaranteed - if the company goes under, the policy may or may not have any value.  Life insurance in a trust is usually done for other reasons.  So keeping pension funds in a trust, invested in money market accounts, may be a way of guaranteeing that the bulk of your money will be there.  There are also estate planning advantages to keeping pension funds and life insurance in a trust.  You would have to consult an attorney who is familiar with both trusts and the tax advantages of using them.  The one downside to a trust is that if you don't have at least $100K then you may stand to lose because the bank will take fees for managing your assets.  These fees can be high.

This is the most common type of investment with an interest only mortgage. You pay a fixed monthly payment towards an investment which is designed to grow so that the amount invested and it’s growth are enough to pay off the capital on the mortgage at maturity. This policy will also provide life assurance, so your mortgage will be paid should you die during the term of the plan.

At the beginning of the policy, assumptions will be made about the growth of your investment. The problems with endowments have arisen when people have signed up to a very high growth rate, which has then not been achieved over the life of the policy. This has meant that their monthly investment has not generated enough capital to fully repay the loan at the end of the term. Your investment will be more secure if you work on a cautious growth assumption. This will require higher monthly payments, but will be less risky.

If the plan has performed well, then you could end up with a lump sum payment in excess of your capital repayment at maturity. This cash surplus is tax free. However if the policy has not performed well, you may have to find funds to pay a portion of the capital yourself.

There are several different types of endowment policy:

Full with-profit endowment

This is the most expensive type of plan. It guarantees an annual growth rate and to pay off the loan in full at maturity. Your monthly investment premium will be pooled with the premiums of other investors and paid into a fund which is managed by the company. Each year a bonus is added, depending on the performance of the fund. A final bonus will be paid at the end of the life of the plan – this may represent a large portion of the capital repayment and is guaranteed to repay the loan. The large final bonus means that you will probably not be able to pay off your loan early.

Low cost endowment

This works in the same way as the full with-profit plan, but without the guarantee of paying off your loan in full at maturity. The growth assumption rate is used to determine your monthly payment. This will be lower than for a full with-profit plan as you are not paying for the guarantee. If profits are less than the initial growth assumption, you would have to find the funds to cover the shortfall. However you will be warned during the term of the policy if your plan looks as though it may have a shortfall and you can increase your monthly payment.

Unit linked endowment

Your monthly premium is used to buy units in a managed fund. The more monthly premiums are paid, the more units you hold. This method does not pay any bonuses, so if your fund has grown to a level whereby you can pay off your capital loan, you can cash in your policy. The total amount of money your policy is worth will fluctuate depending on the performance of your units so provided your assumed growth rate is maintained or exceeded, you will be able to pay off your loan in full. The opposite is also true and if the growth is lower than assumed you may have to adjust your payments to achieve the full capital repayment.

Unitised with profit endowment

With this policy, the value of the units is declared annually and this value is then guaranteed. This is designed to smooth out the price fluctuations of a standard unit linked policy. The guaranteed value is less than the actual value, so the chance of paying off your loan early is less, but so is the risk involved. This is an attractive policy when markets are volatile.

Low start endowment

This is designed for the expensive first few years of property ownership. It follows the same route as the low cost endowment, but premiums begin low and increase over a number of years. The overall amount that you pay into this type of plan will be higher than with a standard low cost endowment and the cash-in value will be lower for longer.

Non profit endowment

There are no bonuses paid with this type of policy, so you will not have a cash surplus on maturity. You will pay your monthly premium and this will be invested to cover the cost of your capital loan on maturity.

Advantages

If you choose a policy with a cautious growth assumption then you should have a tax free cash surplus on maturity of the policy.



If you choose a policy which can be paid back early, you can clear the mortgage completely as soon as the capital repayment value has been reached.



Life insurance is included in the policy so you do not need to arrange this separately. This gives peace of mind that the mortgage will be cleared in the event of your death.



If one payment covers your interest and monthly premium, then the amount of money invested will be higher during periods of low interest rates. This is because less of the fixed payment is needed to pay your interest charges, so more can be invested, increasing your likelihood of a cash surplus.



Policies can easily move with you. If you need to borrow more money for a more expensive prop

I'm not sure of why the insurance companies have problems, it might be that they are just trying to undersell each other to gain market share and wind up underselling themselves right out of the market, especially after all these natural disasters happen.
As for banks, I remember seeing advertisements on TV starting several years ago that would say, "we'll lend you money for any reason, if you have no credit history or even bad credit." I thought at the time, why would I want to do business with companies like that? Then of course there was the big push on ARM loans that seemed attractive to people wanting to get some quick money by backing them with the equity in their homes, not too concerned or really thinking about how the interest rates can adjust up, and what effect they would have on their payments.

I new a guy a school who was a slippery toad of a bloke.

Over time he became part of the friday night guys night out group.
He told me years ago well before this fiasco at the moment as a friend he could get me a mortgage for what ever i liked.
Its as a case of providing wage slips that were knocked out on a home computer saying you earned 100k a year or 200k a year.
Nobody checked.
OR CARED.!!
And the bigger the deposit you had the better.
a 30 grand deposit could of got me a 500 grand house.
He was a straight as a 3 pound note but had the wisdom to bail out 2 years ago a he said to me when the bubble bursts it will be huge.

Every company including pension schemes has invested in sub prime mortgages.
Lehman brothers new nothing about sub prime lending ten years ago but when they heard how much money could be maid they ditched there other ventures and invested everything in sub prime.

20 years ago it started.
When i was 18 getting a 200 quid stereo on the knock seemed a stupid thing to do.
3 years ago Top financial outfits like Fannie Mae think its fine to lend 200k dollars to hookers and waitresses to buy houses.
These greedy C..TS HAVE HAD THERE COME UPPANCE.
a lesson for all to learn here i think.

Why?  The company won't have any records this far back unless it is a life insurance product you are looking for and it is still in force. And if it were still in force you would be receiving at least annual statements.

There's a statute of limitations on claims and I'd say that would have well and truly run out.

the insurance company has to hold records for a minimum of 3 years, but after that then they may have been destroyed. it is unlikely you will be able to find out who you were with back then. sorry xx

Are you looking because someone passed away?



Or are you looking to cash it in?



Do you know if the policy was paid up?

You need to post a lot more details or any little info you have.



It is possible there is a company still holding that policy but you need to give more details or any at all to get help to find it.

Try your Dept. of Insurance or Insurance Commissioner in your state for help.

Mortgage payment protection / maternity allowance?



Been made redundant today.  I am pregnant so will be claiming job seekers allowance until december then claiming maternity allowance.

The company I have my mortgage payment protection insurance with are saying they will not pay whilst I am claiming maternity allowance as I am not actively seeking work, surely this can't be right.

I am a lone parent with 2 young children and am now worried sick

any advice would be greatly appreciated

many thanks

The insurance is intended to protect you against things that are beyond your control. Being pregnant is not beyond your control, therefore the insurance is not obligated to pay.

Sorry but they are probably correct. If you'd kept your job you wouldn't have been able to claim whist on maternity leave. 
I'm really sorry you've been made redundant hope it wasn't because you are pregnant?
Make an appointment at your local CAB

No there correct but whilst your on maternity allowance you can claim housing benefit/council tax benefit against the payments of your morgage. I doubt it will be all but i will be the majority. Have a word with either your local council housing department or CAB, they'll be able to tell you how much you could claim.

Should goverments bail out the banks and insurance companies that are struggling?hat would you like to ask?



the question is simple but I guess the complications arise from what if they don't bail them out and what happens to joe public as a result. Personally I would like to see more control of banks and how they lend and borrow money as its there greed that got them in this mess, but joe public who gets a hard time from the banks is the one footing the bill with job losses and public money being used to support them for there poor judgement.

What really happened to the banks and insurance companies, is like a world wide war against the mortgage industry. Which involved the sub prime mortgage creators and even natural interventions like the 'Katrina' and the mortgage problems. Now that war is almost over, the financial industries like the banks and insurance industries need to do their write downs,their capital injections, revise their lending guidelines, credit controls and their business practises.  The bubble in the housing industry burst and houses became unsold and house prices and equities dropped The people with mortgage repayments problems become homeless and jobless. The government has to bail some out so that the financial and insurance industries will not collapsed or  the country go into a recession.
