If demand of $ is more, will the $ become strong or weak?



Similarly, If supply of $ is more, will the $ become strong or weak & why?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Simple Supply and Demand.



If the supply of dollars increases, it exceeds demand and the price drops. Thus making the dollar weaker. A great example of this is in Zimbabwe right now. They are printing way more dollars than demand for the currency. As a result, they have hyper inflation and the value of the dollar is tanking.

I mean i come from a middle class family. no matter how bad the economy is middle class and poverty  will always pay for the goverments mistakes and corruption.

Sadly, your happiness is incorrect. The richman is fine - have you heard of limited liability? Sure, those with shares may get wiped out, but the fat cats cannot lose their houses, cars, jets, etc....they will keep them forever.



The people who are getting their butts kicked will sadly be the middle class as the government raises taxes to pay for healthcare, etc



And if the banks go kaput you won't able to borrow money anymore so anyone who owes money....hang on!



But no, the rich man's butt ain't really getting kicked. Let me quote from you:



"no matter how bad the economy is middle class and poverty will always pay for the goverments mistakes and corruption."



I'm afraid that it looks like that will be the case, unless someone proves me wrong.

The rich bastards won't be paying anything. Even if everything collapsed here and we had a *socialist revolution* by the poor to kick out the rich and take their money, what do you think the rich would do? They would get onto their private jets and fly to Europe or any other region that's okay with wealthy people.

The aren't rich because of how much they have.  They are rich because they know how to make money.  Some people can lose basically everything in a given year and gain all the back and then some the next.  The stock market crash doesn't really hurt the rich.  If they are truly rich, they diversify.  If they diversify, they Still have a lot of money.  In the long-run, the stock market beats inflation by the most out of all investments.  So, the rich keep getting richer and they keep beating inflation.  Also, the rich you talk about hardly have to pay for anything.  Companies make money by GIVING the rich their product and the rich inducing the product.  I don't think you understand how things work.  A FAMILY is usually rich because of things that happened long ago.  If you know to stay rich for over 100 years, chances are you are not going to fall out of the bracket from a few bad days of the DOW, let's be honest here!

We're all indebted to each other



Being the richest country in the world has nothing to do with self sustainability



Perhaps the US government doesn't have to borrow money from other countries, but it just does.



It does so to finance public spending (roads, bridges, etc) I guess



US banks also borrow money from Japan coz their banks have got low interest rates, meaning they can lend money to USAns at a higher interest rate and pocket the difference



Good question though



Thought provoking - can a country survive without foreign credit?

In reality, this country isn't as rich as people think it is. This entire country, the social programs, the system, has been built up with debt. In terms of real money and value, this country is straight up broke. If one day every country decided to stop giving loans to the US, then this country would collapse within a year.

That 'richest country in the world' thing is mostly a political catch phrase, isn't it? The US is the largest economy in the world, I suppose, but largest isn't always 'best'.



Anyway, the government borrows from whoever is willing to lend. Often that is China, Japan, or my dad. The borrow money from other countries is to finance the federal debt, which is a bit different from the economy as a whole.

Why is acorn getting so much of the bailout money?



People are getting upset about the bailout being voted down. The thing that Nancy Pelosi wont admit is that she has the majority in the house. If her people would have voted for the bill then it would have passed.  But her own people voted against it. What I want to know is why is Obama's pet group Acorn set up to get 20% of the money. That would be 140billion. I thought Obama was against pork barrel spending. Go figure.

The bailout in theory is a necessity but the problem is all the other things being attached ... i.e., what is being attached like ACORN.



Why ACORN should even be a part of the bailout is incomprehensible!!



Sorry but the Democrats in Congress managed to find time to slip language into the bailout legislation that would provide a dandy little slush fund for ACORN.



ACORN stands for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform



ACORN does many things under the umbrella of "community organizing." They agitate for higher minimum wages, attempt to thwart school reform, try to unionize welfare workers (that is, those welfare recipients who are obliged to work in exchange for benefits) and organize voter registration efforts (always for Democrats, of course). Because they are on the side of righteousness and justice, they aren't especially fastidious about their methods. In 2006, for example, ACORN registered 1,800 new voters in Washington. The only trouble was, with the exception of six, all of the names submitted were fake. The secretary of state called it the "worst case of election fraud in our state's history."



And we paid these people to go out there and register "fake" people.  I guess they documented days and weeks to acquire that many new registrations but in reality it really took them a few hours to look them up from the phone book.



ACORN is known for their fraudulent activities, misapproripation of funds and also their ties to the democratic parties.



Source(s):



Get ACORN out and any of the special interest groups that DO NOT directly have financial impact to financial institutions... out of this bill.



Obama was the legal lead and cut his teeth with the community leadership at ACORN... read up on it -- it is disgusting, actually!!

None of the bailout money goes to ACORN, you dolt. Het real.
20% of the PROFITS (if there are any, and that is a big IF), go to the housing trust fund and the Capital magnet fund. These funds distribute funds to local organisations to improve housing for the poor, elderly and disabled, sometimes including ACORN.
The amount that might go to ACORN is likely close to nothing, and that assumes any profits on the transactions. A fraction of 20% of any possible profit, which might be nothing.

the question is there is not mechanism to identify them or make it to pay this or to prove the really were benefited by the circumstance...all says "I did my work, I do not have to pay by the failures of others"...this posture could have many elements of justice but could be too dangerous for all the economics agents, included all the workers or those who live of a salary

This "crisis" has not affected me in the slightest. All of the stocks/funds I own are for retirement, which is decades away. All of my bank accounts are with stable banks. I have a mortgage and a car loan already. I work in a recession-proof industry (Biotech/Health Care). I feel that this crisis is affecting only financial speculators. There are a lot of lobbyists for such people, and they have the ears of Washington. I think they should just leave things alone. The American economy is supposed to be based on market forces. And a free market will always fix itself because people want to make money. It might take some time, but no more time for the "bailout" to take effect. I personally don't care if some banks disappear. Most people won't be affected by that because accounts are insured and honored by the companies that takeover the bad banks. If you are really affected by that, then you have enough money not to worry about it.

When goods are consumed immediately you can't get a refund.



Also, the demand tends to be price inelastic (since consumers only have so much time to make a decision) so you can charge high a price.

How much money will you get from a tex increase?



I'm writing a problem/solution essay, and my topic is Obesity in America. One of my solutions would be for the government to provide free gym memberships or federal funded gyms to individuals that qualify for them. So my question is, how much of a tax increase would be needed to allow this solution to be funded, and how much money would you get from such a tax increase.



Or if anybody has a different solution, i'm already using free gyms, active lifestyles, health groups, and to teach young kids in school (during health class) about obesity.

ROTFLMAO!!!



Are you serious!???  As a taxpayer I wouldn't pay one red cent to give government subsidized gym memberships to some one because they are obese!



That's like saying that the government should pay for people to all change their hair to blonde because someone said "blondes have more fun" or to pay for everyone that wants it to have a brand new Mercedes or BMW because it would "close economic differences between families".



This is the stupidest thing I've heard in awhile... thanks for the laugh.

Who do you blame for the current financial crisis in the U.S. economy?



I blame the Bush Administration for lack of regulation and oversight on the credit card companies and mortgage lenders.  The Bush Administration was busy conducting its imperalistic wars in the Middle East that it failed to take care of business at the domestic front.  I blame President W. Bush for his stupidity and incompentence.  What good will all my criticism do?  Expose the truth and reality.  I don't claim to have all the solutions or answers, I call it as I see it.  It's called balls and common sense.  People are losing their life savings on the disastrous drop in stock points.  Regular hard-working middle class Americans are worried over their financial futures.  Who do you blame for this outrageous state of the economy?  Who do you blame?

The American public, for signing loans they knew they couldn't afford, for taking their lives on credit.



You can't exactly blame the government for lack of regulation, personally I feel our government is to strict as it is. Think of it this way, the basic ideas of our government revolve around free speech, free religion, and free business, the entire country is a marketplace and I don't want the government trying to shelter me. Those people signed those loans, they did this to themselves and they have brought down our economy with them.

We are not in a "crisis"
Economy's cycle and bubbles burst, it has been happening since man first engaged in commerce.



Calling this bump a crisis is ridiculous, the media hypes everything these days and trying to affix blame for economic cycles is effectively saying:
"we should all have everything we want all the time and never have to worry about how smart we are with our money"



Stop watching the news for a couple days and you will realize things are as they have always been.

Why do companies collapse when people keep selling its stocks?



i remember learning in accounting that when a company issues common stock, it doesn't matter to the company what happens in the market with the stock once sold because if 100,000 stocks are sold for $10, the company has 1 million dollars and it doesn't have to pay say $1000 if some trader sells 100 of those stocks and at that moment nobody actually bought the 100 of them back.



if true, though simplistic, what happens when people panic and lose confidence in company ABC and sell sell sell stocks. price of the stock drops. and then what? the "market" has the stocks but it doesn't force the company to buy them back and cause it to go backrupt, does it?



</question>



<additional details>



so if say company ABC has 100,000 stocks at $10 each, and one day a rumour spreads that the company is going bankrupt, everybody starts selling...say 90,000 of the stocks aren't owned by anybody. what happens?



if the stocks are just a reflection, then the reflection may have be off the mark if instead of going bankrupt, the company was actually doing pretty well as it had been doing all the while.



the company does not have to pay money of any sort to the people who sold their stocks. does the company still survive? or does this selling of its stock directly cause it to collapse? or indirectly perhaps?

Most companies do not have that problem -- their stocks could tank and it doesn't really affect their business. Which is why for healthy companies, stocks seldom if ever truly collapse without reason.



But Wall Street firms and banks are in a special class. Their business DEPENDS in people having confidence in their financial stability. If a bank stock started collapsing, depositors would get scared and make a run on the bank, which really WOULD cause the business to fail.



Wall Street firms depend on other companies to trade with them and lend them money. It's a highly leveraged business where you constantly borrow money to make money, and you have to put up cash to settle trades that have been made. So similar to a bank, they are hostage to the confidence other people have in them. If everyone gets scared the Lehman is about to lose their liquidity and go bankrupt, then they stop trading and lending to Lehman, and affect is much the same as a run on the bank.



So for these financial firms, it's different and amounts to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Mere fear will destroy these companies quickly, and if a stock collapse starts picking up steam, a death spiral ensures ... even if at the beginning the falling stock price was completely unwarranted.

The price of the stock is a reflection of the business. What the stock owners are saying is that there is something wrong with this company. In fact it is so wrong we are selling the stock for less money. While not always accurate when I see a big selloff in an equity I have to take a step back and look to see if maybe the sellers are right. A good example is the present mess that many of the banks are in because they bought outsanding loans that were issued to people who could not pay them. It was not the price of the stock that drove many of these banks under. It was the .bad business practices.

The two responses above me couldn't be more wrong. The Federal Reserve is one of the main reasons why we are in this mess right now.



The Business Cycle Theory of Ludwig Von Mises of the Austrian School of Economics, explains that business cycles exist because of government intervention and not because of the free market.



One way for government to intervene in the market aside from coercive legislation is through a central bank (Federal Reserve) by keeping interest rates artificially low, price-fixing, inflating the money supply, etc.



The market should determine what prices, wages, interest rates are. The free market is the amalgamation of a lot of individual supply and demand transactions. This is the most powerful determinant of what rates should be and not a few people who think they know better than the market. Central planning have been proven to be a mistake again and again.



Due to the loose monetary policy of the Federal Reserve and by tampering with the economy, we are in this mess. Entrepreneurs are the expert in predicting the market, thus they can venture into capital investment and business decisions. Some of them fail because they are not as good as those who are successful. But if the market is tampered with by the government (through artificially low interest rates, price fixing, wage fixing, inflation, etc), it sends bad signals to these entrepreneurs which causes them to make bad investments (malinvestments) - and a temporary/fake prosperity ensues (this is the boom cycle). Once the market tries to get back to real rates or equilibrium, it will start liquidating the malinvestments created by the boom cycle (this is the bust cycle).



A perfect analogy would be the following:



Imagine a small landowner who rents out a space for lodging in a small town. One day, the circus came to town bringing with it its numerous staff and the tourists they attract. Because of this, more demand came up for his business. He then started buying the lots beside his land and created more lodging for the people that the circus attracts. Once the circus leaves town though, not only did it bring its staff with it, its departure also stopped the big number of tourists coming into town. Now the business owner is paying extra expenses for very few customers.

No.. banks did quite an awesome job of it all on their own.



Once banks start inventing products for credit swaps and sell-offs, there WILL be an issue of moral hazard... meaning that they won't take the initiative to protect themselves if they are just going to sell it off.



If the Fed were going to make a bank go bust though.. it would be pretty easy.  Simply deny them Federal Reserve credit lines.

Monetary and fiscal policy?



can someone please give me a basic definition of both of these economic systems please? regards



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Monetary policy is the process by which the government, central bank, or monetary authority of a country controls (i) the supply of money, (ii) availability of money, and (iii) cost of money or rate of interest, in order to attain a set of objectives oriented towards the growth and stability of the economy. Monetary theory provides insight into how to craft optimal monetary policy.
Monetary policy is generally referred to as either being an expansionary policy, or a contractionary policy, where an expansionary policy increases the total supply of money in the economy, and a contractionary policy decreases the total money supply. Expansionary policy is traditionally used to combat unemployment in a recession by lowering interest rates, while contractionary policy involves raising interest rates in order to combat inflation. Monetary policy should be contrasted with fiscal policy, which refers to government borrowing, spending and taxation



Fiscal policy, taking the scope of budgetary policy, refers to government policy that attempts to influence the direction of the economy through changes in government taxes, or through some spending (fiscal allowances).
Fiscal policy can be contrasted with the other main type of macroeconomic policy, monetary policy, which attempts to stabilize the economy by controlling interest rates and the supply of money. The two main instruments of fiscal policy are government spending and taxation. Changes in the level and composition of taxation and government spending can impact on the following variables in the economy:
Aggregate demand and the level of economic activity
The pattern of resource allocation
The distribution of income.Fiscal policy refers to the overall effect of the budget outcome on economic activity. The three possible stances of fiscal policy are neutral, expansionary and contractionary:
A neutral stance of fiscal policy implies a balanced budget where G = T (Government spending = Tax revenue). Government spending is fully funded by tax revenue and overall the budget outcome has a neutral effect on the level of economic activity.
An expansionary stance of fiscal policy involves a net increase in government spending (G &gt; T) through a rise in government spending or a fall in taxation revenue or a combination of the two. This will lead to a larger budget deficit or a smaller budget surplus than the government previously had, or a deficit if the government previously had a balanced budget. Expansionary fiscal policy is usually associated with a budget deficit.
Contractionary fiscal policy (G &lt; T) occurs when net government spending is reduced either through higher taxation revenue or reduced government spending or a combination of the two. This would lead to a lower budget deficit or a larger surplus than the government previously had, or a surplus if the government previously had a balanced budget. Contractionary fiscal policy is usually associated with a surplus.

If it passes, taxes will likely increase at some future time to pay for any losses. Interest rates will also likely increase for a bit.



If it doesn't pass, expect rising unemployment, lower housing prices, tighter credit (harder to get student loans, car loans, mortgages).

The recent announcement of $700 billion U.S. bank rescue plan helped bolster the dollar and made dollar strong?



Also if demand of $ increases, dollar becomes strong. Thus, if supply of $ increases, it becomes strong and if demand of $ increases, then also it becomes strong. I am confused. PLease help.

<answer>



Because if everyone is out buying stuff, businesses need to use more products, hire more people, give workers overtime and they are happy with more money, thus, buying more cars, getting more loans, spending more at Wal-Mart and the whole thing gets bigger, making the economy grow. This money is like a jump start to all of that.



Those that are for this rescue plan, realize that this is the way to inject some life into the economy. Those opposed, are ignorant, thinking it will come out of the tax payers pocket, when really, it will repay itself when folks are making more money and paying more in anyway.

I just want to add something, You cant loose your superpower status only because of an economic crisis...sure Bush is the worst leader america has ever seen...but still only if the country is defeated and has been occpuied or surrendered then it will loose it's superpower position in the world just like today, China isn't a superpower yet because of it's military status russia as well, look at the US Military budget and you'll see...of course it will affect the US status in the world but thank god elections are coming soon and i hope Obama wins and deals with this situation and make his country proud again.

Since China still has a population surplus and is facing countless accounts of human rights violations and industry violations, no they are not a superpower. they have a strong economy, but nothing else. There's a strong social part to determining the standing of a nation, and the US is only in a recession. There's no reason to worry, it's not like we're going to socially devolve just because to the economic tide.

In medium place we can not expect change in economic preponderance in the world because all the world will entry in the crisis more less in the same proportion; but if the crisis get prolonged for a long period of time then we must see new poles of economic preponderance located in Europe, China or Latin America...



We can find during '30 crisis a big prosperity in URSS, at point to convert it in the second economic power in the world...in Latin America we found some wake up of industrialization process into a context where there was not financial, technology and market conditions...

The US already has lost its superpower.



As Dubya goes begging to Congress for his political life and his country's welfare, China is blowing billions on space walks, and Russia is producing billionaires by the minute.



In six months China will have bought up all the deflated banks and be standing tall amongst this devastating economic mess and Russia will be holding onto her gas lines even tighter than before.



Mr Bush was so busy waging war in the middle east he took his eye off the rest of the world and the economy (if it was ever there) and now he and the US people, and probably the rest of Europe, dearly will have to pay for it.

I'm not an Expert, but here goes.
The United States has relied too heavily upon debt in the post-industrial world. Industrial capacity has moved to the BRIC nations, as production costs are lower. Manufactured goods are now paid for in Dollars and imported, leaving China with enormous currency reserves. Ironically, the Sovereign Wealth Funds are the largest holders of Collateralized Debt Obligations, which are the main source of the present Credit Crunch. The SWFs had lots of Dollars and the US selling them these property-based CDOs seemed to be the perfect investment for their money.
You will notice that China now has its own lunar project, which shows that it wants to be taken seriously.
In the same way as the 19th Century was the British Century and the 20th Century was the American one (now ending), the 21st Century will be the Chinese Century.

the US will lose its "superpower" status to China, India and Russia (remember Russia sells gas to most of Europe) with or without the current crisis. However they will have smug smiles on their faces.



And remember the US has never really been a world power such as the UK. We ruled 20% of the world's population for over 150 years. The US has had its chance ..its all over inside 50 years. Not very impressive really

I think it's due to people having hope the bailout plan will pass the second time around.  In the long run, it's actually a great idea because the Treasury is going to make a killing in return when the banks get back, up and running again.  I honestly don't care if my tax dollars go to bail the big-wigs out, because it's not like I would be able to do anything with that money once it's taken out of my paycheck; it will either go to fund schools, fix the roads or something else.  Might as well be this.



Hopefully the plan will include some sort of accountability though, to these jokers that got us here in the first place.  The whole reason we are in this mess is because no one was holding them accountable and they were trying to cut corners with these mortgage-backed securities and spreading the risk around by selling a group of bad assets as a bond; no one knows who is responsible for the original asset, because none of the idiots kept track of them in their portfolios.  As a result, everyone has to pay.  Things will get sorted out for a while, then in another 25 years another financial crisis will hit.  It's just the cycle of the financial industry mixed with lack of accountability.

Is the dollar as the reserve currency an inflation tax?



*If you purchase one dollar off America in exchange for a pint of milk.  And then hang on to the $ for, say, a year.



*And if, during the year the Americans have allowed the $ to inflate - loosing 1/4 of its value.



*Then you only get 3/4 pint of milk back from America if you give them your dollar.



*They are up 1/4 pint of milk.



The whole thing depends on the *delay* of one year.



As a reserve currency the $ sits in a bank for some time - otherwise the reserve would be zero.



Question:  So is the dollar as the world's reserve currency an inflation tax levied by America on the world?



(Everything simplified and idealised for simplicity.)

I have a friend that lives in canada across the border by detroit.  When I visit him, the places all accept my U.S. money.  You get canadian money as change though and it gets really confusing because 1 dollar of U.S. money does not equal 1 dollar of canadian (aka exchange rate).  It's a pain in the butt to try and figure out what the heck is going on.  I'm not sure if all of canada accepts U.S. money or just places close to the U.S. border.  I've never ventured too far from the border so I don't know.



Personally, I just use credit cards when I visit now.  It's a lot less confusing.



Also, the gasoline prices are really confusing because the prices on the signs look really low but then you realize that the price is in canadian dollars per liter instead of U.S. dollars per gallon.  So then your head explodes trying to do the math and you just go home to where everything is familiar and never go back.....or at least that's what I did.  :)

I am. I see financial groups all over the world in distress.  That can't be a good sign.  Reports say credit is tightening making it difficult for businesses to get the cash they need to keep operating. Its also more difficult for consumers to get credit for things like car loans, mortgages, student loans, etc so those sectors are also suffering.  Its all interconnected.

Can anyone explain to me how giving banks 700 billion dollars is going to make the economy better? ?



From what I have been told we (tax payers) are going to have to pay this money back in the form of higher taxes. Doesn't this take money out of the average persons pocket? How is this bill going to help you and me? I don't have a high intrest loan, I was responsible and didn't buy something I can't afford. Why do I have to pay for the banks mistakes?

To simplify things, without the $700B and if the economy is not getting better, you will not be able to afford anything at all.



It's not the bank's mistakes, all of these happened because a series of complex events. To understand it, we will need finance and politics degrees, which unfortunately, I don't have.



There's no such thing as a free lunch, and that goes with citizenship as well.

economics measures involve big ethical questions like you mention...US economy leaves '30 crisis by the principle of "all must pay the mistakes made by a someone"; in that years governments increase a lot its fiscal deficit to recover the economy and only give the promise to pay this money by new taxes for him son and grandson (your fathers)...at the same manner, you responsibility and your word is not only for you it is for all either...it look like communist argument, but it is principles guided by practice in economic policy...

Depends really on your personal situation.



If it was a personal situation where you had no job therefore had no money unemployment would be pretty bad but on the other hand looking at it from a global perspective inflation is worse. Mainly because no one has money even if they do its worth nothing even the government can't fix inflation easily. So therefore inflation should be considered worse for everyone.

You are comparing apples and oranges. They are not at all the same. For example, if you have a job and we were to get hit with 50% inflation, then you would be making 50% less money. But if we had a recession and the cost of things went down 50% and you were getting unemployment at a rate of 67% of your former salary, you would actually be making more money. So there is no pat answer, the variables decide it.

America is not the "richest" they aren't even close. Our money is based on nothing but the hopes and dreams of the American people. So therefore in theory America is worth nothing. But we do have other stuff like technology but that doesn't matter because it isn't worth soooo much. Other countries have Gold we have nothing to back up our economy.... so yes richest is a lie.



And the distribution of our so called "money" is like what is it because our government doesn't stress regulation as much as other countries. Like Europe which has huge taxes but everyone gets free health and other benefits.

America is not the richest country in the world. they want you to believe that, and they were at one point, but we're going under. we are trilions of dollars in debt to other nations, our economy is terrible! we are in a recession, and soon may face another depression, and the worth of our dollar keeps dropping. jobs are being lost, prices are going up, and the government has no clue on how to fix all this. I don't know where you got the idea that america is a rich country, but it is not.

Is economics a pseudoscience?



I've been studying finance thruout my undergrad. study, and the first few core courses I have to pass are all economics related. I didn't know why.



I then had been enrolled in a MA program in Economics, and graduated. I saw all the finance guys had to take Econ courses as well, I didn't know why by then either.



Now I'm in a PhD program in Economics, things have been going wilder and crazier, the only thing that doesn't change is my feeling of this subject being a COMPLETE pseudoscience. The more you deal with it, the stronger the feeling becomes, ridiculous fundamentals of economics such as "rational hehaviors of consumers", "econometrics greatly rely on continuous quantities", "homothetic, quasi-concavity of utility, which incurs the whole demand theory , hence the fundamentals of Microeconomics"..... all of these bother me, since they conflict and severely contradict our simple realities, "winnowing out" is how economics theories were born, you try to simulate the real life into economics models, if your theory doesn't explain the reality, its abandoned, c'mon folks, real science doesn't do that....



In another hand, the fact that  the united states and the rest of world have governments use this type of science to regulate all of us proves we are all PATHETIC BASTARDS.

Econ is a social science. It's basically about trying to find out how and why people be have they do with resources like money and capital and how to efficiently use them. If fairly difficult to quantify something like that.



I mean there have been many schools of thought (Chicago, Keynesian, Austrian, et al) over the years to explain why people react the way the do some work better than others. It's not like physics where there is a unifying law that controls everything. You might have to do some research from their point of view and see why people like Keynes, or Friedman came up with their theories and their rationalities.

I feel that president bush is what happened to this economy.  Many of his policies and not taking action when needed or taking late action when he does.  We have this credit crisis that allowed people to borrow more than they could afford.  Some think that it started with president clinton that he wanted Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac to allow more borrowing.  But he did that when they had billions in surplus and along with that the Senate passed a bill that the government oversees less of these transactions.  This is what happened and it has snowballed from there.  That is what I think

Actually, our economy is tumbling down. This is because of several reasons. Our currency has depreciated sharply, and keeps on depreciating. Almost all the investors have left this country and investing abroad. There is almost no federal reserve left in our central bank, State Bank of Pakistan. Besides that no multinational companies are launching their firms in Pakistan anymore. What government need to do is to stop the imports of luxury goods in order to conserve Federal Reserves. They ought to encourage private sector, investors and multinational companies to invest in Pakistan. . .

The United States borrowed like a teenager with a new credit card, that's what happened.



This entire country and system (social programs, military, etc...) has been built up with debt and inflated money and now we can't pay the bill. I've seen this coming for 10 years and I know some people who've been seeing this for the last 30 years. It's not something to blame Bush for (even though he is part of the problem), it's something to blame the American system and way of life for. This country is not financially sustainable and now it's paying for it. We will have an economic depression. It will last for a long time. American quality of life will deteriorate and a lot of people are going to be poor and hungry. That is the consequence of a greedy, materialistic, unsustainable society that bought a lot of things that it doesn't need, with money that it doesn't have.



My personal tips: Stock up on food, get a gun, get a place far outside of the city (I don't mean suburb, I mean rural) because the next 3-6 years will be very very rough.

I can't make my money last. How can I control my spending habits?



Every month after my bills have gone out (my rent, council tax, utility bills, broadband, car insurance, phone bill, personal loan etc) i'm left with a bit of money but i can't make it last and every month i'm cashing cheques for the next month to survive.

I'm not lavish but sometimes you HAVE to have things, like this month I NEEDED my hair doing and it was £60. There's too much pressure on me. I need clothes and stuff and I need to do up my flat. If I don't have certain things (usually self image) then I get mega depressed and the less money I have the more I want to buy something to make myself feel better. How can I control my spending habits? I can't carry on like this it's seriously stressing me out



</question>



<additional details>



Without phone and broadband I would be isolated and even more unhappy so it's worth £50 per month!! Just don't know where the rest all goes..

I know someone who was in a similar situation.  This person was also depressed and had low self esteem. As a result of this, she got into the cycle of over spending to make herself feel better.  This lead to a mountain of debt, more depression, more anxiety and as a result more spending.  However, she got help in the form of CBT and counselling sessions.  This wasn't just to crub her spending habits, but also to work on her self esteem and depression.  I urge you to go to your GP and get some help before it gets out of hand.  They should also be able to maybe get you intouch with some services to help you organise your finacial situation a bit better.



In the mean time, try and write down you budget and how it will be spent each day, maybe allocate a certain amount each day or week and prioritise what you need to buy.



I know what it's like to feel you need to control something in your life that could be potentially self destructive.



Good luck and take care.

You need to work on your self-esteem. You are worth more than a hairdo or a fancy decoration for your apartment.  Your discretionary cash might be best spent on some counseling to raise your self-value. Your hair is not a need.  You are beautiful with hair straight or in a do.  You are worthy of love no matter how fancy or plain your flat is.  You need to know that on the inside, so that you will have better control of your spending.  You are worth saving some cash and creating a secure financial future.

Maybe you should start to accept yourself for who you are. Stop thinking you need to buy things for yourself to make yourself happy. If your friends are stressing you out over things you have or don't have, they're most likely in for what you've got, not who you are.

I understand the needing hair done bit. If you dye your hair, maybe you should stop. Get it cut 2 months or so. That should save some money alone. You shouldn't need new clothes every month. I haven't gone to the mall since a few months before school got out, and when I would go, I would take a few dollars in cash, and leave checks, debit cards, credit cards, everything at home.

When you're getting your money, after you write off bills, put some in savings.

Hope I helped :)

Keep a journal of your discretionary spending. Not a budget but a journal of the extra funds and where they go. I  assume you have already taken a look at your fixed expenses ,cut back there if possible. If no room to cut back than budget what you absolutely have to have.

I was in a similar situation and I made a game out of seeing how little of every day things I could use and still get the job done. It was amazing how wasteful humans are. I use far less of everything. I started with shampoo. I kept on using less and less until it was ineffective and than increased slightly. You can do it with most consumer staple products, hairspray, makeup, toothpaste... etc..

I just down loaded a budget planner from Money Expert and was horrified that we were over spending by nearly £300 a month.  It was quite an eye opener.  Unfortunately the first things that had to go was JJB fitness club, also curbing our entertainment will make a difference.

Down load a planner and look at your finances in detail.  You'll then have a much clearer idea of what you have as a disposable income.  Unfortunately, having to budget is a bit like being on a diet, as soon as you can't have something you feel the need to really have it.  It's like a craving, almost like an addiction.  You need to find some inner strength and ask those around you to support you.

Revisit your wardrobe too.  Most fashions are repeated every few years so the chances are that you've got things lurking back there that you haven't worn for ages that you can dress up with new accessories.

As for needing that hair do... you do.  But shop around, there are a lot of great little salons out there that don't charge the earth to give you that fresh look.



Good luck

Get rid of your car and use public transportation instead.  And if you live in an isolated area without  public transportation.  Then move to a more convenient location.

Even if you have to take a taxi once or twice a week to deliver your groceries from the food store.  You still would save a lot of money by not having a car.  No car insurance, no car maintenance costs, no gasoine bills, and no need to save up for a new car when the present one gets old.

You can't live without a shelter.  But without a car you most certainly can live.

ECB uses holds "Rule based policy", it's main priority (rule) - to hold low inflation (though partially they might use judge-type approach). but I would guess that this mix is 75%-Rule and 25%-discretionary..

http://www.ecb.eu/mopo/intro/html/object...

P.S. discreationary sometimes means destabilizing - so it not the right word.

Added: Well, it's not a joke , but I'm not completely sure. It is just my thoughts in this case, so better check-out link and make sure you read their goals and methods (at least few sentences) - part which says "Guiding principles":

as the purpose to all central banks is globalization of a single one world monetary system, discretionary policy IS rule based. it is used simply to give the illusion of a free and fair system when the reality is all central banks are strickly controlled through rule. it is how they control governments. the united states owes the american central banking system trillions of dollars. where's the descretion in putting any one "borrower" so deep in debt that paying back the loans are almost impossible? what happens if the government defaults? will the central banks then "own" america by default? maybe the u.s. should consider bankruptcy protection filings!

of course they should be. they spread economic activity over a larger number of enterprises. they drain less of resources, especially of space, infrastructure, and environment. they spread employment. they cushion the impact of macroeconomic forces.

Pharaoh's dream - any lessons for the modern economy?



In the book of Genesis, Pharaoh dreamt he saw seven fat cattle and then seven thin cattle, which ate up the fat ones.
Joseph interpreted that there would be seven good years followed by seven bad years.  His solution was to store grain in the good years to tide the country over the bad ones.
But these days, the governments have spent, spent and spent in the good years, and encluraged the people to do the same, creating a crippling load of debt when times get hard.
Now the lean years are on us.
Are the lean years worse than the fat years are good?

China, Japan and others are heading for seven lean years worse than the fat years because they are the ones who were buying (i.e. storing) U.S. debt when they could have spent it. Their cycle is something like this: save save save then lose lose lose.

As for America the future is not so bleak. Their cycle is something like this: spend spend spend followed by lose devalue spend more!

Macroeconomics help please!?



Assume that GDP=6000, personal disposable income=5100, government budget deficit=200.  Consumption is 3800, and the trade deficit is 100.  How large is savings(S)? What is the size of investment(I), how large is government spending(G)?  Thanks for you help!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



G=T+Deficit
Taxes = Y - disposable income
T = 6000 - 5100
T = 900
G = 900 + 200 = 1100

Y = C + I + G + NX
6000 = 3800 + I + 1100 - 100
I = 6000 - 4800 = 1200
NX = S - I
-100 = S - 1200
S = 1100

The US is going to be hit real hard.



The game a certain section of the population have played have come back to haunt everybody else.

Look at AIG. The previous incompetent CEO was fired with at US$93m payoff, the company is worth 5.2b on the stock market about now. The CEO got paid around 1.5% of what the company is worth today for running the company into the ground.



All the collapses ue to mortgage collapse are due to star investors and portfoio managers who had had huge bonuses worth millions for investing other peoples money into stuff that's today, worthless. They made millions, and you lose your shirt.

WHat has gone wrong is that regulations which are supposed to protect the population from excesses just went missing.

New products were created such that people could use the unrealised value (paper value) of their shares to make borrowings; this is fine as long as the stock market is up.

he same for th emortgage market. The new product started with low interest which increased over time. Hence if you buy the most uxurious house ou can afford today under the scheme, as long as the price of hiuses rises, once the interest you pay gets too much for you, you can resell the house at a profit, and start again. But if the price of houses stops rising, then you are stuck.

Regulations allowed this to happen, people like Mr Greenspan talked to allow the market to keep on rising. However, there always are limits, and we have reached them.

The recession is here and will wipe out the value of many assets. However, since the world is more linked than in the 30s, since India and China arent that dependent on the US, the global recession will not be as bad; however the US will suffer a major blow as the value of US assets crash.

However, there are good buying opportunities, and what will save the US from a 30s style depression is that money from India, China, the Middle East will flow in and pick bargains, such as AIG at $1.75 (minimal downside with reasonable upside).

In sum the US will go through a depression, many US assets will end up in foreign hands and his is what will save the US from a 30s style depression.

I suspect it, but I don't fear it, because the writing's been on the wall for a few years and I've had plenty of time to think about it and prepare for it.

It wasn't obvious how it was going to happen, but it was obvious that things couldn't go on the way they were forever. Western economies have been living on borrowed time. After the party comes the hangover.

<question>



Oil Prices/Reserves Situation, why are they putting the price back up?



I know there are alot of oil questions and they are probably getting tedious. But what is the reason for them putting oil price up? They are falling due less demand and the OPECs are determined to push them back up. The only two reasons i can think of is to have control over western economy or because it is running out and there reservers are much lower than they make out from when they "fudged the figures" back in the 70's and they are trying to get the oil to last longer?

Im sure it might be neither but some other peoples insight would be well good. Cheers guys

Huh? Demand HAS decreased. Substantially. And since, apparently, buyers think that prices are more likely to fall than climb, the demand for hedging forward has been greatly reduced.

What is your prediction for the economy for next year?



People are selling like crazy today in Asia. I'm not sure when this is going to end. Personally, I'm not one of the monied people out there. The markets have gone down for a year and there are all sorts of dire predictions. I heard one business person on BBC say that some people are predicting up to 50 airlines will be out of business as a result of the crisis. George Soros says this is going to get worse. I haven't heard anything from Warren Buffet on this lately. Where is it all going? Will it compound in your opinion? Who can afford to buy property atthis point anyways especially all the resort properties that have been built around the world. Your thoughts?

<answer>



The thing is everybody knows there will be bail-outs but everybody pretends it isn't the case.

The bankers know their bonuses depend on the paper profits made, and hence are encouraged to take maximum risks allowed. The shareholders allow them to take maximum risks since as profits grow so do share prices and dividends to a lesser degree. The savers allow these risks by placing their funds with these bankers because they know the government/fed will bail them out if something bad happens.

Today's issues are due to that.

They can also be traced back to the new products created during the boom. Lending to people with low credit rating (sub prime) is bad enough, but reselling the streams of payments as commercial paper assuming a low bankruptcy rate was the killer. Everybody was too optimistic, nobody did their jobs properly. Whatever checks and balances failed.

Allowing a mortgage product that starts with low interest and then has increasing interests encourages people to buy the most expensive they can afford now, pay until the interest is too high, sell at a profit (assuming booming market). Again, the key is assuming the boom continues.

The same thing for the stock market, allowing people to borrow based on the market value of their stock holdings works only is the markets don't go down.

So the fault lies with stupid optimism (inflation is dead, recessions are of the past, good times are here to stay for ever and ever, Greenspan is God), and the knowledge at the back of the head that the US is NOT a true capitalistic society where big banks will be allowed to fail.

To me Mr Greenspan is the greatest culprit, refusing to see the signs of a slowing economy and keep talking up the economy. A lot of people are blaming Mr Bernenke, but he is picking up the pieces of Mr Greenspan who allowed, encouraged even a severe difference between reality (over heated markets) and people's perception (all is rosy).

Alternatives, 
1 let them fail and lose votes. But that will teach everyone there is no safety net and would encourage bonuses to be paid on longer term measures, not paper profit, reducing risk taken and probability of crashes.
2 make the bank executives responsible, take back their bonuses and bankrupt them. Next time they'll think twice before being reckless.
3 There are anti trust laws in many areas; most economic theory is based on perfect competition, companies are too big to be competitive, they work together. Impose maximum sizes on companies, force them to spin off parts that are big so they can't hide their problems that easily.
4 Seperate savings and investments clearly and ensure savings can only be invested in very safe areas and be thus more protected while investments are volatile and can easily be worthless. Basically ensure financial instuitutions manage these 2 pots seperately, or even have 2 entities to do the job, and allow the investement bit to fail if necessary.

Hope that helped.

gb..I absolutely agree. Not sure how it is elsewhere in the world, but we also have very high level management that are paid millions of dollars and run companies so far into the ground that they are then paid huge settlements to get them to leave said company (after having bankrupted the companies in some cases). And they move from company to company as well. I don't know about your job, but I know if I screwed up like that,  I'd just be shown the door :-)  or a cell.

Part of the problem is unrestrained greed. Of the 'companies' and their leaders. They don't offer a good balance or win-win...they don't look at the long term. They agregiously move from company to company and irresponsibly suck it dry. 
Well, there's alot of other aspects as well. 
Alternative? 
I read once where Chinese businessmen were executed for their failures/corruption. I remember being appalled. But with some of the recent cases in the US..makes me go 'hmmmmm'

Where might I find information about the wealth of the UK population? ?



Hi there, I am trying to find out where the highest concentration of rich people live in the UK. I believe they are a1's? I would also like data on b1's? What would this type of data be called along with the group that these belong to and any further groups. The more in-depth this information is, the better (i.e down to city/town level).



</question>

GNP is quite different I believe. We want to know how many people of a certain wealth live in an area. Obviously, some areas are better to target than others.

Does this make sense?

Islam is against usury; that is, charging interest on loans.  That sounds good, but in practice they just give it a different name.  So if you get a bank loan in Saudi or Afghanistan the procedures and costs to you are pretty much the same as in the West.  Just as Christianity preaches against killing, but the US has the largest defence budget in the world, and judicially kills more people than all but about 2 other countries.

The main difference is that Islam  forbid  charging interest on loan  as did Christians until after the reformation, so instead or borrowing  you must share ownership to get money for business ventures. However  the Banking system in Islamic nations were set up by colonial powers  and work just like they do in the west. There has been some efforts to start small local islamic banks for people who feel strongly about their religion and investment funds that only  buy stock in companies that do not borrow.

Globalization is not new,its just another way to call Imperialism and free trade.Liberalization ( Derregulation) was needed to counterwight the diminishing profits of Corporations.Its nearly the same as  gambling.Just think what would happen to Capitalist economies if the new " markets " of China and East countries were non existent.There is a saturation of merchandises.We, Bolsheviks, are happy because this world crisis will spread to China,and everybody will see that it is an overinvested country, millions of Chinese will lose their Jobs.China is just an export-import platform.All that crap about "Capitalism Rebuilding in China and Russia" is just plain ignorance.It is not possible, this is the phase of agony of Capitalism.

Liberalisation of financial markets encourages capital exchange between different countries.  This in turn encourages cultural exchange, trade and population movement between countries.  This leads to globalisation.



A bank lending money to a company in a foreign country will do so as it expects to make more on the investment abroad than a similar investment at home.  With this increased return comes increased risk as the market, competition, culture etc are be less familiar.  In order to manage this risk a bank will attempt to learn more about the foreign country.  It will send people to do research, encourage people to live to manage the investment etc etc.  The same is true for governments and individuals.  All of this leads to globalisation

Economic theory says countries that are less developed will produce a greater return on capital (marginal product of capital) than a developed country.  This encourages investment in developing countries which - in theory - will speed up their development.  This will allow them to join the global community faster and more fully than would otherwise be the case.

You see, many banks have bought mortgage backed securities, basically pieces of paper that pay you a return depending on how people repay their mortgages.

Now this is not highly rated because mortgage, especially the famous sub-prime mortgages (lending to people wosre credit rating is so bad that in general they wouldn't get a loan).

WHat the banks do is go to an insurer like AIG and buy insurance that this piece of paper will pay. The risk is transferred to AIG and AIG gives another piece of paper that's now insured. The credit rating of this paper is high since insured by AIG. The bank then uses this paper as part of its regulatory reserves, hence other assets like cash can be lent out and earn more money.

But if AIG fails, the paper from AIG that the bank holds becomes worthless, the bank suddenly does not have enough reserves. Now the central bank could temporarily relax reserve requirements. But that will not help. Once people know that reserves are too low, they will rush to get their money out first. Bans will be unable to pay, and will collapse.

In sum, if AIG collapses, many other banks worldwide will be affected. Many people will lose their shirts, even deposit guarantee schemes that protect our savings in banks (to a maximum whih varies depending on the coutry) might not be able to hold. After all these deposit guarantees are ften also insurance covered.

The cycle goes on.

Lehman brothers is an investment hous; it crashes only lehman investors suffer; some banks who used lehman to invest for them also suffer. But nothing on the scale of AIG.

Is it unfair? Yes it is. When you think AIG worth is arond 10b and the previous CEO (sullivan, not willumstad) responsible to a large degree of this fiasco got 93m in severance package.

But did the Fed have a choice?Not really, someone had to save AIG and the financial markets.

Is it over? Not by a long shot. There will be more to come; exposure to the mortgages is everywhere, and not everybody has used AIG as insurance.

All that US Fed is doing is worthless.It is just increasing the debt of US goverment, this huge defficit will fuel higher interest rates and this will brake US economy, worsening the financial crunch.

USA is epicenter of the world crisis.Our forecast was correct.
No country in the World will be undamaged from this crisis.
From our point of view it is excellent for our cause.
The door for us (and this one is a gate) is again open.
Ans at last but not least, this "socialization" of bankruptcy will make this world recession  last for a long time.

Besides the issue of sheer size, AIGs assets are really worth something. If they have a bridge to selling some of those assets, they should be able to repay the loan. Lehman essentially was worthless.

The price of crude and even the levels of oil surplus has little to do with the price you pay at the pump. Oil companies will often use those as excuses to raise the price, but as you pointed out, they never use those same excuses to lower prices. The cost of gas at the pump often reflects what they think the cost of oil will be in the future, not what it costs now. They can get away with that because they have huge lobbies in congress that make sure the oil companies always end up on top.

The answer is that crude oil and finished, refined product are two separate commodities industries.

Therefore, its possible to have cheap crude and still have expensive diesel, gasoline, kerosene, heating oil and the like due to demand upon refineries instead of demand at the oil field.

However, because oil is lower today, does not change the fact that deliveries of fuels ordered in June and July are cheap. They are still at the all-time high price of $147 a barrel. Since the refinery has paid more for that crude, they will price their gasoline and diesel and other products based on cost of the raw material, cost of refining it, and cost of distribution to the oil companies that then blend the fuels and distribute them to stations which dispense them to your tank.

For those that purchase oil on the spot market for less money, its just price gouging or simply they can get what they get now because YOU are willing to pay for it.

If you refuse to purchase petrol or gas or diesel or any refined product, and its just sitting there at the station, eventually the major distributors will find a way to lower the price to even out the spread or losses over time.

Unfortunately we are paying the price of the greed of a handful of super-wealthy investment funds that sought to undermine the market for a quick profit.

This is why necessaries such as fuel and energy, and even fuel should be more closely regulated so that only those who contract for actual deliveries and who have the capacity to accept immediate delivery, should be allowed to buy futures contracts like this.

Too many speculators, hedge funds, and investment banks poured tens if not hundreds of billion dollars in the oil markets in the vain hopes of making a fast buck by bidding up the prices astronomically. The end result is the huge economic meltdown you see today.

Shame on them! Maybe this will mark the end of the greedplays that have plagued financial markets across the globe for nearly 10 years.

People were able to borrow money easily and could finance high materialistic lifestyles also borrow money to buy houses beyond what they could afford which meant house prices could grow bigger and bigger.



The crunch has shown this was wrong so people wont lend money as easily as they did before. People wont be able to get loans and mortgages as easily.

Also insurance companies will be hit and will no doubt be driving up premiums as they were propping up the companies that were giving risky loans.

<answer>



It's what happens when people borrow more than they can afford to. People are given a line of credit much larger than they should have, and then can't pay off their debts - so the bank starts charging higher interest on smaller loans to make up its losses. There is less money available from potential loaners to potential borrowers, which means less businesses open up, less big-ticket items are bought, less people are employed, and it's a tight period. Shortage of liquidity is never a good thing.
