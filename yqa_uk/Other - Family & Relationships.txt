Would you give shared care in my situation?



My daughter is 8 years old. She has been living with me for 6 years. The father now wants shared care after all this time. She also lives with her 2 1/2 brothers. The father and I have just gone through divorce and going through mediation. The father and myself do not have a good relationship very hostile and lack of communication. My daughter is coming back from contact distressed, sleeping difficulties, tells me stuff the father has told her and discussing care arrangements with her, she is not eating all her meals, she is clingy to me and her behaviour has changed. I simply cannot agree. I feel that she is insecure and anymore contact to her father would not be in her best interests.

sorry hun, this may not be want you to hear but this r'ship is doomed to fail, the age gap is too great, no matter how hard u try it will be too big a problem to overcome...just think when your 30 he will be 48!!! when yr 48 he will be 66, you are just at different stages of yr life.
To find real happiness try to find a partner closer in age, if he is yr babies father then try to keep things amicable tho. good luck!!

It could be the age difference, but that doesn't mean it won't work out, he might feel awkward going out with someone younger because he thinks other people will dislike him for it and call him a pervert, tell him how you feel and that you want him to spend more time with you doing things you want to do as well as what he wants to do, he might be tired and moody because of work or some other number of reasons, ask him about it.

From my own personal experience, I doubt its entirely the age difference.



I've been down that road myself, granted, never with such a gap; only about 6 years maximum for me, but I got a lot of crap too as I'm only in my 20s. You can't place a number, such as age, on love. Now there SHOULD be limits of course! Someone in their mid 20s dating a 12 year old would just be sick =/



You do have to consider things from his standpoint. He has to worry about certain things regarding your parents, your friends, his friends, the law even.



He is also 35, hes pretty much halfway through his life while you're just getting yours started. Hes ready to settle down, and your still ready for the parties that he has apparently had his fill of. Try talking it out with him? Communication is one of the biggest benefits in ANY relationship.

Hey hun. Ok first off WHY are you with this guy? This age gap is far to wide. Two, you are saying you love him. But has or have you notice him saying "I love you too" to you? Because you have not mentioned this & it sounds like he is after sex with the typical "young clean fresh bodied lady". Three. He is very mature and has been through his teen years. So he knows how it is going out, baking cakes etc... But he is getting older so partying modes are not always switched on. & you guys I am assuming had a baby? Girl are you telling me you have missed out on your teen years? I am sorry but this is going to hurt. What possessed you to have a child with someone who is old enough to be your dad in some freakishly weird way?!! & to be honest hun. Yes it is the age gap, and the constant tiredness and moodiness. Look he is way older than you. He is probably moaning for the fact that you are too much for him to handle. And he probably knows this. So he may be missing someone his own age who can relate to him in life etc... Where as you a 17 yr old teen who has no understanding to the meaning of the word "life" It's kind of hard for your partner to relate to you. Because you are still young & want to have fun. Girl give up the old man & have fun why your still young!! Believe me!! You don't want to be missing out on your teen days! Most adults I can tell you would love to turn back the hands of time to when they were a teen or even younger! Because life today is so hard, we want to feel or even have the life where we were not worrying about our lives so much. You let this go. If you love him that much let him go. Do you know this saying? "If you love something let it go, if it comes back it was meant to be. If it doesn't it wasn't." Think about this hun.

what do u mean man? anyways i reckon one of the best indicators a chicks has a crush on u is the way she looks at eg if shes staring etc



umm i reckon eyes do tell a persons future and much more and yeah possibly love, cuz once when i was a kid a old guy just came up to me and mom on the street and told us that i was a really smart kid but i would have troubles and interfereces in my studies when i grow up and that if i perserve i would be able to get a great job. he said that he could tell from my eyes and also that i was smart from my eyes too. well my studies are screwed up for certain reasons and so even though im notfinished with schooling yet i feel that that prediction has come half true already.

I need to know if anyone understands me or has ever felt like this. Ok, there's this guy he's forty. I've seen him ten times. And I'm like totally in love with him but I've never actually talked to him. Then awhile ago I found out he started doing drugs. I feel so bad for him even though i know it's his fault. I've tried to tell people that I really care about him but no one understands. They just tell me to forget about him. But I think about him 24/7. I know he's so amazing. Has anything like this happened to you? Or do you understand me?

You must really really care for this guy since u still like him through his imperfections. I think you should have ur first conversation with him next time you see him. form a friendship is the first step. Maybe he will feel strongly about you as u feel for him. but first you need to talk to him. forget the fact he has started drugs for a moment and worry about your friendship and after you have got that then speak to him about personally stuff. goodluck

Son's girlfriend is cheating on him, he doesn't know?



I can't be the one to tell him because I know it will make him angry at me instead of her, and he probably won't believe me anyway.



He is a freshmen in college, she is a high school senior.  He doesn't go out or do anything except go to classes while he is at college because she doesn't want him to.  He drives home every weekend because seh wants him to.  Basically she has him wrapped around her finger.  I found out from a very reliable source that she is going out with another boy when my son is away.



I don't know what to do.  I am so angry at this girl I don't know if I can act normal around her when he brings her over anymore.  It is going to break his heart when he does find out.  His sister offered to tell him, but I know he won't believe her either.  I think I should just stay out of it but I can't pretend to like this girl when he brings her around.

I am so sorry that you were put in this situation. What I would do is sit them BOTH down at the same time and approach it in a very concerned and gentle way about the rumors you have heard. It is very important that you make no accusations yourself, but simpley state that you have heard some things and you think they should both be aware of what is being said. By talking to them both at the same time, it will show that you are not making accusations, but are concerned about their relationship, which is the truth. I'm sure she will make excuses, etc, etc. But it will show your son that you aren't trying to split them up, which as much as you may want them to, it has to be his choice.



And it will maybe show him that not all is as it appears, maybe open his eyes a little and he can figure out on his own that she's no good for him. Or so you can hope.



But this way, you can have the comfort knowing that he was made aware of it and no matter which way it swings, at least you acted with the best intentions in mind. And it won't make you the bad guy either.



Best of luck!

maybe you should take her to mediation or sit her down and find out if dad has been hostile or abusive towards her.  i went through the same with my sons.  i would suggest all kids go see dad to see if he is the same way with the boys.  please get your daughter to mediation as she will have problems later in life.  if not have her talk to a social worker at school. trust me you will be amazed with the results.  i am.

I want to go out and do things and bake cakes and make a mess sometimes like normal 17 year olds but my boyfriend doesnt wan to join in.



He wants to cuddle up on the sofa and watch what HE wants to watch.
I'm going out tonight and mums having the baby.
The problem is my boyfriend doesnt want to come with me!
I feel like we are drifting apart.
Is the age difference putting a wall between us?
Oh and he is constantly tired and moody and its pushing me away.

sorry hun, this may not be want you to hear but this r'ship is doomed to fail, the age gap is too great, no matter how hard u try it will be too big a problem to overcome...just think when your 30 he will be 48!!! when yr 48 he will be 66, you are just at different stages of yr life.
To find real happiness try to find a partner closer in age, if he is yr babies father then try to keep things amicable tho. good luck!!

It could be the age difference, but that doesn't mean it won't work out, he might feel awkward going out with someone younger because he thinks other people will dislike him for it and call him a pervert, tell him how you feel and that you want him to spend more time with you doing things you want to do as well as what he wants to do, he might be tired and moody because of work or some other number of reasons, ask him about it.

From my own personal experience, I doubt its entirely the age difference.



I've been down that road myself, granted, never with such a gap; only about 6 years maximum for me, but I got a lot of crap too as I'm only in my 20s. You can't place a number, such as age, on love. Now there SHOULD be limits of course! Someone in their mid 20s dating a 12 year old would just be sick =/



You do have to consider things from his standpoint. He has to worry about certain things regarding your parents, your friends, his friends, the law even.



He is also 35, hes pretty much halfway through his life while you're just getting yours started. Hes ready to settle down, and your still ready for the parties that he has apparently had his fill of. Try talking it out with him? Communication is one of the biggest benefits in ANY relationship.

Hey hun. Ok first off WHY are you with this guy? This age gap is far to wide. Two, you are saying you love him. But has or have you notice him saying "I love you too" to you? Because you have not mentioned this & it sounds like he is after sex with the typical "young clean fresh bodied lady". Three. He is very mature and has been through his teen years. So he knows how it is going out, baking cakes etc... But he is getting older so partying modes are not always switched on. & you guys I am assuming had a baby? Girl are you telling me you have missed out on your teen years? I am sorry but this is going to hurt. What possessed you to have a child with someone who is old enough to be your dad in some freakishly weird way?!! & to be honest hun. Yes it is the age gap, and the constant tiredness and moodiness. Look he is way older than you. He is probably moaning for the fact that you are too much for him to handle. And he probably knows this. So he may be missing someone his own age who can relate to him in life etc... Where as you a 17 yr old teen who has no understanding to the meaning of the word "life" It's kind of hard for your partner to relate to you. Because you are still young & want to have fun. Girl give up the old man & have fun why your still young!! Believe me!! You don't want to be missing out on your teen days! Most adults I can tell you would love to turn back the hands of time to when they were a teen or even younger! Because life today is so hard, we want to feel or even have the life where we were not worrying about our lives so much. You let this go. If you love him that much let him go. Do you know this saying? "If you love something let it go, if it comes back it was meant to be. If it doesn't it wasn't." Think about this hun.

It's nothing about age, it's just personalities. You shouldn't worry about age, as long as you get on it's fine. By the sounds of it, you just have alot more of a playful character than him. Arrange a big day out paintballing or something fun and if that doesn't get him happy then talk to him. However old anyone is, everyone has to act like a kid sometimes, it's only natural =]

No body understands because a relationship with an adult requires 2 consenting adults, and you are not one. You are a child no matter how you feel and in that, drug use or not has no relevance.



If he is remotely interested in you, he is a petifile, and is apt to try to molest one of your children if you were to get and stay together, besides, any younger siblings or friends you may have.



It is understandable how a girl your age can be vulnerable to an older man that has frailties, but you need to understand that you are not aware of the long term potential risks you are willing to take for something that is illegal for a reason.



I feel for you and hope that you can find interest in some one closer to your own age, that is not all wrinkled and drugged out. Find happiness, that's what being a kid is for....TO BE A KID!!! Not to be playing adult games with adults.



Life is far to stressful to look for more stress and complication. You need to be focased on school and your future, If by chance this man loves you, then he will respect you enough to stay out of your life until you are 18, and then if you are still interested in him, then it is your choice at that point.



Until then, focas on school, a career and ways to become self sufficient, so that if things don't work out with your creepy love affair, you will have some thing to fall back on to protect yourself.



and please try to spend time in finding things to love and respect yourself more, so that you are not trying to find excuses to date men as old or older as your father.

I think guys don't notice you because you are too shy.Usually when people are like that,they kinda make themselves ""fade'' into the background,even when they don't want and mean to.
Try to be more outgoing,more open towards people..not just to guys but to anyone.The rest will follow...

Your outward beauty might be striking but you are most likely to be less-spirited. Your presence leaves no lasting impression on opposite sex. Work out on your personality development.

Why are you scared? Every female gets their period unfortunately. They'll probably only say, "Good luck" or "It's about time!" And throw you a pad. Don't be scared though, you need to let someone know so that you can learn proper hygiene.

The sky is gray now, but it will surely turn blue and clear one day. Something bad can never remain forever.
It's gloomy today, but who knows what tomorrow might carry?
A shiny sun perhaps that will bright your day.
there, there, everyone got his good and bad days, if today was bad, there will be a good one soon.
So, inhale all these feelings and give out a big sigh which will get them all out.
Look at the sky, and smile, you're alive!

Relationship issue...PLEASE HELP!?



My boyfriend is gradually breaking up with me. I can feel this vibe because he has pretty much ignored me for the past month. He never contacts me at all. No texting, emails, no phone calls. I have to initiate everything. He lives five minutes away! :'( Anyway, this is a question to the boys out there (and if there's a girls opnion)...everytime we do talk, he says he loves he, he adores me, he wants to marry me. He is confusing the hell out of me! Why is he doing this? He is dragging my heart through the mud! And when I say to him if he wants to break of his like "yeah, ok, I guess if you want to..." He NEVER says what he wants...just what he think I'm going to say! We are both 18 (19 very soon) we've been going out for one year, everything was great. This has pretty much came from no where. He is also the first boy I slept with. And at the moment, I'm feeling used and worthless. His just ignoring me like a piece of rubbish! :'( I cant sleep at night,....is this jsut so hard because his my first boyfriend? Please help! thanks

Aww im sorry, I know how you feel im 17 and my boyfriend is 21; weve been dating for 2 years but ive gone thorugh that before. I hate being the one who HAS to initiate things, cause like if i dont he wont either you know?



You should talk to him, I talked to my boyfriend about it and our relationship improved. I told him how I'm more emotional and I like to know that he cares about me. I also said that I like when not only will he tell me he loves me but that he shows me he loves me you know?



So you should definetly put some time aside for a serious discussion but it can also be a really intimate discussion too.



Goodluck!

Yes Maria,Answer is with you. You know pretty well that he is ignoring you.He would never reveal from his heart that he does not need you.
My advise is you too ignore him..Don't ever go behind him...Be calm.
You show him that you are happy with out him...
Why do you want to get hurt more by continuing relationship with him....
If he really love you he will certainly come to you..You can't achieve anything forcibly.He is just playing with you dear. Don't allow him to play with you any more.If he really loves you and wants to marry you he would never ignore you. You yourself know the answer....It is quite hard.But take tough decision to move on in life.

sorry about your situation.  i guess he is just burned out with the relationship.  he may still love you (as what he is telling you) but i guess he needs time for himself too.  he is probably needing sometime to do something like school for example.  give him the space that he wanted and believe me, if he is yours he will come back but if he will not, he is definitely not yours from the very start.

Hels playing you. guys like these need waking up and you dont deserve to be played around. end it and make him realise what a prick he's been acting towards you!...



I know its tough because he's your "first" and maybe thats what the biggest tie you have to him.. First loves are always the most painful, but if there's no way you cn get a decent response out of him of what he wants. then there's no way you can let your heart be messed around with any longer...



If you dont wanna do that. just leave him and go out with friends. once you find other things to do instead of dwelling on him, like spending time with friends for some reason they are aware of it and want to know you every 5 minutes!!!.. its a stupid thing they do!!

Frankly, I think this guy just have a cruah on you (i.e. this is just a puppy love) and when he got what he wants from you, he'll just moved on to the next girl. He does not really loves you. Like you said both of you just 18 years old, there's still plenty of chances out there for you to meet many more guys which is better than him and one who will appreciate you more than him. Moved on with your life now and look ahead. There's plenty more things for you to achive in your future as you are just too young right now. If he really loves you he won't let you feel like terrible about yourself. So, just dump him and have a better life. Good luck ya! :)

This is where men get their bad rep from! i would suggest (and i know its easier said than done) biting the bullet and not contacting him. If you're the one doing all the chasing then stop contacting him and wait to see what his reaction is. I think that will tell you once and for all what he really thinks/feels. Be strong!
i know it sounds like a cliche but i think partly you are takin it to heart so much because he is your first. I was the same and so were many of my friends. the first is the worst as they say.

Ok calm down, first of all stop initiating contact with him, after a few days a week maybe he will contact you mainly cuz he is horny. Ok so he is your first get ready sweetie he wont be your last. You are young and will have alot of boyfriends and maybe a few one hitter quitters. Guys do not associate sex with love like some women do. I am not saying you are easy but most women I know my age mid twentys have had several partners and several relationships and usually a child. Just let him be he will come crawling back like a lost hungry puppy. If he dont, his loss you gotta remember that.

My partner has become quiet and does not seem himself?



He is fairly close to his grandmother, who is currently in hospital with a minor infection, but he sais that it is not bothering him too much, but lately it seems he's closed up with no emotion.



When i ask what's wrong or if I say he's acting diffferently he says "sorry, i dont know im doing it, i haven't noticed"..



We have been together for 5 years, so he shouldn't struggle to tell me anything.



But he isn't interested in sex either. which is NOT like him, usually his sex drive is unreal!! recently he has barely touched me.



What could the possibilities be? I am worried for him, but it is beggining to get me down, wondering if it's something I dont know about, or if there's something he's not telling me, and i can't work it out..



As men, what do you think would be best to get him to talk or to help me find out a bit more?

Have you tried to change him yourself? Sometimes all it is is a bridge between two people. Make sure you aren't changing yourself because of him changing himself, you need to keep up who you are and if he doesn't turn around then, then there is another problem. Did you do something to him or against him behind his back that you don't expect him to know? Maybe someone told him something, maybe HE did something! It's all about communication. Don't threaten to end your relationship or anything but do whatever you can to find out what's wrong. It's good that you care so much. Ask him if you're still beautiful to him and stuff, just asking questions without getting angry or frustrated can usually open a guy up to talking about more, just after talking about a little bit.

Sorry to hear about this, its a really bad feeling 'not knowing'. But after reading your story I believe there is something going on that you don't know about & that you might find upsetting if you found out. What you wrote sounds familiar to me when my partner became distant. Ended up he was chatting to a chick at work via email & sharing our personal problems. It was very upsetting but it did not go beyond that. So don't panic! I would back off for a day or two. See how he reacts, if u r still getting nothing then you will have to make a drastic move. Admit you think something is going on & suggest some time apart because u do not feel close to him. See what he thinks, it may not be what u want (time apart) but at least you'll know & the 'wondering' will stop. Good Luck.

no.. he is not possessed.  He is just not being open with you.  You need to tell him that he's shutting you out, and you never shut him out.  He needs to know that you are part of him, and you've been stressed out due to this odd behavior of his.  Maybe don't call him for a while, or do the same back to him.  Although it sounds juvenile, he will not appreciate the behavior, and most likely tell you.  hopefully he'd talk, then.

Well I am not a guy but it sounds like to me that he is just going through a difficult time. He is down and maybe a little depressed but don't worry he may just need time to figure this out on his own in his head. Just be there and support him and if he wants to talk about it he will, don't ask him what is wrong anymore if he wants to he will tell you but don't worry I am sure you two are fine. He probably doesn't understand it himself. Just be there and let him experience this.

Do you suspect that he might be having an affair and is harboring feelings of guilt?If he did have one,how would you feel if he were to reveal it?Men who think they may be abandoned,embarressed or punished will try hard to keep it secret.You have to first ask yourself if you want to really know the truth and if so,be prepared to handle it.Secondly,you may want to suggest counseling and see what his reaction will be.He may have issues concerning grandma which is possible but I would consult a counselor on my own if he refuses to go to get better insight.I would also insist on him using condoms if he isn't already..Since his desire for sex has waned,you can tell him that you are insecure and feel better using protection.If he sulks or groans about a lack of trust then tell him that he has placed a wall between you in the communication department so you are taking better care of yourself since you feel rejected by his lack of confidence in you.You may want to talk to his friends if things don't improve within a reasonable period of time.

Its good to have parents that allow you to mix around with people of different genders . Seems your parents allows to talk to him ,



Check if : He has good eye contact , body posture , personality , and the way he talks .



If he has all of the characters above .. Go for it , make the first move , who knows he might be waiting for you to make the first move .Ask him out ! You can do it !
I also suggest you tell your parents about it . ( Hope they are very open about it ) Because i do think that Good parents allow a Good Relationship. Good luck .

Help with a job dilemna please!  Serious answers only!!?



Ok I teach Spanish, and next Monday I am starting a new job at a new school, and I have a real problem.  Maybe it wouldn't bother most people but it is REALLY bothering me and I would like to know some possible solutions.



I'm a mixture of Hispanic, British and other things but I got stuck with an all-American last name.  It is Jones. I'm realy proud of having Spanish blood but, every time I tell people that I have Spanish blood (European Spanish from SPAIN) nobody believes me.  I feel ridiculous telling people that because there's no reason for them to believe me.



I HATE being called Ms.Jones.  I'm from Texas, and over there I asked my students to call me (Ms.) Cristina (my first name).  At least it sounds like it could be castellano (Spanish language).  In Texas, people are nice and understanding and it wasn't a problem.  In North Carolina, people are weird and anal retentive and the principal is saying that it's unprofessional to use your first name.  I feel like it's my name and I shouldn't have to ask permission to use it.



Maybe it wouldn't bother most people, but I have always been ashamed to be part Welsh.  No offense to anyone but Wales is the least sexy country on earth and Jones is the unsexiest last name I can  imagine...  Ms.Jones doesn't exctly bespeak "sexy latin chick."



What should I do???? Every time someone introduces me as Ms Jones, I just CRINGE!!!
I dont think I can bear to hear it for an entire school year,  it's already driving me crazy.



I hate for the kids to call me that... I want a sexy Spanish last name.
I got in trouble at A different school because I picked out a name I wanted to be called.



I would like to be called Miss Lopez or Miss Fernmandez or something decent.



I am SO MISERABLE!



I want a classy, sexy name so badly.  I hate having a name that conjures up images of some redneck in a mummu that says preemum instead of premium.  If I had a sexy British name like St.Gallimore, it wouldn't be so bad, but Jones sounds like some uneducated peasant.



I want to sound like the Spanish girl I am!



I need help!!!! What are the students gonna call me?
I HATE being called Ms.jhones??



HELP I AM GOING CRAZY!!!

Is she using me?? Help please!!!?



OK, the homecoming dance is tonight..I'm taking some girl that I somewhat know. She's in 8th grade n i'm a freshman but middle schoolers can't go, but I have people in high places to get her in.



For example. She wasn't at the game last night, so I text her and no response. But If I text her saying I like you a lot we should have fun etc etc then she does text back usually.



So my question is, should I be worried if she doesn't text back 100% of the time? ( Sounds obsessive and sad I know and  never had a GF so cut me some slack!)



Also guys have treated her like **** many of my friends dated her just for looks and sex...she doesn't show it but maybe she's afraid I will do that? She's always happy and smiling..



Anyway thanks

Don't get upset that she doesn't respond back right away or at all at times... She could be busy or you could've sent her an opened ended text...  But, if you ARE worried about it, ask her...  And prove to her that you are not one of your macho friends either... She could be having doubts because when she sees you, she may see all your friends that hurt her..  Be careful, talk to her, find out what is going on...  Communication is always key...

Don't get upset maybe she might feel that you only want her for sex because your friends did that to her.
You could call her and ask her to go with you to a cafe and chat to her and tell her how you really feel about her.
Also tell her your ot in just for the sex and you want a relationship that could last more than just hours

I don't understand what he means, does he mean you are too clingy or possessive?  If I understand this, he may mean you need to focus more on your life with your friends and family and not be so into him.  Sit down and actually have him explain what he wants out of this relationship.

remind yourself of how you were when you first met and started dating.  try not to revolve your life around the relationship.  be devoted and loyal, but dont' become so completely  absorbed in the relationship itself that you forget why you're in the relationship in the first place and most importantly, who you are as a person.

I am currently with my fiancee who i now have an 8 week little girl with, and i met him on the net. In a chat room!



Make sure you know who you are speaking to, you see them on cam frequently, talk on the phone maybe, and dont meet straight away!! Make sure you have an ongoing conversation to get to know each other for at least a few months even better would be a year! That way you get to know each other better, then when you do meet, you will have a stronger connection! And always remember to meet in a public place, where your in sight.

Wow that is deep, look you got a boy not a man who is a controlling prick and does not care what you think or what is best for the baby. The fact that he is a father (notice I did not say a dad) has not sunk into his pea brain. It also depends on what you are talking about him doing, is it going to the bars, sporting events, out with the guys. or is it buying expensive ****.

He asks you so that he can feel like he is doing he right
thing, even though he is not going to consider your opinion
regarding the matter.



It sounds like communication has completely broken
down between the two of you.



He appears to be self-absorbed.



I am very surprised that there were no signs of this type of
behavior before you had a child with him.



It is time for you to start living.



You need to find your autonomy, before he sucks the life
out of you with his behavior.



You are your own person and can make your own decisions
without his approval/disapproval.



You need to demonstrate to him that your life is going to
move forward regardless of the decisions that he makes.



If his priorities involve partying before family, than you need



to make sure that your priorities demonstrate otherwise.



You can put the child in daycare or get a sitter whether he



likes it or not.



You can go back to school, and you can start working.



He does not have to like it, but he has to live with it.



If he tries to leave you, then you know the answer as to
whether or not he wants to be in the relationship.



His excuses are his own.



Do what is right for you and the child.

Just tell her. If she doesn't understand then avoid her at all costs. Maybe you should tell your girlfriend, too, just in case she finds out through other channels.

Tell her you have a girlfriend, are not interested in her and want her to stop calling you.  Ask your girlfriend if she knows the girl who stared at the bathroom door. Explain to your girl whats happening, don't know how she got your number and has texted you. Don't tell her shes offering sex or anything like that, just that the girl texted asking you to go out with her. Tell her that you're mentioning it in case the girl tries to start some mess with her, don't want her saying or approaching anyone. Assure your girl that you love her and will handle it even if it means changing your cell number.

Why is she stalking/harassing me, how do I get her to stop?



I had a 'best friend', until her attention starved love for drama ended it and she stabbed me int he back. Now she stalks me through the internet constantly. Every account I get to a new site, what would you know- she gets one too, just to keep an eye one me?! She goes as far as to stalking me on Gaia and posting in the same threads I do just to get me to notice her... I'd say the most outrageous thing she's done is used someone else's facebook and myspace account to spy on mine. I gently threatened her with police action twice when she attempted to contact me, but it doesn't seem to deter her.



What can I do to get her to move on already? I'm tired of my life being her personal television show, and she's not benefitting from it either. Can't we just end this for both our own goods?

I am having the same problem. Not as bad, but a particular person keeps finding me after I made it clear I was finished with the childish friendship. Keep your profiles private and use a different name. This will really bug her considering it would be impossible to find you again.

go get a restraining order, that way, if she violates it, they can actually take action against her.  the laws for restraining orders are different for just about all states, so you may just want to call the police station and tell them what is going on, ask if there is anything that you can do and they will let you know for sure if you can even file an order.

USPS Workers-Can You Drop Off Prepaid Packages in Bulk Somewhere?



Hello,



I purchase and print shipping labels for packages online via Paypal for my small online retail business. I usually take them to my local post office and wait in line to hand them to a clerk, who then just says, "Okay thanks."



Recently I have several large packages, and several orders per day. I do not want to have to continually make several trips to bring in large and medium sized boxes, when they are all prepaid anyways. My local PO don't have an automated postal center dropoff, however, my packages are too large to fit anyways.



So my question is this: Is there some way I can drop off prepaid packages quickly and easily?? How does a big business do this like amazon.com? I sometimes have too many packages or too large packages for pickup or to wait in line.



I noticed that they have a big dock in the back, but it looks like it is for incoming trucks, and not for dropping off.



Thanks so much for your help in advance-I really appreciate it!

guys are not so good at the romanticy things. my boyfriend has NEVER done anything romantic for me either, but i know he would never cheat on me, i know that he loves me,.. can't you tell by certain looks sometimes, that he adores you?...



jus because he doesn't bring home chocolates, or light up a few candles at dinner, doesn't mean he doesn't love you. although it may seem he is taking you for granted. drop a few hints to him "Would be lovely and special if i had flowers delivered, my favourite's are......"



Even if he doesn't deliver flowers, bring up the convo again and subtly say "guess what my favourite flowers are..." it sounds juvenile, but if he guesses right, it means he's listened to you... which is half the battle with a guy, and he must genuinley love you... !!!! hahaa

Love is always best shown rather than said (although of course it's good to hear it too).



It doesn't mean he doesn't love you, perhaps he's just not that romantic. As you have discovered, it's different when you live with someone. However there does need to be a balance between who's doing the giving and who's doing the taking in relationships... and no it's not selfish for you to want him to show you how much he loves you.  It's only been a month, so I would give him a little more time. Maybe he just doesn't know how to show you.



Drop him some hints - when someone does something really nice say on telly, point out 'ah isn't that just so lovely, I'd love it if you did anything like that for me' !! It's a bit sharp but you know guys, they often need to be hit over the head with the bleedin obvious!

Just because he's not romantic doesn't mean doesn't care.  Some men just aren't romantics.  There's a difference between being romantic and being in love.  I think he loves you since you live together and he says it; he just isn't the poem-writing, flower pedal trail leaving kind of man.



I think you should stay with him.  At the end of the day you both love each other and that's the most important thing.  If you need romance, than he's not the man for you but if you want a man to love you, you already have that.

How can I get over this and stop feeling so broody?



I have two fantastic daughters, but I am desperate for another baby.



Its awfull it has become an obsession. My husband dosen't want anymore, and while I understand thats his choice it hurts so much.



I have been feeling like this for about a year now and its just getting worse. I feel so sad, I feel like im going to explode sometimes.



I've tried ignoring it but it dosen't work. I know there is no rational reason for me to feel this way, I just wish I knew how to stop it.



Anyone got any ideas on how to stop feeling broody?

Can someone love there babys mom more then they love you?



me and my husband have been married now for 7 months! our relationship seems great but he has a child from another female. he tells me all the time he doesnt love her he doesnt love anyone but me! He says if I wanted to be with her or anyone else I wouldnt have married you. i dont know im sorta jealous of her in a way because his family kinda kiss up to her because she throws in there face that if they dont she wont let them see the child. Sometimes I feel like im on the back burner like she is always gonna be better then me because my doctor isnt forsure if i can have kids yet. I guess its nothing i just worry to much and think to hard about things. like on his babys moms myspace page when they were together he sent her sweet comments all the time but he never does that for me but then again he was in high school. I get soo depressed thinking that maybe deep in his heart he is in love with her. please help!!??

We’ve been best friends for nearly 10 years, we grew up together and we’ve always been inseparable, we’ve had some tough times but come out stronger for it – but just the other day my best friend came out and told me he was black! I mean I had always suspected it and maybe deep down I even knew, but now I just feel different – I don’t want to throw away 10 years of friendship, I wish he’d never told me.

why would you feel different if he was black you liked him as a friend for the past 10 years and just because he's black it doesn't change anything. I can't believe you are even saying this it doesn't really matter what his ethnicity is.

This is a difficult one.



It's a very difficult time when some one comes out to his friends and family as being 'black', you have to remember that he's still the same person that you've always known and as a friend, you should be there to support him.



I understand how your feeling completely, just the other week my best mate told me he was a Scot.
Unlike you, i had no choice but to get rid of him.

Sorry, this may not be the awnser to your question but what do you mean by "what should i do"?
You are making it sound as if your friend being black is a problem?
And also, how could you not know that your friend is black? i dont understand what you mean? You always suspected that your friend was black?

I don't understand why it should affect your friendship. Friendship is beyond these simplistic things, so if you think that it's going to affect your friendship, you might have to think over whether both of you were ever friends at all.



Of course, knowing something like this might change things a little bit, but definitely it cannot change drastically.

I need advise on my relationship please.?



My fiancee and i have been together now for15 months. We got engaged in august. we live together.
I work full time and sometimes on weekends, and im doing a degree and in my final year.
She is also in her final year at university and will do her masters degree next year.
The thing is, that she suffers from depression and had to give her part time job up in August, and i supported her with this and agreed it was making her worse and very stressed.
She receives a student loan, and does contribute to things like shopping and stuff.But im the main bread winner, and sometimes find it hard to work every weekend as i get stressed and need to do my uni work too. I had to have a couple of weeks off due to stress, and got given antidepressants. We have started to argue as during the day she studies and does the washing up, but when i come home, there is still loads of chores to be done, and food shopping, i cook every night, and do most of the housework. All this is really stressing me out, we love eachother very much and would never split up, but i dont think its fair for her not to work, and put all the pressure on me.
Im a being unreasonble and a bully? i know she cant help being depressed and cant cope with work, and say its ok, but then, especially if ive had a few beers i start an argument about all this.
Shes gone to uni today without saying goodbye as we argued last night about it all.
Any advise.

Well firstly talk about it calmly and see how she feels about it and tell her how you feel. You could make a chores list and separate them between you. Say you understand her depression but you need her to help you as much as you help her.

First off congrats on better yourselves!!!
I truly think that she should be caring a bit more of the home weight. I don't see why you are the only cook in the home. If she cant cook maybe to start off getting her to help you with little things and simple dinners. As for cleaning if she is home she should do it. It really takes no time. I too go to school and my boyfriend works and pays the bills. We have things that we just do. I am home more so I do laundry and cleaning the house. He does the dishes. and as for cooking we have our days but if we get lazy there is always a roasted chicken from the grocery store for 8 bucks lol. If the laundry or dishes build up no one really complains we just work around it. Like today he had one last pair of socks and they where multicolored so he came up to me and laughed saying look what you made me wear hahaha. We don't take it personally. Now if the dishes get moldy or we have to wear PJ's to work we are aloud to complain hehe. I know its stressful ( I also have a 7 year old daughter) so life gets a little busy and can cause us to freak out over little things but I think the best thing to do is sort out who carries what responsibilities and how you can help each other.
I commend your strength in your relationship and wish you all the best. Depression can simply be a confusing problem but you can beat it with perseverance.
All the best!

You need to talk to her.  Be calm and don't allow yourself to blow up. You will get farther with sugar than spice.  Alcohol is dangerous when your already upset.  You need to take it easy as well.  Your working hard but I don't think she realizes that she is being that difficult.  Depression makes you very tired and none enthusiastic. Keep that in mind.  Good luck to you.  Love is hard to find and sometimes can be difficult but do give it a chance, but don't allow yourself to live a life of unhappiness and possibly follow in the same steps as your fiancee.  Your still young and need to review things closely! P.S me and my hubby never leave without saying good-bye no matter how much we might be angry.  You never know when something might happen and you'll never forgive yourself for not saying good-bye....sometimes it actually breaks the ice and we are fine after.

What is she depressed about? Since you got engaged in August, all of a sudden she's depressed and has to quit her job. It sounds like she's got you hooked now so she does'nt have to do anything. I think you have to ask yourself if this is a onesided love affair or maybe you two just LIKE each other very much. Maybe it's the engagement part that she's stressed out about. If you broke off the engagement, would anything change or remain status quo?

Are you talking about marriage or long term?



If so, then living together may be a good choice and just say that you know you are going to further your relationship so it makes sense just to be together.



However dont get in a situation where you have to depend on him. Have your own money...Your own things...I mean share on utilities/groceries that stuff, but in the event that you break up for have to leave....You will be able to without having to ask anything from him.



Also keep in mind living together may seem super fun and exciting right now, but things sometimes change when people live together...So as long as you are prepared to deal with all this..Go for it and Best of luck!

Should I wait untill after christmas to tell my girlfriend I have been cheating on her?



The scenario, I have been going out with my girlfriend nearly nine years, we met and had the accidental happening of pregnancy 2 months into the relationship. Over the years we have had our ups and downs and could've broke up any time only the fact we had a child together which has certainly been the anchor or saving grace for why we've lasted so long. She says she loves me and to an extent I love her too, but our releationship is dull and we practically live seperate lives in the same house, she stays in one room and me in the other. 8 weeks ago on a staff night out I kissed a girl (18, I'm 31 btw) and while we decided that this would never happen again because of my situation with me having a missus and a kid but as things turned out we did start to see each other again. This new girl says she loves me and I love her and I feel this girl is right for me because we get on extremely well unlike the forced situation like my current one where pregnancy happened early and we didn't get to spend much time prior to that getting to know one another unable to make the choice of wanting to spend a lifetime together because it was right instead we tried to do the "right" thing for the kid. We have a mortgage together, my girlfriends home town is 30 miles from here, I don't drive either so things could be extremely hard for me if seperation took place, not getting close access to my kid. I want to give full support for my soon to be ex and child. I want to come clean and bring this situation out into the open rather than sneaking around, I know my current girlfriend will be extremely hurt by it but at the same time I don't think we are right for each other. Should I tell her asap or wait untill after christmas to keep this time of year as happy as possible and not ruin the festive season for my kid or current missus?



Another note to mention is that the 18 year old I'm seeing isn't about sex because we haven't done it yet. I don't feel like I'm a low-life because life isn't so black and white and you can't plan relationships in this way, sometimes these things happen and a new love has intervened in my life.



</question>



<additional details>



this is the thing, I understand this new relationship might not be a lifetime gaurantee but also the fact that the relationship with my current woman despite if there was no cheating, there's no real love there, it's a uniform relation spearheaded by keeping it together for the kid. I want to be full supportive with the missus and my kid after the breakup.



Gotta appreciate all the stereotypical hate mail, name calling answers. U look on this situation like it was a cliche when every person is an individual, every relationship is unique. Thanks for looking on this like it was a statistic, when my sincerity is to make things work after the break up



I'm not married btw, i don't participate into this idea of marriage which spewed out of humans invention of religions, gods - imaginary men in the sky etc

18? - and you're 31?  the chances of that actually working out are extremely slim...



i'd wait until after the holidays - so as to not upset your child's christmas.  besides which, in the meantime, you just may have a change of heart, and decide that this 18yr old isn't right for you after all.

Ok first of all pregnancy is never a reason to stay you can still make it work just realize that u need to be sensitive to her cuz one of a mothers biggest fears are being a single parent be there for your child and take care of your responsibilities...



What I don't get is a man at the age of 31 how can u claim to love someone in just a short time. Maybe it is just the excitement of something new your feeling but I doubt it is love...Tell the girl you are with now that you no longer wish to be togheter because u have found someone new let her now you will still be there for you child if u chose to do so then let her know ur a piece of **** for allowing another female to kiss u and ur enjoying it and taking it to a whole nother cheating level ur going to crush her but she will get over it and become a stronger person

unfortuantley the chances are if u leave her n go with the other girl u will regret it masively.  of course u will get on with this young girl she appears to be everythin ur missing but it will not last and eventually u will be on ur own.  if ur relationship is over y are u still together?  why not agree to stop seeing eather other (u n the girl) for say til january and give it one last big attempt at working out your marriage and your child.  if it doesnt work fine, but u owe her and ur child a chance

Don't wait till after Christmas.If you do,Christmas will come and go and another thing like her/your/your child's birthday will stop you from telling her.
I know its hard cos I've been there but it WILL get batter I promise.
Tell her you no longer feel you want to be in a relationship with her and that you still love her but you are no-longer IN love with her.Tell her it's time you moved on from the relationship.Tell her that you have been looking elsewhere and that this is worrying you.You don't have to mention that you have found someone.Just say you want to start another relationship and are therefore ending this one first.You have only kissed this other girl so stay quiet for now until you end this relationship.I fshe finds out you have another girl (younger too) she may make it hard for you to see your child so say nothing for now.
Good luck I hope it all works out for you.
Don't feel bad....you only fell in Love and thats great.

well...... you are not happy that is for sure. what about your wife? is she happy. I will tell you this,it took two to get her pregnant and now you have a child. that child deserves a Mother and Father and didn't ask to be born. your 18 year old, lets think about this for a second.. she is with you and knows you are married and still finds it ok to be with you, what makes you think she wont heat on you later. sometimes you have to look at what you have and realise how lucky you are. you have someone who loves you and a child... make sure this is what you want before you brake two peoples hearts and if this is what you are going to do at least have the decency to ell her now.

You clearly haven't tried hard enough to do the 'right' thing!
It sounds to me like you have a very selfish perspective on you and your current partners situation, you weren't the only one that has missed out on the early stages of a new relationship you girlfriend and mother of your children did too! And yet you seem very determined to try and re-live your youth.



However like you say these things happen, I suggest you tell your partner straight away, it would be extremely unfair to string her along any longer. It is down to the pair of you to make sure it doesn't ruin your children's xmas.



Before you do I would ask yourself if you are 100% prepared to sacrifice what you have now for the 18 year old girl you are currently seeing. You will have to be certain that it is a love that will last (besides 18 years old is very young - how do you know she won't get bored of you?)
Your partner has every right to move back to her home town with the children the fact that you don't drive IS YOUR PROBLEM. You can't have it both ways, your new girlfriend and your family on your doorstep.



Be a man and do the right thing by being honest straight away - you can still make the split amicable.

Hi.



I was recently in a 7½ year long relationship, which unlike yours was not partly because a child.



I think it's normal that you in long relationships feel like everyday is the same, and nothing seems interesting, that's when a new and very exciting person can seen like too good to be true, and it's easy to paint up an illusion about this other person just because your everyday life with your partner is everything but exiting.



I think it's good that you havn't done anything drastic yet like having sex with the new girl... but I think the age difference between you is a problem, because an 18-year old has a 13 year gap of life experience and lives a completely different life and has another lifestyle than you. Yet, I don't want to judge you two, without knowing you. Do you have much in common with her?



I don't think a child is a good reason to stay together. But if you look at your present girl, is she wonderful, do you deeply inside love her? What would life really be like without her by your side? Can you give up the thought of a future with her?
I think you should talk to her about how your feelings for her has decreased - but I really don't think it's a good idea to tell her about the new young girl - don't say a word to her about the new girl, that won't do any good! Just try to talk about the problems in your relationship, and make her realize them - then it will be more clear to her that a break up might be necessary. But don't say that you've met someone new! That will only really hurt her feelings! Try to be as nice and friendly with your present girlfriend while talking about your relationship - and don't make her feel guilty about the way things have turned out - both of you are guilty of that. And tell her that you'd like to remember the 9 years with her as nine wonderful years of your life, that you really thank her for!



I don't see the reason with waiting, I mean, I think your present girlfriend knows that something wrong... don't drag on it, do it now, and by christmas she will be surounded be family and people that loves her.



Good luck!

Your reason for wanting to end your relationship is completely understandable.  A child is NO reason to continue a relationship with someone.  Two people will raise a happier child if they are genuinely happy themselves even if that means they are in 2 different relationships.  You need PUT your child first meaning also putting the child's mother first instead of your own desires.  Every time you lie you are digging a deeper hole and when you finally decide to show yourself it's going to be even harder to make things right the deeper that hole is.  The last thing you want is your child to see you as a coward...believe me.  The quicker you tell her this the quicker she can be happy too...not just you.



Please use your heart.  I'm a 20 year old woman who decided at 11 to cut of all ties with my father.  I was 8 when I found out he had been cheating on my mother and after seeing her hurt that much I never could forgive him....and never ever will.

Have you really tried to make the relationship work with your girlfriend before dumping her for an 18 year old?  This new 'relationship' is very unlikely to last, so be certain that your current girlfriend is not for you, not least for the sake of your child ,  I think you're using this girl as an excuse to leave a relationship you don't want to be in.  You can't possibly love her or know she is right for you at this stage.



Take a good long look at your life and think about what you want to do, then act on it, being as kind and loving as you can, especially to your child.  Don't wait until after christmas, bite the bullet.  But make sure if you do leave your girlfriend you ENSURE that you father your child properly and provide for him/her and see him/her regularly.  Be mindful of your child's feelings above your own,a nd do all you can to maintain a good graceful relationship with your ex.



Wait until you've left one relationship before starting another, it's only decent.

Ladies why is she being nice when I know she has a boyfriend?



I dated a woman for 3 months i am 28 she is 26 and a single mom, We have been broken up for 2 months now. I have been in the Army for 9 years. I recently got in trouble at work and have 10 days of extra duty left. Last week she came to base, picked up my laundry and returned it to me two days later. Then last friday she sent me a txt saying "whats wrong with dating someone like me" Also one day last week she called me three times after I found out that she was back together with her old Boyfriend. Last night she called me to ask if I needed my laundry done and also said to put together a list of what I need as she is going to go to Walmart and get the items for me. I am confused. She is back with her last boyfriend prior to me who is a drunk and abusive so why is she offering to help me with stuff.



I do really care for her, she told me not to react to what I was told about her being back with her old Boyfriend which confused me more as I am not sure what she ment by that. I have been on a few dates and always find myself thinking of her. She has alot of my things and every time we would arrange to meet to exchange these things she would not show up like she wanted to keep holding the stuff to keep me contacting her. I have keys to her house and just recently she asked for them but I took them off my chain and they are at my place and I am restricted to base. I would kill to be with her again.

CAN I HOOK UP WITH ANOTHER GUY?? OR SHOULD I HAVE TO WAIT?



Im 18 and my boyfriend is 22.  We've been dating 2 1/2 years exclusively.  I am not a cheater at all and would NEVER cheat.  I am very outgoing and have a lot of friends at work.. some are guys.  One has liked me for over a year but we NEVER hung out. he respects that I had a boyfriend. My boyfriend and I never argued for over the first year.
My boyfriend and I have been arguing over stupid little things for about six months now.  I think it's just the stress of school, work, family etc.



We argued over him not going to a friend of mines party on sat., and it tumbled into me not going to his grandmas...stupid stuff again.  He last said monday "I need a break.  Don't expect a call or text for a few days.. "  I have not heard from him other than one text an hour after it happened saying "I didn't want us to end this way." but we never talked after that.  We never broke up in 2 1/2 years so i'm confused.



Here's the question.  I saw this guy at work last nite and he asked if I wanted to go out to eat tonight. What if he wants to hook up too which I am sure he will. Am I free to do this??? what the hell does "I need a break" mean.  Am I single or not?

alright, i know how tough it can be to have the one you love act like this. as soon as my girl found out she had to go to boarding school, she started drinking heavily and i became aware of her new accessories: wristbands. i convinced her to move them away, and there were huge cuts all up her forearm.



i was never a smoker before that, but in order to help her, i began smoking cigarettes and i convinced her to try them. they seriously helped out with her depression, and cut back her drinking. i know smoking may seem gross, and it is, but if it is safer for her than alcohol, you should consider it.



also, tell her that you love her no matter what happens, and you will always be there for her. spend as much time with her as you can and make sure she understands that you are there to help.



i hope everything goes well for you, and if you get a chance, could you answer MY question?

Well it doesn't annoy me as such, no, because like Sam Q said it's most likely people who's first languages aren't english.



But I have to admit I'm less inclined to answer a question when it is in broken english; for some reason it just seems even more impersonal than it already is answering questions online!

Ladies why is she being nice when I know she has a boyfriend?



I dated a woman for 3 months i am 28 she is 26 and a single mom, We have been broken up for 2 months now. I have been in the Army for 9 years. I recently got in trouble at work and have 10 days of extra duty left. Last week she came to base, picked up my laundry and returned it to me two days later. Then last friday she sent me a txt saying "whats wrong with dating someone like me" Also one day last week she called me three times after I found out that she was back together with her old Boyfriend. Last night she called me to ask if I needed my laundry done and also said to put together a list of what I need as she is going to go to Walmart and get the items for me. I am confused. She is back with her last boyfriend prior to me who is a drunk and abusive so why is she offering to help me with stuff.



I do really care for her, she told me not to react to what I was told about her being back with her old Boyfriend which confused me more as I am not sure what she ment by that. I have been on a few dates and always find myself thinking of her. She has alot of my things and every time we would arrange to meet to exchange these things she would not show up like she wanted to keep holding the stuff to keep me contacting her. I have keys to her house and just recently she asked for them but I took them off my chain and they are at my place and I am restricted to base. I would kill to be with her again.

She sounds like a "I want to have my cake and eat it too" kind of person.  She wants you and her current boyfriend.



This is a dangerous kind of woman because she makes you want to "kill to be with her again" and she probably should be with you but for some unknown reason, won't be with you.  She'll lead you on and lead you on and lead you on but you'll never get her.



I haven't been in your exact situation but I've been in your situation.  Some women just need the attention and need to know they could be with you if they wanted to (and probably do care) but won't ever really be with you when it comes down to it.

She is confused too. You mention all the things she does that shows she too cares about you BUT you fail to mention why you broke up. She may care about you but possibly whatever it was that caused the break-up hasn't been changed?Keep communication open with her, theres nothing wrong with having female friends and her help is good for you to have. Everyone likes to be cared about. Just find out or think about what broke you guys up and see what that beings you. Don't think you have to either be with her not nothing there is a middle ground and at the moment that's where you are.

I'd be shocked if a teacher mentioned porn in a class, also.  I think they are just teasing you.  They probably think it highly unlikely you are "bad" so are being ironic.  It's ok.  You can either joke back or tell them it's not funny.

I have never been in similar situation and I feel like I need clearance on some things.  ?



I've always been honest about my past.  One night my boyfriend asked if I ever had a threesome and I told him about the time I had sex with my best friend and her boyfriend walked in on us (we continued to have sex but he never joined and wasn't sitting there and starring at us).  My boyfriend flipped out and called me a **** and whore.  Even though he actually had a threesome in the past, he thinks that I'm a **** for doing what I've done. I know better than to listen to it, but I just wanted to see if many people see things this way also.  He thinks of me as a **** because he says that what you do in the past, shapes who you are. He flipped out on me that night and treated me in a way I would never treat anybody.  I guess my question is: do you see his behavior as normal (he said that I hurt him so much because he fell in love with me and I ended up being a ****) and if you had found out something like that, how would you react? To me everybody mistakes and if he can't deal with something I did one time in the past, then he's obviously not mature enough to build a strong relationship.  Thank you for any responses.

Do you know the most important thing I read in your question?  YOUR BOYFRIEND THINKS YOU'RE A ****!  And as if that's not enough, he doesn't even WANT to look past what he feels is a mistake... HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO TRY!



How can you be with someone that has no respect for you, calls you names, and thinks you are disgusting?



Don't you have any self-respect?  Find someone who actually cares about you, actually respects you, and actually treats you how you deserve to be treated.

No, his behaviour isn't normal, he asked the question and you gave him an honest answer. It isnt' appropriate for anyone to have one set of rules for what is acceptable "guy" actions and another for "girl" actions. You should have turned the tables on him when he confessed to his own threesome and reacted the same way he did. If I asked my husband or anyone else for that matter whether they'd had a threesome I would respect any answer they gave me. It's not like a person knows their whole life who they are going to wind up spending their adult life with and what you do in the past is what you did in the past. Dump the jerk and find someone respectful who realizes that.

It's always a mistake to ask and answer detailed questions about one's past sex life. He shouldn't have asked if he couldn't handle the answer, and you should have said you don't want to talk about the past, you're with him now. It's really none of his business that this incident occurred.



That being said, your boyfriend is immature because he asked a question, then had a fit when he heard the answer. He may get over it, but so what. He's immature, and I don't know if that's what you want.

Is there anything I have to worry about?



I have been dating the same girl for about 14 months now. She is 2 years older than me. In the past before she met me there was a guy who she kind of had a thing with for a few months, they never actually dated, but hung out a few times, and made out, according to her. This was long before she met me. She now claims (to me) that they arn't really friends and she doesn't like talking to him, and she finds him gross and ugly and would never consider being with him. We both have the same facebook password so we can check it for the other if we want to or the other isn't near a computer but we can let them know over the phone etc. Well I checked hers tonight, and she had a message from this guy. He is quite a few years older than me (about 4 or 5, so 2 or 3 older than her) and in my opinion more attractive than myself, even though she doesn't agree. When I checked hers tonight and she had a message from him, so I read it quick and what they had talked about. She basically just sent him a message this morning about how things are going and how his senior year in college is going for him and how he has been. They chatted for few messages today, and I have to admit I am a little jealous. She initiated the conversation with him by sending him the message this morning, but doesn't send me messages on facebook very often, and hasn't in over a week, yet she started talking to him out of no where today. She says she isn't really friends with him and doesn't like him and won't talk to him if she doesn't have to, and will do anything to avoid it. So why did she message him this morning if she wants nothing to do with him? Why would she be talking to him instead of me, when she barely texted me or contacted me today until I saw her. Do I have anything to be worried about, or am I fretting over nothing? I'm so confused! She has always been honest with me and never tried to hide anything from me but didn't mention anything about this? What do I do, and should I be as jealous as I am? I don't want to confront her just yet and upset her, especially if I have nothing to be worried about, and I don't want her to think I don't trust her at all if I don't have anything to worry about. Please help!

Thanks so much for the help!  This is kind of what I thought but it can be hard not to be jealous sometimes!  Thanks for the responses anyone else have a thought?

Do you ever flirt with a girl just for the sake of flirting?  Just to know you can?  It doesn't mean anything but it raises your confidence.  Sometimes girls do this, too.  You aren't engaged (at least you didn't say you were) and it would be foolish to throw the "little black book" away at this point.  There's always a chance it may be needed at some point.  So, saying hello from time to time should not be a problem as long as it doesn't go any farther than that.  Sometimes these online accounts cause problems because it's so impersonal people don't think of it as flirting.  If it's a problem for you, talk to her about it, but don't be on the offense.  Don't back her into a corner.  Just be matter-of-fact and say you happened to notice.  Keep your tone neutral.

I think if she thought anything of it she would change her password, or delete all the posts that were made. She must really not think there is anything to it if she is leaving it out there in the open knowing that you can go on it whenever. I don't think you should worry just yet!

She says she doesn't like him to spare your feelings and to hide how she really feels about this guy, from you. In fact, all that she swears by and keeps saying to you about him, is the total opposite of what she really thinks and feels. I think she wants to keep in her life but he has moved on.



You need to stop worrying about how she feels or if she will be upset. She is the one causing the confusion therefore worry about solving the matter and about yourself being happy.  You should to talk to her about it.  Tell her how you feel and what you discovered. Explain that communication with this guy is causing problems for you and that it is no longer acceptable to you and your relationship with her. If she becomes defensive and agitated by the discussion, she is hiding something. If she truly values you and the relationship, she will not have a problem talking to you and will honor your request.



Frankly, I think you should distance yourself from this situation and her before you get hurt. Personally, I wouldn't mention it. I would say I'm confused about somethings between us and need some time to sort them out. Again, if she values you and the relationship, she will only give you as much room as she thinks you need.

By truly believing that you are worth something more, and that, whatever your boyfriend says, he will behave in the same way again and again.



You deserve a proper relationship with a decent man who doesn't behave like this. Once you believe that you will find it easier to discontinue the relationship. Get a friend to help you if you can. Tell her everything that has happened and ask her to help you regain your self confidence.



God luck - and remember that you need to be out of this violent relationship because you're worth it!

you need to leave and u need to do it now!!
violent men never change in my experience!
i went through this with a friend not so long ago, and my step-dad used to beat up my mum in front of me when i was a kid( until my dad beat the **** out of him n we never saw him again!!) and it really does affect the whole of ur being!
seeing that when i was a kid made me strong today n no man would get away with lifting a finger to me n i'd be gone!!( just a shame it had to be bad experiences that me that strong person i am today!)
i understand how hard it is too let go but inside u there is the strengh to get through this, if u think he's completely unhinged i would go to ur local woman's refuge where ur guaranteed safety and will meet people who r in the exact situartion u r.
if he's not that psycho then go anywhere u can, family??friends?? but u must get away from him and never go back!
and get an injunction against him, so he can't come near u!
when u realise how good life can be without this fear ur inner strengh will come 10-fold and u will be a much stronger independant woman in ur next relationship!
every journey begins with a 1st step.......do it ,today!!
good luck x

My answer to this question is if you can I would pack up and go somewhere else and find a new place to live. Cut all ties with this man. If you have children to this man I would still leave and start a brand new life. Do not tell this man you are leaving. I would maybe do it discretly and maybe leave your children with your mother or father for a week and say that you need a break and that you are going on a holiday. Use that time to pack everything up and leave. Trust me I have been there. I have just broken free of a relationship from my ex. I have spent the last 5 1/2 years waiting for him to change. I would say we broke up about 5 times in that time. I would not talk to him and I would eventually get back with him and it would start all over again. It was not violent, but he was emotionally, financially abusive. I divorced him this year and I am now up against more abuse through mediation and he is threatening to take me to court. Do not waste anymore of your time on this man and move on. You will find yourself 5 1/2 yeawrs later again with the same **** and nothing changes. Please believe in yourself. Be strong. And think positive and move on.

If you don't break this cycle now, you will always be the victim of abuse.... for your sanity and for your life (and your kitten's), do NOT get back with this man.  If you let this man back into your life, then expect the same... or worse.  One day, he could hurt you really bad... or kill you.  Use you're head !!!!

You should google or listen to people who have suffered with Domestic Violence - this includes verbal abuse. They all say the same thing: "I wish I got out earlier". Every day you let this continue, every day you answer a phone call or text msg to him you are making things worse. This is in your hands, not his. Stop all contact with him & open up to your true friends and family because that is also a way to stay strong. Them knowing will ensure you do not ever go back to that way with him again. You are setting a very bad example for Women out there if you continue. I also HOPE to god there is not a child involved in this.

Give her time and space.  She is hurting right now.  Pressuring her to forgive you isn't going to help...it will just push her away.



Apologize then tell her you will do whatever it takes to regain her trust.



Good luck

Well for starters, if you had felt that you had made a terrible mistake, and it was ONLY once, and you KNEW you'd never do it again, I wouldn't have told her. Just because it causes WAY too much pain onto the person that you love. And by telling them you are justifying your feelings of wrong doings. You are already beating yourself up about it, and now you have your girlfriend beating you up about it too.. and now, not only are you hurting for what you did to her, she is too.



If you did it more than once, and can't see yourself stopping, but want to make it up to your girlfriend, then the only healthy/smart thing that you could do to make things right for HER, would be to leave. And I say this because, we all make mistakes, but you should learn from them. And if you can't learn from your mistake of cheating, then she can find someone better to love her the way that she deserves to be.



If you made the mistake, and told her, then only time can heal this. She is going to be hurt, and disappointed in you. You need to let things pass over. Let her know that you WANT to be with her, and that you made a terrible mistake. It's going to take a while to earn her trust back... but if she's worth it, then eventually things will go back to the way they were....for the most part.



But now that the damage is said and done, be faithful, love her like you never loved another, delete all of the girls numbers in your phone (in front of her), because she needs to know that you don't have any on the side.



Good luck! It's going to be a bumpy road for the next few months...

I don't think quick is in the equation. Get rid of or put away all the mementos of him first. Box them up, hide them in the back of the closet or simply throw them away.
Then go out and do the things you've been wanting to do but have been putting them off. Finish that book, knit that blanket, go see that movie with a friend, go skydiving, learn to ride a motorcycle, whatever. Just get busy and let the healing begin and take it's course. Hang in there, you'll get through this. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. Take Care of Yourself.

What does he want?  His actions are different than his words...?



ok so my boyfriend has said before that he is not ready for kids. he is 23, and I am 20.  Im late and waiting on blood tests to find out if i am preggo.  If I am I will be happy.  He is scared, but this is where it gets confusing,  Since I have been late he has constantly checked on me asking how I feel, am I okay, how am I sleeping, and if I need anything.  He is a sweet guy in general to me, but not this sweet.  Do you think deep down he may actually want me to be preggo and may be too scared to say or too nervous?  Or do you think he is just being sweet about the situation?  Thanks for your advice.

He is scared like shiz about this, but in case you are pregnant he wants you to know that he will be there, he will do the right thing and be a man about it and not leave you hanging. If you are pregnant he will be scared at first, but hen he is goign to be static, excited and sooooo happy that he is going to be a dad.

Well if he is not ready and your ready, its you who has to be respectful and be patient ans use protection. But eventually if he is not decided and you want that in life, then you should find somebody that wants kids as well. You cant impose that on somebody (men or women). However, If he seems sweet and all its because he cares about you and he is anxious to know as well. It is a scary thing to have a baby, especially when you do want one NOW!... Maybe if you are preggo...he will be happy. It can change for the good or bad!....

Hi, I guess he was actually being honest when he stated that he was not ready for children yet.However you are both confronted with the possibility now.As you say he is a real sweet guy and i am very sure he is just frightened.If you are pregnant i have the feeling he will stick by you and be the very best partner and father that he can be.He just probably wants to do the right thing by you.I wish you the very best!

I can never get what I want like for instance I want a car because I wanna leave FL. I hate it so much because its hard. I can't find a job and I'm always broke. But, I had a job then i got fired for a dumb reason. I'm going to school and all. I'm tring to get my Assocaite Degree for I can work in the hospital. But, I feel like no ones taking me seriously because everyone think I'm just a kid don't know any better. They don't know how much it hurts to not be with the person you love. I believe my life would be different if my mom was still here. I feel like my life is falling apart piece by piece.

I'm going to say to you what was said to me and I'm going to be 100% HONEST with you... Life's tough, get a helmet!  Life is tough.  That's what makes EARNING things worth while.



I think your priorities and viewpoints are out of order.  You hate your life because "it's hard", you got fired for "a dumb reason", you're upset about school because everyone thinks you're "just a kid that don't know any better"...I don't see you taking ANY responsibility for anything and I don't see you accepting the world.  I see you complaining.



I know losing your mother was tough (tougher than words can even describe so I won't try) but almost everyone is the world is going to or has lost a parent and the world keeps turning.  I mean, what would your mother say if she say you having this pity party and crying about how tough your life is???  If she was a good mother (which I assume she was), she'd tell you to get off you a** and work for something.  You want everything handed to you but that's not how things work.



Get over yourself, stop being a baby (like when you cry life is too hard), and do something about it!



Source(s):



You're probably just going to thumbs down me and call me an a**hole that doesn't understand  but I can tell you stories that would make you cry and I WORKED for everything I have.  I didn't blame anyone and I didn't cry and I didn't run away.  If you want to spend the rest of your life feeling bad for yourself, that's your choice but don't sit there and expect us to be all "of, your life is so bad. boo-hoo" because it's not.  Life is what you make of it and as of right now, you're making NOTHING of it!

I have survived through similar experiences (I hope this doesn't make me sound old).  At the time the situation was really hard and it didn't seem like anything was going my way.  But then one part of my life improved, some time went by and something else improved, then something else.  In 5 years I have been able to recover from a terrible job situation and the loss of the love of my life.  I now have my own house, make almost triple what I did 5 years ago (people take me more seriously now too after I proved I have skills), and have just started dating someone I think I could marry.  So I guess what I am trying to say is that it only takes one thing going right to turn the whole thing around, you just have to wait for it.  In the mean time, do everything in your power to set your life up for success.  I hope it happens for you.

Sometimes in life it stops being about us and what is best for our kids. Do what you have to for your child. It is not about you anymore. I know I had my son at 18. Keep your head up and remember it will not last forever. Sooner or later you will get to move out and have a place all your own. For now keep your chin up and think about your kid, not yourself.

If your 17 and I am sure he is around the same age then both of you need to get a job and stop asking his parents for money. As far as his sister goes, leave her alone and ignore her when she says mean things to you. You don't want your baby growing up in a hostile enviorment. If it's that bad living there then why don't you move in with your parents? Either way one or both of you need to get a job and support your daughter on your own.

money always causes problems in any relationship. both of you should have a job and both of you should be paying an equal amount. minimize the amount that you spend on things that are not needed and save the rest so you guys can get your own place and not have to relay on his parents oh and ignore his lil sis. or try to you getting angry only feeds her immaturity.

How old is your boyfriend? Is he old enough to get a job? Are either of you in school or working? If neither of you are working or going to school the very first thing you need to do is make a plan. Maybe one of you works while the other goes to college to get a degree. Then, after graduation, you switch. Maybe that plan wont work for you but you do need a plan. A goal to work toward, a prize to aim for so to speak. after you get your plan, you need to make a list of your priorities, in order of most important to least important. Then figure out what you have to do to either make that happen or take care of that (like for instance your daughter). I am sure your daughter is first, right? Everything else can take a back burner until she is fully taken care of and if that means swallowing your pride and living with your inlaws for a while you will just have to, for your daughter. You must always remember that sometimes, to get what you want in life you need to live like a pulper and put up with a lot of crap but, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Just look forward, grin and bare it and always, always keep your eye on the prize. Someday you will have what you want and you will be able to give your daughter a good life. I hope you take my advice, I have been where you are.

You need to make a plan! Write down your goals that you have for you and your small family. After that, start to see that women and men have been doing this for ages, and now it is your turn. Put things into actions. Things are the way they are, because you allow then to be this way. If you want change, then you are gonna have to be the one to do it. Know one is gonna make your life better for you, then you. Think about that!

I'm 25 and I know exactly what you're gong through...minus the daughter.  I went through the same thing when I was 18...living with the boyfriend and mom and dad...it sucked.  Anyways, it really depends on how he treats you.  My relationship started with us fighting about money.  Then, a few months later we started fighting about other things...who's lying, who's cheating, etc.  He started controlling everything I did.  He took my car keys and wouldn't let me leave the house without him.  I couldn't see any of my family or friends because he didn't like them.  I was stupid and did whatever he said cause I cared about him and wanted to make him happy.  Then, one day we got into a huge fight and I don't even remember what it was about because it was so stupid.  He slapped me and that was the end of it.  I know that not all guys are like he was, but you have to keep your eye out for things like this.  If he's an awesome guy and the only problem you're having is money, then you need to sit down and talk calmly to one another about what's going on.  Let him know before you start speaking that you don't want to fight.  If the fighting persists, then you need to get out of there because it's not gonna get any better.  If that baby is his, then he needs to be out working.  You didn't say how old he was, but if he's still in school then he needs to get an after-school job.  If he's not willing to work and take care of his family now, then he never will.  And as far as the little sister goes, smack her around a few times.  Eventually, she'll leave you alone.

I am a hard working single mother of 1 child with a boyfriend that is working over seas. We've discussed the possibility of getting married and starting our own family. While there is always a separation and we only spend about a month w/each other total during the year we have an understanding relationship (sexually) meaning he can get his needs met and I can do the same for mine. Any who. I slept with my child's father and I just found out that I am pregnant. I've told my boyfriend, and the "baby daddy" but now my ex wants me back to "fix" our problem, but I don't want to leave my boyfriend who also said he'll still be here if I have the baby. It's an ugly situation yes however, what should I do?

Confused about a guy/s?



i'm a 14 year old girl. I used to go to primary school with BoyA. He moved to my school a few months back. Everytime i look at him, he looks at me then quickly looks away. Everytime i go near him, he hurries immediately as far away as possible. But he's always looking at me and not in a 'she's a weirdo' way. Does he like me or something? I dont really fancy him much.



BoyB is kinda nerdy but really funny. not my type in looks cos hes blonde, but i could live with that. same taste in music too. However, i think someone else has his eye and she's WAY cuter than me. :( should i bother?



BoyC is cute to me and no one seems to really like him, and hes free. but he never looks at me unless i like just walked through the classroom door or something and he never talks to me either, unless i ask him to help me out with something. we have some things in common, but if hes not interested in me, is there anyway i can get him to?

Please help!!  10 points for best solution!!?



I have a real dilemna at work and I have no one to go to for help.
Probably few people would understand why it's bothering me so much, but it's making my life miserable and driving me crazy.
I have a last name that I absolutely hate, and I have hated it all my 29 years.  I have Spanish blood but I got stuck with an "all-American" last name.  I'm not anti-American, it's just that as a little girl I didn't know I had Spanish blood and no one in my family knows Spanish but me but I became obsessed with latin culture, with learning Spanish and I love latin stuff.
I teach Spanish, and it feels really weird to have a name like "Jones" as a Spanish teacher.  I am really proud that I have Spanish blood but the kids have no way of knowing.  I could tell them but they'll think I'm just making it up.



In the past, I always just had them call me my first name (Cristina) or Ms. Cristina, not my favorite name but at least it's Spanish sounding.  In Texas, my home, it has never been a problem.
well, unfortunately I live in NC now (and very homesick :*( ) and the schools here are anal retentive and the school authorities are giving me a hard time, and saying it's unprofessional tu use my first name.



I HATE it when people call me Ms. Jones, because they won't know I have Spanish ancestry, and it feels weird to be a Spanish teacher named Ms. Jones.  I love latin culture and feel like I should have a Spanish name because I teach spanish, have Spanish ancestry, love latin culture more than us culture.



Every time someone calls me Ms.Jones, I feel like I've been physically stung.  Imagine you have a severe sunburn and someone comes and slaps you on it.  Imagine how that feels... then imagine they do it to you twenty times a day.



I don't want the kids to call me that.  The school authorities are making things difficult by giving me a hard time about my first name.  I tried picking out a Spanish name and going by that but the schools were very mean to me when I did that.



Spanish is who I am.  If I had a CLASSY English name like St.Chamberlain or Gallimore or Stratford I wouldn't be so miserable.  But, Jones sounds common.  Its just not music to my ears.  I want a beautiful last name.



What am I gonna tell the kids Monday??  I don't think I can stand to hear "Ms Jones" all semester, the schools were mean to me when I made up a name and they've given me a hard time about using my first name. I really HATE the name Jones and can't stand to hear it all semester.



Help!!!!!
Please give me some ideas!!!!



Oh yes, nearly forgot to mention that I don't WANT to take a husband's last name if I should marry.
I want a name of my own!  I want my own identity.

If you don't want to take a husband's last name if you marry and you want a name of your own, why not just legally change your name? Come up with a last name you like, that you feel reflects your heritage, and go and get it changed. Then no one in the school board can give you a hard time about it, because it really is your last name. It just takes a little paperwork and a little money, i'm not sure how much it costs, but i don't think it's too much.

I'm sure not everyone is happy with their name.  But one idea is you could research your ancestry and take the name of a spanish family member. That way you still will be using a family name and not just picking some random one to change it to.

I am also going through the process of having a legal name change.  It depends on your county, city, and state.
If you can change it, do it.  No sense being miserable if you can do something about it.

Its been 4 years already, but the craziest thing is that I never really talked to him, just saw him walk me by for 4 months, and then he left (he was an exchange student). when i realised he was gone i got sick for a week.



I got to know his name after a year or so.
It's not infatuation and neither am I a psychopath/stalker, maybe a bit shy, but im pretty down to earth normal girl
I just wish I could see him for one more time and maybe then I could move on..
I think im in love, but then how could u be in love with someone u barely know?

ok me and the ex broke up last weekend b/c he wasnt sure his heart was in it anymore but said he wasnt 100% sure about it. hes been depressed w/his living situation and its confused his outlook on life and even us.



last night he came over to pick his stuff up and told me he loves me and has feelings for me but needs time. can anyone understand this? how can you love someone and have feelings for them but not know your heart is in it? doesnt love + feelings = in love most of the time? or having feelings means your heart IS in it? I know hes not just saying this stuff



he said a month ago he wanted to marry me how can something like that change in a matter of weeks when we werent having problems within those weeks?
im just not gonna speak to him for a while i know he misses me now and will miss me even more and hopefully hell just remember what he told me several times...that he cant live without me

What to do? 1 child/1 boyfriend(overseas)/pregnant by child 1s father/boyfriend aware help with relationship? ?



I am a hard working single mother of 1 child with a boyfriend that is working over seas. We've discussed the possibility of getting married and starting our own family. While there is always a separation and we only spend about a month w/each other total during the year we have an understanding relationship (sexually) meaning he can get his needs met and I can do the same for mine. Any who. I slept with my child's father and I just found out that I am pregnant. I've told my boyfriend, and the "baby daddy" but now my ex wants me back to "fix" our problem, but I don't want to leave my boyfriend who also said he'll still be here if I have the baby. It's an ugly situation yes however, what should I do?

wow...that is tough...



I think ultimately it comes down to what you want and which relationship makes you happy and who you can see a future with...I think that your boyfriend is pretty crazy about you and loves you if he is still willing to work out the relationship, trusting you that these things wont happen again, i mean you do have ties with your ex (because he is the father of your child and soon to be second child).



Think it through and be honest with yourself.

Why do people think I'm stupid?
I'm quiet and shy, and I am a bit awkward. People who don't know me always assume and call me stupid or retarded. But I think I have just as much potential for doing well in school. This one girl said to her friends that I probably don't even know what they're talking about and calls me "dumb ****." If a teacher tells the class that I got the highest grade, people would glare at me with a confused look on their face.



I get called stupid/retarded a lot and people always talk about me as if I'm not even there. How am I behaving in a way that makes people think I'm as dumb as a ? How can I change this?

People don't care about potential... they care about what you do.  If you want people to think you're smart, then you need to give them something to think about.  You've shown them NO reason to think otherwise and while they are wrong for assuming the worst in you, you haven't done anything about it.



I suggest you start studying to get your grades up, participating in class, and being more assertive.  You can do it!

Is the past of a relationship best to be discussed or let go?



In a long relationship is it best to leave the past (during the relationship) alone and move on, or explore the past with your partner.  I'd imagine that discussing the past for a better understanding of your partners actions would be very beneficial in strengthening a relationship.  But Is bringing up the past harmful even if both partners are open to discussing the past?

Well some of them do obviously. I think it's sad if you reduce yourself to being somebody's mum. Don't get me wrong, motherhood is special but there is more to have a fulfilling life.

hi



i am sorry it is over, he just feels bad when he sees or talks to you, and thinks he should say all this stuff to stop you being sad.
but really he should stop saying this stuff,as he is just prolonging the agony.
better to have clean break, he probably got into a tricky situation and thought getting engaged would please you, then realised he couldnt go through with it, which is good, it would be worse if you got married and his heart wasnt in it.
tell him to stop saying these things and just go. and let you get on with your life.

you answered your own question by asking this



how can you love someone and have feelings for them but not know your heart is in it?



the answer lays in that. if there were no issues going on with him then he wouldn't need his time.  he thinks he is doing you a favor by letting you down easy and giving you a sense of hope..

Love is independent of feelings. It is only reliant on actions and experiences. Love is a verb...



"Positive feelings" or emotions only come when the times are great and easy. If his heart is not in it, he may be getting really depressed by things going on in his life, unable to understand them, and is not getting the "comfort" he was hoping for in a relationship.



Comfort can never FULLY be found in other people, though. He needs to know that whether or not he feels close, whatever stress he is feeling, the love both of you have should be evaluated based on how you treat each other and what you do for each other. If your relationship has enough in that area, and a good foundation of communication - it will survive.



In summary, feelings are totally independent of love - they are instead dependent on our happiness/psychology.



If you have the inclination, I suggest studying a Bible to learn more about love. 1 Cor. 13, 1 John 4, etc.

<question>



The guy I cheated on my b/f with a year ago contacted me to tell me he's in love with me?



I have been with my b/f for almost 10 years. A year ago we were having major problems...we were engaged, I was trying to plan our wedding and he didn't want to be bothered and called our wedding day "Doomsday". He broke my heart with things he would say, very insecure, jealous and controlling. I ended up working with this guy who pursued me even though I was engaged and said I deserved better. Eventually after a huge fight with my b/f, I gave in and cheated. My b/f found out and forgave me, but I broke up with him cause I thought he didn't care about me. Very quickly I changed my mind and realized I still loved him, so I broke it off with the other guy. I thought things would be different with my b/f when we worked out our issues, but he's still the same insecure and jealous guy and constantly brings up the past (not just the cheating). The other guy recently contacted me a year later and told me he was in love with me, couldn't get me off his mind, and wanted to be with me. Now I'm torn...I haven't been able to get him off my mind either and I couldn't figure out why. Should I leave my b/f for good and take a chance on what I'm feeling? The other guy isn't jealous or insecure and doesn't want to control my life.

Well do you know the other guy well enough to say he isnt controlling and jealous?



And also, he got cheated on...he may have forgiven you but hes gonna bring it up every now and then...its devestating to him but hell truly move on eventually...he wont be talking about it in 5 yrs still if you're still together.



But if you feel your bf is really not caring for you...leave.

I don't think you got back with your fiance because you still loved him, I think you did it because he was such a constant part of your life, that when you were without him, you felt empty.



So you decided to get back with him to fill that void, even though he's not good for you.



My suggestion is to leave the fiance, make it on your own for a while until you can fill that void on your own and not with another guy, then if you still want to get with the other guy, then do that.

It doesn't sound like either guy is right for you. You should leave based on whether or not you can truly be happy with your fiance, not because there is another guy ready to step into the picture. I think you should leave your relationship and then take a break from dating for awhile.
If the other guy truly loves you, he will understand this and wait. Also, how could he say he loves you after just being together once? And then he waited a year to tell you? That doesn't sound right either.

Well you seem to jump ship pretty easy so i don't think it matters who you are with. When you get bored of the new one just go out and find a new victim. Like buying a car. Get a new one.I'm a firm believer in fixing what you have if the other party is game. If you can make it through this you will be way stronger. But it will take alot of growing up on both your part. Sorry for sounding harsh but i have a distaste for cheaters.

Really, a year later he realizes he loves you?! I think he wants an easy lay becuase he got it before. Maybe you should leave your b/f and save him the cost of a divorce after you get married, because you obviously don't love him or you wouldn't be questioning if you should leave?

Remember back to when you were dating?  Did you call him sometimes just to whisper I love you?  Or wear a skirt with no panties to dinner and neck in the parking lot?  How about making a date night once a month - you go out to dinner and a movie or show afterwards?  Or take a "weekend honeymoon" at a local resort/hotel.  Put notes in his truck/car that say "Have a great day" or "Miss you"  "Love you"  "Hugs and Kisses", anything to let him know you are thinking of him and love him.  When he sits down to watch tv, go sit by his feet and start to rub them.  And sometimes when he comes to bed, warm up some baby oil (not too hot!!!) and give him a massage (put a towel down over the sheets or put on old sheets).  I bet you will see rewards for your efforts!  Greet him at the front door after a hard day at work in nothing but a rain coat (or nothing at all but a bow for a present, strategically placed maybe).  Good luck and God Bless.

Maybe try taking the first step like a romantic evening with some lingerie or something along those lines. He should notice you trying and then its his turn to do something nice for you. Me and my wife are the same way, especially with kids you get caught up in the rat race but you have to stay concious of the relationship to. It's tough. Good luck.

What to do if your ex-girlfriends best friend tells you she is in love with you & sabotaged your relationship?



To make a long story short me and my ex broke up 6 months ago because I received pictures and a DVD of her cheating on me one day at my office. When I confronted her with this evidence she denied it and said she did not know who was lying on her and that the DVD was an old DVD of her and a past fling and she did not know where the pictures of her kissing the guy in the tape came from. A couple days later while I was doing hers and my laundry I found dirty men's boxers that were not mine given that we have our own laundry room and no males outside of me have been to our apartment in the past month and I do laundry every 3 days I just knew something was up with all of the odd calls I got one day when I was sick and suppose to be at work and on the one day I came home early the bed that I make every morning looked like 2 people had been in it and was left unmade. So at this point me and her split cause she couldn't take my accusation and I couldn't deal with her supposed lies and shady behavior. After the split her best friend gets a job at the insurance company next to my office. Since the split me and her have become pretty good friends and have gone to lunch a few times and she even has escorted me to a couple of company functions and have hung with me and my buddies I kind of figured she liked me but I am not trying to go there and make this split even worst on me cause my ex got married and I think she still loved me and me and me and friend would just make her even more mad and hurt her. So today while she was helping me move into my new home and after everybody leaves she ask if she could borrow my shower and change. So changes into this stunning outfit and and kisses me. I tell her how great she looks and I don't know if we should be going there do my recent break up with her friend. She said she understood but I didn't understand all the work she put in to getting us to this point. She then proceeds to tell me she loves me and that she intentially broke me and my ex up because she couldn't let a good man like me go to someone who didn't appreciate me and told me how she did everything and to give her a call after calm down from being mad at her. Do I call her and tell her how mess up she is? Or do I just ignore her and end our friendship? Or do I see where this could lead and then get my payback?

hi,



she is evil.
don't have anything to do with her ( not one single thing) she is too sleazy and instead of getting an opportunity for payback, she might be the one that will do you in. admit it she fooled u and your girlfriend without neither of you getting a hint.
break the relationship dint even be friends with her or she might ruin your future relationships. if she is this obsessed and psycho to do this to her friend what do you think she would do to others if she remains your friend? bail out, NOW but be watchfull she might close in on you to mess you up for rejecting her. your work, house, reputation even your ex might be her next Target. if you notice anything mysteriously getting wrong, could be her on the move.
meanwhile call your ex and appologise, tell her everything so she will beware of her evil supposed friend. she might still be a target in her new life cos her supposed friend is a saddist.

You dont really have to start something by calling her and telling her off, unless you really feel you have to. DONT be friends with her, she sounds crazy. You should maybe apologise to your ex, and maybe tell her what is going on. That can be payback enough, since that girl is supossed to be her friend. Obviously your a good guy, and she is obviously not your type.

Ideas on Non violent revenge?



i would gladly love to solve this problem with violence, (burning of the hair, smashing of the face etc) but seeing as i'm still at school, i would like it to end in something that doesn't get me suspended or expelled..



see my sister has someone taunting her ((her ex)) cause she dropped him and now he's making her school life hell..



also there's a little b*tch who was all over my BF while i was in europe for a month, so i would like to hurt her muchly. but i can not. and he's with her now too =[ so yeah.. any ideas??

best thing to do about your bf is tell him and the other chick they deserve each other and tell her she did you a favour. they won't expect you to say it so it will catch them off guard. if your sister's ex is being a pig (i would of preferred to say worse) then she is better off without him anyway. ignorance is bliss

Sex????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!…



I'm still a teenager,i had sex about a month ago.I was going home with my 4 best friends.We lived in the same street so it was easy to go home together.The,we decided to go get some food and phone our moms to let them know.When we were at a restaurant,we ordered some food.I ordered the least cos i was on a diet.Then,we saw a guy and we all agreed he was cute.When we were about to leave,I was still cleaning my things,i was always last,they said they'd wait for me outside so I agreed.Then,the guy walked up to me and asked for my number,i gave it to him and he asked me on a date and i said yes.When he was picking me up,he brought me to his home.He gave me something to drink and i knew it was beer but drank it anyway.Then,I got drunk and I felt so sleepy! I was wearing a bra with NO shirt,a super short mini with high heels.When i woke up i was on the sofa,i saw the guy naked and i looked at his huge ****,it was huge!i wanted to touch it and i told him.he let me if i had sex with him.so i agreed.we had sex,the next day,we had sex.We kept doing it almost evryday.I loved the feeling.But,a week ago,i was totally drunk at a party and i had sex with my best friend's bf 2 times!!!I'm so scared,what if i'm pregnant!!??

You should have had sex at such a young age .But its your wish and your life .



Sex is something that many people might/will enjoy , it gives pleasure . Having sex might be nice but you also have to be protected .



Instead of having unprotected sex , Use a condom or birth control pills , its the best temporary method . You can also buy flavoured condoms , it does not affect your pleasure but make it more safe .



I suggest you see a doctor , get yourself checked and have a small talk with your so call 'Boyfriends' (No Offence)

Idk what to do every one hates me?



Hi,



I guess everybody hates me, even my Family, i have no friends, but on irc/msn, tho not in real life, and so my Dad had his Girlfriend move in, i told him to date her more but he wouldn't listen to me, cause he's a idiot (I'm more wise than Him) so she has two kids and She lied about her kids. the boy had a mental problem for shi*ing in his pants, I had to tell him to use the bathroom and to make him take his pill when he got off of school, and also He was hiding underwear everywhere with **** in them, and i told Him to change but he didn't even take a shower to clean Himself up, and so He has adhd, the Girl has lice so the family was not clean, once i got to know Her and my Dad he didn't know her more than two weeks , She moved in for like 3 weeks and the Boy had the house stinking like hell (Had to pay people to clean it up And use pure bleach to get rid of the lice and the smell) , and (She said i was a worthless bum and she got jealous cause my Dad got for me all the time). well He found out She left another Man for Him, and He didn't like that, (He's anti cheat) cause my mom cheated on him 5 times, now She lied about the Girl having lice till the school called and he found out She lied about a lot of stuff, then He made Her pack Her stuff and the Kids get moved, so (She called me a worthless deadbea), cause I'm anti socal sometimes, now my Mom left for like a year and my dad said it was part my faught cause i didn't do everything He said and She said but i'm not a slave i got to study,, now my Mom just moved in like 4 days ago and thinking of moving out, so i'm tired of this crap and last night on freaking election day i got sick so i went to sleep i woke up with two bullet holes in the wall out side and inside well found out my Dad got fuc*ing drunk tried to kill Himself my Mom could of went to the pin cause of hIm, but she got the gun before he could hurt Himself, now i think He's gonna go back to dating (Which he probably will get some other trash which hates me move in),  i'm 17 btw i kinda have a learning problem (so sorry for my english) tho i'm only behind 2 years tho it's probably cause i'm about to give up.. and i have 0 friends... so i don't know what to do i want to die but i'm not stupid like my dad to kill my self, i never been drunk or had cig in my mouth even, i never done weed, and so every one at school makes fun of me. idk what to do any more.. i got two more years of schoo.. so i can't move out. and mu dad was about to mary that girl and she probably would of kicked me out, and make my life hell.. so any idea what to do?

your parents problems are there problems. You are not a fault. First off they are two adults and make  there owner decisions. Stop trying to control your parents. They can take care of them selves. seems like you want a perfect family. Well if that is the case i would get educated in any program that you desire.(not your family) focus on school graduate then find a nice man(Christian man) and settle down and make your own perfect family. Stop worrying about people who chose to stay this way. they chose to be miserable. they can change that at any point and given time.  Focus on what make you happy. Respect your parents wishes. One day this will be a distant memory. The only time you will think about this is the time you look back and wonder if you would have actually took control of your life where would you be now. God bless and  I will pray for you.

Wow, I'm sorry. Any hobbies, art, music, sports, etc? If so then really focus on that, if not then try to find one. Go talk to the counselor at school and they can help you, they can even (and probably will if you tell them all of this) get you out of the house into a better environmaent. This is no way to live. I'd say go live with your mom but since you're obviously in your dad's custody, she can't be anything but another piece of crap. Don't give up. Go talk to the counselor or a teacher you trust, even if there's no one at the school you trust, they are legally obligated to help you. Not only that, why do you think they became counselors, to help people.

Wow... Dude you had a harsh life. I feel bad for you. =(



You sound like you been very independent throughout your life. Your responsible and act way older then you should be. Your probably over emotional from all the stress. What i suggest you to do is try to separate yourself from your problems. The stress is probably cover up who you are and is give the body signal to everyone else around you to stay away. Open yourself and just be yourself around people. Drinking and cigs are stupid. Its just peer pressure trying to get you to do stuff you don't wanna do. Even more, be upfront. If they pick on you for not drinking/cigs tell them this-"I don't drink because i don't want to. You got a problem with it?"



Get a job somewhere and meet new people. Start afresh. Don't assume nobody likes you. You just never gave them a chance to like you or not.

I'm really sorry you're going through all of this.  And whatever your parents do is not your fault so don't believe that.  They are adults and if they can't get their lives straightend out then it's stupid to try to blame a 17 yr old.  You seem sensible enough.  Your dad is making stupid decisions.  Do you have any siblings or cousins?  You should really try to finish school though, really try to do that.  I know it's hard not having friends, but don't do stupid things because of that.  Later on in life you will be glad to have made good decisions... otherwise, you don't wanna end up like your dad, right?  You be a good person and when you have kids, be a good dad to them.  The only thing i can tell you now is that God cares and he sees everything.  Ask Him to guide you and to help you.  He will help you and be at your side, but you have to ask Him.  If you let him, he can change your life's course.  Hang on in there and keep the good work up.  I'll pray for you

A decreased sex drive can be due to a ton of reasons. First off having to children takes a lot of time and energy. Who feels sexy and wants to have sex after running around after two kids all day!



In addition - are you under stress or depressed? Stress and depression can also cause a decrease in sexual desire.



Last but not least - you should go and see your physician to discuss this issue. Hormones play a big part in sexual drive and you could have low testosterone - yes woman have testosterone also.



Good luck.

Desire comes and goes. You might find that in months or years it'll come back - and it might not coincide with your partner's level of desire.



Your stress level can affect it as well. If you're stressed out because of a hectic schedule, or perhaps taking care of two kids and dealing with your medical bills stemming from the pregnancies, you're likely to have less interest.



And maybe you're just not as interested in your partner as you were when the first blush of love and lust overcame you. It's to be expected. Your chemical system isn't designed to maintain that high forever.

I am 31 years old with 3 kids. My youngest is 9 and my oldest is 14. All through my 20's, right up to 29 and probably 30 I only had sex with my husband because I thought it was my "duty" as his wife. I really had no desire for sex unless I was drunk which wasn't very often either lol. Now, it's a whole different story, I am the initiator. I am the one who can't go to sleep without at least trying to "get his attention". I have no clue what changed, I think it must be my hormones. I absolutely love sex now and I am so happy that I do. It is such an easy way to give you a little pleasure. It is nice to have something to look forward to at night instead of dread! I hope you will come around as I did, it made a world of difference in our marriage as well.

it's a chemical imbalance along with hormones, you can ask a doctor and they usually can provide a medicine that balances them. But they will balance out over time. Sex is there for exercise, pleasure, and making babies, so you really don't have to do it, unless you want to.

I believe you pinpointed the problem.  There's a connection between your lack of desire and the fact that you have two kids.  Probably your body is way off after your last one.  I would discuss it with your gynecologist who can offer a few suggestions to help return your desire.

Should you love your husband for who he is even if you don't agree with things he does?



My husband is a good man.  He is sweet and gentle.  He works hard at his job and he clearly loves me and his children.  One of the problems I have with him is that he will NOT get up in the morning.  It doesn't matter if he goes to sleep at 12pm or 3am, he still will not get up until it is time for him to go to work.  He works 3:30pm-12.  It is really bothersome because I work first shift and we have two toddler age children and he doesn't get up with them.  They tear the house down while he sleeps plus I feel like its very dangerous for them to be up alone for any period of time.



We argue about the constantly and it is putting a strain on our marriage.  What can I do and is this worth getting out of a marriage over?  They say you can't change people and I don't know if I can live with him doing this.



PS  I also have trouble getting him to help out around the house.

Tea bag can be when you play a prank on someone and a guy puts his balls on someone. Or it can be more of a sexual thing, where a guy puts his balls near a girls mouth and kind of dips them in and she happily goes for it. google it.

Good question... but no real answer really...



People can come up with all sorts of wild theories, but when we come down to base fact... there really isn't way to show life's meaning. Maybe life doesn't have one? If life had meaning, it wouldn't be so easy to take away, right?

OK, I would be peeved about this too if I were you.  You need to talk to him about this if it isn't working for you.  You can love someone but not like things they do, but eventually, this could turn into resentment, and your love for him will disappear.



Before considering getting out of the marriage, talk to him about it and try to get some marriage counselling.  Counselling can be pretty effective if a couple both want to work things out.  People can change their behaviour, but they have to really work at it. It is a lot of hard work, but at the very least, you should give it a try before you start considering getting out.  If he refuses, then he has no respect for your concerns, and he has no intention of changing.  If he accepts, then at least he is prepared to try and sort things out and respects that you have issues with him.  I strongly believe that divorce should never be considered until all avenues have been exhausted.

your sister's boyfriends only liked her for her body too - hence the weekly new one. You could do just as well, but relationships aren't built off of physical attraction alone, and good ones are hard to come by.



So you can either have sex with lots of guys, or one really good friend.

He has left the office now but hes been texting me a lot and I saw him on Saturday for a coffee. Anyway he was being bit more forward than usual I suppose cause hes left the office and feels he can. He was calling me sexy and doing the im gonna stare at u but im not going to take my eyes off u like guys do even when u tell them not to. He was like youre lucky im only looking at your eyes. I also felt him brush his leg up against me quite hard.



I spoke to him online since then and he has said he enjoyed my company on Saturday and we have made plans to do other stuff. I do know its quite wrong and I wouldn’t do anything with him while hes with her. I don’t know what to do I don’t want to cut him out my life.



He hasnt seen his mrs for a good few weeks i know this as hes online tlking to me in the evenings. She asked to go over the one night but he told her not ot. I asked him why he doesnt see much of her but he didnt want to disclose but is asking to do stuff at weekend.

SOMEONE PLEASE GIVE ME INPUT ON BOYFRIEND?



So, awhile back I had snooped through my boyfriend's phone and I found several nasty texts from this girl.  He claims they were from a long time ago and they carried over to his new phone (he had just got a new phone the night before...and I believed this story because the last time I got a new phone for some reason these random really old texts showed up on my new phone), and if you knew him and what a great guy he is (or at least plays it off REALLY well if he's not) then you wouldn't think twice if he tells you something.  Basically I believed him and shrugged it off...deciding to give him the benefit of the doubt.  I haven't looked at his phone ever since because I honestly do trust him and I know his heart belongs to me and vice versa.  I did happen to get a little nosey the other day and look at his phone, and I noticed that they had been exchanging texts.  Nothing nasty or provocative, but it still irritated me nonetheless.  Some texts I have read have been plans for them to hang out (and once again nothing nasty wast mentioned...just hang out time), but the big thing on my mind is that, yes, I trust him with all my heart...but I DO NOT trust her at all.  And the fact that they have this history together of some type of sexual origin just makes it really weird.  And very, very hard for me to get it out of my head.  I've also noticed he's been checking out her MySpace and her pictures alot.  She's also told him at times that she loves him and misses him, etc.  I don't know whether to take all this as a former **** buddy ( I don't know if they ever fucked, but you get the idea) just keeping touch, or is there something more to it?  I love him to death, and I can tell that when he tells me he loves me it's genuine, but once again my problem is HER, not him.  I don't like the idea of him and her conversing because it's weird for me.  I can't tell him any of this though because I don't want him to know I was snooping around in his phone again.  What do I do?



</question>



<additional details>



ALSO...yeah I SHOULDN'T have been snooping, but what's done is done, and I need some input so get over it.



Another thing....no I am not some psycho chick who gets mad about having friends that are girls...the only reason this one irritates me is because I know they have a history together which, like I said, is just really awkward for me.  He has other girls that he hangs out with that I don't care about.

Of course this is abuse. Never ever under any circumstance does your father have any right to hit you nor abuse your mom in any way. This is something that you should immediately report the minute that it happens. Both You and your Mom should not be afraid of your dad, you father need to know that he has to respect not only you but also your mom and every body in your family. If both you and your mom aren't careful enough he might kill you one of these days and that is not good. ( This is just a suggestion) Your dad might need "anger management classes for this to Stop !  But between you and your mom you both need to decide what is the best solution. Because What you are going through right now is almost the same thing that my own father did to my mom and to both my brothers and myself 23 years ago. To the point that My uncles from my mothers side of the family even confronted him because he used to beat my mom, kill her and tried to go after me and my brothers. But because he had another family. So What my mother did was that she called the police immediately and she file a "restraining order" against him and divorced him. Since then we have never seen nor heard from him again nor have we had to worry about going through our fathers abuse.



Well I hope this Information helps you out! Good Luck to both you and your mom ! :)

it is ABSOLUTELY abuse!  have his jerka$$ arrested!  i was abused in my first marriage.  if i had gotten his *** arrested, i would have had a MUCH better chance in my divorce.  but i got screwed again there.
if it's on his record, it's good for you because it will always be with him.
some jail time would do him good.  his boyfriend could give him a tasted of his own medicine.

You need money for somewhere to sleep, food, toiletries, heat.  You'll need to get a job to support yourself and at 13 you will only be able to work a few hours so won't be able to earn enough to keep yourself.  You'll probably end up living rough amongst the addicts and has beens

Whether you want to read it or not don't run away. Talk to your family and sort things out. They'll be upset and worried about you. I also highly doubt you have enough money to survive or anywhere to live. You wouldn't be able to rent/buy a place and you wouldn't be able to get a job either or certainly not one that is enough to support you). You'll miss out on a lot of education which you will regret.

I am not going to tell you not to run away. You will do whatever you like regardless of what I tell you.
Depending on your mothers age, she may be starting to go through menopause. That is when an older woman's body changes, just like a girls body changes when they turn into a teenager. You running away will only add to this ordeal. She is going through a very rough time right now. She may not even know that she is going through menopause. It isn't that she doesn't love you. She may be afraid and unsure of herself right now.



My advice, if you don't run away is to give her some space and respect. It will all blow over. Help her out when you can and just be understanding.

How do I gain my boyfriends trust back after I lied to him a couple of times?



I have been with my boyfriend for 5 months.  I am totally in love with him and want to be with him more than anything.  Recently we have had trust issues because of me lying to him.  I haven't cheated on him or anything like that but trust is a big issue to him.  I lied to him about small things and I even made a swear to him that I would never do it again.  I did it again and now I am so scared of losing him.  He has all right to be angry and I am so sorry I lied to him. I want to know how to gain his trust back and prove to him that he can trust me.

The only thing I have found to take care of the trust issue is time and NEVER messing up again.  You have to have a perfect track record over a long period of time.  The question is whether he will be able to give you that time.  The ball's in his court on this one.

You cannot be totally in love with somebody and bring yourself to lie to them. Let him be anyway, give him time and never lie to him again. If you reall want to be with him. Because the choice is his, if he cannot trust you any more...

If I were you, I would tell him the truth from all the lies you have told him. I would start telling him more important things that happen to you so he feels more involved in your life. That way, if he sees you trusting him, it might make him trust you even more. And don't forget to show him that you love him. Give him complients and ask him questions, I'm sure that would make his day, or come close to it! Good Luck, xoxo.

i have anxiety and depression as well. i read a lot of f. scott fitzgerald. mainly because in his short stories its always just and realistic. (to an extent) but i draw. make new friends on the internet using sites. actually exercising is the best thing because it helps you stay in shape and also it releases endorphines which will make you much happier through out the day. My doctor calls it our bodies medicine for depression. just try it out. the pen pals on the internet helps the best for me.

read... to divert your attention.
write a blog / journal... for you to have a medium where you could write how you feel at the moment. it helps easing the pain... a little bit. but think of this, that 'little bit' could become a big deal if you do it on a regular basis and eventually you would be surprised that you already had moved on.
chat... talk to tons if people. listen to their stories as well. it helps a lot when you have someone to talk to. that would keep you busy.
clean your room... and eventually your whole home. hehe.
excercise... to shred all the pain in you... and to help you shape up as well... talking about hitting two birds with one stone.
there's tons of work to do. just be creative.
thinking of your ex won't go away in an overnight basis. it takes time... time... time... but eventually, a strong girl can get over it.

the problem is you are trying to get their attention. that means you arent being picky. you need to get some self esteem before you can expect a guy with selfesteem to come for you. If you just be confident and worry about you a guy will pop into your life when you least expect it. (oh and the drama thing probably turns them off completely, just a guess) Feel better.

How long should I wait?



Well I broke up with my girlfriend of 1 year earlier today.. I asked to see her and she told me no, she was gonna be busy. I only see her once or twice a week on average, and it seems she wants to get back into partying.. well for some strange reason, its like I don't even care about it. But whats weird is, last night I was completely upset at the thought of breaking up. Basically, we just talk on the phone for 2-3 hours at night and text message throughout the day. She lives about 45 minutes away. I'm 27 years old, have about 4 good friends, and stay pretty busy at work. How long should I wait until give it another shot at dating? I have probably 1 or 2 only girls that I talk to and thats on an every now and then basis. Other than that I have no really girls to hang out with, and about 3 true friends that I see maybe once or twice a month.

Stay busy, try not to think about missing your ex or anything like that - I know its hard, but there will come a time when you'll feel ready to meet someone else. I can't give you an answer as to how long because it really isnt set in stone. Some people seem to flit from one to another with hardly a gap in between, whereas others have to have a time to readjust
Good luck to you, I know it's hard splitting up with anyone, let alone a long standing relationship

Just wear what you are comfortable in. Don't wear any college or team stuff though in case he likes that teams rivals or a band shirt in case he hates that band. I like girls with a sweatshirt or something but that's just me everyone has their opinion, but just look him in the eyes and talk to him and smile and laugh a lot. Don't wear anything that might make him even more shy than he already is like a dress or bikini then you'll be really hard to approach and he is already shy. Hope I helped best of luck :)

Something that doesn't "throw it all out there"- When it comes to women (i've been told im the stereotypical nice guy), those who wear clothes (^_^) I find not only much more easily approachable, but also much more mysterious than those who walk around in a string bikini ------  Also, remember if he's shy don't count on him asking you out (or possibly even talking to you) &gt;&gt; you're probably going to have to bring him in to doing it

You know what - alot of shy, sweet guys like nasty clothes too.
But you should just be yourself and wear what you are comfortable in.



It's much more important to make eye contact and smile at him - and talk to him and be nice than it is to dress in any specific manner.



If you smile nicely at him - whatever you wear will look great.

What if you are suddenly better off?



how would u react if u struggled since you got married,then 1 day your husband finds out he unexpectantly enherited enough money (from family) for you never to work ever again? he knew that it was your dream to have a restaurant of your own. he hands you the paper saying that he'll have no interference, you'll be the sole owner & a cheque for the amount. you've been living with family, but he picks you up from work & shows u a house, for u only to realise that u'll be moving in there & u dont owe a penny on it. he also asks u to tell him how much all your debt is, he wants to settle it

i think i didnt make myself clear. i meant struggled financially, but madly in love. we still are, now he wants to give me everything he couldnt before, even though all i want, is to be with him, whether in a chicken coop or a mansion



we are still together, he adores me & vice versa. we've been staying with family, because we couldnt afford to live on our own.now, he has all this money & wants to give us, his family, a life he didnt have as a child. is find it overwhelming

Money isn't important. If you are still married, then fine. If you are divorced and have moved on, then no amount of any good fortune will change your mind. Especially when you've nearly died of all the nervous breakdowns your ex gave you for his stupidity and immaturity. I say move on and don't look back. I know I'd rather be poor.

Please help....My bf says I'm losing myself in this relationship!?



We've gone out for 18 wonderful months...The last three or so months I realized how much I am truly in love with him. I have been spoiling him and wanting to do things to show my love and to express how happy he has made me. He is in love with me too, does nice things for me, but is more mellow. Last night he told me that he feels like I leave myself out and that its all about him...That I don't give myself enough credit for the nice things I do in the relationship. I told him that I was aware I was spoiling him but not realizing it was a bad thing...that I too want balance in the relationship. Did I ruin this beautiful relationship or lose his respect? How do I start fresh from here? I know I need to be an equal partner in the relationship, do less, etc. I know he was saying this because he cares, but I feel like I'm being punished for being nice. Help me sort this out. Thank you!

i think you are def. over thinking the entire relationship. All he wants you to do is take a step back and chill out. Everything is fine, just be you. He doesn't want anything extra, just you. You are lucky to be in a relationship where a man will sit you down and tell you something like that. It isn't a punishment you are just being too much. Tone it down some. And just enjoy the ride. No need to push it.

Wow, that's a different senerio! I think it's great you give a lot to your relationship, I don't think you should feel you are being punished for giving so much of yourself to him. The only thing I can think is to maybe take a little time for yourself, treat yourself to a day at a spa or something you truly love. Maybe reconnect with yourself. I really don't think he meant it to make you second guess yourself, maybe thats him way of saying thank you for being such a wonderful girlfriend to me!

You must not stop being yourself, being outwardly in showing your affections. Clearly he is feeling a little outdone, but its not your fault. You now need to communicate to him that he needs to find ways of improving his side or helping you "tone-down". Its about egos and security with us men. Help him understand that he is still the man and you are not trying to take his position or belittle him. This is the hard part. How to communicate that without being offensive. This is also the best opportunity to test and improve your communication skills. All the best for now and the future. I hope this helps. Bye.

I don't think you've ruined the relationship by any means..you simply got alittle carried away..it sounds like you've got a good relationship in that you both treat each other well..you just need to remember to take time for yourself..an important part of having a healthy relationship is having a life outside of your relationship as in some activity you do without him and having your own friends..spending all your time together is not a healthy thing..try an tone down how much you do for your bf..don't do everything..maybe talk about deciding on something you can do for each other once a month to show you appreciate each other..like cooking for each other or something, just an example. Hope this helps.

Frustrated with making friends and intimacy issues!?



This is something I have observed in myself over the years and it really bothers me. I used to have a hard time fitting in groups and making close friends over the years but it got better when I moved out to college and stopped living with my controlling and abusive family. When I join a new setting/group everything seems good for a while. I get to talk to a lot of people, they are friendly and polite to me but for some reason I do not make that connection with most of the people. I almost feel I am left out of the group making process and that soon enough people find someone else to be friends with. I feel I am the person that most of the people get along with and a lot of people have said that I am part of the group and not excluded. I am nice, caring and warm person with some very good friends and definitely have a lot to offer. However I do not feel the same way. One of my sponsors have said I have too high expectations of people I am hanging around and that there are a lot of damaged people who do not get anyone close to them. I want intense, instant,commited and close relationships and usually do not want to settle myself for just casual friends. I also attract people who either want to use me or have similar issues with groups and food like I do. I also feel frustrated with myself and other people, as if they are not letting me get close to them. I was told I am a dominant person who likes to be in charge in relationships and that I try too hard to make friends. I know I am a strong person who will stand up and say things directly and that I can be selfish sometimes. I feel some people are naturally intimidated by my honesty, assertiveness and will avoid me. I try my best to look for people who have healthy boundaries, someone I have things in common, someone I click with but it is hard. I know relationships form gradually and that should be mutual. I also feel that part of me is dysfunctional as the result of growing up in a family with codependency and eating disorder issues and that I do not function like most of the people. One of the feedbacks I got from counselors and other people is that I need to work on my self-confidence issues and learn how to take care of myself. Although I came to the point where I enjoy my own company and enjoy different interesting things, I would like to hear some useful feedback from you guys. What do you think my core issues with people are and how should I change the way I approach people. Thanks guys!

If someone said that to me I would tell them they are superficial. He wasn't just being honest with you he was being mean. Come on look at that statement. Why would it matter to him if you lost weight. Did you tell him that he would look better with some meat on his bones. There are plenty of adult men not boys that like thick girls. I'm a thick women and men love my curves. Tell your child like friends to take a hike.

It is all about being confident in yourself. If a bigger girl walks around with her head held up and with an air of confidence about her i think that is very beautiful. However if she is always walking around with her head hung low and never making eye contact that can be a complete turn off.

In MOST cases it's bad not to make eye contact. It always seems to me that someone isn't trust worthy if they can't look you in the eye. Be confident...nobody is going to rip your head off for making eye contact. People find it MORE odd if you don't make eye contact.

Why does my boyfriend have this fetish?



My boyfriend has a fetish and Im not sure its normal? He gets really turned on by my belly button. I think my belly button is icky, its an innie/outie, but he loves it. One time he wiggled his finger inside and then smelled the gunk on his finger. He also smears chocolate inside all the nooks and crannies and then licks it out. Could this develop into something worse? I think it's kind of gross but cute.
I have a good body, Im thin, and people tell me that Im pretty, so why does he like my belly button so much, I dont understand. Is this something I should worry about?

Proper Legal Name in divorce age 12?



Proper Legal Name in divorce at school age 12?
My 12 year old has been told by the school to use her proper legal name. She still uses my ex wifes new married name. My ex has been alienating me from my children for a long time. I have legal visitation with my daugher and my ex wont send the 12 year old saying it would be abuse ,if she does not want to visit me. My ex is suppose to encourage visitation but does not. She can't even tell her to use her proper name how encouraging is that? Is this an issue I should just let go or do something about? I have contacted the school and they say what she does outside school setting they can't control. So that means papers done at home can have the "Wrong legal name". It may sound trivial but its part of the parental alienation and I think its sad and awful. I miss and love my child i haven't seen in over a year. Third contempt of court pending on visitation. By the time this is over she will be age 14 and I'll have no say at all :( Thanks for your time.

Well, look at the obvious. Job = income. Look at her skills, there you have it. A career in catering or teaching languages (or anywhere that may need her linguistic skills).



If there are any job agencies nearby, she should make a visit to one. She can make a CV with her past jobs, qualifications, current skills etc on it, and the agency should help her find any available work placements in the area, and arrangement interviews etc.



If there aren't any agencies, then she should have a look in some newspapers, in the work section where available job placements are advertised.

She is not the only one that has money problems, a lot of people do.  And amazingly having money does not always mean you have happiness.  Help her to appreciate the things she has and enjoy the life she has.  She is lucky to have a child (some can't) and a good friend.  It is always good to strive for more money but let's not get lost in that and miss what we have right now.  It is the month of gratitude, a good time to help her be thankful.  I wish you serenity

I think the conception of what true love is has been morphed a little bit over the years. It's not all a fairy tale but it shouldn't be a huge battle either. The relationship between you and the other person should be good, the battle might just be environment which is fine and you have to work together to get through it.



Now I've been in a similar situation before and it's a really confusing thing. I guess you or I have maybe never been in the situation of feeling that kind of pressure from parents and family, etc so it's really hard to say we know what he's feeling or that we can understand at all. However, I think if someone is truly, and i mean TRULY, in love with you, there is no reason that they would even let themselves be in the situation of marrying someone else



Love knows no bounds.
(Love should not be bounded by other people).



If he chose his path with another person, then you should do the same. If it is meant to be it will come around, but I don't think love is all about the pain of waiting.

I've just this situation,only i am male,she married someone else because of family/friends/society.Tough call,waiting in my opinion is true love,to give someone else your love when you KNOW what real love is would only be cheating them and yourself,as you will most likely never forget "the one".However,moving on is something that you may want to consider.It has been 30 years since i lost my one true love,not a day goes by that i don't think of her.It is my sincerest hope that you don't follow my example,the heartache is just too much.Find peace of mind however you can,whether that means by yourself or with someone else.This is the best that i can offer.

Dear if true love means waiting for the rest of ur life then when ru gonna start living? To begin wit if he loves u why marry someone else? And if he s bound to family etc then best is to not get committed. Only gud thing he has done here is he told u his family status of approval.



Did his parents checked the horoscope  match or anything yet wit urs? Even if ur guy believes or not in this horoscope thing he s definately gonna giv u up if his parents say so. Keep praying so ther wont be any prob marrying him but sincere advice is if he s gonna get married to some1 else or already married plz back off and dont expect too much frm him and waste ur life. Once he starts his family he s not gonna sit and think much bout u. U cannot share relationship wit other woman. He seems like a neutral guy who goes wit the flow. If it hapens it happens if not no. Think for urself..and yes leave it to god

I have no idea why this woman would say something like this!?



I went to this meditation centre where we had to stay 10 days without talking or making any form of communication with the other meditators. I tried to do exactly the same, but as usual there were plenty of people out there breaking the rules. I tried not to, but this one girl, who lived next to my room, would always come and talk to me a bit, because she was too scared to be alone and stuff. I couldn't not say on her face that i do not want to talk to her and i would reply to whatever she said, while not trying to initiate any conversation.



But this girl would talk to every other meditator, and one day she told me that this 34 year old woman has told her to not stay with me or talk to me because that 34 year old woman does NOT LIKE ME!



I wondered what i did wrong because i never had  a talk with that woman as we were not allowed to talk. How can someone NOT like a person when they have just seen the other person and dont know anything about the other person. I was quite puzzled to hear that! Now can anyone tell me why would that woman say something like that about me?!



I would have to say that the woman was creating mischief over there, because from day one she was NOT meditating and talking to everybody!

Comfortable=lost love?



After seventh months together, my boyfriend seems like he has lost some interest in me. He's not as romantic as he once was, and he doesn't pay as much attention to me anymore. He says he loves me more than ever, and I assume this is only happening because we've reached that comfortability stage in our relationship.

That's just how relationships work. After the new completely in love stage wears off, it's a partnership as well as a relationship. This is when you stay best friends as well. Luckily, 2 years into my relationship we still haven't reached the just comfortable stage. We're plenty comfortable, but things are just as amazing as ever.

Whether you are bisexual doesn't come into it. Whether you liked the opposite sex doesn't either. What comes into it is what do you want. Do you want to be with your boyfriend or do you want to be with your friend. You cannot take on both that would be selfish to both of them. You have definately make a choice. The only one who can do that is you. I suggest that you write down all the pros and cons of each of them. Ask yourself is this current relationship going anywhere? How long have I been with my boyfriend? What are his intentions? Does he talk about the future. Does he say that he loves you and shows that he cares about you. Where do you see yourself in 5 years with this person? Where do you see yourself in 10 years with this person? Do you want kids? Do both of you have similar goals? It is not about loving someone totally. It is about wanting the same things in life together. Love can grow with the right person. If you do not want the same things in life I feel it will work for a while but eventually you will get sick of that person and want to move on. Take care and all the best. Up to you what you decide. Hope that helps you.

it's easy to start developing feelings for your best friend, because there is always such an easy connection between you two after awhile. but that feeling will eventually pass once you realize that the novelty of possibly falling for this new person is simply a phase. don't get too caught up in it, or make a hasty decision on a simple spur of the moment infatuation. Is giving up on your boyfriend, someone you know who you have something real with, worth a crush?

um , this is kind of confusing, but your friend seems kind of suspicious if she's keeping the number from you. or she's trying to protect you, but she needs to let you make your own mistakes and learn from them. but why wouldn't you just ask him for his number?

How do I show him I love him?



Okay, so i am in love with this guy. Not only is he just some guy but he's the father of my daughter. We've recently been through a lot of drama, (not on my part) and we're trying to work things out.



I would like some positive tips on how to show him I love him. Throughout our relationship thus far I've sent the "i love you" e-mails, the random love notes, and even the miscellaneous gifts.



I would like some input on things that have worked for you and what may work for me. I'm open to any point of view.



Thank you

You must be strong and let go of what you can not fix,people don't change and in no case you can buy love,he's not just loving you but obviously he isn't a responsible parent,you have to take charge and not let the child go trough the life without your love,it seems like you give yourself to him,what about make him feel like you are going on with your life just as beautiful without him and be strong,you are not alone.
Good luck,freespirit

Be an attentive listener, something we women tend not to be. We women are always talking or trying to solve a crisis just be a good listener. Be a best friend, don't judge, give unconditional love. Not gifts, not cards, selfless love that's giving of oneself. Example would be your time.

As long as it is reciprocated I would be careful. I usually make dinner for two and make it romantic. I dress up for my hubby. We go out on dates, walks. If I did something to upset him I will make up for it. I will make the house spotless and change things around. He is also respectful that I take care of our two little boys. I just make sure we stay connected. On a personall level we try Tantric sex and Taoist sex.

the fact that they are usually easy to get drunk, like being touched all the time in places that are a bit "friendly"... Not to mention guys have a dictionary dedicated to words or lines that we use to determine reactions.... For us its a game to see who is and isn't... then we keep those girls numbers for that reason... little tip, if he doesnt ever talk to you and then texts or calls all flirty, its kinda a hint what he thinks

In Zimbabwe the child is the centre of the community.  Men and women are known by the name of their oldest child. e.g. your name is not George but it it Father-of-Thomas or whatever.  In practice children are expected to be totally submissive but at the same time everything parents do is meant to be for the benefit of their children.

i found messages on my bf's myspace that he tried to delete to other girls calling them babe, and i miss you etc...nothing really bad he never met up with these girls or did anything physical and i definitely know he would never go to the point of cheating but he tried to lie at first and then finally realized he was caught when i had original copies of the emails, all he said was oh sorry. and then he thinks that everything should be ok and i shouldnt be mad bc he said sorry. i cant get him to understand that those emails behind my back made me feel betrayed and i want him to show me that hes truly sorry like he supposedly says. he thinks that just saying sorry fixes the problem. what do i have to do to get him to understand that its a big deal to me? i've cried screamed yelled kicked him out for two nights done everything....i dont know what else to do bc we both dont want to leave each other we have two kids. i need some guy answers....

I don't think you should be over-reacting, sure, a lot of wives fear a BF/HUBBY cheating on them, and to tell you the truth, women over-react... just calm down, take a breath, and look at the problem, ask him, is he really actually trying to cheat on you? Or is it just harmless flirting? If it is real, I suggest you dump him. No man has any excuse to do such a thing to the woman he chooses to have children with. Blast the scumbag, if he apologizes sincerely then just tell him it is concerning to you.

I've seen countless articles on your situation. Basically, when you say you "caught [your] bf talking to other girls on myspace" what you really mean to say is that you went behind his back and checked up on him. Even when you are in a relationship, that doesn't automatically give you the right to snoop on your partners personal belongings. He still has a right to have privacy. BUT- If he is doing these things, while in a relationship with you, it might mean that he is bored and is trying to have fun with other girls. As to your confrontation with him and needing something more than a sorry, you should try using another method. Have you told him how that makes you feel? How it disrespects the relationship? Be upfront with your feelings.
It also seems to me that you may have insecurity issues, to have "orginal copies of the emails". That's a little far-fetched. Has he ever cheated on you before? Is that why you don't trust him? Has he ever given you a reason not to trust him? The only solution is that YOU need to talk to him. Have a one-on-one. If at this point, he wants nothing to do with the convo, then the relationship is beyond repair...

welcome to the real world...............men look around .........its what they do..........just because he looking dont mean he is gonna do it........but you did do the right thing by nipping it in the bud and confronting him....but you did it in such a way that he probably dont trust you around his things anymore and will probably go 59 times out of his way to cover his tracks from you..........you guys have some serious trust issues.........thats why i have the attitude i do about men....if they gonna cheat they gonna cheat ....it dont mean you are less of a person....it dont mean you are ugly....it dont mean that you did something wrong......men are always on the prowl looking for other stuff to play with until they come home.....................now is that right.....?????????????? thats on that indiviual to be the judge.....its on you if you are going to take that for the rest of your life or do something about it now.

Kindness, someone you can talk to and will listen. Someone who wont be too overprotective and will understand when you want some alone/girl time. Someone whos easy to get along with and u can easily have fun with. Sharing interests helps a lot, like having things in common.
Someone who is full of surprises and will do nice things for you!

A turn off for me (when it comes to looks) would be when a guy dyes his hair that's like a huge turn off for me idk lol, but most girls would agree you have to have something going for you, you need a good sense of humor, don't act needy, be sweet, confident, and just be a gentleman :)

Why am I such a loser and why do people hate me?



Hello Im 20 years old and im a total failure in my eyes. When I was younger I wanted to be a pro athlete (I have the genetics for it and I learn really fast) I could be making millions of dollars right now. But heres the problem I dont know how to function in society, im a social retard. Im wasted potential, I should be the nfls only good running back right now. But I couldnt function in school. I used to get bad grades because I was too depressed to do my homework. The only way for me to release my tention was through sports. Then sohmore year I quit everything, becuase people used to accuse me of steroids since im so gifted. I tried playing sports again, and I was doing mma but I quit that also. I dont like being around people I dont know. I always feel like im being judged.  Im really smart too, and i dropped out of college because i dont like to be around other people because I cant function. Im also very good looking, like a male model. And I cant even get a girlfriend. The only thing I get is gay guys hitting on me. Im buff and I have a six pack abs. But it seems looks dont matter, its all about how cool you are. And im not cool and I never have been cool. Im tired of people calling me gay, or telling me a take steroids. I enjoy working out and challenging myself. I like to work hard. But I am criticzed for that. I just want to win and be good. like my role models, but i just get made fun of. I want lots of money and women. But I feel like I never will. Im being honest. I feel like life is a joke, like everyones screwing with me. When I was 12 I knew what life was about, and I set out to be the best. 3 years later, i found out it was a joke. 8 years later, im still a loser. Girls always say im hot, but i cant geta girlfriend. whats with that? Only guys with lots of friends get girls. I keep getting hit on by gay guys, and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Oh yeah the reason why I workout is so that people dont pick on me. because people used to pick on me before i hit puberty.and when i stop working out people pick on me. LONG STORY SHORT- I am scared to be in society. HERES THE FUNNY THING. you know what my favorite thing is????????????? People. I love people more than anything in the world. I want to make everyone happy and to have peace and love you know. It sounds gay but whatever. I want to be the best. I want to be like Tiger Woods you know, I want kids to look up to me as a hero. I want to be a role model, like a gleam of light in the darkness. I just dont know what i should do. I feel like killing myself, but God would not approve of that and winners dont quit, winners win.I want to be a winner I am a winner. But seriosuly if life was a video game I would turn the game off and find the directions. I work way to hard to be were I am in life, I actually try really hard to fit it with people. I do everything that you could think of. Also another weird thing. I often find that people are stupid? it sounds odd but, people talk about the dumest things and dont know anything about anything. And the people who are like me dont like me. It seems like everyone that is like me thinks im competition. Anyway I have serious problems and the pychiatrist aint working. HE DOSNT UNDERSTAND. nobody does. I just want to be happy.

What Do I Do With My Ex-Boyfriend?



Hello...Me and my ex-boyfriend went out for a year and some months on and off. Throughout that relationship he treated me like **** like tallk down to me and it was always drama with us. Towards the end when we decided to get together the second time since we were on and off he was talking and having sex with someone else without even letting me know so I left him alone. And let me remind you this ***** was ugly. Anyway after not talking to him for about almost 2 years he been trying to get to me through all my friends and family and he wanted to apologize for all the things he has done to me right now but I feel like if I even hear his voice I would get so mad all over again. So should I even waste my time or just forget him and move on with my life.

Oh forget the scum and move on.  He's not worth it.  Off and on relationships never work out anyway, and it's obvious yours has been over for a long time.  He probably doesn't have anyone right now and wants you as his doormat.  Well, you deserve better.  Tell everyone to tell him to stop calling for and about you or you will get a restraining order out on him.  He's harassing.  Tell your friends and family you don't even want to hear his name mentioned ever.  You'll meet someone who truly loves and respects you.

Why would she do this?



Hello again. I'm a lady & we go to diff universities in diff towns. My friend from h s started drifting away a couple years ago, then was ignoring a lot of my messages, said she lost her phone, then I called her, she ended the convo quickly, and didn't call back. That was 3 weeks ago. I know she has been on facebook at least several times since then. I decided to let the relationship go. 
Well, her good bye party she invited me to (she's going to Spain for a semester), she never called back with additional info or anything. She said she was going to pick me up when she picked up someone else. When she didn't call back for over a 3 weeks, I rejected the invite on Facebook. 
Well, yesterday about an hour before her party she calls me. I ignored the phone call, I was going clothes shopping w/my mom anyway for school. She left a message saying she was coming to pick up Andrew and was I coming. She called an additional two times. Then, texted me her parents' address and asked was I going to make it. I have yet to respond to any of the messages. I def was not going to her party. Since I thought she was ditching me, I didn't buy a gift or write the thing she wanted everyone to bring. I didn't know what I was supposed to wear or anything? Also, why did she assume I'd be ready to go when she didn't give me all the info or call me back. Alot, of my "friends" used to do this to me. I finally let them go.

What does this sound like?



A few months ago I noticed that my boyfriend would be spending a lot of time with this girl online playing World of Warcraft. I didn't think anything of it until whenever I came into the room, he'd scroll his text up so I couldn't read it. I know he has always been very protective of his conversations, but for some reason this one really concerned me.

A few days after he got two new girls on his myspace page. After I asked him who they were, out of curiosity, he told me there were just friends of friends.

One day he left his myspace open on his computer and I read the conversations between the two girls on his myspace. I still feel really bad for reading them because I know how it feels, but I just had to know. I know that doesn't justify it, but what done is done.

The first messages I read was just messages of him getting to know this one girl. In the message he tells her that he had been thinking about her and asked her if that was ok. She replied telling him the same.

The second girl he left a comment on her photos (which, was just a photo of her boobs hanging out) and he told her how sexy she was and how her boyfriend was a very lucky man to have someone like her.

Come to find out the one he was telling he was thinking about her, was the girl from World of Warcraft. I'm still not for sure who the other girl is.

Am I over reacting? I think I'm still so upset by it because I know I'd NEVER say anything like that to a man. When I'm with someone, no other men exsist but the person I'm with.

What do you think? Is that consider cheating?

I play World of Warcraft with my boyfriend and he talks to girls online and I talk to guys online.  But the difference is we don't sit around and think about the people we talk to online.  We usually only talk about stuff in the game.  If your boyfriend is being protective about his conversations, its probably because hes hiding something.  There is no reason your boyfriend should be thinking about some chick in Warcraft unless shes in his guild and their about to do a major raid on some gay *** alliance.  Other than gameplay stuff why does he need to talk to her? I dont get it.....why is he hiding it?  Why dont you play with him?



</answer>



<asker's comment>



I agree, no need to talk to her outside of the game.  The whole reason he started playing WoW again was to play with me.  I was interested, he was not.

Thanks for the advice.

I would say that is really messed up! if he cares for u then he shouldn't be leaving messages for girls like that. u where right to take a look at his messages. cheating maybe. choose if u really need some1 who's gonna do that stuff behind ur back. thoughts like that shouldn't cross his mind about other girls.

Well if it is so bad you should go to church to confess. Even if you dont believe in god it feels better to confess. I dont know what you have done or if you can do anything to do it better only you know what to do. But just incase do lots of good things and try and clear up the air...be brave dont let it haunt you forever &lt;3 =]

you need to tell us what it is before we can help you. 
however f it is something you don' t want to share on here, i suggest you call a helpline, such as the samaritans.
also, what you think is an awful thing, might not be that bad, if you share a problem you feel less burdened and the problem doesn't seem so bad. :)

Well figure out why you feel so bad. Why does it bother you? Is there anyone you hurt when you did that something bad? If so you need to confess or apoligize or both. Figure a way to make it better. Find someone to talk to about it.

Did you say "feel guilty" ? Hook line and sinker you are, you told us that you actually hurt your own flesh and blood.
How in heavens name did you find the time to come on here and put up this question when you should be at the hospital wait to make sure you brother is ok.
To flip the script like you did must have had a female involved or maybe you came home and found a man in your brothers arms, we can only guess at this point,but it seems that you are looking at the answers we give and then you tell us a bit more about what happened at your home.
drunk or stoned it seems that things are slowly coming back to you, you started this, now finnish it.

Wife wants to have kids, i don't!?



for the past few months my wife has wanted to start a family together by having kids,i dont think we are ready because of our financial status, if i had financial aid i guess i would have kids, you know, please and just do it, im not really crazy about the idea to begin with, she said its a wonderfull feeling bringing a new life into the world, i said ''i guess its agree to disagree, i dont really agree with what your saying''

now its beginning to be a pain, she has really started nagging onto me about how she wants to have kids, and she thinks our relationship is great, but inside its driving me crazy each and every day, i've told her im not to thrilled about the idea, and said i dont think theres anything special about it, she just wont take no for an answer, its got to the point where i left her a note on the table saying ''back in a week, dont worry about me'', im currently at a friends house, i feel the only way i can get out of this is to just grab the car keys and take off...



</question>



<additional details>



its not that im not ready, i just dont want them, i just want to live my life then just die afterwards you know? she just keeps saying how great it is to have kids, i disagree, i think there is nothing great about it. and ill proberly get the chance to take off in the car tomorrow morning if i decide too.



if i do take off, i think its a pretty safe situation in my view, i can rent a place about 50 miles away, ive already been looking.



the only reason im at a friends house is because she keeps going on about kids all the time, its driving me insane, i have tried talking to her, she just keeps on and on, kind of like a broken record. so i had to take a week off, i would have exploted and turned into a monster otherwise, and that would not have been good.

If you love this woman, you shouldn't consider leaving her for one second. By the sound of what you said, you haven't actually just outright said you're not ready, you made excuses to avoid saying it.

Sit down with her, and explain your feelings on the matter, don't hide anything about it. If this woman loves you as much as you love her, then she'll understand and be sympathetic towards it. You shouldn't be embarrassed or feel bad about it, there are thousands of men that have had or are having your problem. Just have faith that your wife will listen to what you have to say. She wants to have a child with you, that has to mean something.

Well first of all, I don't think it was a very good idea to leave. I think you need to go back and apologize.

But it seems kinda silly to let children drive apart a marriage, when that's one of the reasons FOR a marriage. Have you guys actually talked about it seriously? Have you discussed why you don't think you should have kids? I mean, you told us your reasoning, but have you told her? Do you know why she thinks you can afford kids? Is she willing to work harder and get paid more? Did you talk about children before you got married?

I think you guys just need to talk about it. But go back. Staying away from her is not going to help anything.

You cannot avoid the situation, what are you going to do in a weeks time when you have to return to your wife, yiu will have to face the music sometime. You should speak to her about the situation, you didnt say how old you and your wife are, this could be a reason for not wanting children, maybe try counselling for you as a couple. Tell her you may want children in the future, but are not ready now.

you both want different things this can put a major strain on your relationship and can cause your wife to be resentful. Marriage is about compromise. Talk out the situation with her and come to a middle ground. Marriage is also about sacrifice. Sometimes we have to sacrafice the things we want to make our significant others happy. It's give and take for both. While I understand why you don't want to have kids especially the financial aspects. There are no real bad guys in this situation. One of you are going to have to make a sacrifice or it may be your undoing. 
It sounds like you are scared at the thought of being a father. You should take into thought not only your feelings but your wifes as well. Do you want this to be a barrier in your relationship that will cause a continous circle of arguements that get no where or are you going to do something about it.
Try a sincere conversation with your wife. Work something out, tell her the real reason you are afraid to have kids, even the emotional aspects. Open up to her and she will open up to you. Stay calm don't get angry and try to come to a decision where you will both be happy.
[edit] Then again you seem to be really immature by the way you are treating your wife. Your butt should be home. If you can't handle a disagreement without running away then marriage is not for you. Get a divorce and save her from years of hoping she will have something she will never have from you.

Well this should have been discussed before marriage. These kind of things can ruin a marriage.

A woman feels the need to have kids sometimes and it can actually consume her whole life.



Once that baby comes you'd be happy I am sure. But feeling like you don't want kids at all is going to cause a lot of stress on the marriage.



Really just sit down and put it out there what you want and what she wants and if you are already running off when things get toug then probably it isn't a good idea to have kids anyway.

sounds like you guys hit a brick wall...did you discuss having children before you got married???
maybe now its time to think about getting some outside help from a counselor..that way your wife can express her thoughts and you can do the same...
i can see youre thinking of the child by saying that you cant afford it right now...because a child does cost alot to raise properly..
i can understand what your wife is saying because bringing a new life into the world is a wonderful thing...but she also has to understand that maybe now isnt the right time...

It seems to me that girls termed "hot" more likely to have guys try and use them for sex, but that having certain looks cannot influence a guy to want a relationship one little bit. If not looks, then what would make them want one? Is it just when they are ready?
 it seems like a lot just arent ready. Im 23.

Koeksisters
The secret of the crisp syrupy outside of koeksisters is that they are taken straight from hot oil and dipped into ice-cold syrup. This seals the syrup outside and leaves the inside dryish in contrast. 
To make the syrup, mix a liter of sugar, 5 ml cream of tartar, 2.5 ml tartaric acid and 5 ml vanilla essence or grated orange rind or cinnamon, or 1.5 ml ginger with 500 ml of water. Bring mixture to the boil and allow it to simmer for about 10 minutes or until syrupy. Set syrup aside to cool. It is advisable to make the syrup first and leave it overnight in the fridge. 
To make the batter, sift 500 ml flour, 10 ml baking powder and 5 ml salt into a mixing bowl. Cut or rub 70 ml of margarine or butter into the dry ingredients. Beat an egg thoroughly and add it to 80 ml of milk. Add the egg and milk to the flour mixture, handling as little as possible. Put the dough in the fridge for at least one hour. Roll out the dough to a thickness of 4 mm. Cut into strips about 8 cm long and 2.5 cm wide. Cut each strip into three lengthwise, leaving one side uncut. Now plait the three pieces and press ends together firmly. 
Pre-heat a deep pan and remove syrup from the fridge. The hot fried koeksisters must be dropped into the cold syrup. The syrup will warm up about halfway through, so divide the syrup into two bowls. Deep-fry koeksisters until golden brown, drain for a few seconds on absorbent paper and dip into cold syrup.

Which perks you up more???



A compliment from a friend/partner/family member???
or
A compliment from a stranger???

And why???



</question>



<additional details>



All very interesting points... I think from a stranger, it IS unbiased and makes you feel just that little bit more special... Family/Friends/Partners can be biased or want something by "buttering you up"... Especially kids (who want money/lift/borrow the car/be allowed to do something usually not allowed) and partners (who might want sex)... :D

Good question...probably a stranger, because he/she wouldn't have an ulterior motive, whereas someone you know may want something from you.
But I know that's not necessarily true. A stranger could want something, too.
But as I live with a 6 year old and a teenager, i find that any "compliments" I receive from them are just openers for a request ;-)

I think a stranger, they don't have anything to gain from paying you a compliment so it's genuine.
I had one recently about a suit I was wearing a guy who was walking past me told me my suit was beautiful and looked great on me and just carried on walking, quite bizarre but very nice.

a compliment from a stranger....cause family members usually want to make u feel good and may say things are not true/exaggarated....and they find it easier to say cause ur closer to them....now 4 me to compliment a stranger id have to break through that barrier of slight reticance and hesitancy....so for me to say it,  have to really mean it....unless they are just trying to get in ur pants...but yeah...a stranger, cause they can judge you without the rose tinted specs that family use.

Feeling behind with life experiences



Hiya im feeling like im way behind with life experiences which is sortof affecting my confidence.  I know people who have been clubbing since their late teens and i rarely do it so theyre used to socialising with people yet i get shy with newish people.  I hate regretting the past as it doesnt help but i do feel ive missed out on alot of stuff and am frustrated i cant get it bak.  I know i need to get out there but find it hard motivating myself ie facing the fear.  Funny thing i know its not that bad but still cant get up and go.  Any inspiration would help!

Don't worry about it. I wouldn't exactly call clubbing a "life experience" to begin with.

If your worried about meeting new people or socialising, go to the clubs when your friends are so that you have someone to hang around if you're feeling shy.



If your still not up for that try joining a local sports team or something to get to know people there.

Hope this helps,

If you go clubbing. Try starting with a couple shots before yall leave. Thats what we do. It feels way more comfortable to walk in the club with a buzz. And you save a little money on drinks.

Hey, know what you mean.  I also give myself a hard time by judging what I feel I "should" have done by this point in my life.  I've found if I can step aside from that feeling from time to time, my mind is much more at ease and I feel better, and more able to do something, rather than dwell.



I know in general that the feeling of wanting to do more is a good one, but when it starts affecting my life in the opposite manner it's pretty useless.  There's nothing too it but to get your *** in gear and do what needs to be done -- recondition yourself.  You can do it because you're infinitely malleable and adaptable.



It does get easier the more you socially interact.  It's reciprocal.  It keeps resonating and giving. Focus on what you will do, rather than what you have not done.  No one judges you so harshly as you do yourself.

How would you handle this situation with your ex-fiance?



I broke up with him 3 yrs ago because he had cheated on me with his ex-gf with whom he has a child.When I called him and said that I knew all, his only reply was that it was none of my business what he had with child`s mother. No apology nothing,just hung up. (he had broke up with her before as she had become pregnant from another guy and tried to make him think it was his. )He had always assured me that he loved me so much and was so blessed to have me and his mom told me that he had told her I was the one for him and that I was the only woman he had ever proposed to. Til today I am not able to move into a new relationship as I am scared sthg like that could happen to me just out of the blue again without a reason or wrongdoing of me.Earlier this year he wrote me a card and apologized for hurting me so badly and acting irresponsible.His ex has become his ex again as once more he found out she was cheating on him.He was beating around the bush and it seemed to me as if he wanted to ask me to take him back.I didn`t respond to that.What I really want from him is to tell me the reasons why he had done all that to me.I told him that he owed me the truth so I can heal from all that.He was understanding and said he would tell me why he had acted this way but not that day as he was too tired.We wrote emails back and forth about the weather and blabla...he backed out when it came to more serious topics so I stopped writing to him in May.He started writing to my best friend then telling her he was sorry for what he had caused me.She stopped writing him as well as she feels he was only trying to find out through her if I was in a relationship.I had counseling with a psycho therapist about this issue but they couldn´t give me answers either.One adviced me to write him and ask for answers but I don`t want to seem needy to him and I don`t think it makes sense to force him to talk to me, there`d be no outcome.What would you do in this situation? Or how can I get peace of mind?

URGENTLY need help please please!!?



Right can anyone advise me on how to deal with my boyfriend? I find him quite mean and money driven - like today I told him Id been offered a small promotion and the first thing he says is "ooh did you ask for more money" and when we go out - to the cinema like, he'll buy a large popcorn and a large drink for us to share - even though Id prefer my own! Or he'll let me pay for stuff no bother. Now Im not looking for a free ride, and would always offer to pay my way, but I find him just being quite mean in the things he does and says.... in other ways hes very good - like he'll buy me surprises - or spoil me by cooking for me etc - but I just find the meaness that IS there quite offputting.... any advice please? I dont want to end things, but need to figure out how to get over this!!!

How long have you known him.  The sharing drink and popcorn is nice.  there is plenty of time to sit there with your own, whenyour old and grey hahahaha.  or when he buys it next time you follow him and buy your own
he doesnt sound mean, he buys you suprises or cooks for you.

The only advice I can offer is talk to him.  I used to overindulge my boyfriend, and one time he just sat down and talked to me, asking me to let him pay.  Kind of like, the opposite of what you have going.  Saying that, my sister's ex was very much like the guy you're dating seems to be.  I think you need to stand up for yourself (easier said than done, I know) and just talk to him.  Try not to get upset or angry or start an argument, this could only escalate the situation.  Tell him how you feel, hopefully he's man enough to accept that.

hope this helps - good luck.

Maybe he's just being frugal in the current financial climate we are all having to tighten our belts a little if we want to ride it out.

It could also be that money is his God and he worships at the alter of £££££££, you will never change this in him and if you already find it annoying that will only get worse.

It's also a sign of control, he has the purse strings therefore he decides what happens/where you go etc.

If this irritates you and it does, your best bet is sit down and talk with him.  If he doesn't know it irritates you, then he can't change the behavior.  As for how much you earn, that is your business and not his.  You have to understand that being a boyfriend entitles him to nothing.  He has not put a ring on your finger and until he does, your personal business is just that.  Sit down and have a heart to heart with him.  If he denies it or won't change, drop him like a hot potato.  Young ladies you have to have more self respect and not allow some guy to run your life.  It is one thing to be married to someone and share these things.  Make sure you can support yourself before you entertain the though of taking on some guy.

I would bet that your BF is a Cancerian. Being one myself I can tell you that Cancerians have a totally different take on money than anyone else. He would probably feel really hurt and misunderstood if you accused him of being "mean" Cancerians can be very clever with money and are not mean, but can be very easily misinterpreted. Wonder if Im right.?

Best thing to do is just always go half on everything that you both want and if gets annoyed with that you know he just wants money off you and gives you a chance to talk to him about it and get your point across.

Your guy seems sweet - little surprises, cooking for you and sharing drinks/popcorn - that is romantic! Lots of girls have guys that wouldn't dream of doing even these things and your complaining about it.

It's his money - let him spend it like he wants - if you want something get it yourself! Better still why don;t you buy the popcorn and drinks in the cinema for both of you - does he pay the tickets..??

Your going out with him for his personality not his money - right? If it's his money then dump him - he's better off without a golddigger like you!

<question>



My boyfriend's acting weird?



well his friend recently told me he liked me, so I told "Bob" because we try and keep from having secrets from each other. "Billy", his friend, constantly hits on me and tried to make a move as much as he can. the other day I was alone with my ex "Joe" who told me he just wanted to talk, I'm naive and believed him. Joe decided to take advantage of me... he pushed me up against a wall and started kissing me. I'm not strong and he is, so I couldn't really fight it.. told Billy in hopes for advice... Billy said to tell Bob so I did... Bob seemed mad, a little at me but more so at Joe. well now Bob is acting incredibly protective and more forceful. he's always been really gentle with me, but since this happened he'll grab my hand and physically move me if he wants to, pick me up roughly, and it's just more dominance than I'm used to. Any advice on how to get him back to normal?



</question>



<additional details>



it was actually at school... and I still sort of had feelings for... forgot what I named him... Billy I think?.. because he was my first real relationship and I had fallen for him.. he broke up with me.. which was main reason I thought it safe to have a conversation



er, Joe I mean... but I'd liked Billy longer than I'd even known Bob and I'm close friends with Billy

Give him time first. His ego has been dented cause of what your ex had done to you. Explain to him to calm down with you and not be so rough because your are after all an innocent party in all this.



You mentioned Billy and that's a separate problem. Don't meet with Billy for advice. If Bob is aware that he tries to hit on you all the time why would you want to meet him for advice? Gives him open chance at you. I'd make distance with Billy and always tell Bob the truth of whats going on. If Bob can't take it then maybe you need to find another person to be happy with.

bob , billy and joe, lol
heh sorry ^^,
i think he's just a bit grumpy
depending on how long ago this happened, he should just return to normal pretty soon
if you're game, talk to him. he probably hasn't quite grasped the fact that you didn't want or expect it to happen, and reminding him of this might making him realise
but if you don't want to talk to him about it, he'll kinda just have to let his fuse run dry, its natural for him to be like this; you are his, not joe's,



as for the forcefullness, i think he'll realise its a bit pointless soon enough, its not like joe is bob's split personality and he has to "hold onto you" constantly, right? :)
id say stay clear of joe for a while and later inform him you didn't appreciate it. joe is probably just jealous of you and bob. and now bob is jealous of joe taking advantage of you when he had you once already.
bottom line is bob obviously loves you and he should drop the act soon enough, after all, it is a bit pointless now and obviosuly doesnt make you feel too great =[ =]
good luck!

if he continues to act like that, talk to him

First Billy is a Dick. You should not confide in your BF's friend ( same one hitting on you).Bob should handle him firmly.Now Joe that is your problem. Probably not a great idea of meeting him alone. Where did you meet. Not at your place I hope. Bad. Bob is obviously still into you but seems to be having trust issues about this Joe thing. Who wouldn't. He was your ex. Try reassuring Bob and do something special for him. Also tell him you are not comfortable with his roughness.  If he listens. Great. If not then he is showing he cannot change and/or forget. Then it is up to you. Stay and work it out or tell him your leaving. Maybe he can change someday and you can reconnect. Life is short. Stay out of drama so much.  And if you did not want Bob to freak out maybe you could have keep one secret. Unless you are still into Joe and felt guilty?

Does having sex actually make a relationship better?



I waited 7 months before I slept with my girlfriend as due to a bad relationship beforehand/her first boyfriend she had an awful experience and had terribly low self esteem. That has gone now, she is strong and confident and very content. I have to admit I do adore her and thats why  even at certain points I decided to refuse her oncoming to ensure she was ready. In this case then, actually holding off (although i hit the tissue roll plenty of times)has shown her she is not just a girl but THE GIRL for me. So does good sex make a relationship great or the good relationship make sex great?

Sex actually made it worse for me. I abstained 6 months in my relationship till we finally did it.. it was great before it. After it is not so rosy.. we were both virgins but my partner seems to have certain expectations of how I should perform, even though she is inexperienced herself. If I do badly she gets annoyed and more distant, if I'm good she gets all cuddly and close. Well if you are having good sex all the time, that is great!! But I do not believe sex should be the driving part of a relationship - I value the companionship/relationship side better than the sex.

I think that was is so great about this is the fact that you really care about this girl. You have been willing to wait for her, that is coooolll!

I think that a good relationship can make sex great - you will both be so into eachothers needs and desires.

A relationship which is built up by sex can end up fading quite quickly, because you can find yourself not really caring about the other persons true character etc.

so good for you:)

It is  neither right  nor wrong..
Here you are concerned about only sex  and relationship mainly.
Between a husband -wife relationship the sex is rather a very important factor to get on to a good relationship to have a harmonious life. The husband has to satisfy the sex of his spouse.Then good sex makes your relationship great and this good relationship makes your sex also great.
Then it means that you love her and she loves you.
In extra marital cases,if it happens as said above it is mere a sex gratification and not real love.

Crisis? Middle age crisis at 16? Whiny lame kid? Who cares? Can someone please help?



I don't really know what to say. I'm really not feeling sorry for myself. I just feel so..I don't know, I guess depressed lately. I'm only 16, and I know most of the answer's I'll get is "Your young, you have your whole life ahead of you." or "Get over it, your young, everyone goes through tough times.". Anyways, I'll get to the point.



Since last year, I've just been feeling a bit depressed. I started smoking and smoking weed. I started doing shrooms once and a while, but I'm trying to stop everything. But it's not easy when the only few friends you have only want to hang out if your smoking weed. I always feel like ****, I don't have any close friends, and I don't have any close family. I just feel like when I graduate, I'll be an average joe with an average job, and no one I work with will know me. I don't feel like I'll be remembered by anyone. I used to be who I wanted to be, I used to have friends, and then I got into the wrong stuff. And now I'm growing up to be my dad. I ******* hate my dad. I don't get good grades in school because I don't try, and now I ****** my life up by taking the lower level classes. I can't switch out of them and take regular ones unless I go back and take the regular grade 10 classes.



There's this girl that I've liked since grade 6. We don't hang out in the same groups at all. We really only talk on msn or text eachother, but we have hung out a few times. Sometimes I think she likes me, but then she always seems annoyed with me. I never told her I like her, but I think she knows. Anyways, I'm friends with this other chick, and she went out with this guy named Dean. She said Dean was a douche, hes a huge stoner, drinks alot, and he is always just trying to get laid. And guess what, he's going out with the chick I like. I wouldn't say I'm jelious at all, because I don't think I have a chance with her, but its just that she's been baked once, and I really don't want her to start getting into the stuff I do. I don't want her getting drunk and having sex with him either! I don't know, I've tried to move on, but when I try to stop talking to her, or get my mind off her, I get a text from her or something. Before people start saying anything like "Don't go after her, shes not worth it" or "You wont even remember her". I know theres a very slim chance she will be in my life in a few years. But before shes out of my life, I want to be in hers.. She really isn't trying to get into that stuff, and she tries really hard to not let it happen.. And I know I can't control what she does, I'm not trying to, I don't want to, if I could control what she did and everything, she wouldn't be special. Heh, that sounded so lame, but whatever.

Lol, well there's my life story. I know it's not much compared to everyone else that posts, but I'd like answers on how to deal with things. If anyone wants to talk on msn or something, ask and I'll add you.



If someone actually read all this, thanks, because I really don't think alot of people will want to read it.



Thanks;

So here's my advice, for what it's worth. Take the regular 10th grade classes. Making the extra effort will be worth it. You sort of remind me of my older older brother.. He started ******* up his life at 16 and still hasn't stopped. Got caught with marijuana, and giving alcohol to minors. Parents bailed him out.. cost them 1500 that they didn't have to spend. He's 24. You don't want a life like that, and I'm proud of you for realizing that. Secondly, the girl thing. Dean sounds stupid. She'll realize it eventually. When she does, be there for her. She's bound to notice a sweet guy who made her feel better when life was really crappy. I wish you luck and all the best. Message me if you need to vent or ask questions. Oh, and about the depression.. I'm bipolar, makes things tricky.. I'm not medicated. Just find things that will make you smile. To get REAL friends, try  joining some teams and clubs.

for one thing, no, that didn't sound lame at all, and don't be so hard on yourself, other people may have "bigger" problems but that shouldn't stop you trying to find solutions to yours. you need to believ in yourself to others can help you =]

okay first things first, you wont be forgotten! do you REALLY think you wont make friends when you find work? do you really think no one wants to be your friend? your silly!! lol
honestly though, you don't sound like the type to be doing drugs and all that, you sound like a nice person and i think you are smarter than you think. and i really think you should stop doing the drugs, maybe thats why people "arent your friends"? the drugs scare them off? (if they know), because the people who do drugs have generally given up on life and need chemicals to mess with them so they can FEEL.
judging by what youve said you obviously don't need drugs to "feel". i was really...touched...is the word, as wrong as it may sound lol, by what you said about this girl, you obviously care for her deeply and want the best for her. theres nothing stopping you from being in her life, she will see how much of a better perosn you are than this idiot shes dating! i already hate him! (aha) 
if everyone had a boyfriend like you who genuinely care for them, and wasn't just interested in sex and pleasuring themselves everyone would be happy =]
i think you obviosuly deserve this girl, and i wouldnt be suprised if she did liek you,as you suspect sometimes, theres alot to like about you! but maybe your not goign about it the right way?
i think you really need to clean yourself up to be happy =] 
* take up those year 10 classes, i think youve got what it takes, and you can do it!



* TRY to give up the drugs , nobody should lower themselves to that level, you are better of without them
*those "friends" who hang out with you when you have weed aren't friends. you will be able to make newer, better, friends, trust me
*try to find something you enjoy doing,something that is constructive that will take your mind off things for a few minutes a day, a hobby or interest maybe? try a few things youev never tried before, like painting, or learn an instrument
*believe in yourself
* have the courage to talk to this girl after you've tried to fix yourself up. wait, that sounds horrible, "fix."  &gt;&lt; sorry. "better" yourself =]

and another thing, you obviously have an open mind, even just by saying you don't want to turn out like your dad, you are thinking about your future =]

ill be happy to talk to you over msn to help, i have a few other things that might help you but arent 100% sure about your situation. 
i just wont paste my email here as other people will get it lol =] how shall we go about it? ill make IM'ing me on here available for a while :)
sorry, that was a bit long but meh, i hoped i helped even in the slightest.
good luck!!
 you have something to give to this world =]

The girl I love broke it off, what should I do to get her back?



I know I have to give her some space.  She said she will never date me again but she was very angry when she said that so I kinda think its out of anger.  It has been three weeks and my impulse to call her has been making things worse.  I finally got my clothes back yesterday and the conversation started off calm and I left her mad at me again.  Any tips on how to go about this would really be appreciated.

You need to make whatever you did wrong, right.  Let her know and show her you're very sorry.  After that, give her some space so she can think about this.  Don't become impatient and too persistent, but continue to show her that you care, even if she doesn't agree to the relationship again.

Society places such a big value on being in a relationship. People like to impress others, and feel special and loved. I think people need to be alot more confident with who they are as individuals, and realize, that a single person can accomplish whatever they set their mind to doing, and it shouldn't depend on anyone else.Ialso think people are insecure, and feel the need to have another person to depend upon.

I'm just wondering because everyone I know puts up with so much just so they don't have to be alone and I don't understand it. For some reason I don't feel the need to be with someone, I feel whole already.

¿Puede hacerte vibrar el amor?



Anoche soñe con ella.

Yo iba corriendo por una avenida y ella salió por una calle lateral andando en su bicicleta.  La saludé moviendo mi mano y ella me contestó con un gesto amable.  Atravesé la calle y continué mi carrera a su lado sintiendome muy contento en su compañia..  No hubo palabras, no eran necesarias.  Los dos sabíamos que estabamos unidos.  Era una sensación maravillosa; Libertad, la brisa calida golpeando mi cuerpo al ritmo de la carrera y ella a mi lado.

En ese momento me desperté.

Intencionalmente no me moví para nada, volví a cerrar los ojos y pensé en ella.  Su imagen apareció en mi mente.  Clara y nítida.  Estaba dormida con su larga cabellera esparcida sobre la cabicera en tranquilidad y paz.

Fué entonces cuando empesé a sentir esa vibración.  No eran temblores, eran mas suves. Tampoco escalofrios ni calambres. Mas bien fué como un eco que inició en el centro de mi pecho a la altura de mi corazón y se esparciò en un instante por todo mi ser.



Noté de pronto una ligera sensación cálida y tibia en mi costado que provenìa del lado vacio de mi cama, y supe (o al menos creo) que era ella.

Pude percibir el tranquilo ritmo de su respiración y contuve el deseo de darme la vuelta y marcar suavemente sus labios por el temor de interrumpir su sueño.

El ruido de un relàmpago me distrajo. Y así como apareciò, subitamente la sensación de estar vibrando y ese calorcito a mi lado se desvaneció.  Su imagen se fué y sólo quedó el recuerdo de un instante verraquero. ¡Vaya pija camarita!.

Sin temor a parecer soroco pregunto: ¿Será posible que el amor te haga vibrar?



</question>



<additional details>



Del diccionario de modismos:



cabicera: almohada
pija camarita: expresión de gusto.
marcar: besarse.
soroco: tonto, estúpido.
verraquera: cosa fantástica, muy buena.

hola por supuesto que este te hace vibrar, incluso cuando lo deseas tanto puedes sentir que esa persona no solo te acompaña en tus sueños, sino durante todo el dia, no puedes sacarla de la mente al caminar, te sonries solo al imaginarte las cosas que hiciste o que pudieras hacer, que hablaste o que pudieras hablar, que compartiste o pudieras compartir con ella, en fin cuando suñas tan lindo con una persona jamas hay limites para seguir disfrutando de esa sensacion tan hermosa que es sentirla a tu lado a cualquier momento, sabes el amor es el unico don que jamas tiene final para la persona que lo siente, porque podras terminar con tu pareja pero jamas podras olvidar ningun momento de esa relacion, jams podras olvidar cuando reian por tonterias, cuando peleaban, cuando se agarraban de la mano con tanto amor, en fin  cuando uno ama jamas lo deja de hacer, asi esos recuerdos aparezcan muy remotamente en tu mente o en tu corazon, pero siempre sabras que tuvistes el don tan hermoso de sentir el amor.

El amor casi siempre te hace vibrar, si no yo no hubiera formulado la pregunta que me contestaste tan tentamente. Esa es la razón por la cual buscoa a alguien que vaya "más allá de la cama". Por lo que parece tú estás enamorado, pero ten cuidado, si bien el amor es algo hermoso y te hace vibrar, debes tratar de llevarlo al plano de la realidad, como sueño fue muy lindo, pero: piensa en los sentimientos de ella, acércate, vé sus reacciones. cerciórate si siente lo mismo. Tal vez sí. 
A mi me encantaría que alguien se enamorara de mí en esa forma y sueñe conmigo, pero eso no basta no lo es todo. 
Suerte, que seas correspondido por ella.

fantasmi:
el amor no solo te hace vibrar, te hace morir y vivir en segundo, en un abrir y cerrar de ojos te transporta hasta el mas lejano rincon de tu alma, y el amor no lo provoca el corazon, lo crea el cerebro, para los poetas sera un poco frio pero asi es, la mente es capaz de hacerte pasar por miedo, angustia, alegria y dolor con solo traer un recuerdo a ella, imaginate si se conjugan todos los sentimientos bonitos que te hace sentir una persona, no solo te hace vibrar...........
te hace VIVIR.

Porsupuesto que sí!!!!!!! y no necesariamente que sea de forma física, es decir no somos gatos ronroneando, pero el amor puede hacer cosas inimaginables!!!! Desde curar enfermedades, o por lo menos síntomas feos de éstas, hasta mover la voluntad de la gente.



Eso que sentiste se debe a que estas enamorado! Junto con eso viene la ilusión, las ganas de estar con esa persona, la alegría espontánea que pareciera que no tiene razón,



En fin, que bonito que estes sintiendo eso, ah! por cierto me gustó mucho tu redacción =) me hizo adentrarme en la historia.

Why do some men just don't get it?



My daughter asked me this morning, on the way to school,  why I do everything in the house and work full time.  I ask her what do you mean?  Well, she said, she notices me cooking, cleaning, work full time, schedule 3 kids school functions, manage the money, go grocery shopping, and know when to start christmas shopping, mow the lawn, feed the dog, feed the lizard thing, know when we need new sneakers, or need to get the kids hair cuts, know when there is something bothering us and you take the time to actually make us chocolate chip cookies before we go to bed.  When you ask dad to mow the lawn or help put a load of laundry in the dryer he acts like its the end of the world.



Then she said I don't think I want to be a mom or a wife its like working overtime all the time. No breaks.



I just started to cry, I sometimes think about it, I get anxious about there is so much to do  and just do it, otherwise all hell breaks lose. Yes the kids help with dishes and my husband too sometimes, and the kids do their own laundry, I just have to guide them to do it.  But why is it SOME men can only handle one thing at a time?

studies find that women can multi task so well and men can't.  Mom's have that special mother's intuition to know when something it wrong, dads don't have that usually.  Mothers are care givers and see their moms juggle it all.  Thats why being a mom is such a huge thing.  Wifes and mothers are the ones who keep the house running.

From what you have stated that you do, you are a Super Mom and a Super Woman!

I would start having your husband help out.  You will burn out and he should help you out.  Sit down and tell him look I can't do it all forever and I need your help.

It works best that way. God made men to just do one thing at a time. He made women to multi task. If you ask me, the world probably would be better off if we had a woman President. She could probably get everything done at once!

Men are focused with their tasks and women are built to be multi-taskers.  He should still be able to do those chores, only one at a time.  This is a physiological difference between the way men and women's brains are wired.

i think your hubby needs to have the whole thing put to him and make him share more. If not there needs to be a power sharing deal. Personally i take care of my girl because i love her and it really is equal in our affairs. I do all the washing clothes and stuff because admittedly she is the better cook but i love to surprise her by giving her some days off. Just bring it to his face. Wont be because he doesnt love u but i guess he has just got accustomed to it just as much as you have!

Does she work outside the house?  If she does you might want to sit down and talk to her.  Both of you need to make a list of jobs around the house and take responsibility for things that need to be done.  May be she would rather cut the grass.  She might not be too good at the jobs that you are expecting her to do and she might need to learn how to do them.  If she is a stay at home wife, she may be depressed.  It is not easy being alone all day.  Honestly, you need to talk this out before it becomes a bad situation.

Are you living in 1860?  Women work now and taking care of kids is a full time job.  And does she never cook or sometimes is there no dinner for the big strong man of the house?  Can't you stir a pot?  Boil water?  Press your own shorts?  It's called being a team.  If one member of the team is falling behind, the other members pick up the slack...  don't you remember that?

Are there things she needs you to do that you don't? Does that make you a bad husband? No. Like one of the previous answers says, you need to talk about this. There are a lot of things that may play a part in this as well. Children, work, depression etc. I am in a relationship where I am the full time house wife, full time worker, and full time mom. I do my best for meals, cleaning, etc. ( and I do a very good job) :), but I do not press his clothes for 1 I don't know how for 2 if I did that what would he do. I pull 80% of the weight around the home and it gets tiring. So there are a lot of things to consider. Hope that helped.

I'm a guy but from experience i'd say this was an individual thing. Most sexual health clinics offer free condoms and lube now. So its very much worth trying the lube to ease your first few times at sex. Important thing is not to expect too much from it as its often a disappointment for women. You don't need to add stress that can make you uptight that will just make it uncomfortable in more than one way.

Good luck.

Help! My best friend's mom thinks I am a lesbian?



Me and my best friend "experimented" for about two weeks in May, just to explore our feelings. Turns out we both are totally straight. But, when we were "experimenting", I sent her an email revealing that we have done such things. Her mom saw the email, and ever since, she's been thinking I am a lesbian.



How can we convince her that both of us are straight? All the time my friend is at my house, her mom calls to check in and implies that we are doing "stuff". I do not want her mom getting this completely wrong idea. What can we do? (We are both 15).



Her mom is not a homophobic or anything, she is very liberal, but we still do not want her thinking we are lesbians/bisexual because if we're just hanging out as friends, she thinks we are doing "stuff" together



Thanks

I think your friend should talk to her mom about this, not you.  If your friend feels uncomfortable talking about it, maybe she can write it in a letter.  But I wouldn't worry about it - it's your friend that should feel weird.



add on:  You will not go to HELL as these no-brained, closed minded religious freaks want you to believe.  This is why there are so many teenage suicides because of people like that.  You did nothing wrong.  You experimented - and discovered you're not a lesbian.

if i was her mother... if i found out my daughter was doing that at all, especially with a girl tho, i'd kill her! if homophobic means being against homosexuals, then her mom has every right to be! first that will send you to hell. Its not normal to experiement with it. Secondly, if i was her mom, i wouldn't have to be calling and implying anything because she would never leave her room again. her friends would have to come to her house until she were old enough to make smarter decisions. its sad that you think this is no big deal. i feel sorry that her mom and yours that has to deal with this. i hope you have apologized and not acted like you had the right to do that.

Experimentation is natural. But the problem is your friends
because of your email. There's a lot of grief that goes with being lesbian and her mother is worried. That's understandable. Don't feel guilty and don't let someone lay a trip on you. Relax.

You have just did the wrong thing. If you and your best friend have been friends and have known each other why do you have to do the "experimenting" thing?What for instance did you try experimenting? It's absurd to me. Naturally, your email stating the "experimenting" would insinuate suspision from the mother. It is just a natural reaction from a mother. I would suggest that you guys should apologize for it and prove your sincerity.

This just proves anything you place on the internet, or e-mail for that matter, becomes public domain.  Be careful what you put on myspace, facebook, youtube, etc.  It may come back to haunt you in your adult life.



But to answer your question.  It is up to your friend to have a discussion with her mother, there is nothing you can do.

I need some help here..please!?



Ok, well, I have a question..it's hard to even ask...but I really need some help.  I don't know what to do anymore.  My girlfriend and I are constantly fighting (we are both female).



I know all couples fight, but this is ridiculous.  Every time she does something that she later regrets,like yelling or throwing objects or eveytime she lies to me about anything, I catch her and then she always apologizes and then I forgive her because she cries.  I feel like I am being manipulated.  I shouldn't have to go through what she is putting me through.  I love her so much and I couldn't imagine life without her, but I am tired of just forgiving her for the same stuff over and over just because she cries and I then makes me feel sorry for her...please help me...Should I stay with her because I love her, or is she manipulating me?  I am really stuck here...thanks in advance for any help!

Believe me...I know how you feel. I kinda have the same problem with my bf (minus the crying part :) )
Well, i think whether or not you should stay with her depends on the severity of the things she does to upset you.



Try and retrospect-are they really big things or small issues; b'cuz sometimes fighting over the same issues over and over makes them seem bigger than they really are)
Second, see how happy you are on an average.



If you leave her, do you think you will be happier?
I can only give you suggetsions, but the ultimate decision is yours and how you feel

You probably need a man's point of view, but here are my thoughts.



Men may break up with women they "like" because they aren't ready to make a committment and they want to see other women to be sure they aren't missing anything.



They may discover in time that the woman they left was actually the best of the bunch, but until they shop around, they won't know that.



Unfortunately, it is usually too late to recapture what they had once they come to that conclusion.  By then the woman has moved on, and rightfully so.

Leave him.  His destructive behavior seems to have already spread to the rest of the family (and if it hasn't, it will), and what he's doing isn't fair to you or the kids.  You deserve better, your kids deserve better, and there's little chance he'll change.



He can only bring you down, I fear.



Sorry to hear that, by the way.  Good luck.

Addiction is a terrible thing.  It changes otherwise good people into lying, stealing, self-centered monsters.  They no longer care about loved ones;  they care only about the next "high" or getting the money by any means to get their fix.  Even if he were to go to rehab, the odds are high he would return to his addictive behavior.



Addicts only change when they truly want to change and not before.  Sometimes they have to hit rock bottom to realize what they've done, but most continue their destructive behavior even when they lose their family, their job, and their self-respect.



I am terribly sorry for your situation, especially with children involved.  But you do not do your children any favors by keeping them in this environment.  They may miss their father for a time, but when they are older they will understand.



You need to get out for your sake and for the sake of your children.



Things will not get better, only worse.



I hope you have family you can turn to to help you get established on your own.  If not, there are community resources in most places that can help.  Look in your local Yellow Pages for crisis centers for women and children.



I wish you luck.

how are you being a bad mother if you take them out of a home where this man has a seriously bad habit if he doesn't get help he can only get worse and one day can possibly take it out on you and the children since people under the influence cant control there actions try to get him to a rehab and if all fails do what you have to for the sake of the children there future depends on it it doesn't mean he cant visit them maybe the break will give him a wake up call and if it doesn't then are you willing to deal with his behavior for the rest of your life also are you doing it for the children or for yourself by sticking around

Has to be tall, and reasonably good looking...certainly not weedy.  Well dressed is not necessary, but it adds to respect.  Greying hair looks good, it implies maturity and knowledge.  Must be able to keep people under his thumb without having them resent, or hate, him.  So what is that...assertiveness.  He needs to imply POWER, whether his own, or that of his paid heavies.

An "Alpha male" is usually someone who has a naturally dominant personality.  This does not mean that he has to dominate others but simply by virtue of his personality it happens.  He does not need to fight for his position or demand respect.  He gains his position through his actions and commands respect simply by who he is.  There is no need for him to PROVE his dominance it just IS.



Such a man has a command of himself, his perspective, his nature and his life.  Often a man in his 40's will be considered more Alpha based on his life experience.  In reality, however, it is not bounded by age.  An Alpha man will show himself early in life.  Such a man also balances his dominant tendencies with the desire and ability to protect and guide those around him.  He is concerned for their welfare and well-being.  Much like any proper leader or Alpha he serves those around him through protecting and guiding them.

<question>



Why didn't he hold me this time? Is he intimdated again?



Shy guy and i have been "hanging out" since summer started. We're very close and comfortable physically and mentally - could be ourselves around each other. He hasn't said or mentioned anything abt status but things his actions definitely speak louder. (smiles like he's gonna laugh but not, teasing, etc...)



During this time, there's this routine tht goes on. Everytime we hang out, it's at his room chillin watchin dvds. Routine: grabbing a pillow to provoke pillow fight, tickling me, lying on me w or w/o his pillow, asking for massage, giving massages & by the end of it, he's holding me. One night in August, we got most intimate - wore his button down shirt w. just my bra/undies. Tickled me, wnted him to stop so i kissed him on the cheek n he stopped. Didn't see him for a while after and did want me to keep his shirt...



NOW, we're back to hanging out more frequently and has been tutoring me in my class - offering me help. He does all of the above routine EXCEPT holding me :( when i would hint that i wanted to be held...instead of sharing the futon w. me, he sat on the floor close to me :( I don't get it...:(

What can i do to win her heart?



I met this girl 4 months ago. I have feelings for her. However , she is waiting for a guy now. The guy told her that he is unable to commit into a relationship yet due to studies. They will be together next February once he completes his studies. She also confided in me that the guy treats her like trash. He never showers her with love nor affection. They rarely spend time together. She wanted to give up on him but could not do it. I told her she deserves someone better but to no avail. She decided to hold on. She once said that she hoped the guy was like me. Last month , i could not hide my feelings anymore. So i decided to confess my feelings to her. It was a terrible mistake. In the past , she used to contact me and asked about my day etc. We used to hang out at least once a week. But it is no longer happening. Her level of interest in me seems to diminish. I still try to text message her and pretend nothing has happen. But i don't think it is working. She don't initiate contact anymore.I text message her once to make a date. But she did not reply me. What should i do now? Should i move on? Or is there any other way i can do to make her level of interest in me soar again?

I think you know the answer to this question.. Her heart is with someone else.Even though she says that he treats her like trash and he never shows her effection, and  ..If she gets married to this guy she will be unhappy.But she knows what shes getting herself into because she has discussed this with you.. So she isnt going into things blind..
The both of you had  a great friendship together in the beginning and you both trusted each other enough to share personal imformation about each other..It sounds to me that maybe since you told her that you had feelings for her that she has stepped back and analyze things.She might be feeling overwhelmed right now.. We both know her heart belongs to someone else..If  She needs to sort out what she needs and wants right in her life..I would just  give her some space and let her contact you..I would just call her and leave her a message that if she needed someone to talk to that you would still be there  for her as a friend .. But can you put aside your true feelings for her and just reain a friend?

do not fret...i myself am a proud Navy Brat and the first time we moved after 10 years in the same city (VA Beach), was to California! I was scared too at first because of the friends thing too (i was going into my last year in middle school, soon off to high school) and don't worry about it! i made some of the best friends i've ever had in california and we still stay in contact and visit each other since i have moved since.  and we just got orders again to go back to CA! i cannot wait! i'm sure you will love it and fit in perfectly, just dont be afraid to introduce yourself and jump right in!

The best answer gets 5 points, and any critisisms, then I will report abuse!!!?



I have a friend who is bi-sexual and he told his cousin this secret. His cousin will not except it and will not speak to him again. My friend has been seeing his cousin again for 2 months, because something happened five years ago and they hadn't seen each other since. He spoiled his chances of seeing his cousin again. Nobody knows his bi-sexual secret apart from me and his cusion, and is afraid to talk to anybody else about it.



He wants to see his cusion again, but he is afraid to speak to him. Any ideas on how to make him come round.

Perhaps someone like yourself could act as a go between to persuade his cousin to talk to him.
Otherwise a letter from him explaining his thoughts and feelings about losing his cousins friendship might work.
And just for the record...its wasn't very nice to threaten to report people just for criticising, some criticism can be very positive.

You can't really, opinions like this can't be forced out of a person as it's a personal view point (i.e. there isn't really any evidence you could present to make it right in his eyes). His cousin will have to work it out for himself. He will either come round or remain ignorant. All your friend can do is wait.

I think if his cousin is unwilling to accept him for what he is then it's him who has the problem. he might come round,given time, but i don't think forcing the issue will help. I'm sure your friend will find that not everyone is narrow minded.

The cousin is obviously not o.k with the idea of your friend being bi.



Which is ashame, as if they got on well before this then his sexuality should never be an issue.



I know your friend will want to speak to his cousin but if he doesn't want to speak to him then there's not a lot he can do.



The only thing I would suggest is if he phoned him to speak about it and ask why he has a problem with it, as it doesn't involve him, he just thought he might understand. Get him to tell him that he valued him as trustworthy and that's why he told him this in confidence.



Other than that, I would get him to forget about his cousin if he doesn't come round and find some new friends. I know it's his family but there's no point in him beating himself up about it.

Your poor friend.  He shouldn't work so hard to be liked by his cousin.



If his cousin cannot accept his sexuality, and will not speak to him because of this, advise your friend not to chase after him.  The cousin sounds manipulative and mean.  At the end of the day, your friend is his family, and just because someone is bi-sexual is not a reason to ignore them forever!

I think my bloke is sleeping around??



I have been seeing my new bloke for about 4 months.. We met on the internet and have been dating since.. I thought things were really good, we spend lots of time together sex life was ok but this last week he seems half way though sex he seems to suddenly lose his errection saying its because of the condom or he just stops half way through and says he can't come because he has already mastubated that day.. Was getting a bit annoyed at it yesterday and told him. thought it best to be open.  An we went to bed and ad great sex.... Then last night when he ad gone home i was messing on internet and just clicked on the dating site we ad met on and it showed he ad been active so i made up a  false person and emailed him saying hello, asking if he ad found his mrs right yet. I never expected him to reply but he did. (Obviously he has no idea its me) He said he was single and asked this if i was up for a bit of fun.. i am gutted i really thought he liked me. If i ask him about it i know he will lie his way out of it.  Should i call it off now or try an catch him out???? Feel i need to know for definate.... He has always since i av been with him been protective over his phone he goes mad if i touch it saying his ex never let him av a mobile because she was really insecure. So never really thought anything of it.  Didn't for one min think he was hiding anythin from me.... Are all men cheating lieing scumbags??????

No, of course they're not all lying cheating scumbags, but it appears as though your man is. Sorry hun.



You tested him and he failed.



I did this to my man in the beginning of our relationship but he was saying that he was happy and he loved me and wouldn't cheat on me.



Move on and forget about him, he has it in him to be deceitful, if i were you i would end the relationship.

No they are not if you got married befour you had sex and met a decent bloke instead of dating sites you would not have this problem.

sweety, your situation doesnt sound sweet at all. You have caught him out already!



i am not the most experienced in sex ed but i know a lot for my age even though i havent had it HA, but if he has masturbated that day im pretty sure he should still *** if you two have sex.



if you like him A LOT, im guessing you will most definately find it hard to leave him. But think about it, is he doing something good or bad? and if having you isnt pleasing him both sexually and emotionally, so much so as to pretend he is single to get more action from someone else, do you think he likes you the way he DID?



if you want, try to talk to him about it and find out more, then make a decision. He is only you boyfriend at the moment though, and there are plenty of tasty fish out in the sea. follow you heart. if a man is sneaking behind you back you should do something about it.



and if you ask me, i dont really think all men are bastards, but it is hard to find a decent one for yourself. i know it is for me :P

The bloke is the male equivalent to a SLAG.



Unfortunately, the majority of men who used those particular websites are looking for sex.  They don't mind who, where, or how.  They usually have a few different women, and get sex with each one.



NOT all men are lying cheating scumbags at all.  The truth is.......if you want a decent, honest, reliable man for a proper relationship, you need to first get to know a man through other means (work, hobbies, sports, friends, etc) and really get to know him, find out where he works, what he likes to do in his spare time, etc., etc., BEFORE you get to know him sexually.

I dont think you even need to confront him about it, just say that its over and if he asks why then just say that you know that he would be willing to cheat on you if he hasnt already. You dont really need to give him an explanation but if he insists then just tell him the truth, that your instincts were telling you something so you followed them and that the other girl on the internet was you and that you now know for sure that he is not the right guy for you since he clearly cant keep it in his pants. It doesnt matter if he says that it was wrong of you to trick him as this will just be anger that he has been found out!

I'm 35 and my boyfriend is 25. He said he'd never had sex before, so I was the first for him. The problem is, I find it stupid that he can't penetrate himself and ALWAYS asks me to 'guide' him to penetrate me. He's tried himself to do it by his own, but he just can't. What do u say about it? Is he really dumb?

This is a f***ed up question, sorry. I wasn't able to penetrate in sex for a while, it didn't make it any worse for the girls I was with. In fact, they looked at it as a cute thing. Think of the glass as half full, not empty. You should be happy he's not experienced at it. Him losing his virginity to you is something very important to him, and you shouldn't get mad at him over something so small and insignificant! D:&lt; This kind of thing makes me angry, people go into sex because they either love the person, are finding love for the person, or just want the feeling. To me it seems like he is one of the first two, because why would he have waited so long otherwise? It seems like you're either looking at what he's doing as a negative action, or are just in it so you can get the feeling. You have no reason to blame him. I'm not speaking because I couldn't penetrate for a while, I'm speaking solely objectively. You're getting mad and negative for no reason, look at it as a good thing, that he saved his virginity for roughly 12 years he could have lost it in for you. Who cares he can't penetrate?!

What's the deal with everyone freaking when they hear that a 16yo is having sex?



Kids have been doing it for decades at least, more like centuries. Juliette was only 13 for pete's sake. Everyone keeps screaming about how these kids need to grow up when in reality, they do. 16yos out there having sex is nothing new, and isn't going to change. All you can do is calmly give them the right advice, to get on BC and use condoms. Stop chastising and do something constructive for a change. If more was taught in school about condoms and safer sex and they weren't so focused on abstinence (come on, stopping a teen is like stopping a speeding bullet mid-air) there might not be such a problem with teen pregnancy, and maybe even fewer cases of STIs running around.



Who here agrees?

Because sex makes babies. They don't want you to have to deal with certain things just yet. Contraceptives don't always work.



Also the second guy I slept with swore I gave him herpes. I went to planned parent hood and a medical Dr and got tested, about a year apart, after I  met someone else, just to be careful. I don't have herpes, but that jerk did. People are not looking out for what is best for you, just them, sad to say.



You are right, more should be taught in schools, but idiots cannot be taught and they are the ones we have to worry about. I htink 16 would be more grown if 16 year olds had more responsibility, but why do you want to grow up so fast?



And just to add to your point, an unplanned pregnancy is always difficult. Plus if you had a kid at 16 you would still be young when they moved out. No one thinks about that.



Good luck

She has recently been asking about her other cousins (my ex's neice) I contacted my ex's sister in law via friends reunited (I sent a e-card saying hello - nothing else) and he e-mailed my sister stating I was harassing them and that he'll "contact the police if it continues" all my daughter wanted to do was see her cousins again.

He is still being a control freak. It might be as well to go through the courts and do everything legally as that way he cannot complain to anyone. It is also up to your sister in law if she would like your daughter to see her cousin. It seems that he just cannot let go and move on. I had this problem but soon got it sorted. good luck.

Why didn't he hold me this time? Is he intimdated again?



Shy guy and i have been "hanging out" since summer started. We're very close and comfortable physically and mentally - could be ourselves around each other. He hasn't said or mentioned anything abt status but things his actions definitely speak louder. (smiles like he's gonna laugh but not, teasing, etc...)



During this time, there's this routine tht goes on. Everytime we hang out, it's at his room chillin watchin dvds. Routine: grabbing a pillow to provoke pillow fight, tickling me, lying on me w or w/o his pillow, asking for massage, giving massages & by the end of it, he's holding me. One night in August, we got most intimate - wore his button down shirt w. just my bra/undies. Tickled me, wnted him to stop so i kissed him on the cheek n he stopped. Didn't see him for a while after and did want me to keep his shirt...



NOW, we're back to hanging out more frequently and has been tutoring me in my class - offering me help. He does all of the above routine EXCEPT holding me :( when i would hint that i wanted to be held...instead of sharing the futon w. me, he sat on the floor close to me :( I don't get it...:(



</question>



<additional details>



When he gives massages he somtimes but his hand below my shirt but has still been very RESPECTFUL. Also when i thanked him for help, i put my arm around to hug and he rested his head on my arm...maybe he's not interested anymore? :( started hanging out in june and now it's october



PS: we have our own lives - we don't see/text/hang out w. each other everyday...play it by ear and hopefully see each other once a week...he's usually the one who initiates this flirting...



HE HELD ME BEFORE, WHY CAN'T HE DO IT AGAIN NOW? I promise you, i'm not pressuring/forcing him...not expecting a move now...i'm just wondering why he won't hold me now...what happened?

Lol, yeah we're ugly from the front :P Haha, I don't know, I'm not guilty of the boobie thing,to be honest I have little to show off in that region, but I think the side on or above pictures is just an act of insecurity because you can't see as much face. Plus it gives u angles and shows off your cheek bones. =P Sorry, does it irritate you? He he. X

I don't try to attract the cleavage personally...('cause I don't have one, thank god). I basically try to copy whatever pose I like from pin-ups, like Brigitte Bardot or barbarella jane fonda. I like reminding people of the classics with a gothic-tomboy flair of my own.

How much are your personal morals worth?



If someone offered you a lot of money to do something you (personally) find immoral, would you do it???



Or would it depend on the amount of money???



Or are your morals worth more to you than anything, so you'd refuse the money???

Well it could mean that but you never know, it might just mean that he misses having someone there for him, emotionally and affectionately.



Also you have to know that your mutual friend could be misinterpereting things.



You should talk to him and find out from him what exactly he misses, you sound like the two of you used to be pretty close, so it shouldn't be very difficult to talk to him about it, who knows maybe you guys will get back together and be better than before.

I doubt that they will refund the money they paid for your coarse.  I guess they really cant do anything if you continue to hang out with your friends.  The real question is how much do you want to became a pharmaciest?  If you think you can balance going out with your friends and the pressure of doing the coarse I don't see any reason why you have to stop hanging out with them.  Your parents just have to learn to trust you.

Have you talked to him about it?



I've come to find that it's just a guy thing. Actually, come to think of it, I know some girls that are in relationships that do it too.



Before you let it get to you, you should ask him about it. But don't accuse him or anything, don't talk down to him or interrogate him or anything. Just casually ask, "hey what's with this". You guys have been together for a year and a half, so you should get a pretty honest answer out of him.

I would feel creepy if I found this out too.
It would cause a real issue with me.
I'd feel like maybe he was sometimes thinking of other women and situations when he was with me.



If it was just a little, but you say "loads" of sites.

Two things, yes it's normal and no you're not wrong.  It's normal for people to do rubbish things, but think about it, this porn has only been all over computers in the past few years and now everyone's paying into this massive world ring of prostitution like it's ok!



I've fallen for it, most people have and find it hard to stay away from, it has nothing to do with him thinking he's not happy with you or fancying other women, it's just fascinating.  But you should confront him about it because it's not ok.  Chances are he'll be very defensive and tell you everyone looks at porn like that makes it fine, but it isn't fine, it's a nasty business.  Don't be hard on him or horrible, but make sure he tries to stop and make sure he can come to you when he slips up, which he will!



If he's having a really hard time quitting to the point of it ruining your relationship look on google for porn addiction help (with safesearch on!) and you'll soon find you are far from alone.



It is a huge temptation when it's just handed to you on a plate and guys are very visual creatures, girls get off more on an emotional and intellectual level.



Don't be too angry, be calm and understanding, all sorts of people are falling for this big worldwide phenomenon, but let him know it hurts you.

It's pretty normal, most guys do it. I wouldn't be upset about it, the reason he hides it from you is because he obviously knows you wouldn't like it......most women don't.



I don't see any big reason to be upset over it because at least he's just looking at dirty sites, and not real life women, which is what I would be more worried about if I were in your position.



If he "gets enough" at home from you, you probably have nothing to worry about.

its not a normal thing for a guy, its a Common thing. guys on here will tell its no big deal because hes a guy. and women will make excuses telling you its normal and that its nothing personal. women who are affected by this and hurt by this are always ignored. 10 out of 10 hes not going to stop watching it. if men can't let go of porn, they are not ready for a relationship, and i truly believe this. women come on here complaining and men just dont seem to care about their feelings. so hes not going to stop. you either have to deal with it and accept it, or move on to a guy who doesn't need pleasure from a bunch of women he doesn't know.

In a rut and seriously upset...?



I'll give you some background...I've been with my fiance for almost 4 years.  We've been engaged for 2 and have a beautiful 22 month old daughter together.  He's 10 years older than me if that makes a difference.  I'd say for the last two months or so, we are stuck in a rut.  The problem is that he is TOTALLY oblivious to it.  I'm very much into the little things...little love notes, a flower here or there, or just a random text to make my day better.  I've gotten nothing.  Absolutely NOTHING recently.  I feel like I'm just one of his buddies.  I told him two weeks ago about all of this and he was okay for about a week and then it just started all over again.  If I get any physical attention from him at all, he's either poking me, tickling me, or just putting his hand down my pants.  He's not romantic, although he used to be all the time.  He has no happy medium.  He can't just give me a kiss or a hug without aggravating me by tickling or trying to make me sleep with him.  Honestly, I get more attention when I leave the house than I do from him.  He just doesn't treat me like his significant other.  I feel like one of the guys.  I'm beyond over all of this.  He asks what's wrong, I tell him and he loses it and just won't talk to me.  IF I DO tell him, he gets pissed and thinks I'm stupid for thinking what I think.  I'm just so sick of not feeling like I mean anything to him.  We're getting married in April, but if this behavior continues, there's no way.  Has anyone else dealt with this?  He has no idea what he's doing wrong, even when I tell him. It's so aggravating.  I slept on the couch last night because he wouldn't stop tickling me even when I asked him.  That seems to be his way of making things better but all it does is piss me off even more.  I'm over this BS and sick and tired of how he acts.  I'm not one of the guys.  I'm not here for just his sexual pleasure either.  Isn't there somewhere in between where we can be happy and be a normal COUPLE?  I'm not his friend...I'm his FIANCEE!



</question>



<additional details>



I send him sweet texts a few times a week.  I leave nice little notes on the fridge.  I AM his friend and AM one of the guys whenever he wants me to be.  I clean the house.  I take care of our child.  I work full time and go to school full time.  I tell him I love him whenever I get the chance.  Whenever I try to mess around with HIM, he draws back and looks at me like I'm the most disgusting girl he knows, but it's fine when he wants to put HIS hands down MY pants.  HE'S the one who won't play on the two-way street.  Thats my point with all of this.  He has a HUGE double standard.  He asks what's wrong.  I tell him and he gets pissed off.  If I don't tell him he gets upset.  It's so ironic.  I can't make him happy no matter what I do.  He does nothing for me, though.  When is it time for HIM to start acting like a fiance?

Sounds like you need a bit of a lifestyle change
1. Look at your goals (and make them) - work out what you want to do with your life, and how you can achieve them
2. Take up exercise, or something extra curricular
3. Discuss feelings with bf - nobody deserves to be treated badly in a relationship. Decide on necessary action to take
4. Speak to parents, obviously they want you to be doing something differently with you life. Discuss the goals you have, and then ask for their help to support you to achieve them. Discuss how they see your life, and how they want it to change.



(remember the goals need to be realistic - short, medium and long term)

Hi Ashley, wow major problems, but can be sorted.
With your father, look at the reasons why you don't want to visit him, and tell him, also tell him what needs to happen before you will consider visiting him.
Your b/f, well you can't control who he sees, but coming back covered in hickeys suggests that this guy is no good for you, and this unfaithfulness by him is certainly doing bad things to your self esteem, making it so that you don't want to go out, simply because you are reminded of all the sh*t happening to you when you do.
Your step father sounds a right ***. He should not be referring to you in those terms, unless he has actual proof, and really your mother should be stepping in for your defence.
To start the solution, get rid of the b/f, you can't trust him, and that means you are going to feel down.
Find someone with a decent personality and sense of humour, that's going to make you feel good and help you believe in yourself, and have you thinking  about him for the right reasons when you are apart.
Having sorted this part of your life out, hopefully you will feel like going out more and socialising with people who aren't going to put you down, but treat you with respect.



This should rub off at home, especial;ly when you introduce the new guy, and he shows that he's interested in you as a person, and not just a mattress.
As I said at the start, it isn't going to be easy, but hopefully this will help along the way a bit.
Mike t.

Have you talked to him about it?



I've come to find that it's just a guy thing. Actually, come to think of it, I know some girls that are in relationships that do it too.



Before you let it get to you, you should ask him about it. But don't accuse him or anything, don't talk down to him or interrogate him or anything. Just casually ask, "hey what's with this". You guys have been together for a year and a half, so you should get a pretty honest answer out of him.

Two things, yes it's normal and no you're not wrong.  It's normal for people to do rubbish things, but think about it, this porn has only been all over computers in the past few years and now everyone's paying into this massive world ring of prostitution like it's ok!



I've fallen for it, most people have and find it hard to stay away from, it has nothing to do with him thinking he's not happy with you or fancying other women, it's just fascinating.  But you should confront him about it because it's not ok.  Chances are he'll be very defensive and tell you everyone looks at porn like that makes it fine, but it isn't fine, it's a nasty business.  Don't be hard on him or horrible, but make sure he tries to stop and make sure he can come to you when he slips up, which he will!



If he's having a really hard time quitting to the point of it ruining your relationship look on google for porn addiction help (with safesearch on!) and you'll soon find you are far from alone.



It is a huge temptation when it's just handed to you on a plate and guys are very visual creatures, girls get off more on an emotional and intellectual level.



Don't be too angry, be calm and understanding, all sorts of people are falling for this big worldwide phenomenon, but let him know it hurts you.

It's pretty normal, most guys do it. I wouldn't be upset about it, the reason he hides it from you is because he obviously knows you wouldn't like it......most women don't.



I don't see any big reason to be upset over it because at least he's just looking at dirty sites, and not real life women, which is what I would be more worried about if I were in your position.



If he "gets enough" at home from you, you probably have nothing to worry about.

Honey ... the majority of men do like porn.  As long as it's not a problem, like say he has to watch porn to get turned on, I wouldn't trip on it.  You say your sex life is great?  The porn might have something to do with that.  Often times men aren't sure if they are good lovers and they kind of learn from watching porn what to do to please a woman.  And just because your sex life is good doesn't mean he's going to stop wanting to watch a porn flick.  Be realistic.  Most men jack off in the shower or wherever.  They tend to get erections for no particular reason ... something a woman doesn't have to deal with.
I wouldn't take it as he is going behind your back.  If he already knows your not into watching porn then he's certainly not going to announce to you that he does.  Personally, (1) No... I don't think you should feel like he's being sneaky, more discrete.  (2) Are you wrong?  You cannot help how you feel about the subject.  I would say if it is REALLY that much of an issue for you to talk to him about it.  Ask him why he watches it and see what he says.  Beware though.  You may be opening a can of worms you don't want to open for no real reason. Like I said, most men do watch porn.  It's when they become obsessed with it that you have an issue to deal with.

Welcome to living together (the same as being married) for a while.  you better get used to this, happens a lot in marriages. Its not that you guys are doing anything wrong every relationship goes through this every once in a while.  You just have to get a hobby, house decor, occupy your mind on something.  This is why a good friendship is key to any relationship because after "the magic" wears off you still have that friendship as a strong backbone

i can relate when i was stationed at Ft. Gordon money was tighter than anyone could imagine and things got a little rough. We managed to find things to do like renting a movie i dont know how tight your money situation is but we would rent a movie like 2 times a week from this cheap movie place. Or my wife would clean the house constantly to keep herslef busy dont ask me why but the apartment was always clean. Or we would take walks occasionally just around the neighborhood or down the street. And you know looking back those were good memories. See things may have been tight but things will ALWAYS get better as long as you're moving in the right direction with your lives. And trust me when things do get better you'll realize that those tough times provided for some good memories and it'll only make your relationship stronger than what it is. I look back and those times just served as a reminder that life can really suck. Well life really does suck im in Iraq lol. Hey and who the hell said there was anything wrong with sex be creative that'll take up a few hours lmao.

Ok, what do you think of this story?



My husband went out drinking Sunday with a shady friend of his that I don't like.  They were gone 7 hours.  When he came home he was wasted and not making total sense.  He told me that he saw his cousin and his cousin said hang out with this girl while I give somebody a ride some where.  When his cousin came back his cousin couldn't find him for like 20 min (in a bar) and called my husband's cell phone.  They met up at the front door.  My husband was coming from the parking lot.  His cousin is pissed off at him for something.



What do you think happened? I'm worried that my husband was messing around with this girl and that's why his cousin was pissed.  What does it sound like to you?

Doesn't sound great, but maybe he just walked her to her car or went to another bar, or was getting sick and was embarrassed to admit it.  You need to confront him and ask what was going on.

Probably ur husband did. but if he was wasted then u couldn t blame him entirely. People who are drunk lose reality. They forget everything except what their doing at that time.... Confront him about it, but he might forget.... no one remembers everything espeacially during a hangover

You are right to be concerned.  This does sound suspicious. If something did happen it sounds like it may  have been a one time event, of influenced judgment, and just plain stupid.  The fact is you may not ever know at this point.  I doubt he will come with a true story and that's if he could even remember it.  Move on.  In the future I would suggest that you two watch your alcohol consumption and with whom you keep company.  When things get out of control dumb thing can happen.

It could be many things, that his cousin couldn't find him because he was in a different part of the bar, or had gone outside for some fresh air.
As to whether he played around with the girl, a lot would depend upon the state he was in with the alcohol.
Was he alone coming from the car lot, having taken the girl to meet someone else who had turned up for her. There are a lot of possibilities, including the one that he was playing around.
Sit your husband down and talk it through with him, explain your fears, and listen to what he has to say before making judgement.
By the way he answers should hopefully give you an answer to the question. You know your husband best, and would be the best to work out whether he was truthful or not, but go into the situation with a clear mind, prepared to listen to what he has to say before passing judgement.
Hope this helps,

Should I stay with him when he gets out of prison?



I am a very young 50 yr old woman and he is 30. He went to prison on a probation violation for having a beer in his own home while on probation for a 2005 DUI. He was not driving or anything else. We talk every day. He has been in for a year now and won't get out until May 2009. Should we stay together? I can't make up my mind on what to do. He wants to be able to drink when he gets out and says he will no matter what. I drink, but don't know what to expect from this. I think they will tell him he can't live with anyone who drinks or has alcohol in the house. I know this sounds like a no brainer, but I am still confused as to what to really do..... Any advise???

If any normal person was asked to drink this can of beer and go to jail than they would refuse to drink it, the beer simply isn't worth going to jail for. does he care more about drinking that beer than he does with staying with you. The guy is a loser and you are wasting your time with him.

First off, people do not go back and spend three more years in prison for probation violations due to DUIs, unless they were repeat offenders.  I don't think you are getting the whole story.  If his drinking has already landed him in jail, and he insists he is going to drink no matter what, then you should beware.  He may only be using you for a place to live when he gets out.  I suspect he will also have "trouble" finding a job once he's out, and use his past as an excuse to mooch off of you for every dime he can get, thinking you are desperate.

I'm 16 years old and every girl my age has a boyfriend or has had one. Now, I have the opportunity to have a boyfriend because there is this new guy at school who really likes me and he asked me out but my mom said no! I don't get it. She got mad at me because I confronted her about it saying I should have known better then to ask since my older sisters weren't allowed to date until their senior year in high school so I could wait too! I mean that's two years from now and I don't want to wait that long. What is her problem?

Hi Emma,  looking at it from a parent's point of view, your mam is wanting the best education that you can possibly get, and if that means taking out distractions like boyfriends, then so be it.
HOWEVER



If the young man in question was to call and visit your mam, and actually take the time to speak to her, explain that he understands that school comes first, so that you would only date on a weekend and holidays, and that he would keep her informed on planned dates etc, it may just win her round.
I know it's old fashioned, maybe even out dated, but if it wins your mam's respects, then she may well allow him to see you.
A way you could start it is that he brings a book or something you "accidentally" left at school, or on the bus, so he could show himself in a good way to your mam, making sure your mam sees him in the good samaritan role.
Hope this helps,

Flu Shot information?



I'm at my wits end today. I got my 21 Mo. old daughter a flu shot ( her first flu shot) on thursday, it is now sunday and she has barely slept since thursday. She has always been very good about sleeping through the night and just loves being cozy in her bed. thursday night after she got the shot she woke up screaming like she had a bad dream and wouldn't go back to bed. and has done that for naps and at night every night since then. Has this happened to anyone, or you've heard of flu shots causing nightmares in kids, anything. a website. a phone number.

this isn't a result of the medicine but of the way it was administered.



this happened to one of my cousin's twins.  He hated shots until he was almost 4 and would have bad dreams about it for days afterwards.



your baby was traumatized by the shot itself.  Her arm probably hurts and it reminds her of the shot so she hasn't been able to forget it.  (my arm was sore for almost a week the last time I got a flu shot)

How would you feel if you never saw or spoke to this person again?  Would you give them your life if they needed it?  If they got sick and could not take care of themselves, would you take them to the toilet?  Help them with their hygiene?? That is how you know you love someone, not if you have chemistry or not, but what are you willing to do for them unselfishly?

Although lust and love are quite different. In my opinion when you really love some one you lust them as well. A good way to test this is to think to yourself seriously "If they were in an accident and lost the ability to move and were wheelchair bound for the rest of their life, would I still be attacted to them and want to be with them for the rest fo my life?'. If sex is completely taken out of the picture as well as physical attraction, would you still crave to be around them 24-7? That is what makes a huge difference. If you can not picture yourself growing old with some one that can not meet your need sexually then you are simply in lust.

I am a homemaker mom and i have lots of friends who r also stay-at-home mom.Well frankly speaking i dont trust any of them coz they always talk rubbish behind each others back and that really makes me sick.Two of my frnds had a fight with each other and now they dont even talk!!! So now both of them are trying to make me sick by asking "Did u go to her house?",joni told me that u went to her house and that u never come to my house.I dont know from where they get all these stupid info and i dont understand Dont they have anything good to do???If i break up with any of my friends then they will get another hot topic to discuss......sick isn't it?I know.I dont understand how to deal with these kind of sick-headed people?It makes me crazy...!!!!!!!!!!

What can I do to be more attractive in my husbands eyes?



I am 30 weeks pregnant, and have gained alot of weight with this pregnancy. I know my husband loves me but he is just not attacted to me anymore. I have been watching what I eat as well as exercising as much as I can, but being pregnant there doesnt seem like there is anything I can do. I have tried to get all "dolled up" for him but he didnt seem to care. I know it's not his fault that he is not attacted to me anymore, but it has made me extremely depressed. I cant even sleep at night I spend alot of time crying now. I have tried to tell him about it, but he just gets defensive and shrugs it off. I don't even feel like a woman anymore. Feels like we are simply room mates. I sent my kids away for a visit with the in-laws in hope of being able to reconnect with my husband in some way without any luck. He spends more time by himself instead of with me. It just hurts so much. I dont know what I am doing wrong. Sex is only a part of it, but I really just dont know what to do. If anyone has any suggestions I am open to hear it.

I just had a baby 2months ago. I felt just as you did!! Our hormones get crazy and we over react and get more emotional. He loves you, maybe he doesnt know how to handle the pregnancy. I know it's very fustrating and you feel very hurt and lonely. I would scare my poor boyfriend away. Just remember to stay calm and try to talk to him, write him a letter you get more out(I did). Sit him down look at him and tell him exactly how you feel with out yelling or crying like a mad women. Tell that right now you cannot control your feelings and he needs to pay more attention for the babies sake, even if it's silly, tell him sorry and to bear with you and this will all be over soon! when you get to feeling lonely tell him "baby I need attention" in a sweet cute voice. We had it tuff also but it got better because I thought about it and I just talked to him more and he started to change (better)



Also keep yourself busy, do things you like, spend time with friends have fun, this will all keep you busy then he will miss you even more.



Hang in there the big reward is at the end!!

put it this way, if u did all of a sudden shed a few stone, and he was v.atracted to u, wouldnt he  b just be the most vainest person in the world?!look, ur pregnant, ur hormones are all over the place, and the weight is v temporary. suggest things to do to get him excited over the new baby to bring u 2 closer, start to feel good about urself agen, even at the time it may seem impossible, next time he shrugs u off, change the subject, he will soon want to know why ur not dwelling on the matter.

Help! Don't know if I have feelings for this guy...?



A week ago this guy asked me out. I was very suprised, as I had never felt anything romantic towards him, but agreed to go out with him anyway (couldn't hurt, right?). The boy's parents were really nice, and I think they may have even invited me over, but after the movie it became incredibly awkward. We didn't really have real conversation, just sort of jokes back and forth. When I was dropped off at my house, he told me that he wanted to kiss me, but I sort of ignored it, told him good night and that I had a good time. He asked me if I wanted to go out again and I agreed. But the thing is, I really did not have a good time with him. I think I may just be staying with him for fear of losing him as a friend if I break it. We have only been going out for a week, but I feel no sort of romantic attraction to him, at all. Am I not giving it enough time? Help!

Did I do the right thing or the dumb thing?



There was this girl in class (univeristy) that showed up late. I, being nice, asked her if she wanted the notes taken earlier in class and she said yes, smiled widely, and thanked me afterwards several times. We got each others names and made a few little jokes, but didn't say much afterward.



At the end of class I got all my stuff together quickly, said to her audbily "See ya!" and left. She gave me a weird goodbye. Like: ".I guess I'll see you around then" sort of greeting.



What I want to know is did I do the smart thing? I think I did, just need to make sure.

You just missed a chance there.
You should've waited behind a bit, and asked if she wanted to get some lunch or something, perhaps study together.
If you see her again in the class, sit next to her and make conversation, it's not too late yet

I don't have kids yet but i still think i know how i would react. I would hope that she would be upfront about it first. I would hope that i would not find out from someone other than her of my wife. I would respect her job choice and support her any way i could. I would hope that she works for a respectable company that works well with their actors and actresses. If that is what she chooses to do with her life then so be it.

Contacting old high school teacher/crush? :)?



I had this teacher my senior year of high school- it was his first year teaching (he had graduated from that high school too though) and he was in charge of our student council while i was student body president.
He was adorable!..I was 18..him--turning 26? I would always call him by his name though- Mr.____ because it was too awkward not to!
When I was getting ready to move, I heard he was dating someone or engaged or something.. Well, I found his college mail address which I am sure he checks from time to time and I was thinking about writing him. He was such a nice teacher and friend when i was in school- even on graduation night- when we were all getting ready to leave- he gave me a graduation card that said he wouldnt have survived his first year without me and that he knows id do great in college.
Well, here I am, less than a year away from graduating college and I am studying abroad in Europe. I thought It would be nice to email him, fill him in on things and see whats new in his life. I wanted to make a lil joke in the beginning like Hello Mr. ___!  (Ahh..do I still call you Mr. even though Im older?) ;)



I want the letter to be nice..maybe not hardcore flirting but not just a "whatsup from an old student of yours"--keep in mind I dont know if he's seeing anyone.  All the time in school though, i always though..man,when im older and not his student, we could definitely have a future together.. is this weird? Something brought him into my mind today and I havent been able to think of anything else! GRR.



and before any of you make an age remark, I am 22, which would make him 29...

i don't think that you should flirt with him even a little in the beginning, cos although yes you're grown up now, he will still remember you as a kid, and although you're saying he may have liked you, he will definitely feel guilty about it, so just send him a casual email filling him in on whats happened in your life (DO NOT put the do i still call you mr...part) it just makes you sound like a school girl with a crush that you still can't get over



what you need to do is just write as an old student/friend giving him loads of info about your life, then he will reply and your reply to this should be still only friendly, and gradually as he gets to kow you and see that you've grown up then you can start the flirting, but its a good idea to wait for signs from him too, because 22 is still young and he could easily see you as a child if you come across as a "desperate school girl".



good luck :)

Is it possible to be "lovesick" or "homesick/boyfriend-sick" ?



I'm on vacation with my family for the first time in a long time, but my boyfriend couldn't make the trip with us. He and I have been dating for a year and have never been separated for more than a few days. On the day I left for the airport I felt like I was going to get sick, but never did. I still feel that way, but haven't gotten sick. I also have absolutely no appetite for even the most gourmet or chocolate rich foods. I tried to eat fillet but it just didn't appeal to me nothing does, not even water. Also, I get very sleepy and drowsy during the day but if I go to take a nap, I can't sleep, and at night I'll fall asleep but then have a dream about my boyfriend wake up from my sleep with tears and won't be able to get back to bed (and yes, this happens every night.) So I'm feeling lightheaded (I'm guessing that's due to no food intake; which I'm working on even if the thought of food is sickening enough) loosing sleep and don't get it. Does this sound like some sort of bug, or could I really be "homesick/boyfriend-sick"???

being in a new place makes us get less sleep... sometimes.. yes not eating enough mood gets us into  blue mood....and may be you are always thinking about him and not enjoying ur trip?.....just call ur bf oe leave a poem to his mailbox stating how much u miss him which will make u feel more better and romantic too....take it as chance to realize ur deep love....too much worrying leads u to nothing....just get up from ur bed and go out and party and enjoy ur trip and when u go back u can enjoy all the cuddling and love and the things u missed.

I kissed my best mate and now its awkward.?



Well, i've been mates with this guy for about three years now. I really like him, but never told him as i thought it would wreck our friendship. We're pretty much best mates, then a few months a go things got a bit awkward. We went to a party and he came along with some girl i really dislike. I got annoyed as he'd been asked not to bring her along, and so he ended up leaving with her.



Then, i text him later that night to see what he was playing at, he told me that i'd never understand what he wanted. So after a few texts he told me that he liked me as more than a mate. At this time i was going through a rough patch with my boyfriend, and a few weeks later we split.



Me and this guy shared a kiss at a party. we talked and decided to give things a go as a couple, but we weren't actually together.
For a few weeks after that, we went on a few days out together, and went to the pictures and stuff, but he wasn't looking like he was fully into the relationship. We held hands and kissed etc, but i felt like nothing was progressing. I asked him what was going on and he told me that it might be best if we just stayed friends because he was scared or wrecking things.



As hard as it was for me to accept this, i said it was ok and tried to keep my distance for a while.



Ever since this was decided things have been different. When we all go out as a group, he never gives me any eye contact and tries to avoid me most of the time. Yet when we've both been drinking, we seem to get close again, and it's as if he wants to be with me, but not at the same time.



I'm really confused, i really do like him, but i'm trying to move on.
He's starting to try and be closer to my other mates, so i think he might hate me now or something.
He;s also kissed a few other girls infront of me, knowing that it'll annoy me.



Someone help??



thanks!

It's unfortunate, but he's being a guy.  Although the feelings are there, he has a stronger urge to preserve the relationship the way it was before you guys professed interest in each other.  The awkwardness, well that is to be expected b/c you both are trying to figure out what will not set the other person off, put them in too uncomfortable of a situation, etc.  Now, even though you two have spoken, sounds like you really need to talk again and lay it on the line.  Tell him how you really feel, that you were trying to respect his wishes and he makes it hard.  The drinking thing, as always, it is a way to breakdown inhibitions.  So, his feelings are shining through, but it's unfortunate that it has to be done while inebriated.  Talk to him on a individual basis, you two might need to agree not to hang out w/ your friends so much until you two have time to adjust to your current situation.

You want to be with him and are jealous of others around him, admit it. and if you do, then you need to come out and flat tell him you want him as your boyfriend, not just a friend because you can't bear him to be with other girls around you. Period. End of sermon.

I think now in our modern generation we are growing up faster and the fact is that by the age of 8 you pretty much know everything. I don't think it's your innocence personally.

Unfortunately the reality of life is...just because you love someone doesn't mean that you're meant to be together.



It sounds as if she has some issues and likes being controlling and her way of controlling you is by being verbally and emotionally abusive.  It's probably subconscious and she doesn't realize that she's doing it.  You can offer to go to counselling with her, so that a professional can point out her issues, but there's really nothing you can do to change her.



It sounds as if that's a part of her natural personality.

Well, it sounds like her problem and she needs to seek help for it.  You can't do anything to change her, she has to want to change herself.  You can't keep catering to someone who has poor self esteem and will find anything to argue about.  I'm not one for ultimatums, but it may be what you need to do. Tell her that you won't take too much more of her belligerent ways, that she does need to seek help w/ her anger issues/self esteem issues.  Now, as far as you feeling like crap, that's a normal human reaction, and one she is trying to invoke b/c she feels like crap and doesn't want to feel like crap alone.  Don't fall into that trap.  She's dragging you down a horrible path, it's ultimately up to you to let her.  The next time she starts in on one of her tantrums, simply walk away.  Explain to her later, calmly why you did it.  Next time she does, it, walk alway.  After a few times of you not engaging, she sould get a clue.

Does this happen about the same time every month?  Maybe its her hormones wreaking havoc on her emotions???



Try to talk to her, without using the phrase, "is it the time of the month?"  If she is aware of her own PMS then maybe she can make an effort to change.  Diet, more exercise and relaxation techniques can all help with balancing out hormones.



If it is not this, and she is just a being difficult then find someone else who will appreciate you.
Good Luck.

try talking to her. and being honest. but when you do - make sure you are sounding like you are blaming it ALL on her - all she will fell under attack - as it is it is a touch subject - saying i love you, but if it keeps up i am leaving. get ready to find out about what you do that drives her insane. also know that she might be really offended. also what seems like nothing to you - might be really important and that's why she fights.



you too sound like you will have to work with each other and try to understand one another better.

We had the most amazing sex last night but I'm curious?



My bf and I were doing it last night and while he inside of me, he told me that I was tight and I was gripping his penis....is that a good thing? Does that mean that he was enjoying it?



And also he's going out of town this weekend and he told me a month ago that he'd think about taking me but he hasn't said anything else about it. I started hinting at him about the trip last night, asking him wasn't he going this weekend and he said yeah. I'm trying to seem nonchalant about it because a part of me knows that he doesn't really want me to go and he only offered to take me because he was being nice but then turned around and said he'd think about. When he was leaving I said well enjoy your trip and he said I'll text you tomorrow. I don't want to seem too anxious about it, it really doesn't matter if I go or not, but I think it's kind of rude that he hasn't said anything else about it. Should I just come out and ask him or just leave it be?

For your first answer. Yes he probably likes it tight. Most men do.

Definitely leave it be, he's not said anything about it because he knows it does matter to you, you know it matters to you, that's why it's on your mind. It's a horrible situation when this comes up and one I've been through, on his side of the fence. Look for whatever he reason he just doesn't want you to come, you really shouldn't pry, it will only make things much, much worse just try to forget about it.



Also yes of course it's a good thing haha, how old are you? Haven't you ever watched like a bad teen movie, or any kind of porno or read one of those stupid magazines or searched for ANYTHING on the internet?

Being tight is a great thing. Gripping I would find a lil awkward, unless your hand is moist.



Another thing, he actually might of been just looking for play. You should just let him come back to you. If he doesn't he was on some bull.

If he hasnt mentioned it again I would wonder myself.  A lot of times when a man is having an affair or cheating they will either stop having sex with you all together or give you the good stuff.  Look for signs he may be cheating.  If he wanted you to go and hasnt mentioned it I myself would wonder if he found another partner to accompany him!  If the trip isnt far away I would follow him.  I dont care how crazy it sounds.  Some men are sneaky...

Is he going out with his buddies for the weekend or is it to see family?  I would ask outright about whether he wants you to go or not.  I wouldn't play games when it comes to communicating in a relationship.  If I were going for a fun weekend, I would want my significant other with me.  How serious is your relationship too?

When was the last time yall had sex before last night? Sometimes when you take too long in having sex you get tighter and that might be why he was enjoying it. If yall have sex often then it might of been the position yall were in that made it tight.



Well how long have yall been together? Do yall usually go out a lot? Ok he is going on a vacation but were, with who, for what? It really depends on a lot of things if you should worry or not. Give more detail on your relationship.



Hope I helped!

yes it is a good thing to be tight.
you and your BF are already having sex.
but is he committed in a relationship to you?
pre-marital sex is never good.
he can run out on you anytime b/c there is no committment
if he does run out on you, you have nothing to hang on him
that is why God instituted the covenant of marriage and to wait until marriage to have sex.



you cannot be tight forever. your vagina, cervix and uterus will be stretched during childbirth and the muscle cannot tighten back like you are now.
of course we get older and the muscle loses its tone over time.



don't jump into bed with anyone. you just might end up being used for a sexual conquest or until he gets tired of you.

I'm sure he was joking, and trying to make a good impression, but that was a foot-swallowing f u c k up there. He should apologize to her, and take her someplace nice. We've all said something we wish we could take back. Next time,he should  drink less, drink slower, and feel his audience out thoroughly before attempting to win them over with jokes ( jokes that may win over a crowd of acquaintances would be wasted on members of her family, for example, and would probably piss them off.) Since it's easier to think clearly the less you drink, drink less. Good luck.

I would be mad. If he did really like my boobs best, that is something that he shouldnt say in front of anyone else. Its not right even if it was a joke because some people will probably not believe its a joke. Whenever they get with the same group of friends, the bf should say how he was just joking and say something else that he likes about her.

This kind of joke is not acceptable on a first date, especially if you don't know the other couple that well.  If you all have been friends for years and they know that she has nice boobies and he's a boobie man then that's to be expected, but on a first date he should've have said something like her legs, eyes, smile or something.

A general dictionary defines teamwork as a "Cooperative or coordinated effort on the part of a group of persons acting together as a team or in the interests of a common cause, unison for a higher cause, people working together for a selfless purpose, and so on."



Applied to workplaces teamwork is a method that aligns employee mindsets in a cooperative and usually selfless manner, towards a specific business purpose. Today there is no business or organization that does not talk about the need and value of teamwork in the workplace. While the concept of teamwork and its benefits are well known and talked about, it is very rare to see it being practiced truly in reality. And you may have often noticed what appears outwardly as teamwork is not really teamwork internally. Some things cannot be accomplished by people working individually. Larger, more ambitious goals usually require that people work together with other people. Because of this, teamwork is a desired goal of many businesses and organizations today. Projects often require that people work together in order to accomplish a common goal. Although critics often argue that in the corporate world teamwork has become an empty buzzword, or a form of corporate-speak. Effective collaborative skills (knowledge) are necessary to work well in a team environment. As businesses and organizations become larger or more sophisticated. Many employers attempt to enhance their employees' collaborative efforts through training, cross-training, and workshops in order to help people effectively work together in a cohesive group and accomplish shared goals.



Human beings are fiercely independent animals and we will always have our own opinions and independent methods of doing something. This is the way our minds are hardwired by nature. Except for a very small percentage of us, sharing and collaboration with others is not exactly programmed inside each and every one of us. This is because each person is mainly concerned about his or her rewards, appreciation, need for power over others, and so on. But teamwork is a different ballgame that aligns mindsets in a cooperative, and usually selfless manner towards a specific business purpose. And it involves sacrifices, sharing of rewards, sharing the blame and punishments, true uniformity, suppression of personal opinions, etc., which is not very palatable to many. It is always, "What is in it for me" rather than "What is in it for us.



In order for teamwork to succeed one must be a teamplayer. A Teamplayer is one who subordinates personal aspirations and works in a coordinated effort with other members of a group, or team, in striving for a common goal. Businesses and other organizations often go to the effort of coordinating team building events in an attempt to get people to work as a team rather than as individuals.



A 2003 national representative survey, HOW-FAIR [1], revealed that Americans think that 'being a team player' was the most important factor in getting ahead in the workplace. This was ranked higher than several factors, including 'merit and performance', 'leadership skills', 'intelligence', 'making money for the organization' and 'long hours'.



“The old structures are being reformed. As organizations seek to become more flexible in the face of rapid environmental change and more responsive to the needs of customers, they are experimenting with new, team-based structures” (Jackson & Ruderman, 1996).
Contents
[hide]



Teamwork Skill



Aside from any required technical proficiency, a wide variety of social skills are desirable for successful teamwork, including:



* Listening - it is important to listen to other people's ideas. When people are allowed to freely express their ideas, these initial ideas will produce other ideas.



* Discussing It is important to discuss your ideas with your teammates until you agree.



* Questioning - it is important to ask questions, interact, and discuss the objectives of the team.



* Persuading - individuals are encouraged to exchange, defend, and then to ultimately rethink their ideas.



* Respecting - it is important to treat others with respect and to support their ideas.



* Helping - it is crucial to help one's coworkers, which is the general theme of teamwork.



* Sharing - it is important to share with the team to create an environment of teamwork.



* Participating - all members of the team are encouraged to participate in the team. (usually consist of three or more people)



* Communicating - For a team to work effectively it is essential team members acquire communication skills and use effective communication channels between one another e.g. using email, viral communication, group meetings and so on. This will enable team members of the group to work together and achieve the team's purpose and goals.



The forming-storming-norming-performing model takes the team through four stages of team development and maps quite well on to many project management life cycle models, such as initiation - definition - planning - realisation.



As teams grow larger, the skills and methods that people require grow as more ideas are expressed freely. Managers must use these to create or maintain a spirit of teamwork change. The intimacy of a small group is lost, and the opportunity for misinformation and disruptive rumors grows. Managers find that communication methods that once worked well are impractical with so many people to lead. Specifically, leaders might encounter difficulties based on Daglow's Law of Team Dynamics: "Small teams are informed. Big teams infer."



[edit] Team roles



The approach to Team Role analysis was first introduced by Meredith Belbin in 1981[2] to inform management consulting practices and for training[3]. (Belbin Team Roles are not designed for high stake employment decisions.)



Belbin proposed nine team roles required for successful teams:



Coordinator



This person will have a clear view of the team objectives and will be skilled at inviting the contribution of team members in achieving these, rather than just pushing his or her own view. The coordinator (or chairperson) is self disciplined and applies this discipline to the team. They are confident and mature, and will summarize the view of the group and will be prepared to take a decision on the basis of this.



Shaper



The shaper is full of drive to make things happen and get things going. In doing this they are quite happy to push their own views forward, do not mind being challenged and are always ready to challenge others. The shaper looks for the pattern in discussions and tries to pull things together into something feasible, which the team can then get to work on.



Planter



This member is the one who is most likely to come out with original ideas and challenge the traditional way of thinking about things. Sometimes they become so imaginative and creative that the team cannot see the relevance of what they are saying. However, without the plant to scatter the seeds of new ideas the team will often find it difficult to make any headway. The planter's strength is in providing major new insights and ideas for changes in direction and not in contributing to the detail of what needs to be done.



Resource investigator



The resource investigator is the group member with the strongest contacts and networks, and is excellent at bringing in information and support from the outside. This member can be very enthusiastic in pursuit of the team’s goals, but cannot always sustain this enthusiasm.



Implementer



The individual who is a company worker is well organized and effective at turning big ideas into manageable tasks and plans that can be achieved. Such individuals are both logical and disciplined in their approach. They are hardworking and methodical but may have some difficulty in being flexible.



Team worker



The team worker is the one who is most aware of the others in the team, their needs and their concerns. They are sensitive and supportive of other people’s efforts, and try to promote harmony and reduce conflict. Team workers are particularly important when the team is experiencing a stressful or difficult period.



Completer Finisher



The Completer Finisher is a perfectionist and will often go the extra mile to make sure everything is "just right," and the things he or she delivers can be trusted to have been double-checked and then checked again. The Completer Finisher has a strong inward sense of the need for accuracy, rarely needing any encouragement from others because that individual's own high standards are what he or she tries to live up to. They may frustrate their teammates by worrying excessively about minor details and refusing to delegate tasks that they do not trust anyone else to perform.



Monitor evaluator



The monitor evaluator is good at seeing all the options. They have a strategic perspective and can judge situations accurately. The monitor evaluator can be overcritical and is not usually good at inspiring and encouraging others.



Specialist



This person provides specialist skills and knowledge and has a dedicated and single-minded approach. They can adopt a very narrow perspective and sometimes fail to see the whole picture. (Note: the specialist is not considered a team role)



[edit] Team Building



Team Building, or Team Development, is a coverall term given to methods of developing an effective team.



The methods of doing this vary widely, and include



* simple social activities - to encourage team members to spend time together



* group bonding sessions - company sponsored fun activities to get to know team members



* personal development activities - personal change applied on a group level, sometimes physically challenging

it really depends on who you are going to  present this situation ...though this is the year 2000 there is stilla lot of people who wont accept this... the older generation will find it hard to accept this because of how they were brought up...the present population is getting to be  in the older side ...so..this will be a hard proposistion to put on the table for acceptance...but if the populationdn is more on the younger side..i think this situation can be accepted easily.... the age difference is really not a big difference anyway...only 13 year old....but if  the woman looks like a grandmother and the boy loooks like a baby then...it will be really scrutinized more.....i dont know where you are at on this situation.....but in my own opinion ..i wll accept this

How do i get over long relationship ending?



Me and my fiance have been dating for about 3 years now, we met in like 9th grade. the 1st year that we were together was great. we were happy and we did things together. But these last 2 years have really changed, we have a 18 month old son, and he isn't the father i was expecting him to be . He's still a great person but he rarely spends any time with his son, He plays video games after work everyday, and we never hardly spend any time together. He doesn't ever want to go do anything anymore, He stays on his computer from the time he gets home to the time he comes to bed, i always have to go to bed by myself, He's very moody sometimes, I came home from teaching class one day and there was a naked woman on his screen with her butt in his face, i confronted him about it but he just got mad, and i just let it go thinking it was an accident or something and now this morning when i woke up i found he has been watching more of it just in anime. I think that maybe he is starting to get bored with me and ready to move on  with his life without me and his son in it, i just don't know how...Everything i have is here with my family if i took mason (my son) and left i wouldn't know how to start over, i wouldn't know what to do and i just don't think i am strong enough, I love him so much and i have tried talking to him and telling him that he needed to choose what he wanted but he doesn't want to choose. I'm not happy here anymore all i do is keep the house clean and raise my son there is no life at all. I don't have any friends because i stay home all the time, i don't have a vehicle, or any money to make it on my own. i just don't know what to do or how to start over, I love him soo much i just don't know how i would make it by myself. I need some advice!

What difference do women expect between a boyfriend and a husband?



Besides the legal certificate...what do you NOT expect from a boyfriend that you'd expect from a husband?



Example: Do you expect your boyfriend to be loyal, not cheat, love only you, pay for dates, have kids, etc.like a husband would?

Well, I think that I have the same expectations for both, but I want my husband to be someone I "click with" so well that being together for a lifetime is the best choice.



Boyfriends are usually lacking in someway.

truthfully if Im dating a guy for a while and it seems to be getting nowhere then there's no use. Why stay with someone who doesnt have potential in the long-run?



That being said, I don't expect him to take all of the responsibilities a husband would but I do expect him to treat me as if I was more than just some friend.



I understand his buddies might be important but if he always puts me on the back burner than we're not really dating and shouldn't be in a relationship.



What I expect from a boyfriend is support, love, affection and for him to able to make time for us. If you're in a relationship it should be somewhere on your priority list.

Well, since school just started if you see him around you can start by smiling and just start saying hi to him.  Then you can ask him how he likes his classes and teachers so far.  After that you just go on from there.  Or if you know some of his friends, you can ask him how they are and then ask how he's doing in his classes.



Hope this helps some.  Good luck!

When he is somewhere close to you, like passing by or something, why not throw a compliment on him? Anything will work from 'I just have to tell you that I find your eyes so amazing' to 'I notice your hair is really shiny, are you putting something on it?'. Or find out what his hobbies are and ask him a question about it like you really need the answer. Flattery gets you anywhere.

Miscommunication, Misunderstanding...don't know what happened?



Well, my boyfriend is going on a trip soon. We spent some time together yesterday and right when he was leaving I told him to enjoy his trip. He said, I'll text you tomorrow.



Do you think that maybe I was saying that because I wasn't going to talk to him again before his trip? I was just saying it in person because I knew we weren't going to be able to see each other again before he leaves on Friday.



Did I send the wrong message, like maybe I wouldn't be contacting him before then? Or was it just miscommunication?

This has been the slowest week ever?



and I think it's because me and my boyfriend broke up again. It was suppose to be a break for 2 weeks. But I just ended it on the 2 day. I told him I felt he was going to be with another girl and he promised me and said he wasn't. And said he still wanted to continue seeing me so I give him another chance. We agree to change things, like him saying things out of the blue that are offensive and me being honest with him about how I feel when he says things. Then he told me how much he loves and cares about me, that he can see himself with me for the rest of his life and be happy. He just said right now isn't a good time for a commitment as we are still finishing college and he said he didn't see how he would get through 2 weeks with out me, he said he was going to call me after the first week, he thought I needed the space not him and that's why he said 2 weeks. Things are going good now, we still fight and argue often though, and I think it's both of us. we need to  have more peace. what are some mind sets to learn so that I can help keep the peace, what can we do to improve communication? I really want this to work.
thank you all.

trust me, i don't care what people say. what others think dosen't really affect me anymore. it's just, being able to go up to someone and strike up a conversation is like getting a shot. (shot's freakin scare me man)



-.- i just freeze up when someone tries to talk to me. i can barely even nod my head or smile every so often. my conversation is little to non existent.

The only thing you can do, love, Is make yourself talk to people. I had to make myself talk to  people. Its actually nice when you're able to talk and carry on a conversation.... next time your around a group of people and you see someone standing by themselves. just walk up to them and start talking. you never know. You might gain lots of friends that way.... Good luck darlin' and be bold :)

My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for 4 years now and I love him very much but another part of me is infatuated with a guy I knew in middle school. We recently caught up with each other and he seems so interesting, we seem to have so much in common and I find him very attractive. I know he's attracted to me and I wanted us to keep in touch as friends but as soon as I told him I had a boyfriend, he keeps his distance. I know this isn't right but now I wish I never told him about my boyfriend. My friends are telling me I have this whole "grass is greener" complex because this isn't the first time I've felt this way about someone else while in a relationship. I think the worse part is I barely know this guy and the person he is now yet in my mind I picture him to be this perfect person, using just what I know from his MySpace page! Help me! Serious answers please!

Is it normal to dream about other men?



i have been with my man now for 4 years. we got together very fast, and had children very fast. We have had our fair share of problems in our relationship, we even broke up for 6 months because he was talking to another girl A LOT, and it was done behind my back so i was very uncomfortable with it. We got back together but lately i find myself dreaming about other guys, and its throwing me for a loop. they are usually guys i know. I have never cheated on my man and never would, but i dont know what this means. Please help

Do nothing period.  You are responsible only for your own life and actions. People have to take their chances in this world.  You are responsible for what happens to you.  You don't get beaten by your partner if you take the time before making someone your partner.  Women particularly need to learn this--as long as women fall in love with "it" instead of "him," there will be domestic abuse in this world.



No!!!  We have the responsibility NOT to be beaten--not the right.

My boyfriend can't keep it up with a condom on?



Basically, I'm not a virgin, he is and he really doesn't want to be. We've been together for  six months and I've been trying to take his virginity since pretty much the first week we started dating.



We'll be hooking up and he'll be fine, but then whenever we try and put the condom on, he goes limp and he gets so frustrated that we give up for the day. I've been trying to tell him he's incredible at everything else, and that there's really no pressure and that whenever he's ready we'll do it, but I think its making him insecure and its beginning to put a strain on our relationship.



Before anyone suggests birth control, I can't go on birth control because its screws with my hormones in a way that my doctor said was dangerous.



I just need to know, why is this happening? How do I make him feel comfortable enough to do it with me?

I have had that problem myself and I think its one of the reasons men hate rubbers so much. He needs  to keep trying or perhaps its a sign he's not ready yet. He may want to go see a doctor if it continues to happen. I don't see how it could something your doing. Maybe its in his head( no pun intended). There are other forms of birth control for men as well.

(ok i know u said no mentioning of birth control, but u do know there is one that doesn't mess with ur hormones? it acts like a "plug" the recent form of birth control u can take it out whenever u ready and check ups is every 5years..if u wanna know the name of the procedure i'll get that for u)



anyway..ok first thing u could do is to blind fold him, all during foreplay let him know u there but also not know what u doing..so when u kiss him and play with him..pull out the CD then..and there is a technique to put on a CD using ur mouth..he will think u giving him a b.j next thing he will feel something being pushed down his shaft and on...



CD techniques?? read Cosmopolitan



other thing would be to give him viagra (its not just for old men) a friend of mine tried it just for fun, he said that sucker wouldn't go down!! not even after making love with his GF all night..he had to sleep it off.. LOL

I caught my fiance's sister masturbating completely
nude in the living room. She freaked out and ran to her room and threatened me not to say anything. I giggled a little to pretend it wasn't any big deal. But the next time I came over, the whole family treated me like the plague. My fiance now acts so cold to me and his parents said they don't want me around. I know his sister said something about me but no one will say anything. I'm so disheartened and upset. I'm not sure what to do. Any suggestions?

i need to know if i am a bad girlfriend sometimes.  i know i am in love but i feel like sometimes i am slow when it comes to some things with my girlfriend.  First, when she is upset, she gos into another room like the bathroom.  Well, instead of going in there i got on the computer (cause really did not know she was crying).  I heard sniffing but i thought it was her sinuses.  Next, is sometime communication takes a turn for the worse, we could be talking and it all of a sudden ends up in argument, ( i do not be wanting to argue with her).  but she thinks that I do. Last, is the trust of it all.  Allot of rumors have been put out there about her or I.  but mostly me and i am so tired of it all.  i mean damn i want her to believe me when i say that i am faithful, (by the way i am very faithful) in stead of believing other peoples lies about me. What do I DO?

Am I over reacting to this?



I babysit/work with a child with autism. He's a very cute kid, nothing visibly wrong with him. His mother is a younger women, she has a facebook. I was curious one day and decided to see what she does on her facebook and I notice that she has MANY pictures dedicated to her other child (who has no problems whatsoever) and herself. There are no pictures of the child I work with. Its like he doesn't even exist, but this other normal child is everywhere. I don't know what to think about it. It makes me sad to think about this.
Would you take this the wrong way?
Or would you take the high road and say "maybe she missed him"?

This is just a guess, but maybe the kid doesn't like to be photographed. I had an autistic friend actually and would get REALLY angry when someone tried to photograph him. I've babysat a high-functioning autistic kid and I was playing with my camera and he started yelling because he thought I was taking a picture of him. That, or the mom doesn't want pictures of him and is flat out mean. I don't know.

Its nothing to do with you, sorry but you only babysit/work with this child, obviously you have feelings for him because you probably interact more with him than his mother does.
She is trying to get a life for herself and if this is the way she does it then its nothing to do with anybody but herself.
Dont bother trying to analyse this any more and just be there for this boy whom you have a great relationship with.

The high road that "maybe she missed him " is delusional, she didn't miss him at all. More like ," I don't really know how to deal with this ", and at the moment , the method will be avoidance. Apparently , she has some bad feelings coming from all this , and it results in her refusal to acknowledge him publicly, at least for now.How you want to approach this whole thing with the pictures / no pictures issue should be with a healthy dose of tact and timing, and no small part of consideration for your ongoing employment with the mother, as it could result in your dismissal from the babysitting job by even mentioning it to her.If you think about it, the kid is young enough , he probably doesn't get any internet time , right? So , in the immediate sense, whether or not his picture is there would be irrelevant to him. It actually affects you more that she neglects his exposure to the world, at least in the family sense with the photos.Given the sad state of children's affairs in the world , this is a cheap date,not that it is right , but really small change at this point. Think about what you would say,if you would say it, you can't unsay it once it's out of your mouth. Good luck.

Well... I met a guy a couple of weeks but...?



I really liked the way he treated that day we hung out, he was so sweet and affectionate towards me, so I became very attached to him, but when we hung out again, he was a totally different person, he was loaded drunk high I don't know he was just not the guy I met that first day, I understand that drugs and alcohol completely change peoples behaviors , I am not ready for an other messed up relation ship but this guy really seemed different that first day I met him. I found out that he is having a lot of family problems he just crashed his brand new car and is under a lot of stress but this time he was very strange he was really rude mean and obnoxious not to mention the next day he called me saying this to me on my answering machine "WERE YOU AT??? *****!!!  ILL BE SEEING YOU SOON!!! HURRY UP ROLL OUT AND COME OUTSIDE!!!LATE!!!"

I need suggestions? Most likely will use any I get!?



Ok so as we all know, halloween is on the 31st of this month, which is a Friday. My boyfriend has school, and so do I.. Here's the whole story behind our problem.



I met my boyfriend in New Jersey and he asked me out on New Years day when I moved to Pennsylvania. We've been together for 1 year and 10 months so far. (He's 16 years old, and I'm 15) Well, since I had to move, I don't get to see him as much as I would like. And since Halloween is on a school day, I can't go down there like I planned in the beginning, because my dad goes to work at 5 in the morning. Well, my boyfriend has biabetes (ironically, he was diagnosed on halloween, the year he was first going to celebrate it at the age of 10.) Any ways, his mom is OVERLY protective about it. I want him to come to Pennsylvania to my house for a change for once, but in order for that to happen, he'd probably have to sleep over, and I don't have my own room so it's not like we can do things that we wouldn't do until we're married anyways. And my mom's brother (my uncle) has diabetes, and so does my grandma (my mom's mom) and I let his mother know that. I was wondering is there anyway we can kind of reassure her that he'll be fine? Any suggestions? Also, I let her know that whatever candy he might get, I wouldn't allow him to eat it, I'd take it away from him, give it to her, or give it to my little sister or myself. But wouldn't let him have it, NEVER! Is there any suggestions you have? Please give me any! I'm desperate!

Oh Sweetheart, you're in love.
Listen, as you well know, a person in love would do evereything in his or her power not to let anything bad happen to the person they are in love with. Even if that means sitting on top of him and stealing his candy from him on Halloween so he wouldn't eat it!
As an adult, take me advice and tell his mother that you love him and you would never let him come into harms way.(We all remember that first love and how strong it is, make her remember) Explain that there are people there to watch over him and his diabetes situation. Also let her know how close the nearest hospital is in case of emergency.



Have your mother talk to her and guarantee that the two of you will be seperated at a decent hour (bedtime) and that nothing inapropriate will happen.
Once again, let her know you love her son and respect her rules and you will see him on Halloween if she has any kind of heart.
Now give me my ten points and Good Luck!

i think a good way to prove that your boyfriend will be fine is by getting your mum to talk to his mum.since people on your mums side of the family also have diabetes your mum will be able to talk to his mum about what needs to be done for him. also you should prove to his mum that you have an understanding of the needs of a person with diabetes. trust me when u get your parents involved it makes things easier. hope i helped gud lick :)

Well you seemed to have already told his mom that your family knows how to handle people with diabetes. What you can do is get your parents to talk to his parents let them explain everything to his Mom. Try to convince her that everything is fine and will be ok do things like tell her that you two won't do anything like trick-or-treat and just watch movies. But if that is out of the question then just be cool about it and and tell her you can buy him some Sugar-free candy.



And yeah get him to translate for your mom.

Have your mom call his mom and reasure her. honestly, I don't believe you are more than just friends (i'm seventeen and have watched many of my friends believe themselves to be in love than just get crushed), but I know how nice it is to get together with those we love. (talking friends and family, my best friend moved to florida when i was in seventh grade. just have your mom talk to his mom, and just hope for the best. you may not be religious, but if you are, just pray that God's will be done. Tell his mom that if anything happens, you can call your grandma or family doctor to find out exactly what to do. Good luck!

ok. you did fine by saying no candy!! why dont you get him to come there and see if you guys can get a ride to a haunted house or something, reassuring her that candy wont be involved. And also, make sure that you let his 'rents know you two will be in seperate rooms while sleeping. It just wouldnt be fair to take his candy if you got it and eat it in front of him.. and a haunted house on halloween night means a lot of snuggling with him due to being scared ;) win win situation!!!

Diabetes can be a serious illness if a person doesn't take care of himself and his Mom has cause for concern.  However, if you really want him to stay at your house, and it's ok with your parents, why don't you have your Mom talk to his Mom over the phone.  Your Mom can reassure his that he'll be well taken care of.  Whatever happens, you and your boyfriend need to respect your parents' wishes.

I'm in a relationship but I'm obsessed with a guy that's not my boyfriend!?



I think I have a serious problem and I want to know what everyone thinks I should do. My boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for 4 years now and I love him very much but another part of me is infatuated with a guy I knew in middle school. We recently caught up with each other and he seems so interesting, we seem to have so much in common and I find him very attractive. I know he's attracted to me and I wanted us to keep in touch as friends but as soon as I told him I had a boyfriend, he keeps his distance. I know this isn't right but now I wish I never told him about my boyfriend. My friends are telling me I have this whole "grass is greener" complex because this isn't the first time I've felt this way about someone else while in a relationship. I think the worse part is I barely know this guy and the person he is now yet in my mind I picture him to be this perfect person, using just what I know from his MySpace page! Help me! Serious answers please!

Geez. This happened to me. Drop the f***er who's not your boyfriend but likes you now. He didn't like you then, that's his own problem. You want what you can't have, well, if you leave your boyfriend for this jerk then you'll regret it later. Plus if things are going well with your boyfriend and you're in love then why change that? That's just selfish and hurting the guy who loves you, and has risked everything to be with you--his heart. Breaking up with him for another guy is a surefire way to make this boy hate himself and never want to be near another girl again because he's so afraid he'll be hurt again. This other kid, forget about him. You have a boyfriend now, and if you're in love then this other kid shouldn't mean one thing to you. Stop living in the moment and be realistic. Don't go out with this new guy, stick with the person you love. If you leave him, all that will happen is you'll hurt, he'll be dying in pain, and the relationship with this new kid won't be so great. Answered from a logical and standpoint from a person who's heart was broken because of the exact same case. I can't recover fully from it. And whatever you do, don't cheat.

If this is not first time when happen during all this time since u have this boyfriend, that's mean that u don't love him a lot..u just got used to be with him, that's all...it is not normal to thing to other boys when in an relationship...
ok, u saw a nice boy and say it but thinking of him...
try to take same time off with your boyfriend, and try to figure out WHAT'S the best for u, for both of u..it is not fair on him to think all the time about this boy..
u have to sort out ur feelings before u stick in an long term relationship , even marry and after see that u don't love him, or before u'll lose ur love for a phantom..

My fiance has begun to do meth, how can i stop her?



To my knowledge I have this huge problem and I'm too confused on how to deal with it.  My fiance who I have been with for a few years, has all of a sudden began to use meth.  At 1st she had been doing it behind my back and she finally told me and I was in the shock of my life, this isn't what I wanted from my future.  We have 2 kids and I fear for losing them and I know I would never forgive her if they were ever in danger of losing them.  I flat out told her I didn't want her doing it and if she continued I would let go.  She always said and began with "I won't let it get that bad"  how can she possibly know this?  or "You just don't understand it" how should I understand it? highly addictive and destroys your body.  I tried to lie to myself because I love her and can't see her destroying herself and allow her to do it (not smart I know).  Yet however I know i'm lying about it and I resent it more and more.  What can I do or how can I get her to stop and see the truth that she is doing something dreadfully wrong and irresponsible for a parent?

Well, she needs help and she needs it now. But the problem is that she has to realize this and nothing short of that will do any good. " I won't let it get bad", is an excuse, trust me. I would suggest that if she won't get help, then you tell her your going to get custody of the children and leave her. And do it.  Chances are she will spiral out of control if she doesn't stop and get help. Stop kidding yourself and take control of this situation or else you very well could end up losing your children over it. Good luck.

you need to tell her this isnt just affecting her, its affecting you and your kids. meth is a very harmful drug and its eventually going to tear your family apart. tell her you dont want the kids around her because she could possible hurt them (not saying that she would purposly but accidents happen.)  families are not very successful when a parent is a crack addict. does she really want your kids to grow up and start doing meth too?

MEN ONLY....a question about the ladies?



I meet up with a friend that I've haven't seen in a long time. Now we went in my car and opened the ca door and let her in, and she gave me a dirty look. I shook it off. That the bar/restaurant I opened the door to let her out and then I opened the bar door and she said I got hands you know. I was like damn. I played it off so we sat and eat did our thing and the check comes in and I pick it (pay of it) while she's in the restroom. She is pissed. She basically states she is a capable women and she doesn't need a man to take care of her. I told her check this out i'm trying to be a gentlemen, but if you don't like it then i'm bad but don't disrespect me. she said sorry and I didn't open any doors.



So this is my question I've been raised to be a gentlemen under any situation but has any other GUY been through the same thing or similar and how did you handle it? Also did i handle my business right?

I'm not a guy but I will tell you anyways.  You extended certain courtesies and you didn't get the responses you expected.
It's like this, you were just too freaking approval-seeking.  Like you're trying to buy her approval.  Cut that out.  It makes you unattractive and it makes you look like you think you can buy her into liking you.

Firstly, take the dream out of dream girl...! Now you may have a better chance of acheiving your goal. Truth is she knows your affection is real and has known for a long time but you being shy and aloof can only mean one thing. One kiss and you'll fall in love ! Yes there is such thing as true love and its very real meaning you too can become a victim of cupids sharp arrow. My advise is, stop procrastinating before its to late...! What have you got to lose my friend ? Life is for living and finding love. Its human nature to feel the way you do so go go go dude. The boyfriend does not own her, she is no ones property either. You will Never know untill you try so stop under estimating your true worth.Take it from her point of veiw, she could also be burdened by beauty and for some girls this is either an issue or its not.

She has recently been asking about her other cousins (my ex's neice) I contacted my ex's sister in law via friends reunited (I sent a e-card saying hello - nothing else) and he e-mailed my sister stating I was harassing them and that he'll "contact the police if it continues" all my daughter wanted to do was see her cousins again.

It really depends on who you are asking, I am married and at this time in my marriage I am unhappy but, it was not always like that, I am not sure if it will get better just yet but when you get married it should be for all the right reasons, such as:



Can you see yourself growing old with this person?
Do really like this person for who they are and not just for what they can do for you?
Do you truly understand what marriage is all about?



I mean I have love for my husband but, there are things that we need to address before it's too late to fix things,



I want my marriage to work out because I walked into this with all that I had to give but, I am not getting what I need from it as well, both parties must be on the same page in order for it to work.



If you want to play around with different people over the weekends.
If you do not want to answer to another or be responsible for others and their feelings, then I must say that being single is what you should.



If you do not want to grow-old by yourself and have a hose full of cats then by all means get married.
At the end of the day marriage is not for all and neither is being singled, so it's up to who you ask at what time you ask them.....Lil Angel

There is no way for someone else to tell you what is better or what is worse because each of us is different.  Some people cherish their independence and like to spend lots of time alone.  For them, being single and the freedom it entails might be better.  Some people can't stand being alone and are extremely social.  For them, always having a partner with whom to enjoy things and spend time might be better.



Of course, that assumes that you are in a good marriage.  If the marriage is bad, then whether it's better to be single or married depends not only upon your tolerance for being around other people but also the degree to which the marriage is bad.  Even a mildly bad marriage might be better for someone who really hates being alone.  As Ann Landers used to advise people asking whether to leave their husbands/wives, you have to ask yourself if you're better off with him/her or without him/her.  Only you know the answer to that.



A really bad marriage, especially an abusive one, is worse in general.  not only is that physically dangerous, but it also dimishes the abused party's self-esteem.

Your question doesn`t make sense: it would have been better to ask `Single or Marriage` which is  better? Or maybe you mean, `is it better to be single, than trapped in a bad Marriage?`



My own opinion is, that for most people, marriage is better



- and it is a fact that married people in general live longer than single people.

Best of all would be to be married to someone you loved and who loved you..



Second would be to be single.



Worst of all (and to be avoided) is to be in any form of relationship which is one sided - love only from one partner with the other accepting that love and being false and secretive and seeing someone else on the side...



I opt to keep to number 2 from now on as the latter "choice" hurts like hell...

I'd rather be single then in a horrible marriage.



But I'd rather be in a healthy and fulfilling marriage then be lonely.



So I don't think there is really an answer to this question.

So we'v been together 4 yrs and i no longer?



So yes 4 years we've been together. I have 2 children from my marriage and one with my current partner. We are engaged and happy as anyone else. We do everything together and get along great. However i find over the past 6-12 months i am no longer sexually attracted to this man. This for me is ok, Tho he is not happy and no matter how much i word it in logic (mans terms) He's not getting it ok so he finds it as a personal dig to his ego however its not i just don't want sex. How can we go on with this?? I find my self pulling away as i don't want any kisses/touches to go "further" Im 28 so is he. So we still young as i said we great as normal until this comes up i kind of freeze inside if he touches me. I d anything to avoid sex i really just don't want too. He is sexually attracted to me which is hard for us. Any ideas how i can get over this? Any one else have this issue?

Do your parents look similar? quick survey?



Well about 2 years ago i started trying to do some studies about couples who get married. and in those studies im trying to see how many couples that got married look alike. By that i mean that ive noticed that couples who get married usually have the same facial features and hair color.



so i started paying attention to couples and the way they look, so i noticed my dad and my mom look similar, so then i studied their freinds and noticed most of them look alike. So then i went to tv stars and noticed those couples mostly looked alike. But then i tried studying the reasons why most people broke up. And i noticed that the people who broke up did not really look alike in the face and in hair



so after some studies i came to a theory that most humans seem to marry someone that looks like them. and how most humans spend time looking for certain characteristics in in a lover, such as charming, loyal, funny etc, but mostly in the end it doesnt matter because they end up marrying just by looks alone. Which is why i think we do it by instinct, now im not saying that couples that look different cannot be in love because they can, im just saying that mostly by instinct we marry someone that looks alike wether we know it or not. and how it seems to happen a lot.



so my question is do people around you who got married or are dating look similar? parents, friends etc? im just curious
so i was looking for pictures of couples on the net just to kind of show the similarities in them, but you have to notice carefully in stuff like the head shape, the hair color, the skin color, the eyebrow shape and thickness, the nose shape, the lips etc

Resolved Question



<question>



I need suggestions? Most likely will use any I get!?



Ok so as we all know, halloween is on the 31st of this month, which is a Friday. My boyfriend has school, and so do I.. Here's the whole story behind our problem.



I met my boyfriend in New Jersey and he asked me out on New Years day when I moved to Pennsylvania. We've been together for 1 year and 10 months so far. (He's 16 years old, and I'm 15) Well, since I had to move, I don't get to see him as much as I would like. And since Halloween is on a school day, I can't go down there like I planned in the beginning, because my dad goes to work at 5 in the morning. Well, my boyfriend has biabetes (ironically, he was diagnosed on halloween, the year he was first going to celebrate it at the age of 10.) Any ways, his mom is OVERLY protective about it. I want him to come to Pennsylvania to my house for a change for once, but in order for that to happen, he'd probably have to sleep over, and I don't have my own room so it's not like we can do things that we wouldn't do until we're married anyways. And my mom's brother (my uncle) has diabetes, and so does my grandma (my mom's mom) and I let his mother know that. I was wondering is there anyway we can kind of reassure her that he'll be fine? Any suggestions? Also, I let her know that whatever candy he might get, I wouldn't allow him to eat it, I'd take it away from him, give it to her, or give it to my little sister or myself. But wouldn't let him have it, NEVER! Is there any suggestions you have? Please give me any! I'm desperate!

Is it wrong to snoop?



i've been with my boyfriend for two years and right before the two year mark i was snooping around on his myspace. i don't know why i did it, but i guess it was because i had been gone for a long period of time in a diffferent state. well i found something that upset me. He didn't cheat on me but what i found hurt. well the other night him and i along with a friend were talking about cheating and i wanted to say something really bad even though i had found it six months ago....and it's eating at me. should i tell him?

Something obviously happened over the last year, if you were ok with sex with him for 3-3 1/2 years before that. It sounds psychlogical. You "freeze up"? You owe it to him and yourself to either get to the bottom of this, or get counseling and find out why you're feeling this way.

How old is the last baby? It sounds to me that you may have some hormones that are out of wack...Or perhaps the lack of affection or desire stems from other parts of life...Kids, financial stress...can all play a factor in libido...not to mention resentment...I personally found myself too tired often, and annoyed at being bothered...and resentful because he was well rested and I wasn't EVER....Likely something other than sex is bothering you!

He's 86, likes MASH, always has a pocket knife on him, speaks French and Spanish along with English, is an ex college professor, and that's about all I know about him without asking more. Sad, yes, but he doesn't really talk a lot. So, from what I've written, what do you think would be a good Christmas gift for him?

I know its whatever makes me happy but I love my family(almost like everyone) and I don't want to jeapordize any relationship. I really care about this guy and starting to fall in love with him. I've told my mom about him, vaguely, but she has been giving me a hard time. She does not approve of the relationship and told me if thats what I chose and if its my happiness, that I should go my own way and she will disown me. Is there anything I can possibly say to her, make understand...anything..any help..*sigh*

It could be a medical thing. Ask him what is wrong. I don't get when people are married that they can't or won't ask questions to the one they are married to. I would be all over this one. And, some people in here are just going to be cruel to you. Time to get real in your relationship and be gentle about it. Ask him if it is physical and then if it is ask him to go to the doctor. He could be very embarrassed about it.

A trip to the doctor is what you guys need. He needs a blood workup to make sure nothing is wrong physically.



He could be cheating. Or he could be waisting himself on porn. But rule out the medical first if you trust him.

What would you girls out there do in my situation?



Okay So my ex and I have a child together. He was 18 and i was 17 when we found out I was pregnant. About three months after that he found himself in a terrible position and was accused of raping at 16 year old girl. He did almost 8 months and he's been out ever since. He and him had a great relationship. We both unofficially broke it off when he went to jail cause it was to hard to write and all that other stuff. He has been out for a while now and we've been talking for months and I know I still want to be with him. He openly admits to having sex and cheating on me. But denys that he forcibly had sex with this girl. I can get over him cheating on me because everyone deserves a second chance. My worry is what other people will think about him because he has this label? Can people give me what they would do in this situation maybe a little advice.

He's made his bed. He has only had sex with underage girls? Is that correct? Re-read that question and tell yourself how that sounds. Can you live with this for the rest of your life? Is this child you have a girl or boy? Is this guy a pedophile? These are all questions you need to answer for yourself before deciding.
Good luck!!!

hate to tell u this but all u can really do in this situation is tell her your concern and if u feel things are getting to out of hand make an anonymous phone call from a pay phone to the cops they will make the situation know to his and her parents and possibly scare the hell out of him. It sounds like she is gonna be on his side no matter what so trying to talk some sense into her is gonna be a waste of time

What this guy is doing is illegal,your mate is under the age of consent,have him arrested for sex with a minor. As for the beating he needs a taste of his own medicine,alas this is not an option so a campaign of mental torture is in order.

you cannot worry about upsetting her if she is potentially being abused in a relationship. you need to bring it up and talk to her saying how concerned you are.



if she decides not to listen to you, then i would advise speaking to her family or maybe an understanding teacher at school directly and voicing your concerns.

Don't feel so insecure...



You have beautiful eyes and lips and facial features. Stop worrying over your look and learn to feel confident and at peace. Then your inner strength will glow and you will appear even more beautiful, when there's harmony between your inside and outside.

How can i be more open and less shy?



i mean, people say "be yourself."
"don't worry about what other people say."



trust me, i don't care what people say. what others think dosen't really affect me anymore. it's just, being able to go up to someone and strike up a conversation is like getting a shot. (shot's freakin scare me man)



-.- i just freeze up when someone tries to talk to me. i can barely even nod my head or smile every so often. my conversation is little to non existent.



i hate being shy, it makes me feel so low



how do i get rid of the shyness and be my normal bubbly/'weird' self

How can I get my boyfriend to make me orgasm?



My bf has an orgasm everytime, but he gets really frustrated that I never do and it makes him feel inadequate, like he can't satisfy me.
I can give myself orgasms through masturbation, but I've never had one because of someone else.
I enjoy sex with my boyfriend, but I want to have an orgasm so that he doesn't feel bad. What can I do?

If you can have an orgasm when you masturbate, then he can give you an orgasm. All you have to do is tell him what to do. Place his hands, tongue, penis, etc. where it needs to be, and show him all the moves in order for you to climax.

There's a finger technique he could try on you.



He would take his pointer finger and middle finger, curl them upward slightly and insert them inside you.



With his free hand he presses slightly on your lower stomach while he moves these fingers inside and out of you.



Relax, you might feel like you're about to piss when you orgasm but it's NOT urine - it's an orgasm waiting to happen.

A lot of foreplay and slick Tender finger massage /with oral /if he is so inclined (on you ). maybe chose a position(reverse cowgirl) where you can easily reach to assist him with a clitoral tutorial by holding his fingers in between your fingers.=and you set the pace and penetration.== you could masturbate with your self  sitting on his chest.=  or during the make out portion of the event find a bony protrusion and bump it till your close then let him go in while you finish(he will too)= School desk(doggy style with you over a kitchen chair) should allow him plenty of acces to your Vzone and you too for a varity that will let him LEARN to EARN your O0oh Mi G0tt.

it is true that males get orgasm faster than females. but many dont realise it. the solution foreplay. foreplay ending with finguring and stimulating the g-spot before culminating in actual intercourse is a solution. discuss with your partner. mutual understanding partnership is a successful partnership whether in life; family or business. god bless you

First rule of thumb, empty your heads. Make room for love making and love making only. Sex is a product of the mind not the body. The mind is what triggers all emotion. Untill you can do this, orgasms for you sweetheart are a long way off. Make forplay longer as this will help you to empty your heads and he should slow down and take his time to bring you to that most wonderful moment that we all love. Good luck lovers...!!!

Most females cannot orgasm through penetration alone -



You and him putting more pressure and stress only makes things worse.



The good news is that you can have one when your by yourself, so you already know what to do...



the secret is that you need to stimulate your clitoris, there are many ways to do this but i would suggest you be on top and control the situation, you can use your hand, or he can use his, or you can use a toy... and stimulate yourself while he is penatrating you.



let him know when he is doing something that feels good.



take your time an relax... it takes practice.

Its not pathetic. It just means you're an introvert. Extroverts are people who have to be around people to express themselves and feel at ease. Introverts tend to enjoy themselves more. Its a bit more harder for introverts to have a lot of friends, but you should definitely talk to them more often if you value their friendship.

No, you are not pathetic.  Like the first person said, you are an introvert. =)



Honestly, if one of my friends had done this to me (and they have) I'd be annoyed.  I know you value your time alone but you should also try to be considerate.  I.e. if your friends keep calling or messaging, at least leave them one message to say you're on your alone time and you'd rather not be bothered.  I have my alone moments too, but I reply to messages and answer calls still (each person gets one, lol) in case of emergencies and to tell the person(s) that I want to be alone.



Other than that, you're not pathetic.  You're quite the opposite for knowing how to enjoy your time alone, enjoying your own company.  I think it somewhat shows that you can live with yourself =).  Good for you!

Of course that's not pathetic! Whoever said that about you is pathetic, actually, and really rude for someone who is supposed to be your friend. Not everyone is a social butterfly. I'm certainly not. I MUCH prefer to stay at home in bed with a book than to "hang out".



Next time that "friend" tells you that you are pathetic because you like to spend time alone, tell them that they are pathetic for needing to be around peopel so much. And when they get mad about it ask them how it freaking feels!

There is no Self Respect in Love?



I would give my life for my boyfriend but he just gives me 2% of his time and energy that too when he has nothing else to do. I wait for his 2% , when he would call me and ask me to stop by his office(railway station). Its convenienet for him as he doesnt need to make time to meet me to spend quality time. He is ashamed to meet me in front of colleagues so we meet outside slyly. He was 'forcibly' engaged to another woman by his sister and parents this February. Though the engagement was caled off because of his fiancees greed, his colleagues still think he is engaged and he refuses to tell them about my existence, or that he loves me and would want to marry me.
Last week my friend was really upset when I told her 'When you love someone, you should be happy even with 2% they give you' My friend thinks I am losing my self respect but I told her that 'In love there is no self respect' I am an Indian financially independant woman but I believe strongly that THERE IS NO SELF RESPECT IN LOVE.
Is my friend wrong to judge me because I am happy with 2 % even if I give him 200%

How do i know if my fiance has feelings for another woman?



My Fiance acts very nervous and funny around his close relatives wife, im very scared he has feelings for her. Im very paranoid because she is veryy attractive. There is obvious tension between me and her, only because of my suspicions, My fiance doesnt know i have these suspicions and i can never bring my self to ask him, because he gets very defensive over how much i dislike her. Im get very uncomfortable when shes around and i feel like my fiance starts to act a little different around her, he gets all fidgety and shy like. What do i do?.. am i just being paranoid?
How do i know if im right?

She acts totally normal, its only him, i know nothing has ever happened between them, but its hard to accept he has feelings for her. and i dont know it for a fact, but his actions around her make me nervous, and even if i was to ask, he will never admit it. So is there enough happening in front of me to be sure of what i fear the most?

The only problem that I see from what you've wrote is that they probably hooked up and now they're weirded out about it. What does her husband act around you? Does he notice these actions? It may be you just being paranoid but if you want answers, all you have to do is ask. The problem with that perhaps is that you may not like the answer. So, you could forget what's going on and move on with your life or leave him.

Help! My best friend's mom thinks I am a lesbian?



Me and my best friend "experimented" for about two weeks in May, just to explore our feelings. Turns out we both are totally straight. But, when we were "experimenting", I sent her an email revealing that we have done such things. Her mom saw the email, and ever since, she's been thinking I am a lesbian.



How can we convince her that both of us are straight? All the time my friend is at my house, her mom calls to check in and implies that we are doing "stuff". I do not want her mom getting this completely wrong idea. What can we do? (We are both 15).



Her mom is not a homophobic or anything, she is very liberal, but we still do not want her thinking we are lesbians/bisexual because if we're just hanging out as friends, she thinks we are doing "stuff" together



Thanks

On the top… in all life aspects.



What a difficult thing to reach, but if you want you can achieve it.



Well, to be honest, I would love to win the lottery and be very rich, so I would not care for work anymore and dedicate my life to enjoy what I really like… I would travel all over the world with all the time I want, stay where I want and try to get to know as many new people as possible and make new experiences like traveling through the jungle of the Amazons, traveling all over Africa and living with tribes…
And I would write a great book about all these adventures, a travel guide… then I would talk in TV travel channels about all the things I experimented.



Well, it is a dream… and I guess it will never be true.
Meanwhile I go on working in tourism management… at least it is what I like to do.

You have to find out if this boy is gay first or you will end up embarrassing yourself and him too.
If he is gay and you think you have gay tendencies then why not forget the letter and just go up to him and make friends, it can be quite casual at first until you find out where you go from there.
Lots of people do it all the time but sending a letter is cowardly and also can get into the wrong hands and is also evidence that he can show around if he is a straight guy.
Please dont humiliate yourself by putting anything in writing.
Good luck by the way and I hope you get what you want.

There is no Self Respect in Love?



I would give my life for my boyfriend but he just gives me 2% of his time and energy that too when he has nothing else to do. I wait for his 2% , when he would call me and ask me to stop by his office(railway station). Its convenienet for him as he doesnt need to make time to meet me to spend quality time. He is ashamed to meet me in front of colleagues so we meet outside slyly. He was 'forcibly' engaged to another woman by his sister and parents this February. Though the engagement was caled off because of his fiancees greed, his colleagues still think he is engaged and he refuses to tell them about my existence, or that he loves me and would want to marry me.
Last week my friend was really upset when I told her 'When you love someone, you should be happy even with 2% they give you' My friend thinks I am losing my self respect but I told her that 'In love there is no self respect' I am an Indian financially independant woman but I believe strongly that THERE IS NO SELF RESPECT IN LOVE.
Is my friend wrong to judge me because I am happy with 2 % even if I give him 200%

Nobody has the right to judge you, they can have an opinion and they are entitled to say something but by the same token you have the right to ignore it.
If you are happy having a meagre 2% of this mans life/love then I cant see what anybody elses point of view has got to do with you, you give 200% and you are happy with the equation its nobodies business but yours.
You are old enough to make your own happiness and you are old enough to make your own mistakes.
Good luck.

you may be happy at the moment but the more that you allow this behavior the more you will start feeling as if you are being used and abused.  The way that you describe him it sounds that he is embarassed by you and this eventually will erode your self esteem and self respect and honey you deserve to be loved and needed 100% and nothing less should be acceptable.  Someday the man of your dreams will walk into your life and you will still be settling too bad for you

She has proven her worth by the lies she is telling just to be thought of as hard and cool, she is not going to be popular for long when they realise that she is the bully and not you.
Hold your head up and your true friends are the only ones that count and they will not believe her for one moment.
This will pass in time if you just ignore it, if you rise to it it will carry on for ever and she is trying to wind you up by this so dont take the bait.
Good luck - oh and by the way she was never your friend.

In a way, she is trying to find out if she is the sort of girl that you want to be with, but, at the same time, it is a question that should initiate a lot of conversation, and flirting, which are both good to securing a relationship.
