Where is a good place to go on holiday in early september?



Me and my family are planning to go on a holiday for my parent's 30th wedding anniversary. We are planning to go in late August or early September in 2009. We want to go somewhere exotic with beaches. I know at this time of year some places have their monsoon season, but we would like a hot country! We would also like a country with big cities for shopping and touristy things. We also would be interested in a place with local history and culture. We would like the destination not to be in Europe, but a bit further a field. As this is a special occasion and we have saved up lots of money for this holiday? I know itâ€™s a lot to ask for. But does anyone have any good suggestions for a holiday destination for that time of the year? Thanks as we are struggling for ideas!

Australia. It's gorgeous, sunny and warm year-round. So unique and friendly and safe. It's modern and also has a lot of history. Sydney is by far the nicest city, and Melbourne and Brisbane are a close second on my list.



I lived in Sydney for a year and it's my most favorite place on earth. I don't know of anyone who has been to Australia and hated it.

Well as I lived in Fiji for 3 years I would strongly recommend it, the beaches are the most beautiful and unspoilt in the world with incredible snorkelling and diving, if going, Nadi (pronounced Nandi) is the place to go, there is plenty of culture in Fiji and make sure to try the traditional Fijian drink Kava! (Look up Blue Lagoon Cruises, Fiji islands) Hope that helped

Brazil might be a country that would be fairly hot in early September, as the southern hemisphere is going into Spring as we, in the northern hemisphere are going into Fall at that time.. And there are beautiful beaches there and big cities for lots of shopping.  I've heard that the people there are very friendly and even speak English.

You should check out Argentina, the weather is beautiful and there is lots of fun touristy things to do. One of the biggest attractions is Iguazu Falls created by a volcanic eruption that left a large crack in the earths surface which is approximately 1.5 miles long and has over 275 falls which cascade from. The thunderous roar of the falls can be heard up to 5 miles away and rightfully so as over 450,000 gallons of water crash over the falls each second. Nestled among some of the most lush rain forests in South America with a plethora of trails and sight seeing options, Iguazu Falls is a must if in the area of Argentina or Belize.

October is the middle of spring in New Zealand, which is nice if you want something different. It's not too warm here in spring though, you can't really swim in the sea this early.



Try one of the other pacific islands, like Samoa or New Caledonia

I reckon Cuba because to see what's extravagant about Havana. I heard this song from Havana Nights, dunno who it's by, and the second Dirty Dancing movie took place there. Then I'd like to check out some flamenco and salsa dancing while eating salsa.



Speaking of salsa, one night when I was taking Salsa, and this dude mistaken me for a latina because I was in a flamenco skirt! lol! I mean, he asked if I was latina.

Sad that Havana got hit so hard with that hurricane....

If you like adventure I would go to Iran.  I was there for a year during the time of the Shah and went all over the country.  The people are really friendly and just about everyone has a friend or family member with a relative in the USA.  My wife's hairdresser who is now a US citizen goes back to see family regularly.  She never has any problems.  I don't think you will have any troubles there either and the country is really interesting.

Next Summer Trip: Fiji or New Zealand?



So my family and I were supposed to go this last summer, but because my mom is having job issues, we couldn't make it.

We are deciding between Fiji and New Zealand.

I know they both have a lot of different things to offer, I really want to go to Fiji just because it is my dream vacation since forever, but my mom and brother would rather go to NZ. :/

If your idea of a vacation is lying on the beach and soaking up the sun....then definitely Fiji.

If you like to sightsee, have beautiful scenery, beaches, mountains, fjords, glaciers, hot springs, good wine, adventure (bungee jumping, orbing, skydiving, etc), nice cities (Auckland and Wellington), .....among other things, then definitely New Zealand.



I have been to both and prefer NZ, but it is ultimately what you want for a vacation.

We had the same issue when we planned a trip 2 years ago.  We decided to go for NZ because it had so much to offer.  We only went the North Island for 10 days.  We did a big loop, but didn't go to wellington.  We saw some spectacular scenery there - hot springs in the Coromandel and Rotorua, beautiful beaches all along the coast, a really cool cave in Waikato, I believe, beautiful gardens in Hamilton, volcanoes and Lake Taupo.  We LOVED it there and highly recommend it!

If you are taking a plane it is 1,130 dollars to make the trip.
Then I would say about 4,000 to stay for a week.

Well , if you're planning to go out on a trip you should never be limited on money , you always have to take some extra cash just in case .

I'm guessing about  $10,000 minimum , remember that you're going to be there for a week .

Umm. Woah. I'm reeling over the first 2 answers. $8 to $10,000? I went on a round the world trip last year (Most of the countries in South America, Central America, West and East coast of USA, England and France, then back to Australia) and it cost $17,000 all up. For the WHOLE year. And that's Australian $ which is worth less than the American $. So, I'd say the 3rd answers more realistic. Unless of course you are reckless with your money, then I guess it could creep up to 10 grand.
