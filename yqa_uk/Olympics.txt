How does it happen that a gymnast wins the World Championships but then she comes like 16th at the olympics?



I've read about many gymnasts who has won the world championships but then get like 16th place at the olympics or something. How is it possible that this could happen? I mean, in both competitions the countries competes against each other. How can you be the best in the world and then fall that far back in a matter of months?

gymnastics of subjectively judged, not objectively.  In a sport like swimming, the score comes from a computer timer.  In a sport like gymnastics, the judge is human and their "opinion" fuels the score.  A different judge will score the same performance differently.

They are Gold Plated:



"Olympic medals must be at least 60 millimetres in diameter and at least three millimetres thick.



Gold and silver medals must be made of 92.5 percent pure silver; the gold medal must be gilded with at least six grams of gold.



The design of the medal is the responsibility of the host city's organising committee, with the approval of the IOC."

This has got to be some of the Apollo astronauts. On re-entry of their command module to the Earth's atmosphere at the end of their mission they had been falling from the height of the moon's orbit. IIRC, Apollo 10 was the fastest re-entry of all the Apollo missions.



As it hit the top of the earth's atmosphere and started slowing down, Apollo 10's command module, with astronauts Thomas Stafford, John Young, and Eugene Cernan inside, was traveling at about 11.1 km/sec, which works out to 6.9 miles/sec, or 24,830 miles per hour.

Some countries support their Olympic teams, but in this country government money is not used to fund the Olympic athletes, so the idea that the gold in Olympics comes from our own pockets is not true.

You first need to be able to do it on the tramp. Work there first. That way it doesn't hurt if you fall and it's easier to jump high.

Well the first thing you need to do is get your back bend.  If you can't stretch you back in the shape of a back bend you wont be able to do a back handspring.  So work on that first, keep practicing and stretching out your back every day until you get it.



It's hard to get a bhs unless your at a gymnastics/cheerleading place with mats, and someone who knows how to spot, so see if you can get help with someone.  If anyone has a big trampoline those are really helpful too.



I wouldn't recommend trying one without a spotter and someone who knows what they're doing.. but if you have one.. Star with your hands straight out in front of you, swing them down past your legs, then throw them over your head and jump back.. with your legs bend them like your sitting in a chair and lean back, and once you feel like your about to fall jump backward with your legs and onto your hands, make sure your arms are completely locked, and throw your legs over your head and back to the ground.



You should also practice handstands and popping off of your hands from your shoulders while your in your handstand.



Good luck!

well first off you need to get enrolled in a tumbling class of some sort next you should start doing a bridge kick over then maybe doing them on a trampoline and finally on a mat and my teacher always tells me once you have it on a trampoline or mat you have it its just the floor thats changing also when you get it picture yourself doing it perfectly and most likely that will give you the boost you need and you will be able to do it

Is it to late for me to become a gymnast? =[?



ok well i'm 13 and i really want to be a gymnast and go to the Olympics. I've wanted to be a gymnast for over 3 years now. I really like the sport and i think it's so much fun. Every night i stretch out and practice gymnastics moves. I go to the gym twice a week with my mom and I practice on the mats there. I'm really flexible and i have alot of muscle in my legs from playing soccer for years (hate soccer, parents made me do it) I fianlly quit soccer and I want to become a gymnast! I love gymnastics sooo much and I want to be in a gymnastics academy and I want to be the best I can be. My mom said she would get me a private gymnastics teacher and enroll me in a gymnastics academy. I'm willing to practice alot more than every night. But i'm afraid i'm too old to become a gymnast. Do you think I could become a gymnast? And if so, Do you think I could be in the Olympics if i train extremely hard? What are the chances??? Is it impossible?

No way is it too late to become a gymnast! And anything is possible! I started tumbling about a year ago, and I couldn't do anything. I remember doing a handstand, and being quite impressed with my self...and then I did more, and I got better at it! I'm turning 15 in december, and I know exactly how you feel. By what you've said, it seems as if you work really hard. There is a possibility that you could take part in the olympics. Anything is possible!! But if you want to follow your dream, you need to work hard, and I know that you can!

It is to an extent based on popularity.  You have to have the sport played in many nations, then you need to have one central governing body for that sport, then you start lobbying the IOC to get your sport into the olympics.  It then is a matter of them voting it in.

<answer>



Yes popularity or more specifically a number of countries from each continent is part of the criteria as the IOC calls this universality.



#1 In order to be reconsider as an Olympic sport you must have an international governing body and a world championships.



For example Basketball is governed by FIBA and has a world championship every 2 years with next one for both men and women in 2010.



http://www.olympic.org/uk/organisation/i...



#2 Sports International Federation must be in compliance with the Olympic Charter which means Anti-Doping Code and conduct effective out of contest testing



#3 Summer Olympic Sports- For men participants in 75 countries over 4 continents and women 40 countries/3 continents.



Winter sports 25 countries



These means the countries must be an active participant and belong to ht sporting federation. Sport doesn't necessarily have to be popular as Ice Hockey isn't really popular in Ireland yet it's a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation.



#4 Physical not mechanical athletic performance is required. Sports, disciplines or events in which  performance depends on mechanical propulsion is not acceptable.



#5 Usually the sport is a recognized sport and has held at least 2 International championships before it's even considered



Then the Olympic executive board will hold an up or down vote on the sport.Currently there's is only room for 28 sports in the Summer Olympics and 8 sports will be voted on in 2016 to see which 2 will be chosen.



They include Baseball, Softball, Rugby 7's, Karate, Golf, Squash, Roller sports and as of yet unnamed 8th sport.

An Olympic record is like a meet record, that is only set or broken during a particular meet.
A world record can be set or broken at any time during a sanctioned or certified meet.
Sometimes world records are set during the Olympics so that would be an Olympic and world record, which means they are the same record.



The reason most world records are faster than Olympic records is because the athletes have more opportunities, and during the Olympics each event has several preliminaries which takes more effort and fatigues the athletes, so their best performance is usually in a meet where there aren't any prelims.

A world record can be set in any sporting competition, whereas Olympic records can only be set during the Olympics, hence the difference between times. However it is possible to set a world record in the Olympics this happens frequently, as shown by Michael Phelps who set 8 world records in 1 Olympics.

A world record is a record that stands for the entire world to strive to beat.  An olympic record is a record set during the olympics only.  If the olympic record is broken it can only happen during the olympics.  But an olympic record can simultaneously be a world record.

Benefits to Olympic Lifts?



Olympic lift-style weightlifting has a higher risk of injury than other forms of resistance training, as you're only using a barbell and lifting from the floor upward in a quick manner. I wanted to know if there were any advantages to this style of training that you would not get in ordinary weight training, ie using barbells in a controlled manner, dumbbells, straps, machines and body weight resistance.



Thanks

Don't confuse weight-lifting with weight-training.



Sensible weight-training involves taking 10%-20% of your maximum ability and pressing ten times.

Depends on the intensity of your traditional training and your ultimate goals. I could type way too much to bore the crap out of you but I'll try to keep it short and sweet.



The Olympic lifts offer total-body training and a higher level of conditioning then, say, one day of chest training then one day of back and so on. The Olympic lifts, done correctly, require muscle recruitment across the entire body, so doing a clean is going to work quads, hamstrings, shoulders, back, bicep, tricep and on and on. It does carry a higher risk of injury but you can also expect greater impact on the metabolism and nervous system.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Voters</evaluation>



Personally I don't like the abstract form, I appreciate the UK is formed from differant entities but the logo does NOT appear very united in its presentation. It presents itself as unfinished and only partial in its representation, the still image reminds me of a splatter of pink, not representational of the strength, courage and determination the people of the UK are known for, hardly a go get them image!
The active image I saw on the News this morning reminded me of a throw back to something from the 80's. Need I say more.



As to representational of London? I recognise no aspect of the logo that makes me surmise an image of London? (I'm not talking literally) Yes I recognise the multi-cultural aspect but that's all.



I urge the Olympics committee, hold off getting the merchandise printed, I shallnt be purchasing any keepsakes if the logo remains the same.



May I suggest that a Blue Peter art competition for the children would have offered us a more promising alternative!!!



If you are looking for the silk lining in this review the only one I can offer is this
Selecting such a good example for being controversial, obviously raises its position as a good media news story, its not likely to be imediately forgotten, possibly good in the sense that it raises awareness in the fact that in 2012 the Olympics are to be in London???? Some kind of marketing kick back somewhere, surely?????????!!!!!!!!
Who was the marketing Company????

Well lets say we were in a world with no technology, back to the caveman days.

I would rank all types of fighting first, taekwondo, boxing, judo.

Next would be running, most likely sprinting, then long distance

After that i would say archery, could get some mad kills way back in the cavemen day.

And of course swimming after that.

The Chef d'Mission of each team organises two ballots for every member of the team. The first ballot is to determine the team captain. The second ballot determines the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. The closing ceremony flag bearer is usually the person who has made an outstanding acheivement in those Games for that nation.

Who cares about Tibet, really? Ever though about all of the countries in poverty, under the control of another country? The only reason people say free Tibet is becuase they want to jump on the cultural band wagon and look like in it for such a good cause. The fact of the matter is, people hate China and want to free Tibet, because everyone else hates China, and wants to free Tibet.

I think it's high time we stop over-stepping our boundaries and imposing our morals and values on the rest of the world, and let the world run it as is. There's a reason America is so hated.

Only in giving the best luck in throwing an excellent Olympics.  Meaning excellent weather, fair competetion, and as little political interference as possible.  That includes protesters, political showboating or ones upmanship by any country.  This is a time and place to enjoy the world coming together and playing and competing with each other and enjoying each other's cultures and company.  I hate when people try to politicize the games for whatever reason it spoils the experience for everyone.

All the builders who screw the government for more money on the pretence of increased costs, lining their own pockets.
All the ticket touts selling tickets at stupid prices. The criminal fraternity are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of all the money they are going to con.
Yea I'm racist, racist the criminal race to a fortune.

Yes, you can clain nationality by naturalization or even easier if you claim it by decent or birth. Like how Merlene Ottey is now running for Barbados. If your parents are Jamaican, you have methods to claim citizenship.

What I'd like to know is how the hell did the US manage to adopt that 10000m African athlete that was winning them all for Ethiopia I think

There are different rules for the federations of different countries and sports. For example, Becky Hammon, an American-born WNBA player, is playing basketball for the Russia team because she had previously played internationally in a Russian League, and since she had never played for another country internationally, they allowed her to become a naturalized citizen and play for them. She has no ancestral ties to Russia, but she did it because she was told that she would not make Team USA and she wanted to compete in the Olympics. So, it depends on the rules of the sport and the country.

Yes, you would have to become a citizen of that country or a permanent resident. Rebecca Hammon did it in basketball. She was snubbed by the US team, now she is playing for Russia.

Rebecca Lynn "Becky" Hammon (Russian: Ребекка Линн Хаммон; born March 11, 1977) is a professional basketball player currently under contract with the San Antonio Silver Stars of the WNBA. An American by birth, she took up Russian citizenship in order to play for Russia in the 2008 Olympics. From: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becky_Hammo...

The Chinesse believe that 8 is a very lucky number , and amazingly dur to their good fortune they get the games in 2008, which means they can staret them on 8.8.08. That is very lucky is it not? Dont you think so???

Drastically depends on the sport.  many athletes have been training for the same event for 5+ years.  Each year builds on the foundation of training from previous years.



Most elite athletes train in "macrocylces" with the cycles designed to lead to peak peformance on the date of their event.  A macrocycle begins with a "base strength" phase, where the muscles are strengthened and a cardio base is built.  Then it gets progressively more specific including speed training or whatever the event requires.  Intensity increases while quantitiy is reduced to prevent fatigue/injury.  If the cycle is successful it will result in peak performance on or about teh week of the event.



Its actually very scientific at the elite level, with coaches who have studied human physiology and usually having a doctorate in the field.  Its much much more complicated and scientific  than "just train and train hard and eat nutritious".



Actually during the current time period most athletes are in the "tapering" phase that will lead to maximum strength for their event.  A taper is designed to allow full recovery and training effect from the previous bouts of intense, sport specific training in the last phase of the macrocycle.  There are also microcyles, and mesocylcles within a training regimen.  type training macrocylcles in google and you will see it is really over our heads unless we are a sports physiologist.

Here is the basic format of a 10-month macrocycle:



* Phase 1 - General development of strength, mobility, endurance and basic technique



* Phase 2 - Development of specific fitness and advanced technical skills



* Phase 3 - Competition experience - achievement of indoor objectives



* Phase 4 - Adjustment of technical model, preparation for the main competition



* Phase 5 - Competition (Olympics)



* Phase 6 - Active recovery - planning preparation for next season

good genes. They probably had to be really strong because of the harsh environment they lived in, so they developed like that because the strongest survive and the strongest in that area were good at running. Not all Africans are runners, there are short Africans where their short stature is more useful in their environment than height and speed. Africans are the most genetically diverse out of any race, nature favors diversity.

Well, some of it is genes, 'cause not all Africans are great runners.  Also, in Africa, running as a sport is encouraged, they really like to run and play soccer in schools.  Lastly, most Africans travel everywhere by foot, and from walking and running so much every single day, they are very fit and fast.

They run fast because when they are kids they carry a crate of 25-30 drinks on there head for a mile and they do that everyday. Sometimes they carry a pale of water on ther head for 5 miles so they can take a shower.
They also have to walk 2 miles to get to school. In school they do obsticle courses almost everyday. They run and practice for the olympics when they are like 7 years old and up.

I was born and grew up in Africa. I was white and privelaged. Being born in Africa I consider myself and African. However my black African friends were not as fortunate as me. Whenever they went anywhere, they ran to get there. Their school was literally miles from where they lived. To do their early morning chores and then get to school on time, they had to run. They had this sort of very relaxed jog. It's hard to explain. Like a young child when it first starts to walk. They sort of lean forward and then have to put one foot forward to stop themselves from toppling forward. Then they are off. It is just so relaxed and natural. And they grow up with that easy relaxed way of running.

Also, African tribes have different body shapes and attributes. That's why some countries produce long distance runners and some sprinters. The Kenyans are by type very slim and  have natural physiques suited to long distance running, whilst others are more muscular and suited to sprinting. They would be more Southern Tribes.

Hope that helps

becuase thats the only sport affordable theyre good at. Africa is a very poor country suffering from famine, droughts, money inflations etc hence we see all the africans concentrating only on athletics as it is the cheapest.
Give them the proper facilities (which is highly unlikely currently) then africans would excel in other sports too.
While Africa sits there and starves we criticise on why africans are so good at running.

the runners all come from 2 countries: ethiopia and kenya. no other african country has any long distance runners. ethiopians and kenyans are generally slim people. running/jogging is part of life there especially the rural areas where the schools can be miles away.

Ireland has never hosted the Olympics, but hopefully they will eventually, because that is a beautiful country.



The Olympics started in Greece a seriously long time ago.  (like in the BC era).  They used to only allow men to play the sports, and they were always in the nude (gross, I know).
I think there is a legend or something that says that the Games were started by the greek gods, but I may be wrong about that.

Interesting question.  I am not sure that the safety of the competitors and spectators cannot be guaranteed.  However there have been a number of issues that have come to the fore since the selection of China which have drawn the interest away from the competition, including Tibet and the freedom of information issues etc.  Whilst this is regrettable it might come down to the IOC making the selection of the host city a little less controversial and political as this one.

China is making a mockery of the games and what they 'traditionally' stand for. The only other time it has become such a farce was in Germany when Hitler likened Jesse Owens to an ape. The Olympics is about expression, freedom and a celebration of the human spirit. China seem hell bent on squashing anything human out of the games. No drunks, no negative slogans (define that mate), no mental illness (whoah you can stop now) and now wait for it, no Sexually transmitted diseases...(never been done before) and next week just to completely make them safe, no tourists, no athletes, sh#t, lets just say no human beings!! Bloody joke is what most of the world is thinking. I just feel sorry for the Chinese people that have to live with a govt that seems hellbent on destroying human rights

Where did you get your conclusion that the safety of all competitors and spectators cannot be guaranteed? The games are not going to be held in your home, how can it not be guaranteed?

Thanks for 2nd chance to answer the same question; grammar notwithstanding.

First of all I don't think that it has been proposed as a sport. Why don't you propose it? You might have to convince your local IOC country representative that it is a sport and worthwhile him/her putting the time in.

In reality Dodgeball is really only played in the US. The rest of us even have trouble spelling 'dodgeball'.

Many foreign athletes in the Olympics..



So many athletes representing the US are not really American.



For instance Luikin, who was actually born in Russia, or Wang Chen from china in table tennis, to mention just two, represent the US. Is it necessary to get help for another people to have some representation in these competitions ?



Does it mean there is not enough good American athletes to represent ourselves ?

Clearly you know nothing about the history of the US and what it actually means to be American. I'm not going to bother explaining it to you because anyone who knows the most famous single quote in our nation's history knows what I'm talking about. You don't need to know much, if any, history, honestly. So I won't bother with that, useless.



Anyway, most foreign athletes train in the US with US trainers and attending US universities. Then you have people like the American girl who was a reject for the American team for basketball and is now the STAR on the Russian team.



Americans always clean this thing up. 90% of the people on the court/track/field/etc. are trained by Americans or they are American.

Hardly.  There are plenty of atheletes competing for countries other than those of their birth.  There are even some Americans competing for other countries. Chris Kaman of the NBA is an American citizen. He recently got his German citizenship for the explicit purpose of playing on the German basketball team at the Olympics. Giovanni Lanaro is an American, born and raised in L.A., and he will be representing Mexico in the pole vault. Five of the nine boxers on Mexico's boxing squad are Americans. There was even a Jamaican woman who sprinted for Slovenia.



The U.S. actually has strict standards as far as who compete under our flag, requiring that all atheletes on the U.S. team hold American citizenship. Most countries, like Mexico, welcome atheletes who merely decend from that country.



What this means is that atheletes go where they are provided the best opportunities to excell and make a difference.  Sometimes that means Americans leaving, and other times it means America accepting help from its "adopted" citizens.

Look, the answer is a bit rough, but you will thank me in the long run.

If you asked your question right, it means that you don't like this particular sport, but maybe you do like others.  I don;t know.

You seem to be having trouble explaining to, or about to explain to a girl that you do not share in her passion for the game.  Which is perfectly fine to feel.

Trouble is, you really, really like her, know what I mean?

So, you bite the bullet and humor her for the season and enjoy the off season with her, your dream girl.

Next season, if you two are still a thing, you can begin to drop hints.  Don't worry about it.

Neither.  The Olympics have been moved to Iraq as a gesture of support for their new democracy.  I heard they are going to put some suicide bombers behind the men for the 100m sprint to try and set some world records.

It looks like plenty of people have given you a geography lesson already, so I'll just say that the games are being held in a country ruled by a communist dictatorship, and I am very disappointed that we aren't boycotting them.  Not only are we not boycotting, Bush is going to go.  The first time an American president has ever gone to the Olympics in a foreign country, and this idiot had to do it in China.

200-205 countries are expected to participate in the coming 2008 Olympic Games. The decision regarding the ban of Iraq from participating had been overturned by IOC last week.  Marshall Islands and Tuvalu gained NOC status in 2006 and 2007 respectively are expected to participate in the games. North Korea, South Korea, Serbia and Montenegro will compete separately(not a united team) in the games.

Look, you should have asked this in a different category, but I will still try and help you out:

1) It is necessary because if he doesn't know who won or lost the oher games played by the teams in his favorite team's division, he won't be able to brag the next day at work, bet or make changes to his fantasy league team.

2) You need to find a new BF?

There are several contexts that would need different answers to this question, such as:

1. You don't share his (level of) interest: He wants to watch Every Game - and wants you to watch too.  If so, you can explain that you have other interests or things to do, and that you will join him in watching certain events only.

2. You don't think he's making a good use of his time, and that other interests/responsibilities may be sacrificed if he spends too much time watching the games.  If this is the case, speak to him of the importance of those other responsibilities.

3. You want to spend more time with the BF, but he's watching (too many) games. If this is the case - then possibly he's just not into you the same way you're into him.  Bite the bullet, and find someone who has more shared interests with you.

Yes, certainly.  Once Team-GB start taking Gold, public interest lights up.  I can still remember our Girls Curling Team winning gold at the Winter Olympics [forget where] the interest was suddenly massive - people who had never heard of Curling suddenly became experts almost overnight avidly reading anything and everything on the subject.

Duncan Goodhew [not sure of spelling] was on TV yesterday and he came out with a great remark, describing the Beijing Olympics as the Team-GB warm up for the 2012 London Olympics.

I am very thrilled for them. I know they are working hard to put on a show in 2012 and really push for greatness there and judging by this years effort it seems to be paying off.

My best friend is British, and she has been floored by how well they are doing. Seeing them in the top three on the medal tally last night was quite thrilling for her because it had been so long since they had done so well - something she had never seen before.



I think it really will help to capture the coming spirit that they will need as the next host, and I know that my friend and one of her friends have been inspired to volunteer come 2012. She is naturally with some regret as an exploding chest ended her gymnastics career, but if she and her friend are anything to go by, I think you will find that the British spirit is now alive and well and I hope for them that it carries them well into 2012.

I just wish they hadn't paid 400,000 pounds for the ugliest logo in the history of the Olympics..

I'm not a huge swimming fan, in fact I don't watch it in any form. However I am finding it interesting to see all of the negative questions being posted on here about Phelps. The guy has won 8 gold medals in this Olympics. I personally thought this was a great feat. (My personal opinion, not fact nor judgement on others opinions).
Is this a case of the "Tall Poppy Syndrome", or are there facts about Phelps that the rest of the world doesn't know about that warrants such negativity? This by the way is a serious question, I am interested to know...not to judge, but pure curiosity.

Anyone who over achieves to the extent Phelps has is going to draw out detractors and suspicion of performance enhancing drug use.

Humans are naturally skeptical and jealous and will always try to drag outstanding individuals back down to the level of the pack.

Agreed it is tall poppy syndrome though i would defiantly have loved Phelps be an Australian. People would probbale be less inclined to be negative about Phelps if he wasn't a feature of the montages which waste important coverage time on seven.

I honestly don't think people think he cheats its just a bit of reflex action for all those stupid Q&A about China cheating in the gymnastics.
Shame really because sour grapes is the one thing that has really tarnished these games and look at the way that poor girl Alicia was treated because she made a mistake in the old days they would of tarred and feathered her.

You are so right ... it is the Tall Poppy Syndrome in action, and it's really a very sad phenomenon. Phelps did wonderfully well and has every right to feel proud of the fantastic achievements he has worked so hard for. It's sad that people see that and yearn to pull him to pieces and look for what they can criticise. It happens to a lot of people who achieve so highly though - there are those lurking in the shadows just waiting to pounce to mar the purity of the happiness they should be able to feel.
I think it's a sad lesson for our kids to see too, that no matter how highly they achieve, it seems it will never be good enough for some people, who would readily belittle their accomplishments and magnify their flaws.

It's a very sad phenomenon. It seems that anyone who is successful ends up being the object of bitter, jealous derision - but maybe it's human nature, a lot of people can't bear to see someone else's success - and the critics quite conveniently forget the years of struggle and sacrifice it's taken for someone like Phelps to get to where he is now.



The "Tall Poppy Syndrome" is rife here in Australia, too - I remember when our own "super-fish" Ian Thorpe won all his gold medals in Athens, and plenty of "fellow Australians" delighted in criticising him - later topped off by the media-generated allegation that Thorpe took performance-enhancing drugs. His critics were positively salivating  - yes, even his own countrymen (though it turned out that Thorpe was clean.)

It's strange how this phenomenon exists - I myself was a victim of it years ago when I succeeded in music. I've thought a lot about it over the years, wondering why Aussies are generally so intent on lopping everyone else down to size - maybe it has something to do with our convict heritage...

Interesting question, Nat!

most olympic runners and other athletes train at very high altitudes so there breathing is more restrained, so when they come back to a lower altitude it is way easier to take deeper breaths and then there bodies can pump more oxygen throughout itself better and more sufficiently than before the high altitude training.

While this has been a trend within the past, it was mostly due to the birth of several nations - e.g. with end of colonialism, many countries in Asia and Africa became independent nations, and similarly with the breakup of Soviet Union and the countries of Yugoslavia.  These grew their own Sports federations, and became eligible to send athletes under their new nations' flags.

When the number of countries in the world stabilizes, that will also affect the number of participants in future Olympics.

A related topic is the number of sports and athletes: the number of sports has been capped at 28, and the number of athletes has stabilized at around 10,000. Those numbers are expected to stay about the same in future games.

Hope this helps...

Not neccesarily, for instance North and South Korea unified for the 2000 and 2004 Olympics and competed as simply "Korea".



Unfortunately I dont think they are going to do the same this year... so there will be more countries in that respect.



Of course there are always more and more new countries and countries who are able to afford competitors when they couldnt before, or who have competitors who have reached the desired standard for entry into the Olympics when they havent had any before.

Also it makes the contest in the 100 m realyl really exciting, 3 world record holders racing for gold, 3 different personalities and styles/stories. so cool also looking forward to the 110 m hurdles that will very interesting and the 200m.

Bolt definitely has a chance to win the double.  Yes, he is the favorite right now, but don't count out Tyson Gay or Usafa Powell in the 100 meters when healthy, these guys have a lot of experience, and will be big factors.  Also Walter Dix could be an threat for a medal as well.



In the 200 meters Bolt said he likes this race better than the 100, so I would say he's a clearer favorite in the 200 meters.

Bolt has the WR, yes, but so far this season Asafa has been doing quite well and is more experianced as a whole. Unfortunatley, Asafa doesn't run well under a lot of pressure (Olympics, World Championships, etc.) so that could be his downfall (but he's getting better at it). And with Gay the type of runner he is, if he gets a good enough start, he could be doing quite well for a medal (assuming his hamstring is fine).



In the 200m, Bolt is already WL. Although Dix and Spearmon could probabaly give him a run for gold. If Gay hadn't cramped up, I'd expect gold to be his.



110mH will be good. Trammell, Oliver, Xiang and Robles will make it a great race.

I am. Because I'm fu*king bored all day long.

p.s. Some of you people really fusty. Open up your eyes and read some newspaper. After long time of improvement including investing billions of dollars in planting trees, building parks and lawns, closing down many factories, forcing half of Beijing's cars to leave the road, and with the help of rain and east wind, I bet Beijing's air condition now is better than that of London. So those who expect causalities among athletes because of polluted air must feel disappointed. Sorry!

Yes! Why shouldn't they continue?

In a world of constant war and violence, the Olympics is, and remains, the only tradition which all cultures and races can relate to. In my opinion, the Olympics are the most important event in the world, especially in terms of raising awareness of other cultures.

It looks like an upside down Nike swoosh. But he's got a Puma logo on his shirt so I would lean toward Puma. Plus, the site for Puma running shoes has got Usane Bolt all over it.

Well rollers are a type of animal - a group of birds from family Coraciidae. Although I'm not sure that the Australian mens wheelchair basketball team is named after the animal, cause there is only one species of roller found in Australia, and its common name is Dollarbird.

Hey, 
Bars can be described as two bars usually with a difference of 150cm. One bar is lower to the ground than the other. It is one of the hardest apparatus' and requires great upper body strength.
Vault is a run from 25 metres to a vaulting horse which has a spring board in front of it in which the gymnast jumps on to spring into the air to complete their vault. Height and a stuck landing is needed.



Three bar skills are:
1. Glide kip- a glide on the bottom bar and then pulling your feet towards the bar forcing the body up to land in a front support. 
2. Cast- pulling your legs forward under the bar and then thrusting them backwards and high up behind you. the body should stay straight, feet as high as your botom. the best casts are hoprizontal or above. 
3. backhip-Circle- requires as a cast before hand. Then your body continues backwards around the bar with a straight body.

Three vault skills are:
1. handstand flatback onto 2 or four mats- run, hurdle, put hands down with straight arms and a straight body passes though handstand to land flat on your back on 2/4 crashmats.
2. handspring- run, hurdle, hands on the vaut, straight arms and legs straight and together. pass through handstand to land on feet onto one crashmat. 
3. Full twist- run, hurdle, hands on the vaut, straight arms and legs straight and together. pass through handstand and twist a full 360* to land on feet onto one crashmat.



Rules- dont go before the judges show a green flag, stop before red flag, present before and after routine.

Scoring- A panel decides A score (usually under 7 and gets higher by the harder the skills in the routine). B Panel decides dedustions (always out of a 10). The deductions are averaged and minused from 10 and added to the A score to get the final score.
Some deductions are:
-0.8 for a fall 
-0.5 for a deep squat on a landing
-0.1/0.3/0.5 for bent arms or legs
-0.1 for going out of direction on landing
-0.1/0.8 for a lack of wow factor on vault.

Generally you can only take 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8 for a deduction

Hope that helps. What do you need this information for??

adult Pony jumpers usef?



I saw a question on here saying that there is going to be an adult pony jumper division. I am not sure this is true but i dont think it is. It was asked a year ago if they wanted adults to ride ponies they would have done it already. Anyway it would not be fair for adults to ride against juniors. I started pony jumpers with my two ponies when i was 8. Now they r 2 of the best pony jumpers in the country. I am just saying it would be ridiculaus for adults to ride against children. If u read this leave  an  answer saying wat u think

She is an Aboriginal.  She was an athlete, now retired from the sport. Her greatest claim, prior to being selected to light the Olympic flame at the Sydney 2000 Olympics was a gold medal in a women's relay team at the Commonwealth games.  In my mind, she shouldn't have been  selected to light the flag.  She did go on to win the 400m at the Sydney games.  She comes across as a wonderful girl, and a great ambassador, but I don't think she did enough to warrant the flame.  The whole of the Sydney Olympics, in my opinion, was a big 'suck up' to the Aboriginals.
Before you even think about it, I am NOT a racist.  My best friends and neighbors are Aboriginals.

Because it is a rule in olympics that only 3 players who are above 23 years can play.in international team most of the players are above 23 years.so,every player can not come.

What does a gold medal w/ a red ribbon in taekwondo mean?(10 pts)?



i'm a white belt and i just finished my white belt testing(for yellow belt) a few hours ago, after the test, my master gave me a gold medal with a red ribbon, while the other white belters got a gold medal with a BLUE ribbon...does anyone know what place i got???



p.s im from the U.S, if that helps



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I don't think you are given this medal for winning but for successfully completing your tests.
A gold medal should mean the same thing, regardless of the color ribbon.
A blue ribbon usually means first place, but I have seen lots of first place medals with red ribbons.
If it concerns you ask the master.
Otherwise be happy in your accomplishments, and remember martial arts are not about competing.

Beijing Prices:
While opening ceremony prices are capped at 5,000 yuan (US$641) per head, the lowest price to view a sports competition will cost 30 yuan (US$4). Athletic competition preliminary tickets range from 30-300 yuan(US$4-39) and tickets to the finals from 60-1,000 yuan(US$8-128).



London Prices will probably be higher- you'd be able to buy tickets from the London 2012 website. Events will be taking place across the country so it's a perfect excuse for a visit (pack thicker clothes and an umberella if you go to Newcastle for the football (soccer)) :)

The tickets usually go on sale about 1 year before the Olympics.
The more popular events cost more than the  minor sports.
Tickets cost more for finals than prelims.
If you are going to attend a popular final you can pay several hundred dollars for a decent seat, and thousands for a prime seat.

yes, I was at the Olympics, I had a very good time.
The arenas were spectacular, and the people very polite and helpful.
This is the third time I have visited China, but the first time to Beijing.
I like to see remarkable things, I visited the Great Wall, Forbidden City, Lama Temple, Summer Palace, Temple of Heaven, and toured the city.

The opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics was one of the most spectacular event that I have seen in a long time. There was magic, magnificence, grandeur and over-all showbiz display that could blow your mind! I was watching the ceremony via satellite feed from beginning to end. I was enthralled, transfixed in my seat, that I had no time to go to the restroom. You must watch it also by DVD copy or any other means. You may inquire from other sources where you could buy a copy of the video.



Good luck to you.

If you've ever trained gymnastics your realise how hot it gets. believe me if I was a man I'd have my shirt off. Shirts and tshirts also get in the way and can snag on the equipment.

Me, I think she was using anabolic steroids her whole career and knew what she was doing. Oprah did not ask a number of questions I would had asked.



Looked at the message board on espn.com on this story, they're rather brutal. Kind of lose sight of the fact silver medalist Thanou probably was also a doper and that Jones won by over .3 seconds in the 100 m.

All right a little insight on the life of Marion Jones from my perspective. Marion arrived at my high school in 1994 (Thousand Oaks High School, California) a transfer from Rio Mesa in Oxnard a few minutes north. From the moment that girl hit the basketball court or the track, you could tell she was something amazing. I mean, she dominated the court, literally slam dunking on other girls, beating our MEN'S team on the track, needless to say she was a stud. But what wasn't so great was her attitude, and the attitudes of others around her mainly her mother. This girl had the proverbial stick so far up her you know what, it was never coming out. She wouldn't talk to anybody, wouldn't hang out with the team or other athletes, basically thought she was too good for everyone else. So when the district sent letters out to ever athlete in our school system (including myself) saying we had to take drug tests, it was no surprise that Marion and her mom hired no other that Johnny Cochran to defend her. Now why would she need him??? Since she had left her previous school there had been rumors circulating that this girl was on roids, and the fact that she had to hire a an ace like johnny, only added fuel to the fire.



So basically, nobody should feel sorry for this girl, she's been eating from a silver spoon, and using these drugs since she began, she just finally got caught. Your ego can only deny the truth for so long, just look at another one of her attorneys clients, lol (O.J.) At least she got her moment in the sun, some people never get that much.

<asker's comment>



Don't know if you're for real, but info on the web is consistent with what you said. Seems Marion Jones' been a cheat her whole career. Here I thought  drug use started with CJ Hunter. So Oprah is a worse interviewer  and Jones is far bigger  liar than I thought. Hope Jones got well paid. Thanks

Yes, she was using drugs.
She only admitted it to try to stay out of jail when she knew they were going to indict her for perjury.
Her coach is now serving house arrest, her former partner is doing 6 years and has another 4 after that.
Tests are getting better and they are saving the samples so when better tests are invented they can go back and catch the cheaters.
Maybe the athletes will realize that they will be caught and ruined if they cheat.

I can also not shave my legs every week and no one notices because I'm wearing leggings



Christmas!  I get presents for doing absolutely nothing, kinda like birthdays, only there's more cookies and decorations everywhere
Making obscene snowmen and destroying them, I can't do that any other time of the year
Looking at ice sculptures- those things are cool and u can drink them after they melt
New Year's eve partying!! It's the best party of the year, for the pure fact that everyone gets drunk, makes out and Clutch will be playing Michigan so It's going to rock better than ever!

SNOW!!!! Making snowmen, watching my dog eat the snow and peeing in it. Lol. Throwing snowballs, going ice skating, going sledding, bundling up (I just like my leather gloves). Hot Chocolate!!!!, And it taste so much better by the fireplace wrapped in a warm blanket. I love decorating the house with wintery stuff. Thanksgiving. Christmas of course. Also the christmas lights and decorations in everyone else's yard. Food, I don't now why but we always have hearty stuff when it's cold like stew and chili. It's awesome. Let's see, Oh, I love ringing in the New Years. I like being with my extended family (they come over during the holidays). There you have it. I'm like the only one in my house who likes the winter, but who cares. I like winter cause so many good things happen between october and march (I think it is). It's just a wonderful time of the year!

How can I get over my back handspring fear?



I have wanted to do a back flick/handspring for ages, and I reckon I could do it, I'm just too scared to jump! I don't have a trampoline or a spotter, and I have tried on the cushions from the sofa, but they are too squishy so flip over. After a while of doing it, I can jump back on them though, I just collapse. I have a mat that is 6ft long, and I'm still too scared to jump back on that! Help please! X

Have you tried practicing your back bends and your your handstands? that will help you a lot with doing a back handspring. That is too bad that you don't have a spotter because you have a high risk of being injured. try to convince a friend that is strong to be your spotter.



Practice your handstand till you have some balance. then you back bend, after that you have to practice walkovers. Once you learned how to do all of that it should be more easier to do a back handspring.



Before you attempt any flips you should get yourself a a confident state of mind. if you don't have confidence in yourself then you won't be able to do it. find something that will help you get into your zone. for example music helps me. then when you have enough confidence then try it with something that can break your fall just in case.

Learned how to do it without no spotter! learned it the same way you are learning. What helps is what i wrote and do some exerise and over time it will become less scary. be careful though if you can't do it then don't do it. because you can hurt yourself. trust me jumping up and landing on your back can hurt for hours.

Thank you! I'm also practicing back walkovres on my left leg, and back limbers, because my right leg always leaves the ground before my left leg. If my left leg went at the same time as my right, then I would be doing it! :D x

Its never to late to start.
But if you would like to you need to start talking with your parents.
It takes a lot of hard work not only on your part but on the part of your parents.
I look forward to hearing great things about you.
Good luck!!! :D
