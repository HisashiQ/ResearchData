you should have reported her behavior to her superior.  she was totally unprofessional.  she could have apologized for making you wait, and offered you a drink for your trouble.  she could have asked you if you needed help and gotten someone to help you unload if a diplomat was that soon to be due.  i think you just got someone who was having a rough day, and had no clue on how to deal with it, so she snapped at you.  i am an american, who lives in hawaii, and not all of us are so rude.  i would say that the majority in hawaii are nice.  that would be like saying all koreans stink and are angry, all hawaiians are fat and lazy, all samoans are big and dumb, all haoles (white people) are greedy, all french are rude, etc.  it is not so easy to make a generalized statement to encompass everyone of one country because of the ill actions of one member.  i'm sorry you had a bad experience with her.  but next time, report her on the spot, or go to your boss, let them know what happened, and they can go to bat for you.  good luck next time.

Rude arrogant people are everywhere. Next time you deliver there be as slow and unco-operative as you can. While you're at it you may as well pee and dump all over the pallet. Then get three or four of your mates to do it so that they get a pallet of steaming crap and pee.

Probably because the Americans are scared that you will take time unloading  to photograph the facility!
Americans do mucho bla bla bla! This is why they hide behind their technological advantages that was originally researched and developed by foreign students like Chinese, Indian, Europeans etc...in the US.
Don't take them serious. The person who was mean to you was just jealous. You have a better job and probably are getting paid in pound or Euros.

Hi,
There is something with the Americans. I went to a American embassy in Asia, i needed some help with a business matter that only the Americans could help me with. I rang an made an appointment with the Vice council and booked a meeting. We meet through a glass panel in the public area (how was i supposed to talk about corruption with lots of locals standing next to me) anyhow i managed to get the issue across (he was very uninterested) but he would not take the business proposal i had made, he did however take down my name, phone number and email on a POST IT i might add, and said that someone would be in contact in a couple of days,,, well it's been 5 weeks now.......
Oh by the way i am an Australian.......thanks US my business is still on hold..

Fill the form at www.passport.gov.in and submit the it at your nearest passport office. You will have to take the thumb impressions of the baby wherever signatures are required. You and your wife need to sign the Annexure H avaialable on the passport website (as mentioned above). Attach the birth certificate, your passport and your wife's passport. These are the formalities to be done for normal passport which will take about 1-2 months.

For tatkal you will have to provide some NOCs which you can find at the passport website.

I did the same for my baby last week.

Hello Dear,
Volunteer work would be permitted as long as you received nothing, absolutely nothing, in exchange. That means no lodging, meals, uniforms, ice cream treats, nothing in return.

Your volunteer work could not involve productive work. You cannot volunteer to sweep the floor in your aunt's store, or work the cash register, for example.

You could enter to participate in a voluntary service program benefiting U.S. local communities, if you establish that you are a member of and have a commitment to a particular recognized religious or nonprofit charitable organization and that no salary or remuneration will be paid from a U.S. source, other than an allowance or other reimbursement for expenses incidental to the volunteer's stay in the United States.

Voluntary Work
Individuals participating in a voluntary service program which benefits a U.S. local community, who establish that they are a member of, and have a commitment to, a particular recognized religious or nonprofit charitable organization, may be eligible for a B-1 visa or visa free travel under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) if the work to be formed is traditionally done by volunteer charity workers; they will receive no salary or remuneration from a U.S. source, other than an allowance or other reimbursement for expenses incidental to their stay in the United State; and they will not engage in the selling of articles and/or the solicitation and acceptance of donations.
A voluntary service program is an organized project conducted by a recognized religious or nonprofit charitable organization to provide assistance to the poor or the needy, or to further a religious or charitable cause.
If your proposed activities as a voluntary worker are not exactly as described, you will require either an exchange visitor (J-1) or temporary worker (H-2B) visa.
Please Note: When applying for entry into the United States as a voluntary worker with a visa or under the VWP, you should furnish a letter from your U.S. sponsor which contains the following information:
•	Your name and date and place of birth; 
•	Your foreign permanent residence address; 
•	The name and address of initial destination in the U.S.; and 
•	The anticipated duration of your assignment.

I actually went on a People to People trip when I was in high school, to Europe.  It is not a scam, it does cost a significant amount of money, but that's because things like international airfare and hotel rooms are expensive!  The organization People to People is a non-profit and doesn't make money off of you. That being said, if you have the money to go, or are willing to work for it, it is really fun!

To answer your specific questions: a lot of people receive the letter.  You do have to have an interview to actually be selected for the program, but I'm pretty sure it's not very selective.

If you want to go somewhere else, it is possible.  The way it works is a group of kids from your geographical area will be going to Japan this summer, but if you want you can go with a group from another area that is going somewhere else.  You can read about all the places People to People goes, and chose the one you want to go on.  Or, you can wait until next year, when the group from your area will be going somewhere else.

Good Luck!

Dear Sarah,



Where they actually send a group differs from year to year. This is a scam, honey. My son and I went to one of their meetings a few years ago. When they say that financial aid is possible...it means that they will give you kits on how to run car washes, etc. to raise the money for your trip. Absolutely all the expenses will be on you--and where you stay, who you get to see, are all decided for you . There was one mother whose eyes were so glazed it was scary who told us it would be more important for your child's future than college so go ahead and break into whatever college money you've managed to scrape up and give it to them.



If they can get enough money raised, the "shepherds" who go with you have their expenses paid.If the woman who spoke could get enough kids to sign up with her, she and her daughter would get a free trip as well. In case something happens and you need medical care, you can take out an insurance policy for the trip.



I read the pamphlets, and watching these people welcoming "candidates' has a Stepford Wives quality as they quoted the information we'd been given and never answered anything that wasn't covered by the folder and pamphlets we were given.



You would not have been contacted if you didn't have a pretty solid GPA, so at least that part of their spiel was true. You are very wise to ask questions and I'm proud of you for checking things out.



Source(s):



My source is having actually having a child who was invited by this organization to be an "ambassador". We went to one of their group meetings and listened to them evade or ignore questions they didn't want to answer. That's how I know about the "financial aid" they claim to offer is giving them ideas to get the people in your town to pay for the trip so that you won't have to pump in as much cash. As I recall, back in 2004 you needed to raise $1500 to secure a place on the roster. Not all meals would be provided so you needed to send money for food, out of pocket expenses, and the medical insurance. It would have cost us more than a year in college financially and I was very relieved my son saw through them.

Sure.  There will still be an Embassy functioning, but it will be led by a Charge rather than an Ambassador.  The State Department hasn't forbidden US citizens to travel there.

What happens if you have overstayed but was under 18?



I went to America when I was about 3 years old and stay there until I was 18. Right after my 18th birthday, I was getting ready to get my drivers license when my father told me that I wasn't allowed to like he promised. I asked why, but never got a straight answer. I figured out why eventually and went back to my home country Japan and have been living here ever since (2 years) I was fortunately able to visit California on a tourist visa, but was wondering if its possible to become a citizen through naturalization someday after going back and applying for a working visa somehow and living there for the required 5 years. Will they still tell me no since I overstayed? Even though I was completely unaware that I was overstaying and also that I was underage??

You will be treated like a new entrant with a tourist visa since you were able to leave undetected after overstaying.

Wow, not too many illegal aliens from Japan!  Which is why Japan is on the Visa Waiver Program, of course.  I'm surprised you had to apply for a tourist visa to visit California (this might be a result of your years in illegal status?).

Yes, it will be possible for you to naturalize someday;  your years of overstay will LIKELY not affect that (as I don't have all the details of your story, hard to know for sure).  However, if I were the consular officer in your case, or an immigration officer at a port of entry, and you were applying for any visa or entrance that falls under 214b purview (i.e. are you an intending immigrant or not?  Do you have ties to your home country or not?) I would deny your visa, the reason being that you are indeed an intending immigrant.  U.S. culture is all you know.

I say this not to scare or discourage you -- this is simply the law and there are other ways to legally do what you want to do.  So, to answer your question, your overstay likely won't affect naturalization, but may indeed affect short term stays.



Hope this helps.

You cannot get a 12 month passport any more. You are thinking of the old British Visitors Passport which could be bought cheaply from the Post Office. These were discontinued over 20 years ago.



The only passport available these days is the standard full price one one. 10 years for adults, 5 years for children. You can get the application forms from most Post Offices and they take up to 2 months to process.

It is not too late.  You would have to get your father's birth certificate and/or passport and go to the French embassy.  It would be best if your father accompanied you.  However, if he gave up his French citizenship already, you can't apply for it.  You should try and find the nearest ambassador/consulate and try to set up an appointment with them.

Given the fact that you are a US citizen since you were born and raised here and assuming that your father is now a US citizen you could not obtain French citizenship unless you are willing to renounce your US citizenship and immigrate to France.
