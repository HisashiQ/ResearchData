well eventually all people will blow their nose when excess snot dribbles out. and then the snot goes into the tissue which goes into the garbage which goes to the landfill to decompose. this process happens many times in every bodies life!! lol :)

Birthday party ideas?



I'm going to be 15 next month and I love doing exciting and different things.

For my birthday i would like to do something really fun, for example last year i got audience tickets to see Cirque De Celebrite and the year before I went on a cbbc tour =P

Ok so it's for me and 4 of my friends, it needs to be either south-east or london (Preferably south east) and not too expensive (Say £40-£50)

Whats the name of this.....?



When I was younger (about 20 years ago!) there were these little pots of liquid plastic in clear bottles that you could use to decorate t-shirts/fabric. If I remember rightly, you could also use them on plastic, mirror and glass. They came in a whole range of colours and the bottles were about the size of nail varnish bottles but made of plastic not glass. You turned the bottles upside down and squeezed slightly and the thick liquid would come out through a hole in the top. You could draw or write with them. After a few hours, the liquid would set and you could wash the t-shirt and the design would stay. It gave a raised/3d effect. Can anyone remember the brand name/make of what I'm talking about? Thank you!

ask him why the hell he's giving your number out to his exes! and making them come after you! pig!

and tell her straight, to get over herself, leave you alone and that he doesnt like her anymore and thats not your fault cause he's had 4 months to ask her back out and has he? No.

This guy you have been talking to for about 4 months is using you to make his ex-girlfriend jealous.  What a creep and I probably would stop talking to him.  He does not care about you and that is obvious.

In terms of the ex-girlfriend, I would tell her to back off.  And, if this guy likes her so much more than you, why is he not going after her vs. you.



You know what I think...this guy has a third girlfriend and he is using you and his ex-girlfriend to diffuse the situation.  Could it be he might even have a 4th girlfriend?  That would not surprise me either...

Good luck and I hope you find a new guy that truly respects you.



I feel like I just reiterated the plot of a movie that came out about 3 years ago...

The show is fine, your mom just doesn't approve of Miley Cyrus.

Have you seen the stuff in the news about Miley? She has tons of half-naked photos all over the internet. She looks like she's 40-yrs old and she she's got the raspy voice of a chronic smoker. She's a bad role model.

You have to listen to your mom.

Um... Hannah Montana has nothing objectional on it.  Ask your mom to watch the show and tell you what is wrong with it.  I think it is probably one of the cleanest shows on tv today. Anyway, she won't let you watch that but she will let you on here?  This is sooooo much worse that Hannah Montana.  I wouldn't let my 13 year old on here.

I'm sure everyone else your age is watching it, but you have to remember that not everything on t.v is true. You mom might be worried that you wish you had all the things that Hanna Montana has, such as money, fame, friends, so many material possessions, and when you start complaining to her, she will be sad. She will feel that she is not a good mother to you. Do you want your mom to feel that way? Of course, this is only if you insist that you want everything that she has, and if you will not do this and do everything else that your mom says, then it is fine to watch.

I do not have kids, have never watched that show, but from what I see on the news I would hope my daughter would not even want to watch it.  I think girls your age should look 13 not 47. And there is a lot better music out there than Disney.  Just a 30 year old ladies opinion.

You shouldn't watch it, Miley Cyrus is a whor* and a sl*t. She obviously doesn't want you to watch someone like her. A lot of girls idolize her
And yes 13 is still young in a way.

You can find a mirror ball at your local Music equipment store.  Somewhere that sells DJ equipment also.  I work as a DJ and I bought my mirror ball at a local music equipment shop.  Good Luck finding one!

Takarazuka Revue Video?



I happened upon a few clips from a Takarazuka Revue performance on youtube, loved the voices, and looked it up on-line. After reading about it on wikipedia, I moved onto a fansite. It provided me with a decent amount of information, but the site hasn't been updated in 2002, so it could be out-of-date.



Does anyone know if any of the Takarazuka Revue shows have been subbed? And even if the answer is no, does anyone know where I could watch them? I believe in supporting the actresses by buying official merchandise, but before I spend a bunch of money importing stuff, I'd like to see at least one show video first. Suggestions?



Thank you~

Loud Neighbor- Please help?



I have an upstairs neighbor who is loud all day and night.  I work a full time job and would be lucky to get 5 hours of sleep at night.  I rent, and have called the Landlord.  The Landlord keeps telling us she can't do anything because of the wife's medical condition (she is on life support.)  I have also tried talking to the neighbors but they don't care either.  He keeps using his wife's medical condition as the reason he paces around all night long.  I have even tried calling he local police and they said they can't do anything.  I wear ear plugs every night and can still here the footsteps and or loud banging.  Any other suggestions of what I can do?

You can ask your landlord if you can move to a different apartment.  You can take sleeping pills.  or you can just stuff your face into a pillow

I have been on a waiting list for 3 years for a different apartment there.  I don't think they are in any rush to move us out and keep making exscuses.  Maybe they are aware that the neighbors are loud and figure that we work full time jobs and won't suffer that much.

Anyone can view them, which is where the danger comes in --- or... just don't put anything up there that would be considered "questionable" in terms of content.  Colleges and future employers look at the pages, yes, and even though they are private - there is no telling what type of connections they have to people who know you and how they might still get their hands on your personal information.



Bottom line - don't put anything online that you wouldn't want someone to know about you or find out about you.  There is no such thing as true privacy online.

Where is the Haunted House in Washington state that you get your money back if you make it to the 3rd floor?



I heard that there is a Haunted House some where in Washington state - more exactly the S. Puget Sound area: Tacoma, etc.  This haunted house is supposed to be around $20 admission and is so scary that if you make it to the 3rd floor you get your money back.



I have heard of similar ones in other states, but this is a first for WA and I am interested in checking it out - I mean if they give you your money back then I am sure you get your pants scared off!!
