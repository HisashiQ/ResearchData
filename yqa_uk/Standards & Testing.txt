I've only managed to do it with tests where I chunk a whole lot of info and try to link things together. It's not a good way to store it in your long term memory.

It gets harder and harder as you get older and take harder classes, but in my junior year (high school), I managed to pull this off on all three of my AP exams, and got 5's on all of them. Actually, for the first one (Biology), I technically did it all ON the day of the exam, since I fell asleep in the afternoon, got up a bit after midnight, and began cramming like mad... Apparently, sometimes you just get lucky, I guess. :P And Lord knows I don't have any photographic memory. My friends can attest to that - my memorization skills are actually a bit below the average. My grades in those AP classes weren't great either, like mostly B's with a few A-'s at best. So I really have no idea how I did it; I'm really not all that smart. The human brain just fascinates me to no end. Isn't it funny how little we understand ourselves? lol

Yes...it's more like the morning of the test .
I actually crammed an entire world history book the night before, and aced the test with a 5 on my AP exam.



usually it's the english / reading stuff that works, but math and physics-wise, I've found that it doesn't work - because you've really got to comprehend the material. biology / chemistry - there's partial recall after cramming, but usually I have maybe about 50% of the material down.



the funny thing is that all that material poofs after a few days or so, especially if I sleep right after I study. my brain has to process it for a little while first before I sleep...



eidetic memory is amazing! personally I can't memorize the contents of a chart but I can remember the picture and where everything is, and recall that way. fascinating, isn't it? :)

I could do it as a young person but as one gets older they still have it stored but it usually can't be pulled up at a certain time.
When I was in the military I did it all the time. I aced almost every test I took. The ones I didn't were close to it. As I said, though,  the subject may remain but a complete synopsis can't be laid out at a moments notice , the older the information lays dormant in your mind.

try illustrating stuff that you need to revise. some people understand better if they "see" it. stick pictures around ur bedroom insteas of... words.



create a revision timetable, be strict with yourself: revise first, then go on the computer.

Well, I understand how frustrating studying can be, I'm now a 2nd year undergraduate doing BSc Mathematics and Comp Sci and it took me a lot of work to get this far.



These are the things I did to help me revise:



1: Get Organised



Lots of time is wasted when you cant find the one page of questions/answers to practise on so get some pocket folders with some dividers for each subject.



As for day plans you gotta be realistic about this, plan an hour or 2 a day doing some practise questions in your subjects. A good time to do so is during your lunchtime, an hour after school with the teacher (if he/she wants to) or perhaps in a local library. Key idea is to find a quiet spot with decent amount of space for your books and notes.



Worried to be made fun out of by your friends? Well to be honest they should respect you because put it this way they are not gonna get you the A grade in exams YOU ARE! As part of revenge watch them quibble in exam halls as you glide through the papers like I did on my A level maths paper with 74/75 *did a silly mistake on the one question lol* :D



And you dont wanna just revise, revise revise 24/7 every now and again you can have some fun like few hours playing a game or join your m8s to do things but dont make them take over too much of your time its all about moderation a happy + disciplined mind is a focused mind too.



2. Get the Revision Material



OK, now you got the basic idea how to sort yourself out, next stage is to grab the materials. Ask your teacher for a recommended book, grab past papers off him/her try and get at least 5 years worth of exam papers it may seem like a lot of work but once you did the first 2 years worth the next 3 should be a breeze especially in GCSE. The final tools then is a cheap notepad, a revise textbook (Letts brand) are normally good for GCSE/A Levels and my technique, postcards.



Why postcards? These are perfect to serve as your reminders of formulas and basic definitions on subjects like Maths and Sciences. Make a well organised plot of formulas that are likely to be on the exam and take the card in your pocket and every now and again look at the card when you're board such as a bus journey, a dull classroom or a TV advert to keep refreshing your mind.



OK, and finally begin the revision, I'm glad to hear that you have decided to begin revising months before exam. Knowing by fact that you will have a head start than your classm8s will give you plenty of time to have one-to-one questions with your teacher until the last 2 weeks comes up where every1 panic revise.



Firstly you read through the text book and note anything useful (not every single word and picture) onto the notepad and then finalise which formulas you should study and jot onto postcard.



Then, with basic theory in your head, practise on your first past paper. If you are stuck on a question look at the answer on the back try to understand why that's the answer and write it down and move on (by writing the answer on the paper you may notice by reading it gives you a message in your brain what to write down which should be a hint to remember). Obviously you must try to work out without looking up the answer, if there is an answer you do not understand, an error or whatever speak to your teacher to verify.



Once you did the first paper (eg Paper 1/5) do paper 2 then 3,4,5 then 1 again and continue. As you progress you should no longer need tolook upp the answers because the papers begin to repeat questions but with different values.



Try and avoid revising at home, use the school or local libraries where you are very likely to concentrate. Last thing you want is a relative/friend to keep bothering you every 5 mins.



OKthat's enough typing now hope this guide gets you somewhere, just stick to the plan and you'll do great.

I think a lot of the advice on this page is really useful... so its difficult to add more.



I just wanted to add, that not all revision techniques necessarily suit you: different people learn best in different ways. If you want more ideas and more specific advice, you could try asking teachers what they think is best for you (sorry if you have already). They might know you and see more clearly how you seem to work, so they could help a lot.



Also, there are many websites that can help offer suggestions. An entertaining example is  http://www.cgpbooks.co.uk/online_rev/exm... (really amusing!), but you can search for more techniques just generally on the internet.



Good luck with the revision!



p.s. reading the lengthy (:p) answer above, I think there is some really useful information there, but something to remember is to tailor the revision to you. Be realistic. Don't - whatever you do - think that planning to work for 5 hours straight is going to help. If you think that you're not great at concentrating (which, let's face it, many people aren't), then try to have regular breaks (without getting distracted and having a 5 hour break!!).



I really hope you find something that suits you!

Why do I suck so bad at tests?



I just turned 17 years old and dropped out of school last year in the 9th grade because of social anxiety. I soon plan on taking GED classes to get my GED.



I have a problem academically though! I SUCK so bad on tests and assignments. I have NEVER been good with tests especially. I can read, write, and spell pretty good. I have some problems with reading like comprehension. I can read words good though and probably have a 9th grade reading level or more.



Well, I was taking some practice GED tests and I passed a few. But one about poems I failed MISERABLY!  Sometimes when I was reading the questions, I wasnt sure on an answer so I would check the answer and everytime I got it wrong I would get mad. I wouldnt cheat on the practice test though, I would just bubble in the answer I was first going to choose in the first place.



Is there a way I can overcome this so I will be able to get my GED? Sometimes I notice if I read the question over and over for maybe 2 or 3 minutes, i'll finally understand it and then i'll usually see the answer right in front of my eyes. Sometimes its how I read things that messes me up and then after reading it 10 times, i'll finally see that I read a word wrong or something. It can be the most SIMPLEST WORD or sentence!



Should I start reading more? Will this improve my comprehension maybe and will I be able to read things better? I notice that if I read out loud, its like reading a bunch of words out loud. If I read to myself I can usually comprehend better.



</question>



<additional details>



Like in school, my grades were always D's or F's. It was partially because I used to get bullied and teased and I have extreme anxiety and couldnt concentrate. Other times it was because I didnt understand something and I was afraid to ask the teacher.



I remember very little of passing a test in school. I mean I have passed a few, mostly spelling tests BUT no big math test or language arts test. I suck so bad at math!

An IQ of 126 means you're quite a bit smarter than average- the average IQ is set at 100.

What is a School-Leaving Exam and what is its equivalent in the Philippine education system?



I am applying for a postgraduate scholarship to a German school and in its online application form, it asks to identify a School Leaving Exam Name and Grade. I have researched about it and found that some countries like Singapore implement this but I don't know what is the direct equivalent of this in our education system in Manila. Please advise! Thanks!

No.



In AIPMT there r two stages, preliminary and mains. U've to be fine in



both objectives and subjectives. And No.of seats are somewhere around 2000. No. of candidates appearing are around 3 to 4 lacs.



In AIIMS, there is one and only test, objective. And the level is a bit high. No of seats are about 50 but No. of candidates appearing are abt



50,000.



So its upto personal skills dat hw you feel.

It completely depends on which state you live in. Driving laws go state to state. The test in michigan took me probably 35-40 minutes, very easy if you have any common sense.

In the UK (which is where it sounds like you're from) it varies from person to person- as I'm sure it does anywhere. It's a good idea to have some idea of the Highway Code, although memorising it would be a nightmare.



I did driving lessons for over a year and never passed my test because of nerves, but some people get lots of practice in with their parents and pass in about four months. It all depends on your attitude, and of course how long you have to wait for your theory and practical tests.



Good luck!

Personally I would not discuss anything about the exam. I have done that before and found it distracting. Another thing is that when it came exam time I kept wondering if my answer was right or my friends. For some stupid reason I chose what my friend said and it was wrong. After that I told myself I would never do that again, I started just going in sitting down at my desk and blocking out everything around. I did allot better when I started doing that, then if I got one wrong it was my answer that was wrong not someone else and I did not hate myself as much.

What I did over the summer I took an SAT preparatory class where I get tutored and u shud try that because u get practice in all the areas pinpointed in the SAT and the more u practice it the more u become comfortable with the content and the format of the test. also try the website www.collegeboard.com if u have not already. they are the ones u make teh SAT or u can try buying an SAT study booklet from an educational store

I was in Oregon for my Junior year  so I didn't get that first chance to take it. I'm scared because I don't know anything about it and i'm afraid of not passing and not being able to graduate...I've heard some people had to study for it? I just got notice yesterday that I have to take it today. What's on it? Is it hard to pass? If I were to fail would I have time later on in the senior yr to take it?

Its free overall no matter state nor city, The process is based on you strictly, reason being is that you will take an assessment test to start out...then you will have to attend classes on ground or online and you will have test for every unit you complete, reason it is on you is because most people pacrasinate and take their time, It is possible to get it quick you just have to be motivated and ITS ALL FREE.



If you are looking for destination to attend it could be one of the technical colleges in your city or state, or ask an area high school where you should go......good luck

What is a School-Leaving Exam and what is its equivalent in the Philippine education system?



I am applying for a postgraduate scholarship to a German school and in its online application form, it asks to identify a School Leaving Exam Name and Grade. I have researched about it and found that some countries like Singapore implement this but I don't know what is the direct equivalent of this in our education system in Manila. Please advise! Thanks!

High School Placement Test! Study!?



Hey, I am in 7th grade and I will be taking the High School Placement Test next year. I want to start studying! I am an intelligent kid, who has scored all 99 Percentiles on the IOWA test, and never gotten worse than an A- in my life. I want to go to this AWESOME high school called University of Detroit Jesuit. I will have no problem getting in, but money is a problem. My family is just in the middle of the income base. We have to much to get financial aid, and it would be really hard to pay the full tuition. But U of D Jesuit says, that if I can score over a 96 percentile on the High School Placement Test, they will give me $2,000 of tuition every year for all 4 years. That would leave me to only pay about $7,000 a year (Which we could probably afford). So, my question is....How can you study for the High School Placement test.



Like, What kind of math is in it?



And, just, any other things you know that could help me study, PLEASE tell me!

When studying?



?



When studying for a math exam how important is it to focus on the things that you understand? And how much time do you think you should spend on it?



I am just really scared to not learn every single detail in case I miss something or just don't understand perfectly. I understand the work but I feel like I should do every single sum but I don't want to do every single sum.



Advice?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



math is all about learning the principles. once you understand the process of how to solve a problem, every problem is essentially the same. you already know how to add, so dont dwell on that. make sure you understand the theories of the subject or section.

well depending on the class and space between you and another classmate, use your hair to cover your eyes from the teacher
write down on a small piece of paper, and hide it somewhere the teacher wont find it
put notes in your ipod and listen to it if they allow you
the easiest is simply covering your eyes from the teacher and keep your head facing you own test but move your eyes
or if the person wants to help you have them write the answers on a sheet of paper, when they are done throw it away, then u stand up to "blow your nose" and pick it up
modify if needed

I agree phone the college and ask which address they got posted to. With the postal service being a useless as it is they no longer guarantee next day delivery so you may just have to wait. But if you are eager to find out the results ask for them when you phone the college.

If a test maker takes questions out of a test bank and makes modifications, is it subject to copyright?



A test maker in India is taking questions from a copyrighted text book containing test questions and he publishes the questions as his own with commercial intent. Does this constitute a copyright infringement in the following scenarios:
1. If we copies the question verbatim and publishes it ? 
2. If he makes minor modifications to the question and then publishes it ? Like assume the question talks of two characters Mark and Spencer. He changes this to Richard and Carl in his question



3. If the language of the question is changed but the figures and calculations in the question remain the same. E.g. 
original question
what is the probability of getting a red ball in a box of 10 red balls, 5 blue balls and 3 green balls



is changed to 
modified question 
a farm has 10 hens, 5 pigs and 3 buffaloes. What is the probability of picking a hen at random from the farm ?

Contact the vocational school in the school district. They will give you a pre-test to see if there are any subjects that you will need help with. If so, you take the classes then another pre-test for that subject. Once you've passed each subject in the pre-test, you go take the actual GED test.

ACT vs. SAT which is easier?



I know it can depend on the person as well, but I wanted to know as a whole which test is "easier"

You'll probably get a lot of questions that say the same thing, but here goes:

If you have a greater aptitude in science or math, take the ACT. People argue that it's easier because it takes less time and seems less stressful to test takers.



Take the SAT if you are strong in English. This is pretty much the traditional test to take, and the format is pretty easy to understand.

However, if the only thing you're interested in is which test is 'easier', and you don't wish to hear me rant on about how yes, it does depend on the person and it doesn't matter which test is easier, I can bypass all that and give the Reader's Digest version: The SAT is the easier test.

I do have to toss in here, at the bottom of the screen, that if you are asking for reference of your own standarized test taking endeavors, that the really smart thing to do is take both. Seriously. Although most colleges don't even require SAT or ACT scores anymore, they encourage them and they do help you get into a good college. If you take both, you can show institutions that you have a wide range of academic talents and interests, and are serious about impressing them and about furthering your education. Good luck!

I've heard the SAT is harder, but I've never actually taken it.

ACT was pretty easy, though.



If you're better at math and science, take the SAT.

If you're better at English and social studies, take the ACT.

most people think the act is easier. i didn't, however. the sat is more test-taking and they do throw tricks at you. you have to know how to take the sat (lots of practice) vs. just the information. the act is more straightforward. if you know your stuff, you should be ok. this is what i've heard. however, i kind of differ. i'm a very good student in school and i got a 30 on the act, whereas i got a 2330 on the sat, which is a big difference. just try practice tests for both to see which you like. you should probably take the sat at least once, anyways, even if you like the act better.

I've already done 2 of mine, just make sure that you relax for about 10 minutes before your talk....breathe deeply and just try to relax your brain whilst going over what you're going to say
yes, just relax...you'll do fine

I'm not even English and was really traumatised by the thought of doing it...and then magically got a B and an A for the ones I've done, so use the fact that it's your mother tongue as a comfort

dont worry this is the easiest part of the exam and most people get c without doing too much. all ill advise you to do is stay calm, try no to think too hard. look at one of your friends in the audience and talk to them which makes it easier.

You just have to remember that everyone has to do it, and they will all be just as nervous as you. Take deep breaths, keep yourself calm. Don't let everyone else go before you. It will just make you feel even worse.

How can I get my GED? (details inside)?



I'm 16 turning 17 in two months. I dropped out of school last fall, a month after it started. I was in 9th grade. I want to know how to get a GED.

The only place that offers GED classes is this vocational school in the school district. I heard that you have to take a pre-test to see if you need the classes. Then someone else tells me you take the pre-test before you take the GED to see if your able to pass it. So do I contact the testing center first? Or can I just contact the vocational school and go there to sign up for classes? I'm not even sure what I would need help in myself. Can someone help me!?

Someone needs to take a signed letter from yourself down to the school along with ID and collect them - you need to ring the school to explain that you can't get them and name the person who will be collecting them.
Or you can ring the school and request that they are posted to your house - you should've done this before really so that you had them delivered today.
Good luck.
