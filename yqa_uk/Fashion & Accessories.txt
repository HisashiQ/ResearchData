Hey there



Speaking of footwear.  I just came across this site that is giving away FREE designer Flip Flops. I got a pair of these last week and they are so comfortable.  Go get a pair while their supply lasts.  Even if you don’t want them, they’d make a great gift for your mom, wife, or girlfriend.  You can get yours at http://pho.se/56l

I wouldn't buy them for that eBay link.
Why pay $300 when they're worth $120 or $130?



As you probably know, they don't sell the colored uggs anymore.
But if you search in some stores they still carry them.
I saw pink Uggs in one store.
So look around!

Please help me with accessorising this dress. Pictures included.?



I'm going out to a formal event and I want to wear a vintage dress with a modern twist, but I'm not sure how to accessorise it, so I need some help!



This is the dress. I'll be shortening it so it'll be above the knees, so please try to picture it that way! And just so you know, the shoulders are see through:
http://i34.tinypic.com/20pvii8.jpg



Once modified, should I wear it:
a) with no stockings
b) with these stockings: http://flickr.com/photos/8545733@N05/286...
c) with sheer black stockings
d) other?



Should I wear it as it is, or throw on



a) a black cinch belt like this one:
http://i34.tinypic.com/xdi9s0.jpg
b) other?



I definitely want oxford peep toe pumps, but what colour should I get?
a) white like these:
http://i38.tinypic.com/2dkkcax.jpg
b) the same as above but in black
c) the same as above but in black AND white?



I'm sort of going a for a black/white look, since I was inspired by Audrey Hepburn's white dress in My Fair Lady. (Looks like this:)
http://i34.tinypic.com/5zgy1t.jpg



If anyone can think of jewelry or hair accessories that match, please put in suggestions. Pictures would be so helpful, and I'd love it if you could give me your opinions on which shoes to wear with which hosiery. I want to look like I just stepped off the runway. Thanks so much!

well, the only thing i ever got from there was crap, and their customer service was down-right rude, so i will never be shoping there again.



they had this ring on-line, it was silver plated, just a basic plain band, and it was really pretty ($150) so my fiance got it for me for christmas.  i put it on as soon as i opened it, and by dinner that night my finger started turning green.  i wasnt happy, but i know everyone reacts differently so i was going to deal with it and just put some clear nail polish on it the next day.  well, i fell asleep with it on, and by the next morning it had rusted around the entire inside, and where it was touching my other 2 fingers!!  i brought it back to the store that day and the woman who was "helping" me had the nerve to tell me it was "supposed to do that" since it was only plated.  her exact words.  so i asked her to refund my fiance's credit card, which she rolled her eyes at.



so my fiance has lucked out and will never ever have to even look at that store again.

Tiffany jewelry is very high quality and worth the money.  Plus, if you do actually have a problem, they will fix or replace it.



Of course you are paying for the name, but it is worth it.

It depends on the tone of orange.
Bright?
Light?
Do you have a picture of it?
That'd help.



If it's bright, try to stick with neutral colors like, grays, blacks, whites, and browns with jeans, that way it doesn't look too clashing,

A lot of colours clash with orange, but it can be done! Black goes with anything, but it may scream out halloween if it's a bright orange. Grey would work if it's a light orange, and white also will go. I guess it depends on the shade of the scarf. I don't think pink, red, or yellow would go, as they are too similar, and green/aqua/bright blues would probably clash. Purple and brown will go nicely :D

Do you think Hanging up heavy sweaters would ruin them?



I hung up my Boyfriends Thick Heavy Sweater on a hanger and put it in the closet. A few days later he removed it and told me that by doing so i streched the neck of the sweater because it was too heavy to be put on a hanger...has anyone ever heard of such a thing before? I just want to know if anyone else would know that that could happen.

yes, putting heavy sweaters on hangers does stretch the neck.
if you fold them up they will be just fine.
after you wash it again, it may not be so stretched out anymore.

Yes!  Hanging sweaters will stretch the shoulders and leave hanger marks.  Heavy sweaters should be folded and put on a shelf or in a drawer.  Besides what are you trying to do, teach your boyfriend you're his maid?  He should be picking up after himself, not you doing it!

I know it can make those little indentations in the shoulders of sweaters. Also, if the sweater is bottom heavy, it could stretch the whole thing out causing holes to appear all through the sweater. I hang all my sweaters up but have been thinking of buying a large dresser so I don't have to deal with messy stretched sweaters any longer!

Absolutely. This is very true. Heavy sweaters should not be hung from hangers. They should be drooped over, like drooping them over the back of a chair until they dry. The reason, is because the fabric is so heavy when wet, it actually ruins the shape of the sweater due to the weight of the fabric stretching the garment against the hanger.



Next time, put it on a backrest of a chair.

Today's temperature is in the 60s-40s the weather says it will be "mostly cloudy". I have a lot of tops that are simple like a pink one that says "Sweet" in blue,a magenta top that says firing love surrounded with hearts,brown top with flowers around the neckline and a lot more. I have a lot of jeans(blue,black,white) and skirts. I love to accessorize. And I have a lot of sandals. Some sneakers and boots.

Generally African Americans can pull off things that white people can't, so go all out with a sweater vest. Otherwise, look around for polos and walking shorts. Also, keep an eye out for argyle print.

Why would you want to "act" like anything? Just be yourself, act what feels natural to you. Not evey single preppy person acts the same. It's a style, that people have turned into like a definition to describe people- generally popular people, just because they dress preppy/laid back- polos jeans tees sweaters etc.

look for polos and skirts, jean or pleated skirts, or walking shorts. And even sweater vests are good too. You have to act like you are the sh*t. And think you are better than everyone else. And spend a lot of money.

Take dress cues from the actor who played Carlton on the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.  Pull out the club ties, sweater vests, and loafers.  Just dress prep school all the way.  Also the fashions from newer shows like Gossip Girl on the CW show preppy styles that are in right now.

What would you do if you lost your high heels during a client meeting!?



Its not that simple, I went to a client meeting at a construction site in my pinstripe tailored suit, with matching pencil skirt, tan nylons and a pair of black peep toe patent leather Gucci stilettos. Unfortunately, the night before it rained a lot and when I reached the construction site there was no one there. I called my client and he told me they were already on the 7th floor and to make my way there. I noticed a small wooden gangplank leading from the sidewalk all the way across the incredibly muddy site to the cemented ground floor of the apartment block being built. Suffice it to say halfway across the rickety and narrow wooden beams, that were still wet from the showers the night before, I stumbled, and as I didn't want to fall face first into the mud, I moved my feet in front to try and stop myself from falling. Unfortunately, both my feet went straight in the mud and I sank to my knees in incredibly, horrifically cold sticky mud!! I screamed for help and luckily a few site workers rushed to help me. Here comes the worst part though… As soon as they pulled me out I immediately felt suction building against my feet and felt the cold mud pouring into my shoes! Yes, they were coming of me! I told them to stop pulling me, but they didn't listen and as a consequence out I came without my shoes!!! What would you do?

PLEASE READ:
ArrrG! What a disaster never mind the embarrassment that you must have experienced its the shoes that are more important! lolz.. no doubt they was really expensive and i feel for you- but there is nothing you can do really.. mud is a difficult thing to get out of clothes never mind shoes- so if you was to fish them out of the mud they wud be ruined- after all you can not put them in the washing machine (well i suppose you could try i guess). I think the best thing to do is to move on and compensate your loss with a brand new pair of gucci shoes.. this way you will forget all about your loss.. above all you should seriously think about suing the company after all construction site is really dangerous and you was lucky not to hurt yourself.. goodness knows what would happened if it was a old person or child.. Style should never be compromised so dont listen to others who tell you to bring sneakers (or has we in the uk call them trainers loz) just go careful next time!!

You could try E-bay for that classic "Smurfet" white shift dress.  BHS had some in for less than 20 pounds this summer, but, as we are now moving into winter stock, you may have difficulty finding one in the right size in the sales!
The first person had a good idea for you to browse the charity shops/boot sales in your area too.  People who buy white dresses often regret it afterwards if they are like me and a muck magnet.
Good luck in your search, have you got fab huge white shoes to go with it and the sexy hat? Lol.

jessica, you can alway buy a white pair and spraypaint them red but then they'd be too stiff.  That's stupid anyway.  Just Google, "where to buy red jeans" and that should help.  Good luck!!!

I think the problem is just that forever 21 is one of the most popular stores out there so its really hard to find unique stuff at a place everyone shops at. I love loads of there stuff there but sometimes the items  get a little too trendy too fast !

i shop there and i actually kind of like what they have this time, i mean its not the best line they have put out but its not their worst, i think last fall season was its worst...this time they have more things that highlight the waist instead of being really shapeless...the only bad point is that for many items the prints arent as bold and there are many black items.

What is the inside of a Ugg Cardy like?



I got bought a pair of Oatmeal Cardies.
The inside has fluffy sheepskin on the heal and innersole.
But the inner lining at the top of the foot isn't sheepskin but a fabric instead, Is that what they should be like?
Just wondering if these are genuine or not- everything else on them seems perfect though.



Thanks.



</question>



<additional details>



or should the entire inside be sheepskin?



THE FOOT PART!- i know the top is crocheted so isn't lined

The cardy is crochet, of course it isn't all lined with sheepskin.
It's supposed to be like that, don't worry.



I'm pretty sure only the sole is lined.

<question>



Does anyone want to buy an authentic Prada Fairies Bag?



One of Prada's newest designs, the Prada Fairy Bag has quickly become a hot item. Featuring an artistic drawing of fairies in black, plum, and earth tones, the bag has been spotted on the arms of several celebrities including Sienna Miller,Hillary Duff, Tilda Swiden, and Jennifer Love Hewitt, which may have contributed to it selling out at Neiman Marcus in just 2 days. Made of deerskin leather it's a very simple shape with top handles and measures 10 1/5" x 14 1/5" x 6".



Only a limited amount of these bags were made. There is a waitlist about a mile long for this bag and it is extremely difficult to get on to. This bag is hot, hot, hot right now!



This bag combines art, fashion, and top quality. It is unique. It is less about fashion and more about art. So for those who want to embrace and tote around art and design, this is the perfect bag. Rarely do you find such artistic work combined with a top quality designer bag. This bag is not like any other designer bag you own and will most likely be a collectible item. This bag is quite unique to say the least.



This bag is an unwanted present off an unwanted contact that will make someone very lucky to own one of the very few Prada Fairy Bags out there. A Dust cover is included with this bag along with a certificate of Authencity.



Leave your email address and i will post you pictures. Thanks

If so go for a patterned top with white in it. Two block colours ie white trousers and a plain top, look dull. Unless you've got some fab big jewellery to make it more interesting?

Some others would say Juicy Couture, Free People, C&C California, Hard Tail, etc.
While some people would only consider Chanel, Burberry, Calvin Klien, Diane von Furstenberg, Marc Jacobs, etc. to be designer

That would have to be custom made, and very expensive to have done for you.  Purchase a viola, not of too good of quality, and paint it yourself.  It would be cool if you could do something similar to the bow too.

Wear some really bright boots that come slightly above your ankle.  Go for COLOR!!



Also make sure to get your hair as big as possible.  If you don't have thick hair, try a side ponytail.



Lots of bold makeup, colorful eyeshadow, bright lipstick, etc.



Have fun with it!

We had one of these at my school and I dressed up with all used clothes I bought at my local thrift store. The shoes were these massive platforms in two-tone leather. Really cool stuff. My girlfriend ending up wearing a Laugh In type Go Go outfit with flowers and a leather vest with a yellow belt that was studded. Both of us found a fringed leather vest, which really looked razed, totally cool.  I actually like shopping at the thrift stores and finding vintage leather vests and boots. You can find so many vintage clothes for this period and You already have most of your outfit. You will look  glam  with the right shoes.



I like the leggings, denim mini skirt but the sweater, I don't know? Maybe a flower rayon blouse or a flower print? The shoes most definitely should be platforms, If you can find a pair in your size.



I think a great pair of platforms , shoes, or boots would look glam and very fitting. If you have a local thrift store or Goodwill I would think you could find lots of really cool clothes and several pair of platform shoes. Groovy time ahead so make the look all your own with  a peace symbol.

Ladies, what color socks do you where with your Crocs?



Good Morning!



It is now getting cooler and we ( in Northern Ca.) are expecting our first rain showers in months this week.  I was wondering what color socks do you wear with your crocs???  All I have is white which I wear with tennis shoes. But I am 6 1/2 months pregnant and getting my



shoes tied is hard to do  now.  So I was thinking of wearing my crocs.  The colors of my crocs are: red, pink, purple & blue.
Thanks and have a good day!

Those things are ugly as sin. Please do us all a favor and stop wearing them. They make slip on sneakers for a reason.

This is a prime example of the differences between the UK and the USA. Crocs in the UK are REALLY not in and only worn by what i believe you'd refer to as "Trailer Trash"? Are they quite cool over there then?
With regards to socks i have no idea - seems a bit wrong wearing socks with that kind of shoe. What do other people wear?

Don't listen to those others.  Wear what ever is comfortable for you.  Personally I would wear all kinds of crazy colored socks just to see if anyone notices!!!  Most people would zone in on you and your pregnancy.
So hand out some raspberries to anyone who has nothing better to do than worry about your footwear.

well you cant tell what your waist will be. thats not where your jeans measure up too. Its your HIPS. your waist can be any size. im a size 3/5 Im 36-23-35. i have a tiny waist but i suppose whatever you hips are that your either that or smaller. lol i sont think anyones waist is bigger than thier hips. all u have to do is measure if u wanna know. take a tape measure and find your waist usually right where ur bellybutton is. and wrap it around till they meet and see for ur self.

I don't know if the paint would melt.. but you could put the pants into a plain pillowcase, put them on the gentle cycle with gentle detergent. Woolite, or Dreft would work, then hang them up to dry.

Depends on the paint.



You should have chosen something that you have defined cleaning directions for.



Most paints, if they survive the washing part will not "melt" in the dryer.  You may have to hand wash and hang dry.

Um... it really isn't going to matter now is it?  We can quote you "perfect" all day long - but in the end, you cannot change the length of your inseam.



I would suggest loving what you've got - buy clothes, have them tailored to fit (it doesn't cost that much and usually your local dry-cleaner can do it or recommend someone)....



Nothing anyone says here is going to change the fact that your inseam is the length that it is... "best" "average" or "perfect" should redefine who you are.



Love yourself no matter what!!!

2cm?
because that's the average size for everyone and is probably on every hand made garment
but in factory's it's 1.5 cm
height hasn't got much to do with seams and being slim doesn't really affect it either
it all depends on how much fabric you cut out.
in case you cut too much u can make d seam bigger and just cut it off if it's loads of left overs.
hope this helped =p

You need to measure yourself. My sister is two inches shorter than me and takes a longer inseam on her pants than I do. Take a pair of pants that do fit and measure from the crotch to the hem.

If you choose a skirt, wear some tights to keep your legs warm.  You might get cold on the flight.  It will also give you something to cover you feet while you go through security.

No idea - not a tight wearer or resident of Bangalore.  Is there a cultural expectation for clothing that makes tights (anything that reveals leg) difficult to find?



Assuming you haven't had success with regular clothing stores or mail-order, I don't know if such schools are available, but perhaps a dance-supply store for ballet schools or similar?  Or for gymnasts?  You might find them unisex, too.

Too many times women will fall in love with a swimsuit in the store and then never put it on again. Why does this happen? The main reason is that the suit isn't practical for active use. When buying a swimsuit there are some important considerations to look at before buying, not the least of which is whether you are going to be active in it, like playing volleyball or just lying in the sun.



Let's take a look at some of the things we want to consider.



First off, you want to choose the right suit for your body type. For example, if you have wide hips or a little bit of a tummy you want to use blocks of color on one-piece suits constructed of darker fabric on the bottom and a lighter top half. You also want at least 15% spandex.



If you aren't naturally or otherwise endowed in the top, choose a lightly padded halter or a bra style with an underwire. You can also divert attention away from a smaller bust by using suits with texture and small print designs.



If you have the opposite problem or blessing, whichever way you want to look at it, you can minimize a larger chest by wearing a darker top with a higher neck. Make sure that the suit offers the support you need and choose a wider bottom to give you balance.



For a small or petite frame, a one piece with thin vertical striping can help and you can make short legs look longer with a higher cut on the hip. If you have a boyish figure, you can give yourself the illusion of a smaller waistline with a tankini and if you have what you consider to be an overly round bottom you can wear a "skort", the short and skirt combination to divert attention.



If you are one of the lucky ones with nice toned legs and shoulders, show them off with a bikini or a more revealing one piece.



These days, you can mix and match tops and bottoms when buying bikinis, so have fun with that. Just remember what you are going to use the suit for. If you plan on being in the water a lot you may not want a light thin material, unless you are an exhibitionist!



If you are going to be doing some kind of athletic activity you wan to be sure that you have the proper support so that you don't end up falling out while jumping for a volleyball.

I'm so afraid that my dreams of becoming a fashion Designer may not happen? ?



I'm 17...I've wanted this since my 12 birthday, which was when I flipped through my first issue of vogue magazine.



However, I think it just hit me how competitive it is out there. I've been working on my portfolio for design school for over a year (I still have 2 to go) . A lot of people say I'm talented, I do internships at boutiquesand ateliers, I take life drawing classes, I learn to sew..



Is there anything else I can do? I love clothing so much. For me...fashion means rrebellion means expressing yourself, not having to stick to rules...

I'd also suggest looking for it in the spring, around April. This way, you won't be last minute shopping one month before grad, and you will have a larger selection to choose from. The father away grad is, the better chance you have of getting a dress.
Again, burgundy. You'd look amazing in a brown or burgundy. Maybe a really dark red will work too.

What do you call this kind of dress? and can i have pictures?



okay, theres this one kind of dress i want to wear for prom..
it want it to be the kind of dress that's short in front [knee length] and long at the back..but i don't want  the back to reach the floor.. just somewhere halfway down my leg [below my knees] or something..



i want to know what it's called..
and i need pictures..



i also want it to be the puffy/thick kind of dress..like a balloon if you know what i mean..i dont want it to shape my butt and thighs.. lol [=



oh, something like the red dress selena gomez wore in their masquerade in 'another cinderella story' something like that, but i need more pics besides those..



if possible, please tell me what's the best material to use for the dress..thanks..



[if possible, material that would look good with converse..coz i MIGHT use converse..]



i'm going to design the dress myself [that's what my dad told me after getting high grades..]
prom is on march here n the Philippines.. and my dad told me to design it as early as now..

What should I wear on generation day?



I'm a sophomore in high school, and for homecoming week, one of the days is generation day. Sophomores get elementary school. What clothes can I wear that look obviously like I'm in elementary school and not just a sophomore with a bad fashion sense?

<answer>



it depends



1. if your suit has any gold detailing or you have a golden toned theme color for the wedding, do NOT wear a silver watch. as for the reverse as well, a silver weding and a gold watch will not match



2. If its silver which it probably is, it would go with any color, other than gold and yellow, so put that into account



3. And an easy way to knwo is to look at your fiances jewelry for the event, gold pearls and a gold bracelet obviously match with your GOLD watch, but silver jewelry would go with your SILVER watch =]



Have fun and congrats on the wedding!

You could be meg from Family guy [;
Her outfit is always long jeans, a red/pink shirt [with a white outline i think] and a red/pink hat. You could just wear some flats also. I don't know how cute it'll be but i bet nobody else would be her, and everybody will know who it is.

<question>



Is this outfit 'acceptable' for me to wear to a bar/club in London?



I'm a 30-something ex die-hard clubber... however, 'ex' is definitely the word, and I go to a club about once or twice a year now, and believe me it's by force!!  However, I cannot say no this time as it's a get-together of friends I rarely see, and I've ducked out of a lot this year.



Clubs being the hostile environment they are now, and the average age being about 16 (slight exaggeration but it's definitely young), I want to make sure I look 'acceptable'.  Luckily I've always looked considerably younger and can easily pass for late 20s, praps younger so I just about get away with mixing with the youth (!).



I have an outfit in mind; leggings with boots and a long kind of tunic dress - I want to be myself and obviously don't want to dress like the kids 15 years younger than me, but is this okay?  If not, can you think of anything?



First person to say I shouldn't be going clubbing is an idiot, coz I've already said I rarely, if ever, go anymore!!!

It would be better if there was a picture of the outfit, but it does sound good. If your boots are too clunky go with heels instead, or a more slender boot.

Go to Backstage in the Masonville mall, they should have something similar if not the same thing. It may be more expensive but trust me go to that store! I've seen similar stuff in White Oaks in Spencer's Gifts.

i'm guessing that he might be gay, but who knows? maybe it just shows that he's a guy and he doesent give a crap about what he's wearing, pink or not pink. but its his life, so maybe he has a reason for wearing all pink. for example, maybe his mom died of breast cancer. maybe the pink is just to help him spread the word about breast cancer. but idk!!! hope this helps!

I think guys like girls (in general) just buy whatever is common in store and being shown. Pink for guys came out in one point last summer (in new zealand atleast) and all the guys who previously would never ever think about wearing pink because it's too "different" decided to wear pink because this difference became 'cool' in a way since it came out as a fashionable color. i don't think guys wearing red makes them passionate, blue meaning trustworthy. I think it depends on each style of clothing that he choose that would instead define his personality more. Wearing pink when no1 does means he is confident or likes to stand out etc etc.



I think most guys look at a top for example and decide that it looks good overall, instead of hunting for the favourite colors. (they may avoid their worst colors but that's different).



So yeah, a guy wearing pink when it came out in fashion means that he is just following the trend, like ithappened here in N.Z. other wise, he could be wanting to look different, experimenting or just having fun even.

They aren't based on a particular culture, they are based more on a time period and genre, those being medieval and fantasy.



The cultural roots for these designs are usually based around European dress during the medieval and renaissance period.  Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, Scandinavian...etc.

It's pretty impossible, im looking for a pair too and i only wanted to spend around £50 however i couldn't find any for that budget so i've extended it to £80 and i've seen a nice pair in river island. If you do find any for that budget they are likely to be kinda cheap looking so i would advise saving a little bit more money and then buy a really nice pair.

Hello



Speaking of footwear.  I just came across this site that is giving away FREE designer Flip Flops. I got a pair of these last week and they are so comfortable.  Go get a pair while their supply lasts.  Even if you don’t want them, they’d make a great gift for your mom, wife, or girlfriend.  You can get yours at http://pho.se/56l

I think the black one looks better. However if you want to stand out you should get the pink ones definitly. The black one however will go with anything you wear and if you change a bit (fashion sense wise) the black shoes will still be fine for you where as the pink one may go against your new styles or likes. When pink shoes get dirty they tend to look real cheap and makes the person look cheap and dirty. But if you get the black ones, not only will they appear cleaner and you won't have to clean them much, if they do get dirty or look like as if it's wearing out a bit, it gives you a pretty cool look i rekon!



Also remember that you are seeing this from the computer screen in professional photos, the pink may not be as appealing as it looks with the clean white background and shiny tips etc!



Hope that helps

Good question.  The common suggestions, or ideas of the answers previously submitted are ones, that in my opinion, are the first thoughts most people have when trying to build a young persons confidence level.
I agree with them, HOWEVER, I also know how important it is for some of us to "fit in" and/or be accepted into today's society; especially at school.  Middle school and high school girls are, by any definition, the meanest and nastiest of any group of individuals. And, to be cast out by a group one wants to be a part of is a HUGE blow to the ego and self esteem.  So, with that said  -



You must search your own self and determine HOW important it is to be accepted into the "in crowd".  If this group of people are the ones you determine are important to your "rank" at school, then you must conform to the accepted dress code that has been established by the high ranking popular students.



As adults we, for the most part, find this behavior petty, rude and unacceptable.  However on the on the opposite of that statement, the same behavior is often found among adult groups, no matter how much we want to believe this is not the case.
So, to sum up what I have already said, it is ultimately up to you as to how you dress and what accessories you deem proper.  If you find you are looked down upon by those to whom you aspire to emulate, you must loose your current style and connect with the styles of your future peers.
If you are not concerned with "fitting in"; which I will safely assume by your posting query, is not the case.
To quote the rock group "Rush" - "conform or be cast out".....
Good luck I hope you find your place.

If it makes you feel any better, I'm dealing with the same thing. People always say to be yourself. Maybe that's wisest. But these same people seem to have forgotten what social life at school was like. The US government and the gods on Mount Olympus have nothing on girl's cliques both hierarchy-wise and governmentally. Its a lot of stress, and sometimes one has to bend to meet social standards.



Social connections are very important to get places in life, and you usually have to be publicly acceptable and maybe a little popular to establish them. However, being yourself is still very important. Its called compromise. Adapt to fashion trends, but make sure you spice it all up a little with YOUR STYLE. Switch off between a tote and ur back pack during the school week, or something like that. You decide how your going to organize it. Blending in...not good. Unless the situation calls for it, becoming completely camouflaged in society is giving in to mediocrity and anonymity in some ways. Stick out. Don't be anonymous.



I think your backpack is really cool.

Depends on how you wear it and what the weathers like where you live. If you live in a hot state and its 80 sonmething degrees out your  could wear it with the sleeves rolled and a thin tee under it, but if its you live in the north and its like in 50-60s put a lightweight polo under it if you want to dress it up, or put a tee under and wear a thin zip -up hoodie layered over.

I have never understood why it matters what colors to wear after labor day, and this and that during the winter time. I have a gorgeous white long jacket that I can wait to wear this winter with some blue jeans and a pair of brown boots! So, no you aren't the only one.

No you're not the only one. I wear white during the winter also. I understand that there is this style that everyone has to live up to; like spring colors, winter colors, summer colors, but I just ignore them. I wear what I like and especially in Cal. where it is quite warm in the winter till a certain point, white is a great color to reflect sunlight and cool off. So wear what you want because it will raise your ego. ^^

I don't like to wear white EVER.



But I think some girls can pull it off in the winter because they can channel a sort of "Russian princess" style-vibe. That can look very sweet and sexy.

ive never really understood that concept of not wearing a color after a certain date. i wear white whenever the moood strikes. so you should continue to do so as well as you like. its a color its clothing...so have fun wear what ever colors you so choose.

well you are wearing a team tshirt and shorts..with a bow to match team colors how childish can you look? there are many ppl who wear their teams colors/clothing an so on...they never look childish....tho how bout the ponytail strait down back with the bow instead of side one? (as far as the looking childish it always depends on age but again....and what you are wearing.--i dont think a team tshirt and shorts constitutes childish.

<question>



How can I dress to look thinner?



I love the way I dress.
I usually go for converses, skinny jeans, t-shirts and hoodies.
I don't like looking too overdone or too pretty, it makes me uncomfortable. But seriously, I've been getting really body-conscious lately. I feel terrible in t-shirts because I'm so d4mn big. My BMI is 22.8 and I'm not allowed to be dieting, because of my age (my body is "still growing".. puberty,,) and because being a vegetarian has given me vitamin deficiencies. I just eat healthily.



Hahaha, anyway.
Is there anything I can do to look better in my wardrobe, particularly in t-shirts now that summer's coming? I'm not interested in completely changing the way I dress. I was told to wear babydolls and flowy dresses, and I was way too self-consious to pull them off. Is there anything I can look out for to help me look thinner? Any materials, colours, patterns or styles in regular, casual clothes?

Babydolls are a nono
they puff out making you look muuccch bigger.
yes admitably black does make you look thiner... however its bland if you wear black all over.
wear bold colours on top, say a bold tee with nothing on it and jeans and then a bold colour converse.
stripes only make you look thiner if they are vertical, horizontal makes you look larger.
try wearing statement accessories as well, like large chunky necklaces and bangles, this draws attention to them, also large bags work for this too.
its going into summer now so get rid of the tees and jeans, why not try a pencil skirt these shape your curves and make you look thinner, also throw a bolero on top :)

well skinny jeans make every nice figured people look not that gorgeous sometimes... loose them...



next season they are virtually out anyhow....



go for baggy jeans and you can keep the hood if you like... DON't wear anything which shows your abdomen tyres please, it's a no no.... as are jeans which are tight at hips and make your fat bulge when you sit.. or in some cases even when walking....



you don't have to wear flowery dresses, it doesn't seem to be your style...  try to avoid light colours if you are big.. no horizontal stripes, vertical stripes are fine. vertical patterns are fine...



if you're not tall don't wear baby doll dresses,  however there are these skirts which are knee length and baggy, gypsyish... I love them, they suit everyone, and you can wear them to anywear, you get them in all fabrics and patterns you just have to choose, they look casual and stylish and depending on the top you wear you can easlily go to smart... they're perfect.



as regards to your bmi... and being a vegeterian i think you're eating  something you're not supposed to... maybe too  much ice cream or chocolate. healthy eating doesn't explain your bmi.. try get some exercise go for a walk or something if you're uncomfy, you're young but exercising will help you feel better about yourself..
hope this helps

Hot Water,



Same Logic as a washing Machine.
When you put stuff on too high a heat it shrinks (same with a dryer)
That's why with important items, you put them on a cool wash.



I don't think this actually works though. The water would have to be really hot. To hot for you to stand sitting in.
Don't try cold either, you'll get pneumonia.



I would suggest taking them in at the seams with a sewing machine!

Its easier to just put them in the washing machine. Just make sure you use the hottest water you have. Once the machine fills open the lid and let them sit for a few minutes. That way once they sit you can let the cycle run and spin them out. Then put them in a hot dryer. Good luck.

its funny i read the pposite thing abt it 2 days ago and tried to stretch my jeans using the same method only yesterday. it's still drying so i dont know if it stretched or not. hopefully it didnt shrink! lol... unfortunately for me i couldn't use hot or warm water cus i know for a fact that hot water shrinks jeans. it was too cold to be in the tub full of cold water...so i kinda gave up on it.
the best thing for u to do would be to wash ur jeans in a hot water cycle and dry in very hot setting in the dryer. it helped me to get a pair of size 3 jeans wearably resized. I'm a size 1. hope this helps.

Both patches claim the coach name and are in cursive not printed.  Wide white stitching all over and small pockets at each end with snap closures

Im just starting to wear Dickies and I dont wanna get the tight dress pants ones, I just like wearing looser clothes.  It would be weird asking this question in real life.

Use one of them little swab thingies that you rip open and put on a scratch. You can find them in first aid kits. I used to order extra packs 'cause I was always putting my pen in my pocket before clicking it closed.

Because they are made by different manufactures so the sizes run different if a size ten is too large go to a size nine and if ten is too small get a size 11.

I have noticed that.  If you have a usual size that you wear but in a shop it ends up being too big the shop assistant says it is a big make, if it is too small it is a small make.  I guess there is no set size in cm for each size.

You can find "fake fur" at your local arts and crafts store or fabric store.



Examples are:



Hobby Lobby,Michael's,JoAnns Fabrics,Hancock Fabrics,or even the fabric dept at Walmart.

Go to the zoo. Howler monkeys are big, usually pretty mean (sometimes), so the zookeeper won't mind you shooting a couple from the herd.  It'll save them money on food, too. Just try not to make a big mess with all the blood and brains. You should shoot 'em in the head - cuz it'll save bullet holes in the skin. Do it around 2 or 3 in the afternoon, then all the little kiddies will be fast asleep napping in their strollers.
Bring a big stick with a hook on the end to fish the bodies out of the moat.
Good Luck, and Happy Hunting!

Now, the real stuff is gonna be expensive for two main reasons-



-Monkeys are endangered and you have to go to a poacher to get them.  Be ready to pay up some dough.  like thousands.



-Since it is a black market item, you have to go all the way to Africa if you want some.  Sorry, no Ebay.



Of course, you can go bye fake fur.  It's easy and should find it in any fabric or arts and crafts store.

Two Men Fancy Dress Costumes?



So with Christmas Eve coming up every year we do a pub crawl and about 50-100 of us dress up. Last year was dreadufll, my preperation was terrible which resulted in me downing alot of beer. Anyway, I plan on having a decent costume.



So me and a friend are starting to plan now and we are looking for something amazing, we're not afraid to dress up stupidly at all so let them come! If you can find something like a double act that's even better. And my friend doesn't mind dressing up as a woman ;)



Any ideas?



Thanks!

I guess the only thing to do now is get a divorce. Your poor hubby spent 2 months' salary on each of those rings and YOU DON'T LIKE THEM? Do this:  Step up to a mirror, and slap yourself.
You're right. There are a lot of smart and informed yahoo people here.  Considerate too.  you should try to be as well.
"I dunno"..."I'm tired of"...Please......you're lucky your hubby doesn't say the same thing waking up next to you.

Do you really care what NO ONE else is wearing or not wearing? Didn't you choose your rings along with your husband? There is no way I could or would change my rings... they mean so much to both f us, not in a monetary way, but they are a lasting symbol of our love and of our commitment to each other.



I'm smart enough and informed enough to know that that is all that matters.

You could always leave a note to your mum on her dressing table. Do not leave it on the dining table if you don't want your dad to know. Besides, getting a bra is part of growing up, there's no need to be embarrassed about it.



You should get it in basic colours like white and maybe pink/blue. Don't get too expensive ones since you're most likely to grow out of them soon.

Don't be shy or embarrassed to talk to your mom.
If you can't start the topic, just wait until she offers to buy you a bra again and say "Yes, I think I already need some".



Go for white and black at first so you can wear them with most colors.
White for bright clothes (shirts, blouses, etc) and black for the dark ones.
Don't worry, your mom is your best friend.
Or if you're soooo shy, just go to some store and ask the seller there what's best for you :)
There's nothing to worry about.

Embrassed? To tell your Mom?? Well than, im 11 and my Mom gets me bra's all the time. She either finds out by doing my laundry (if the bra is broken) or I just tell her. I just say ''Mom I need a bra can we go shopping''? If your dad knows it's not that big of a deal. My dad know's and he dosen't care. It's a BRA it's not a THONG.
Pink, Yellow, White, Black, Blue, Purple, and some with little desgins (words, hearts, cherries etc.)

Most underwear shopps sell PJ's and socks too.
So when your walking past point to the PJ's and say OMG mum arne't they so cool and she'll be like what?? and go in and say  'mum  these!!' and then say can we look down the back? and she'll get the message, i promise

Bra time is a very special time for mom and daughter - don't think your mom is too busy or that it's embarrassing - this is just one of many times you can celebrate being feminine and growing up - celebrate together.  She will be delighted in her busy schedule to have reason for time with you, I say go for lunch too and remember that your mom loves you more than any other person possibly can (you'll understand this better when you have children of your own) and really, you can tell her anything.  As far as color. . . .a couple skintone and a couple fun designs!

white capri pants. she says they are in style now and that guys wear them. they are rather thin. I just tried them on and you can see the outline of my white thong. Should i just wear them? if so, what color thong. I could wear bikini briefs, but then you would see the outline of the briefs.



</question>



<additional details>



i wear thongs because I like cute undies and because  my gf bought them for me.  For the pants, she wanted me to wear them.

just wear them.  if your gf likes you in them, then go ahead.  i wouldn't wear the white thong, though.  i would get nude colour.  get your gf to help you pick one out.  don't wear the bikini briefs or you will have VPL.

the question here is "should i just wear them?". and i say no, the capris sound a little too metro-sexual for a real straight man.



but its your lucky day, cuz i am spewing bonus material: get a new gf...one who appreciates you for own sense of style and underwear preferences. unless you are a toddler, you should be dressing yourself.

I agree with the answer above - they're runway models. A walk is a walk, and it's used basically to show of the clothes- not to show of the model. Runway models usually aren't meant to be show off anyway.

I am looking at boots online for a Halloween costume that have a 4 inch heel and 1/2 inch platform. Will these make me 4 inches taller or 4 1/2 inches taller?



I ask because I am 5'9". My tallest pair of heels right now are 3 inches and I am still shorter than my boyfriend when I wear them. I don't to buy heels if they will make me taller than him.

Glue on garment!!!Help!!!?



what can i use to get glue off my jacket which accidentally spilt there?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It depends on what the jacket is made of and how hard the glue is. Without knowing that, I would hazard a guess and suggest that if the glue is hard, you may be able to scrape it off very gently using a non serrated, smooth plastic knife. I would like to suggest nail polish remover which will work with some fabrics, but could wreck others. You could try a little on a hidden area of a jacket, but I think the best idea as I don't know enough about your fabric, type of glue, etc. would be to take it to a dry cleaners. They may be able to simply spot clean. Best of luck.

Getting boots from Nine West.. Help?



First time getting boots online from Nine West.. thinking of getting this:



http://www.ninewest.com/Cheryl/2984643,d...



or this:



http://www.ninewest.com/Quintera%2c-ship...



Which one is better?



I have 2 pairs of Nine West shoes, both are normal heels, one covered one not, both a size 8. Should I get the boots in size 8 as well or do boots run small or anything?



And now the major Q... what does width N, M or W mean? It is to do with how wide your calves are right.. but are there any measuring guides that can advise me on which is my width then? Coz I think my calves are big, but I don't know if it's just my thinking, or how big it is as compared to others as I am an Asian woman..



And I don't want a pair of boots shipped all the way to me, and go broke for a pair of boots that don't fit..

Hi!



I suggest you take a trip to the bar you will be working in and see what the women there wear. Wear something similar to your interview - they will find it easier to see you in the job if what you wear is close to what their employees wear.



Good luck

I would wear black slacks as it is required for most bartenders and closed toed shoes are a must for working in the service industry.  I guess I recommend going by the old adage of dressing for the job that you want- so they know that you'll be presentable if you get the job.



As for the top, that depends on the bar.  You'd wear a different top for a biker bar than a martini bar.  If it's a scene bar wear something hip but not revealing.  Let them have a hint at your personality so they'll know you'll fit in but keep it professional.

well, you should always look very smart, and don't wear too much makeup. wear something that does not show too much cleavage or too much leg,mini skirts are a no no in an interview. Oh , you must wear tights or holdups,anything,but bare legged.

put it like this...you can take a page outta my All Hallows Eve Handbook.The easiest,and most price friendly costume,out there is to go as a homicidal maniac.Why?Because..they look no different from you or me,any real person could be one...ya never know..and I think that's scary.Plus,when people see you dressed normally and they ask you "what are you dressed as,huh?"You can enjoy the looks on their faces when you tell 'em "I'm a homicidal maniac.They look just like everybody else,that's why y,never know who's crazy!"Or...if you don't like that,you can paint your face white and go as a ghost.

Where can I find a pair of apron pants?



About ten years ago, an acquaintance of mine let me borrow a pair of pants from her that had a little wrap-around apron attached to them.  I really liked the way it covered my tummy and butt.  It draped over them rather than clinging, and I just found them so attractive.  Is there a brand that makes pants like this?

Is This Normal?? Piercing?



Okay, I got my ears pierced on Saturday. My dad did it with one of those at home piercing kits. I clean my ears everyday 2-3 times a day with the stuff that came with the kit. And I turn 3 or more times a day. But, sometimes when I touch them they are still sore. Is it normal for your ears to still hurt almost 5 days after you've had them pierced?



I'm 14. I had my ears pierced once when I was in 5th grade and I don't remember them hurting 5 days after I had them pierced.



If you want to know. I didn't take good care of them when I was in 5th grade so they healed up. And I never really thought about havng them repierced until like a month ago and I just finally got it done.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Yes that is normal. Keep using the cleaning stuff. They say though that you should only clean them once or twice a day. The more you touch then the more they'll get irritated. So, try to avoid it. If they keep hurting and you see redness around your ears you should go to a doctor. They'll tell you if you have a infection or not.



Also, maybe next time you should go to a professional, and get them done..



HOPE THIS HELPS!

Get a stud for sure because they won't snag as easy.



The piercing takes no more than like a millisecond. The pain is no more than a second, just because it's going through cartilage, but it's totally tolerable.

I had a ring put in mine after they pierced it. To me, it heals better because it allows you to move the ring through the piercing as it heals, thus avoiding any scar tissue from building up around the inside. I have had mine for nearly ten years and have never had any problems from it. I cant stand the "screw" ends because they always tend to turn upside down and the end usually ends up sticking out of your nose like a little silver booger...

White capri pants for a guy - what type of underwear?



My gf has bought me a pair of white capri pants.  They are cute and I like them.  The only thing that bothers me is that they are rather thin.  My gf wants me to wear them tomorrow to campus wearing white thong undies.  I just tried it one and you can see the outline of the thong through the pants.  I told her, and she said not to worry, that no one will notice.  Should I wear a different color thong or what?  I mean, if I wear briefs you will see the underwear lines, so a thong is better.  Maybe just a different color?

Why can't women wear stilettos everyday?



I know they just like to complain about everything but dont they realize it makes them much more sexier. I tell me gf to put them on but she doesnt somedays and just whines about it.
if it hurts a little bit, wouldnt you get used to it?

Because it can be seriously dangerous to the feet, if you wear them so much that you are in agony it can mean that the bones in the feet can bend and become out of shape. Besides it hurts like hell and i think you sound very controlling, lay off a bit.

wear stilettos every day from age 15-60 could make us in a wheelchair basically by the time we're 65.  it hurts our feet, ankles, legs, and back.  You don't get used to it if someone smashes your arm into a rock every day, it doesn't hurt any less the more you do it. Also they can give you really painful blisters. Also they're kind of hard to walk in.

You must be a man (or just a boy?) if all you care about is what you think looks good on a woman and who cares if it's uncomfortable. For your information, high heels are extremely bad for the feet and arches. You can permanently damage your feet wearing them. I have no idea why women even wear high heels in the first place, other than to make ignorant guys like you happy. Glad I don't know any guys like you who would be pressuring me to wear heels. My husband just wants me to be comfortable. He says I'm beautiful no matter what I look like or wear. There should be more men saying that to their women!

you classic male pig. you know, we don't have to do anything for you. if that's your attitude, then you should feel lucky you even have a gf. in case you didn't know sherlock, stilettos are bad for our backs and ankles. why don't you put on some stilettos everyday? you'll get used to it. in fact, why don't you try walking in stilettos just for an hour and then say this pig-headed statement. maybe you should do something to make yourself seem sexier, because women do a ton of stuff otherwise like doing their hair, makeup, buying nice clothes, and then guys like you can't even appreciate it because you do none of that stuff.

I wear 4 inch stilettos every day to work. I also enjoy wearing them when on the weekends, so I pretty much wear them the entire week. That's not to say my feet are hideously deformed. I enjoy wearing strappy sandals in the summer, so I take my feet's health and appearance VERY seriously. I moisturize them every day and have pedicures every two weeks. I'm blessed (and cursed!) of having big feet, so I have less difficulty walking in really high heels. I also make sure they're never too tight. Also whenever I get a minute, I dangle or slip in and out of them to give my feet a little rest.

No, This is not a joke. But yes, there is a catch. First, I'm a size 8 UK and second, if you want them, you'll have to take them off my feet! So yes, they're not new. Brands include Gucci, YSL, Dior, Prada, Patrick Cox, Jimmy Choo, Christian Louboutin. If you're interested, please email me. Again, this is not a joke!

So I bought this dress....?



So I go thrifting a lot bc I like to make my own clothes and I got this dress on a whim and it's super 80s but I thought it was really cool. Well just out of curiosity I looked up the designer that made it, which is Patricia Rhodes. It looks like it might have been an expensive dress for the time, I mean like it's all weaved and knit looking, but I wonder if it really is this designer bc when I looked her up her dresses are min $300. How could I know if this is really one of her dresses?

no not necessarily. LL Bean will have sales online and not in the store. Always call the store and ask. Walmart is a huge one that does this. I found an ipod charger for 19 and some change and figured i can get the same price in the store. Well i went and it was 23 and some change. They wouldn't give me the different price and said it's a way to get people to buy online. BUT the funniest thing is, i can have it sent to store for the 19 dollar price.

Could I model? (Picturessss)?



I've never modeled in my life. These are just some senior pictures, but after I posted them online some people have told me I should try modeling. (Specifically modeling for Hot Topic, hha?)



So I guess I'm wondering if I have the potential to model for some clothing companies such as Hot Topic and others:



Here are the senior pictures:

5: http://a986.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/ima...



I have my monroe, septum, nose, ears, belly button, and wrist pierced and I have two tattoos (for now). So I'm not expecting to model for something like Abercrombie. lol;))

Finally my modelling agency sent me the pics of a photoshoot I did last week.
There are ten pics. Can you tell me what you think about each of them? Clothing, set, make up, face expression...
If you think I look awful in some pics, tell it to me. If you think I look slutty, tell it to me. No problem about critics. But please, let me know what you think about each photo.
Thank you.

Only think I'd say is about 80% of these photos have the same face. Maybe try to do another face thats still pretty / sexy. I know its harder then it sound, but if you ever notice the top models and the not so top models the difference between them is that they have MANY different faces.

I think you really pretty, and i love the pics and the clothes but i really don't think some of these are appropriate for the Internet. I mean if you don't mind guys looking at your half naked pics and googling your goodies and doing  god knows what why they look at them then more power to you :) But like i said your pretty and i love the poses , clothing ,etc.............

Most of them are 'good' shots. Not too sure about 3 and 9. They are pretty 'slutty'. But what ever you are happy with. You've a beautiful face you shouldn't really need to be doing those. Good luck

Is this for a modelling agency or for Hustler? No offense or anything- I've just never seen professional modelling pictures of this nature. Don't take this in a bad way- I think they all look slutty. But that's apparently what your agency is going for, so hey you worked it. 2 is def my favorite- i think your hair looks great in it. 1 is my least favorite- I don't like the hair style at all. You don't have a nice enough face or fit enough body type to be like a real model-runway or anything, but for this sort of thing it works. I don't think you'll be the next Pam Vida or Jenna- but you definately have a shot in getting in somewhere!

HONESTLY?



In my opinion you look great in pics 2, 3, 5, & 8. You could have worked on your facial expressions a little more but other then that you look great. You are very pretty and you can make it big.



However, the rest of the pics are not that great. I was told when I was at my modeling agency that the kind of job you want is how you want to present yourself.

I think in all of them, you look so beautiful!



But honestly, I think I would cut out the 8th picture. I don't want to hurt your feelings, not my intention, but you don't look that attractive there.
But in all the other ones, you look gorgous! My favorite is 2, and 10.

Where to find tall people clothes?



i'm 6'2" male, and can never find anything that fit's right - with shirts, L has small sleeves, and XL looks too baggy...



pant's too - i can't find anything with inseam more than 32"



any recomendations besides a big/tall store (where they charge about 4x the normal price)?



</question>

JCPenney has a nice priced Big/Tall section. Avoid places like AE/A&F/Hollister, the rarely carry items for tall people.

I'm not sure if this will help you but as a tall girl I go to New York and Company they have all sizes but then different fits. For example my waist is a size four but with my long legs they would be high waters but at NY&CO i can get a size four and than ask for it in tall. Tall being the fit that i earlier mentioned and since most jeans are unisex it might not hurt looking into. As for shirts same problem either opt for tanks, short sleeves or 3/4 sleeves or if there is a long sleeve shirt you just have to get scrunch the sleeves up a bit.  Believe me I know what ur going through and ppl say that clothing is easy for the tall and thin. Just have to be creative. Hope this helped.

Depends.  Define expensive?



Dior haute couture is one "expensive," for an upper-upper class wealthy woman who loves beauty, quality and one-of-a-kind garments with honest HIGH status.  Juicy Couture and a lot of the other brands people have mentioned here are a totally different "expensive," for a middle-upper class girl who likes the cheap "status" that comes from flashing a name brand on a poorly-made purse or tank top from China.



Get to know your character.. and if her personality is very fashionable, get to know fashion. :)



EDIT: for reference, Juicy runs around $200 average for a dress.  Haute couture runs probably $30,000 average for a dress.

Hollister coming to London! ?



Ahh i'm super happy! I was in my local shopping centre, Bluewater and i saw a shop is about to become Hollister! I was screaming as i've looked on the American site and love the stuff. Does anyone know if Hollister are going to open any other shops in England?

I am in America, but congrats. I love hollister. their shirts and tanks are comfy, laid back, easy to wear, and super cute. I love their jeans and jackets too! Better save up for some shopping! If hollister is going to open anywhere else in England, it would be in a big city, big shopping centers. Hollister and Abercrombie stores usually don't open in rural areas or small towns or tiny places.

tough question, it's kind of opinion-oriented, I'd say, but if I may add my two cents, I'd say the top one is very feminine, and the bottom one less so. Now, hmm, well depending on what kind of guy your boyfriend is, if he's a jock-esque type, I'd say he'd have qualms wearing either one, but perhaps the second one if you said "pretty-please" and batted your eyelashes a bit. (lol?) 
Actually, now that I think about it. It'd most likely come down to self esteem, if he's more self conscious, lean to the second one, if not, perhaps the first one? Maybe he would be okay wearing an effeminate ring from you? Just take a bit, think about how he is, and rate it on a scale of the esteem and testosterone, more testosterone? lean towards a different one or the second one, less testosterone, you'd have more leeway.
(I personally think the top one's purdier, but I'm a really feminine guy, so meh, maybe you'd be better off with the second one as a safe side? Think about it! =D)

Whats with men wearing skinny jeans? eurgh!?



it makes me cringe sooooo bad! i just don't get it. i used to love shopping in topman for my bf but its gone all weird now, selling skinny jeans, gayboy cardi's etc!

men are meant to look masculine and hot in baggy or loose jeans...why are these men trying to dress like women? i personally love wearing skinny jeans but it puts me off when i see a guy walk past me wearing nearly the exact same thing!

i don't care if they're IN....its disgusting and men should be banned from wearing them!

Unbeknownst to you fashion did not start the day you were born.  All you have is your opinion on what is and is not cool.
Several generations of little people like you have been generated by women that swooned over guys in skinny jeans.
Get a perspective before you cry the blues.

Most people don't wear things just because they're "IN" - they wear them because it suits them or they just enjoy wearing it.

"men are meant to look masculine and hot in baggy or loose jeans"
That's like saying women should all go back to wearing skirts 24/7!

It's the 21st century, let people wear what they like. You may find them 'disgusting' - some people may find the clothes you wear disgusting. It's a matter of personal taste. I think men in skinny jeans and cardis are hot.

Plus, "gayboy cardi's" is both derogatory and badly punctuated.

I think some people could pull it off, if teamed with skinny jeans and a plain top. I love the ribbed edging on it!!!!!

The material of that jacket does look fairly cheap though as it is really shiny! I dont think it is worth £45 personally.

If you want you could get a darkish brown coloured one, as this wont look "biker chic" and is really fashionable! You just have to look around until you find the perfect one, dont just go buyin the first one you see (unless you really love it).

Hope I've helped, xx

They would look great with skinny jeans and.. they would look cute with a skirt also! :) So if you get tired of the jeans, .. you can wear them with a skirt :)



But for a top, I would recommend something the same color like the boots . What ever suits your body and flatters you will do just fine, in that color :)



Good luck!

Have you tried seeing your doctor about this? Since it is a condition you seem very concerned about I would think you have tried the over the counter products available at the local pharmasists? There can be a few reasons for your problem. One may be genetic. could be an infection. Only a doctor can tell you for sure. I doubt your parents are ashamed of you though. Unles it is happening because you don't wash your feet, but maybe they feel sorry for you that you have this problem. Don't worry, you'll find a solution.

Bomber jackets arn't in, but this winter leather jackets will be big again like last winter, just they'll be taking a different look. Leather jackets will be taking a more feminine look, with more detailing on neck lines, and a big emphasis on cropped hems.

You may be able to dye the dress but it depends on what fabric it's made of - natural fibres absorb dyes much better than synthetics, so if it's a man-made fabric you may not get the colour that you want.

Finding a dye shouldn't be too difficult. We suggest that you head for Woolworth's, Robert Dyas or John Lewis. Most of them are very easy to use, you'll just need to buy some salt (which will help fix the dye to the fabric) and put everything into the washing machine. Bear in mind when you're choosing the colour though that your dress is yellow not white. That means that the colours will mix together and you'll end up with a very different shade to that on the box.

Fashionalclothes for an 12 yearold?



Can anyone give me any good sites with clothes for a 12 year old  her size ranges from  a 13- 14 yearold girl to a size 14 adult sizes! 
Her size just really depends on the shop( the sizes do seem to very!)
i was thinking such sites as abercrombie. She is quite fashion concious. I would love it if some one could maybe put an outfit together for her... as she is a little bigger than the average 12 yearold nothing to clingy please and something which will maybe make her look thinner.
Thanks x
Feel free to ask any questions... also aren't looking to spen TOO much we have a budget of about 50 to 100 pounds she would also love a really nice hoodie. she suits the colours mainly blue and pink,(but any colour really except for white and pale colours because she has very light skin)
PS.  she is quite big built and is working on loosing some of her exces weight and puppy fat.

If you don't want clingy clothes, places like A&F and Hollister are not where you want to shop. Those stores make mostly tight-fitting clothes. If you must shop there, try to get babydoll shirts or ones that flow. It will cover up any stomach pudge that the girl might have. This is kind of what I mean:

You may just want to find styles of clothing that work best for bigger girls, not just different stores.

Its to hard to avoid the color white, because it goes with everything, and she will have to wear shorts or she'll die of heat stroke. I don't know the exchange rate, as I'm only 13, but i hope it helped. =]. You should also think about getting her a tote.

If you have a long torso and shorter legs, go for a higher wasteband, like mid rise or high waist jeans. This elongates your legs and shortens your torso, balancing you out a bit and slimming your silohuette. Also, heels under a longer flare jean would lengthen your legs as long as the heel isn't too visible under the jean.

Same body type here.  I find that there isn't really a lot of solutions to make me look taller:(
Best advice I can give you though is to try to buy jeans that have a shorter inseam or are labeled short or petite.  Buying to fit your body correctly helps a lot.  Hope this helps:)

Why would you choose to be something you are not, and most importantly, when you don't even know what that looks like? How can you know you want to be something when you don't know what that something is? Also, why do you want to change completely, and become something you're naturally not? Does that feel right to you? Are you trying to cheat others, or just lying to yourself about who you are?
Sorry, but you should just be yourself... whatever that is. Think about it.

No honestly, I agree with Abbey.

What if I told you that scene kids liked to go into the Red Light District every Friday and smoke powder nutrients in a room the size of a telephone booth?
Huh, would you still wanna be scene?

i have no idea what to tell you on the clothes since i'm a dude. but with the room color, black is a must. and than get some really bright neon colors. or just paint your room black and than splatter bright colors everywhere, i guess you could call that 'scene'
okay, for makeup lotsa of eyeliner. make sure it's bold.
just shop at hot topic or pac sun & your good to go.

Lmao I agree, peoplecan be mean! Just dont go around saying your a scene kid, that sounds poseurish!



Hair: Get it razored, layered, long back, and a side fringe at the front. Keep it black mixed in with platinum blonde or neon colours using manic panic (m.p. is great for hair after bleaching, it heals it using vegetable based stuff!)

Makeup: If your not a pro, just keep to eyeliner (black, thick, and around the whole eye). After you get the hang of that use eyeshadow's and false eyelashes. Oh and dont forget the blush!!!

Clothes: Band tee's, retro tees, any tee basically thats in neon colours, match it with black/blue/colourful skinny jeans (hot topic, d-tox), or you can go with skirts with leggings (stripes are popular!) and perhaps once in a while tutus!(claires)

Room colours: Any colours,hot pink/ neon green look great! Or perhaps black && white.

Extras: Must have are bows! for your hair, you can get them at claires, and studded belts, long or super short neclaceswith stars or hearts, piercings such as septum/ears/lip rings, extensions if your hair is short or you want to add colour. Myspace is a must have as well.

Hope I help, if you want to contact me for more info you can do so at www.myspaace.com/jazmox or email me at extremejazmo@hotmail.com

I think that UGGs are kind of hideous and now out of style. If you want a boot, try a fringed boot instead. Its more stylish, better looking, and can give you a stunning boho vibe.

ugg boots have always been wrong outside of the car and house...they are not cute or hot on n e gender's foot. the only reason for uggs is to warm ur feet quickly...which was why they were made...for surfers and water sports people to warm their feet after a day in the cold water originally...those boots definately put the ug in ugly.

I've got that! You can wear it without a top under if you're a bit daring and have a nice chest, or I just match it to whatever else I'm wearing. Usually just a plain black strappy top though, that looks really good, like it's part of the top really, as you can only see like a V-shape of it. It's dead comfy and flattering too because of the length. Definately get it!

As it's probably only a one-off, you won't really want to spend that much money, or go looking like an idiot either.

Try and use all the things at hand that you can... a black pair of leggings, or black fish net tights, a very short black pencil skirt, and a black/dark blue leotard, add a couple of black 'feather bowers' sewn individually around the back, from around neck to waist (legs !) , and you'll need some really big black sun glasses, to create the effect of BIG LENS EYES... a headband for antenae, some wings, and if you have leg-warmers (dark blue) these can go around your ankle calves, oh and you'll need black gloves to complete the picture.

Instant bug er...fly...

Have fun.. and don't get squatted, but if you have a fly squatter handy.. or take a black spatular.. then there's your bug catcher problem sorted too..

Depends on your taste, style and what you can afford really.
My fave shops are Ted Baker, Karen Millen, Gucci is nice but not that I can afford shopping there very much, Monsoon and Whistles.

i would say top shop as it imitates the catwalk fashion scene and everybody is trying to imitate that look.you also have primark which is the same but the prices are dead cheap.River Island and H&M.I would say this are pretty the most fashionable as Sir Green owns them all except H&M.

I have these earrings. They are very practical, and very, very classy. They look good with almost anything, and will always be in style. So ADORABLE!!!, and btw, to anyone who said they are too big... They are much smaller in person. They are the perfect size. They do not pull on your lobes, and are not the least bit thick.

HA! I've never worn high heels in my life, and my sex life is fine.  It may make the woman feel sexier and thus increasing her confidence and getting more, but to say that it indeed improves sex life overall: I'm going to no to that.

They improve her appearance so they probably improve her chances, yes. Very high heels make the legs harder and more shapely, move the hips out, the chest forward and change the gait to be more sexually appealing and more suggestive.



Many men like women to wear sexy shoes during sex, yes.

It's sexy , but it's not gonna make your sex life better.
That's like saying "if i wear tag will women jump me?"

If your ugly wearing high heels won't make people want you more.
but if your good looking, it may make some heads turn.

I don't have a foot fetish or anything,  but a good pair of legs with  some high heels just does something to me

Im thinkin of having a black dress with baby pink accesories...
it needs to be like a prom dress..
I would like it black but if anyone else has any suggestions they would be much appreciated!
Also any ideas on hair & make up & accesories??

Well i think it's great you are supporting breast cancer for a start and also that you are having your makeup and hair done by a professional because you don't have to worry and stress about that and you know you're gonna look fabulous lol x



Well i think a black prom style dress would be good with some baby pink accessories or maybe fuschia pink accessories also. The whole black with pink is really a huge trend for this season.  Maybe a pink dress in a fuschia with black, or baby pink with black?



Well whatever you choose i'll see if i can find some dresses for you, to give you some ideas.



1. This dress is a lovely style strapless in stretch satin, with bow detailing also. It's a lovely flattering shape as it hugs in all the right places. I think it would be perfect for the event as you can dress it up really easily. Also if you do want to go with a pink dress, they do this in a fuschia pink colour also. 
http://www.oasis-stores.com/fcp/product/...

Now you say it needs to be like a prom dress, but in my opinion this style of dress is not the b-all and end all for a ball type event. As long as it's a dress for evening wear, you can wear what you want. So this next dress is inspired by next seasons trend of womanly tailoring ( seen at Burberry prorsorum, Balenciaga, Valentino and Chanel) , this tux inspired sleevless dress with ruffle detail is very fashionable and perfect for an evening occassion. 
http://www.oasis-stores.com/fcp/product/...

This dress has a corset style bodice and has so much detail for the price. I think it would look great it you are still hankering after a prom style dress for the pink tie do. It's a lovely detailed dress that looks simple but has some great embelishment, which means it will be very easy to dress up with accessories.
http://www.asos.com/The-Laden-Showroom/C...

This dress must have been made for your pink tie event because it is demure in the black colour and the prom style shape but has a little sash of baby pink at the waist, which gives it a lovely tickled pink feel, perfect for this event.
http://www.asos.com/Asos/Asos-Premium-Ti...

Wonderful dress, like the dress above but has a splash of fuschia, to liven things up a bit, you could put on some fuschia shoes and wear some hot pink nail varnish to make this fun and flirty in pink.
http://www.asos.com/Asos/Asos-Contrast-T...

This dress is so up to date because the asymmetric shoulder was seen everywhere, from lanvin to stella McCartney for spring summer 08. I love this dress, as the flash of hot pink is really flirty and fun, and will go great with some peep toe black platforms and a black satin clutch and also some hot pink lippy and varnish.
http://www.asos.com/Cheryl-Cole/Asos/Aso...



Now, this dress, is in my opinion is the best dress for an evening  event, if you want  maxi that is. It's v neck neckline is really alluring and the shape is just great. 
http://www.net-a-porter.com/product/3156...

I thought this dress would be absolutely perfect if you want a pink dress, i know its a bit more pricey but you can wear this again and again and again or if not, you can give it to me :P lol
So here it is a donna karen new york original 
http://www.net-a-porter.com/product/3641...

Go for some pink patents by jones boot maker, they're sugary sweet pink will jazz up your outfit.
http://www.jonesbootmaker.com/ebusiness1...

Now i'd choose a pink or a black heel for the event and a clutch in pink or black, and then get some pink earrings, bangles, necklaces.



Lots of pink clutches

I hope ive helped you and that you really enjoy your evening, it sounds as if it will be great! Probably lots of pink champagne in abundance lol

Enjoy your night!

The more you pay the better quality it will be.  As a general rule though umberella's that do not fold into a small package are the best but not as handy so you won't be able to pop it your bag etc.

I bought one at walmart for about 10 dollars and have had it for about 4 years now, I live in a very windy place and the rain is bad. you cant guess when an umbrella is good just buy one and the ones that are automatic open and close work well and dont break fast

i have one its great. its clear and it comes down like a dome one gal mentioned them, earlier.  I got mine from a market in london. It was like £5 and its great. it doesnt fold down tho but def recommend them as they cover me and i can only see through the umbrella as they actually go over your body

Totes Umbrellas are truly worth the money.  After being fed up of £5.99 and hyper value cheap types of brollys always breaking.  I decided to fork out a £15.00 for a brolly.  SInce then it has lasted.  Dont get me wrong you have to protect the brolley from blowing inside out, face the main body towards the wind, and also drying the brolley out properly will help any rust get in joints.  When not in use store it in its protector case.

My friend Teah is a teenage model.
She is Hawaiian, and has dark skin, just like you too!
She is exactly the same measurements and height as you are, so I believe you would be fine for glamor modeling.
However, catwalk is only for the size ) 6 feet tall sort of women. A catalogue would most likely take you.
Do not cut your hair short! They look for length so they have something to play or work with on the shoots. 
Also, wear something fashionable to the interview. They need to know that their models have fashion sense off the sets. Always have a good personality!
You can look up catalogue modeling agencies in the yellow pages.
I hope you make it!

You sound like you have "womanly hips" and that wouldnt go over for a teen model. Teen models they pretty much want long and lean, nothing that stands out to much, like big boobs or hips or butt.So being 5'4 you already got that against you. You can be pretty and not be a model. Why do so many want to model? Just be a happy fun teenage girl.

i think you need to put pictures up, because to be a model, you need to look the part,
contact modelling agencies. look them up on the internet and post them pictures of yourself.
in the photos, don't wear a lot of make up and jewelry etc, you dont want to look too 'try-hard' the less the better.
you say you would like to model for a catalogue or model teenage clothes, you could also try girls magazines, like sugar and shout magazine, they hold competitions like, all the time for a lucky reader to become a model.
there are loads of opportunities out there, your still only young yet so dont rush into things.

also, if the agency won't let you model for them unless you 'loose weight', dont do it. just dont.

and... if the agency asks money to join, is not a real agency, YOU get paid to model, you dont pay them.

good luck =)

try and wear tops with a design which is mostly on the stomach area ...and with a plain colour around the bust..!....--this makes allows a balancing allusion...so not much attention is around your bust but instead to your stomach...whcihc is okay because you have a relatively small waist.....

but rememer ...you;re lucky to have a figure like that..so try flaunt it instead of tryin to hide ii!1 
good luck

Going to a party in a few weeks;



Its an 18th.. casual dress.
I was thinking of wearing high waisted shorts in black.. with four big buttons on the front in like a rectangle shape, a cotton cream top with lace detail. heels and a clutch bag? Is this okay? Should I wear a silk scarf too? I do like silk scarfs.

Oh and i'm 18, tall (5'9 i think).. quite indie dressing, I like vintage clothes  alot!
Hehe.

I don't know how much you want to spend, but nearer the Winter months- Topshop does a great range of jumpers and knitwear in a range of colours and styles. They're about 15-25 pounds each and replace the 'jersey' range of T-shirts and vest tops which are out in Spring and Summer :)

whats wrong with what you have now? dress like a thug? do your friends even known what fred perry is? lol to be honest what you just descibred to me sounds a lil advanced for most teens, alot of kids go out and buy the "mall" brands. fred perry and ben sherman are very respectable clothes. why change cuz your friends have a distorted view of you as a thug?

Perhaps the polo shirt and the cap are a bit of a uniform and just group you with people's misconceptions that all youths wearing such things are bad. Lose the cap (unless your head is cold!) and wear a button-up shirt with a collar. The DMs and jeans are fine.

Possibly cause your dresseing in really dark colours ... maybe try a nice pair of jeans ... but rather than black go for a dark indigo blue ... more casual but still smart cause of the dark colour... get yourself some nice trainers or converse ... poloshirts are good ... but Fred Perry is quite a neddy make ... maybe go to republic or USC and try some other brands ... even H&M have reallly nice guys stuff ... get some poloshirts in different colours ... brighter colours ... lighter blue, red, and if ur confident pink yellow or purple?? Or you could buy a couple or white Ts and get some nice casual shirts to wear over the top open? I also suggest that rather than a zipper maybe try a lightweight jumper in a grey or black .... a good website is ASOS they have a great section for guys and have  a really good sale on right now ...lose the cap ... is it essential??? They do make you look more threatening and plus the give u bad hair and people cant see ur lovely face!!! Its hard to be specific ... but if ur sporty or into football etc try JD sports their guys stuff is nice  and they have nice lightweight jackets 
Its trial and error ... Dont be something you dont want to be ... you need to be comfortable but have a look online ... try different things on and find a look your comfotable with .... lose the cap and boots and give ur wardrob some colour and you should be good to go



Good luck xxx

My son and his baggy jeans help required?



Ive opted to get these for my son as hes into this style of jeans

http://www.violentdelights.co.uk/items/t...

My son has only been into this style for a short time but hes unsure as to wear the jeans are supposed to sit. I finally got round to asking him about his new found style. He said that hes going to have to get some  boxershorts and wear his jeans under his hips as it were so the waist band of the jeans (and belt loops) sits around his bum as it were (not under it). I dont think people will see his boxer shorts because he says that his 'hoody' or t shirt will keep them covered.

Is this the style in which these jeans have to be worn? He seems to think so. Thanks.

he always is trying to be "gangster" i personally despise this style (if it can be called that) this isn't the style in which jeans have to be worn..jeans are meant to sit on the waist not the butt..but it's a phase that a lot of my male friends also went through and as he matures he will realize it's a stupid style and will want to change his dressing style himself...u can help him change his mind along the way to make the process go faster if you want but at the end he'll do what he wants to and what his friends do because that's how most kids think. hope i helped. :)

Baggy jeans used to be the style but they definently arent now. Im 16 years old and im very fashion forward and i know for a fact that baggy jeans and big clothes are out of style, all of the rappers and young men are wearing more fitted clothes because it looks better and cleaner and more put together. Whats in now for the boys are jeans and shirts that are their correct size. Even my brother wears clothes his size now and he is a thug so trust me, tell your son that he is definently out of style with his baggy jeans, maybe he should go for a more fitted put together look, like a nice pair of jeans, a polo, some nice sneakers and a baseball cap to match and he will be in style most definently.

I want to be an emo, how? ?



I am a preppy guy and i think emos are hot and i wana be one and im not like all other wannabemos cos i do have problems, for example every few months my parents will argue and this upsets me - they always forget about this instantly and go back to normal but every time they squabble scars me so that kinda makes me more emo than most emos cos i got real problems.
so how do i become an emo? what is the best kind of eyeliner and where should i get my clothes cos i looked all over new look but they didnt have any black stuff or razor blades

p.s. what is a good way to fake cutting urself cos i know if ur emo u have to cut urself but i did it once and it hurt so how can i fake it?

Poser. Just be yourself. Everyone gets into fights with their parents, but it doesn't mean you have to be emo. Don't label yourself.

You can get emo-ish clothes from Pac Sun, Hot Topic for sure!  Get a guy scene-ish haircut.  For cuts, you odn't HAVE to cut yourself. THats what everyone says that emos cut themseleves, but if you fake it and people catch you they'll think your just a wanna be, and i'm sure you don't want htta happening to you..

WHATHHHHA! seriously ; you don't just become emo
out of the blue. i mean everybody has problems at
home with their parents. also i don't think there is any
possible way to "fake" cut yourself. how about you 
just stick to being preppy as you so call it. once again
emo is a state of mind not something that you just 
become becasue your having harsh problems. last 
i think girls will find you more attractive if you don't
become emo.

uhh WOW.

You cant fake cut yourself.. and EMOS DO IT CAUSE IT HURTS. SO if people find ot you are faking cutting youself, you wont be an emo, you will be a FAKE. No not a fake emo, a FAKE.

Uhh wear black.. Do the EMOish hair, and yeah. You'll be good. And if people queistion the cutting, say you cut your legs [even if you dont]. and wear tight pants so if they wanna see, you just say that you cant roll them up high enough to show the cuts..

You are trying way too hard.
And just because you cut yourself doesn't make you emo.
Just because it hurts that your parents argue, doesn't make you emo, 
either. You need to be yourself and stop trying so hard to be 'emo'.
No one likes posers.

I seriously hope this isn't a real question. Just look up emo fashion styles online or something. Don't fake cut your wrists. It's not cool in the slightest. Haha, there's no cutting yourself competition...that's freaky and a bad stereotype that comes with that whole image. Plus, EVERYONE HAS PROBLEMS!!! Just because you have them doesn't mean you should turn into an emo and all. It's stupid.

Oh wow, get a life.  You don't have problems, parents argue all the time.  Try living with a single mom.  Try living in a country that is in a constant state of terror.  Try being an orphan.  Try being a refugee.  Try living below the poverty line.  Try having a mom who might be suffering from depression.  At least you know who both your parents are.  I suggest you take a real hard look at the world you live in, because compared to a lot of people you are in freaking heaven.

Here are the rules to being emo.
1. Listen to softcore punk music that integrates unenthusiastic melodramatic 17 year olds who dont smile, high pitched overwrought lyrics and inaudible guitar rifts.
2. Start wearing tight wool sweaters, tighter jeans, itchy scarfs (even in the summer), ripped chucks with favorite bands signature, black square rimmed glasses.
3. And for hair, ebony greasy unwashed hair that is required to cover at least 3/5 of the face at an angle.
And talk/write poetry about pain, and call everyone who isn't emo, conformists.

my god, how old are you?!
people have far worse problems than their parents arguing my dear.

but to answer your question:
any kind of eyeliner will do. try the internet for the best clothes, i don't know where you live so i can't point out where you should shop.
and i sincerely don't know a good fake way of cutting yourself.
cutting is not a way of being "emo" it's a way of punishing yourself.
and its MEANT TO HURT. thats why people do it.

my advice is, don't bother angel.
in a few months you'll be wondering what you were thinking.
wear what you like.

i know this from going through various stages and now i wear what i like and the point is i have the confidence to not care what anyone else thinks. i like it so who cares?

ok jus to let u know not all emo people cut theirselfs. My parents fight all the time too I try not to let it get to me. Try being yourself and don't cut yourself. You Are just hurting yourself which isn't necessary. But if you really want to try getting some black hair dye. U can get eyeliner pretty much in every drug store. Just get some black skinny jeans a black shirt etc. Dark colors I guess. You can't just be emo, you have to have it as a lifestyle. Good luck with your life and you can email me if you want to talk or what's ever man and you should really chill out cuz preppy guys usually get all the girls

<question>



Mastectomy Lingerie - opinions please?



I am considering designing a line of post mastectomy lingerie and swimwear and am curious as to what potential customers would want from these items of clothing.

Underwear for example - large bra straps? maybe a more feminine/possibly sexier design than what's available on the current market?

Swimwear - modest and block colours? or maybe a tankini style with bright bold patterns?

I believe women should still want to feel confident and stylish in their underwear after all they've been through with cancer. 
So ladies, what do you think? Please tell me what you'd look for and what you'd love to see in a design for the perfect post mastectomy swimwear/lingerie!
Thank you.

This is a great idea!  Maybe if there was a way where you could make it look like they didn't even have the procedure?  I like your ideas and everyone deserves to have sexy underwear and lingerie.

I don't think women would need or want large straps - after all, large straps aren't pretty. But they're necessary for support! But if you don't have boobs, you don't need support, and you are freed from the big, ugly straps!

I'm sure that they'd want a pocket in there to stick their prosthetics in.

Hi. I've had a mastectomy myself, and I answered this question when you asked it in the Cancer section.

Just had another thought though - I don't know why it wasn't my first thought since it bugs me so much.

When you produce your catalogue please, PLEASE have women who have actually had breast surgery  modeling the bras and swimwear. No existing catalogue does that, the products are shown on professional models with all breasts present and correct, usually with visible cleavage.

It would mean you couldn't use professional models of course, but so much the better - this way you'd have real women of all shapes, sizes and ages showing what the garments would actually look like. And I'd be your first customer!

And... you or someone else might like to consider designing outer garments for women who've had breast surgery. Me, I live in T shirts - not because I want to but because my surgery means that on my right I'm concave from a couple of inches below the collarbone. And in common with many, I have scarring which extends to my underarm and back. And I want all that to be hidden. But on my left side - same as it ever was! There's got to be a party dress waiting to be designed for me!

The ideas are good and what i have seen so far seems ok. I have to say i don't like the wallpaper on the homepage before you go into the actual site, but then that is personal preference. 
You need to have something that will catch the eye, it has a tendancy to be a bit wishy washy. I like the "Style Me" page a lot. Remember to always keep things clean and sharp as if you have too much going on the reader gets distracted and this can put people off. I also find, clean, easy to read pages often have more impact than ones that are crammed full. Good work and good luck with the future of it.

Of course you can wear dresses on holiday!!!! You definitely won't be the only person wearing one seeing as it's quite hot in Greece. You should just wear whatever you feel comfortable in. =]

Where could I get a skirt like this from? (music video)?



I absolutely adore the skirt that actress Amrita Rao is wearing in this Bollywood song. I love the way it's well fitted at the top, and frilled at the bottom. Where could I get a skirt similar to this/ which shop?

I can't find the trainers I want! HELP!!!?



I've seen a D&G pair of skater type trainers that I like and I can't find them anywhere. Not a specific pair - just the skater-y type ones. They're really wide, worn with loose laces and have really random patterns on them. I have searched the internet for Gawd knows how long, and I can't find anything resembling them.
Any ideas??

If you have an old pair of jeans that you don't like anymore or are too short at the bottom, then you could cut them at the knee, Thats what my brother did to all of his jeans since he didn't have any shorts this summer. =]

wear jeans and a t-shirt and pick up a pair of $3 flip flops at Old Navy- you'll fit in
you could get shorts there right now for like $10 if you really want to splurge lol
Don't cut off your jeans like these people are saying- j-horts (jean shorts) are aweful- so unstylish & 80's redneck- ish.  Rolling them up would be more acceptable

Well if you're left with no choice, you're probably going to end up wearing the t-shirt and jeans tomorrow. But don't worry, there's no such thing as looking "normal" anymore and I've seen many people at the beach with jeans on.

But... I'm sure there's shops by the beach where you could get some swim shorts.

Well, Substitute with Boxers, or borrow something from a friend. if you have 10 bucks, dash over to walmart. If that is all the clothes you have on short notice, just walk around with no shirt, some shades, bare feet and if its hot, take a dip. you MAY fit in better if ppl see you wet. they might guess the situation. but if you're just walking around in jeans, you may look silly.

Hi GG,

It has to be dress no.2. because with your dark features the green dress will not flatter you. The colour of dress 2 will sparkle against your dark hair, eyes and medium complexion. Go for it!

its not that bad if your bra does show. but it is way better if it does not. you should get a strapless bra that way none of your straps show. you still get to wear your bra. but its not the worse thing if someone can see the straps on your bra. i hope this helps.

I thoroughly disapprove of this kind of thing, it is a practise we must stamp down on.  The public display of brassier straps is indicative of the general lowering of moral standards today.  You should wear a substantial vest.

Lane Bryant makes a strapless bra with a clear back strap.  It is called the Bra6.  It has four hooks on each side but has a clear back so you can't see your bra with the dress you want to wear.  The bra is great for women with larger breasts.

I think that showing your bra is tacky.
Try the "Nu Bra", it comes in all cup sizes and can be found in most department sizes.

Basically they are sticky cups that support you while making sure no one sees the bra! :)

it's a question of style...

see, generally, with a low cut back you should either wear a strapless bra or one with transparent straps or none at all.

if you have to wear a bra, you could get one of those you can wear very low. anyway, choose at least one that looks good (perhaps lace?). a cheap looking or an old bra are absolutely no go's.

try strap less
and that should be fine if it does its really nothing you can do about that
so just try your best to make it look the best an hopefully it will look fine

but if it really bothers you, then you can find a whole bunch of different kinds of bras so just go look around and see youll probably find one that matches your dress , but it might be a lil pricey

I think it does look bad and ruins the look completely. I would suggest a strapless bra or better still insert bra cups into the dress itself. You can also get underwear that has see through straps that cannot be noticed as much.
Good luck

well what do you normally wear when you go and see them?

personally if i were to go to a sleepover i would wear either jeans and a rib top with cute flats and bag of matching colour and my hair in plait or comfy tainers, joggers and a tee with hair in ponytail but twisted up again so looks somewhat like a bun. natural look makeup such as a slick of eyeshadow mascara and lipgloss and off i go, collecting a comfy pair of either shorts or plain pj bottoms and a strap top with some flip flops or slippers.

Its a good website which is also affordable.

For flip-flops:

They also have designer brands.

If you live in Scotland and it is cold, wear these clothes when you go to the beach.

I don't know what you look like or what your personality is but I'll give it a shot. You'll probably be a dress that expresses your personality and attitude. For example, you're wild and bubbly, then it would be a knee-length dress with tons of wonderful and bright colors and cut in a stylish way. But if you're prim and propper it would be slightly below the knees with one bold color. But if you're quite popular and always the center of attention, you'd be a dress slightly above the knees in just one bright color but decorated with a lot of glitter and sequince. Hope this helps!

Replica Or The Real Thing?



I am looking for a watch, particularly a Hublot Big Bang. The real one is around £7000 yet I can get a replica, with a Swiss ETA 7750 Movement, for £450. I have ordered watches from the guy with the £450 Hublot before and his watches really are IDENTICAL to the real thing, even down to the boxes & warranty etc.
Would I be daft to pay £7000 for a watch, when I could buy the same watch (visually) for just £450, and noone but me would know it wasn't genuine.
Advise please....

None of the above. I wouldn't pay $400 or $7000 for a watch and nothing in between. Replicas are bad. They support terrorist grous, child labor and tons of other



stuff. Get a nice $200  watch such as these:

Question about Brooke Davis from One Tree Hill!



I don't expect a lot of people to remember, but in the episode where it's senior year & a former friend, Jimmy Edwards, brings a gun to school, does anyone remember the jacket she wore? I saw it on tv a couple of days ago and fell in love with it! If anyone is familiar with it can you please tell me where it's from or where I can find a similar one? Any help is appreciated!

I think you look trashy and like a huge wannabe. (Like I am the next Paris Hilton) Sorry, but the overbleached hair, huge sunglasses (indoors), the pale lipstick and the white top makes it look like you are trying to be hot, sexy and classy at the same time. It just comes across as trash. If I would be your age and see you at the street I'd be like 'What a *****' I don't know you, but it just comes across like that. 
You look like a million other girls, there is not much style 'visible' on this pic and overall it just looks pathetic. Wearing glasses that hide half your face, are you ugly or something? To scared to look people in the eye?

If you are comfortable like this than thats fine, but I personally don't like it.

Edit:
I received this message from the question-asker:

From: ~*Dancing Diva*~

Subject: Ur lame *** comments!

Message: Ur a total *****!!
I only asked a simple question about my STYLE as in clothes, not my APPEARENCE!
If you can't answer a question nicely or at least appropiately then don't fuckin answer at all! And you're right you don't know me, but i certainly know ur kind!!



So here is my answer:

Dear *Dancing Diva* (interesting name)
You asked what I thought of you style, and I said I thought that it was trashy. You asked us to be honest. If you wuld have asked to lie, I would have done that.
 I also said I don't know you, but now I have the feeling that you don't just look trashy, you also are trashy. Sorry, you asked and you got an answer. In your life you will have to cope with critisism and with people who judge you on your appearances and 'style'. Not everyone likes the way I walk around and thats okay, because I feel comfortable they way I look and dress. However, I also expect people not to judge me on how I dress and on a single comment I made, when asked about an honest answer. So please, don't do that.
Also, judging from the thumbs up I got, I suppose many share my opnion and my comment can not have been that lame. Don't get insulting, it does not favourably add to your *style*.
regards

PS: I can't be jealous about someone who is scared to show their face. I can only pity them.

well my advice is you can't see they had them around spring where i live. they were everywhere in the mall. plus, now you will find cardigans with full sleeve because of fall coming. but hey, you could by a long sleeve and cut off the sleeves or have professionally done at a tailor so it looks like you bought it.

Tryu ebay. I just searched sleeveless cardigan, but it came up with nothing. Try Urban outfitters and maybe even a Thrift shop. Then just go to a tailer and ask them to shorten the sleeves for you. It will probably be a lot cheaper then just buying one from a good store. Try salvation army of goodwill. Any second hand store should do the trick.

I've got to agree with the first person and make you aware that you are going to sit in the dark, in silence for a few hours.  It's not like you're going to a party.  Most people just wear jeans and a jumper if it's cold or a t-shirt if it's warm

In all honesty, I respect people who live for music and being unique - rock on. But, seriously, it looks like you're trying too hard to fit a certain stereotype. I'm not trying to be rude, but sometimes it's really obvious when people are...how you say...posers. I'd drop the pants and get a pair of jeans. I think it would look better and dress it down a notch.

I like the shoes.

But really, unless you are 15 or under, you will look silly wearing this all at once. Try taking one piece of this clothing and wearing it with more mainstream gear. Example; wear the jeans with a plain black or grey shirt. Too much going on all at once is bad, especially if you are over 15.

I like that kind of thing too... but there's goth. And then there's goth.

I don't think the shoes go to well with the rest of it and the T and hoody would be too much together as they're both elaborately patterned.



Having said that, I like all the individual things (shoes included) other than the T and the black and white trousers.

I had a friend who went through a goth phase years back and she looked like a walking Time Bomb (Hot Topic, I guess? - TIme Bomb is a UK shop) catalogue!

I'd suggest black Converses/Vans/Etnies/TUK/Underground/Ne... Rock/DC Shoes/Quiksilver/Billabong/Ripcurl shoes would be good, maybe with a hint of red and/or yellow (or whatever other colour you like).

As for the top, wear a plain black or dark (red/purple/blue/whatever other colour you like) top.

I don't agree with labelling, but scene is about neon and 80-s and 90s details everywhere... which this outfit isn't.

But it's your life - wear what you like.

I hope some of this is remotely helpful

I think that style is really "in" nowadays (am I wrong? hopefully I am haha) so you're not going to be coming off as unique but rather a poser. If that's okay with you, go ahead.
Meanwhile, I'm not sure if it'll all go together or what, but I guess you can try.
I want to mention, though, that you should just get your own style. My personality would probably fit into the "gothic" label or whatever and I do wear a lot of black and wristbands or whatever, but I wear plaid vests and Doc Martens, plaid gray pants and a few dress shirts and ties. The only thing that I could say would even get close to "gothic" would be my ripped jeans and my (lack of) color pallete. But, anyway, good luck. Hope you find yourself.

the shoes are okay, but if you must have skulls and flames pic either the hoodie or the t shirt, both is a bit too much. maybe wear the hoodie with a white shirt or the t shirt with no hoodie. and i am sorry, but those huge pants aren't flattering on any body. if you want it to be punky, i would suggest dark skinny jeans. they will flatter you figure but work with the outfit. however, if you go with skinny jeans, i would get different shoes.

let me just say this about that, okay? Goth isn't a bad style. But what you chose there, does not match anything. The shoes, the pants. The shirts. the hoodies. the belt. And, um, may I just say. That first pair of pants was... incredibly uncanny.

you defiantly have to do layered curtains, like a base material then a sheer material like organza to drape over it!



a;s you could get some of those coloured lamptons, and put tealights in them.http://mypartystartshere.com/library/311...

that sounds perfect 
just keep the canopies very bright colors and sheer
get tons and tons of throw pillows and put some of them on the ground for a seating area
also try making your bed like a 4 poster bed without the posts by pinning several long sheer fabric valances on your ceiling in a square and let the ends hang down from the ceiling to the floor on the 4 corners of your bed
very very cool idea btw =]

When am I supposed to stop shopping in the juniors section and start shopping in the misses, or women's?



First off, I just turned 24.

The spokespeople they have for the juniors section look so young to me, and I feel kind of weird being in the juniors' section. The clothing often seems juvenile to me. But at the same time, I am tall and slender, so I fit into juniors' clothing better.

The clothes in the misses and women's sections look so "mom-like" to me, and I have trouble selecting clothes from these sections. I have yet to find good fitting jeans here either...

I'm also uncomfortable about the sizing differences (juniors being odd numbers, and the others are even).

Help!

if its comfortable, and fits well, then wear it!! i too have to shop in the junior section, and im 23. im short, and they fit better, because they have the low rise..im sure the misses section have them too, but i agree with you, about they look so mom like....and i am a mom...but that doesnt mean i have to give up looking the way society wants me to look. i wear baggy jeans, and spagetti straps, and dye my hair crazy colors. so dont worry so much about what ppl think, and jus wear what feels comfortable to you.

hmm,,,, about 4 years ago. you don't have to shop i the misses sections but you should not be shopping in juniors either I'm guessing
you only shop at major department stores who only sell "mom-like" clothes for women try shopping in the mall stores like.

if you REALLY hate internet shopping, go to "make your own t-shirt shops" tho you may have to colour in the superman label differently for copy right laws. otherwise i doubt you will find one in a high street shop.

I think you mean 925 and that is its purity. The other marks would be the hall mark and maker. Silver is trading at about £6.50-7 an ounce and you are better off selling it on ebay as those figures are the best a jeweller will pay.

I've never thought of leotards as forbiddable material, but you could order one online if you have your own credit card, or you could get a friend to do it. Also there are dance supply stores that carry them - I'd google for a store near you, then sneak out and get it. Or get a friend to get it. Good luck!

Go, and buy one when you and your friends are at the mall.

Or get one online using your aunt or uncles' Credit Card (with their permission) and get it shipped at thier house, go get it there.

I totally dig how you are concerned about the whole fashion date to date. Nowadays mst people dont wear them but if it's your own touch then spice it up a bit. Roll them up at the bottoms into cuffs or just leave then how they are. Go for it. You may make a new trend and have everyone want to get back into them. They're so HOTT!

Sure, they are pretty in style right now.

The main question is how flattering they are. Skinny jeans usually tend to look best on skinny people, especially skinny people with a bit of height.

Even a slight amount of hip or butt can look large in tight, skinny jeans, and flare or boot cut is much better for balancing out your curves, if you have them. If you must go with skinny jeans, but are not rail thing, stick to dark denim, be it deep blue, black or a dark grey.

As for the spare clothes, theres a massive dryer you stand in next to Storm Force 10 that will dry you off in a few minutes so you wont need them.

you could take skinny jeans, t shirt and cardi or something along those lines, then again if you get wet, you might not be the most comfortable in skinny jeans cos they might stick to your legs! so you could wear a mini skirt with leggings? and any random top

god do not take jeans! They don't dry for about 4 hours haha! In my opinion, the best thing to wear on your bottom half is a pair of shorts, especially if the weather's warm(ish)- your legs'll dry quicker that way. Also jacket-wise (if it's a bit cold), if you haven't got a water-proof jacket like myself i always take a leather jacket; the water literally just bounces off it.

nope. slightly out of my budget :)

I generally spend between 10-20 pounds on a pair of earrings. I like to be sure that they're not about to break, but I'm not going to spend a large amount of money ($2000) on some really nice earrings. On the other hand I have been eying up a pair of onyx studs. Way to pricy tho :(

I guess if they were a present (like anyone would spend that money on me) I would take them. but otherwise it's a no.

They're boyfriend tees. They're supposed to be a little big. Like when you wear your boyfriend's shirt and it's kinda baggy. That's the whole idea.

yaa i had that problem 2 but no matter what you do it wont help the fit @ all. so just give up. mine is @ the bottom of my dresser. im never going 2 buy an ae tee again. so go 2 abercrombie or hollister. their tees fit better. but juicy couture's tees fit the best. i still fit the kids' tees bcause im still 12.

English insipred shirts (with that cute poof in the front and puffy sleeves.) A button-down shirt, preferably with a tie/bow. Skinny or boot cut jeans would look nice, blending in with the whole androgynous color-scale. (So maybe some dark washed, even black or grey denim colored jeans.)

As for shoes... Since the colors most likely are dark, you could wear bright shoes, whether they be flats or high heels.



Hope this helps!

i think it would be ok if you wear a nice pair of jeans. NICE PAIR. which means, no wholes or rips or anything.



go for a dark skinny jean. with either high pumps, or NICE DRESSY flats.

and either a dressy top, or like a really nice blazer, with a simple top under. look at banana republic, H&M, Express, Forever 21, Urban Outfitter.



if you want to go dressy, get a simple dress pants, nothing that makes you look to old. look at express clothes, and H&M

that is preppy, but so am I, I love being preppy!!!  The truth also is that guys look incredibly hot if they shop at abercrombie, just preps in general!!!  But if you do find it a problem, then there are a few things you can do, you can stop buying polos from like AE and A&F and Ralph Lauren, and try maybe Aeropostale...  See the thing is that Aeropostale is like not as brand name nameish, and preps, are sorta brand nameish, so i mean you can still dress however you want to.



Like look it's almost the same polo at AE, but it is from Aero

Yeah you do slightly,
If you want to be a little less preppy,
try to reduce the amount of brand names you wear,
and just shop for nice clothing.
If you like how you dress now,
just dismiss what they say. (:

It's perfectly safe since they're only contacts. Just remember to put the contacts in the correct eyes and make sure they are both the perscription you need. Talk to your eye doctor and tell them you would like one green and one blue and they can set it up for you. I have naturally two different colored eyes, it's called heterochromia: http://i29.tinypic.com/i607qx.jpg%22

Depends on if you want it that way. i've done the exact thing before & i'll admit it lookt kinda awkward, but i didn't care what others thot so it didn't bother me. i eventually put in both blue contacts and realized it lookt a lot better that way. It's up to you. But the different shades of colors will make a difference too. If u haver a dark blue contact with a light green contact it'll look horrible.

you have to make sure though, to have the correct size of contacts in each eye. More than likely, one eye is a different size than another, go see your optometrist to get the sizes, once you get the sizes go and buy all the color eye contacts you want! and yea, wash your hands :)

You may be able to dye the dress but it depends on what fabric it's made of - natural fibres absorb dyes much better than synthetics, so if it's a man-made fabric you may not get the colour that you want.

Finding a dye shouldn't be too difficult. We suggest that you head for Woolworth's, Robert Dyas or John Lewis. Most of them are very easy to use, you'll just need to buy some salt (which will help fix the dye to the fabric) and put everything into the washing machine. Bear in mind when you're choosing the colour though that your dress is yellow not white. That means that the colours will mix together and you'll end up with a very different shade to that on the box.

i would say:

black or grey pair of pants/slacks/trousers
a nice blouse, maybe favourite colour.
nice pair of flats..

or if your a skirt girl, you could wear a skirt, or a 'long' high waisted skirt (by long i mean one that atleast touches your knees)



have fun at the work experience :)

How can you "used to know" someone.  I mean once you know then, unless you get amnesia, you still know them.  As for the dog poop, he's probably doing it to annoy you.

Perhaps it's something to do with one of those old superstitions. It's apparently lucky if you step in dog poo, but only if you do it by accident...

<question>



Which tote bag should I buy for school?



I really like these 4 totes, but I can't choose! Help me..please?

Tote 1:
$39.50
http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...
$39.50 (One in stripes..I don't like the solid color ones, they have open pockets.
I like it, but I don't like how it's $40. And I'm not sure if it has pockets, WHICH I NEED. I need to carry around an iPod Touch, and also a chocolate phone..so I need some pockets, I don't need them any more scratched than they are now. I want some money left over, to buy something else. I got $50 left from my stepsister.

Tote 2:
http://www.abercrombiekids.com/webapp/wc...
I REALLY like this one, because it has the zipper thing, that can hold my stuff. I don't like the light colors, so I'd get the blue or the navy. But once again, I'd like to buy something with the money left over, and there won't be if I buy this!



Tote 3-
http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp...
I like this one, and it seems pretty big...I like how I'd have $20 left over too, but I don't know if it has pockets...but it does mention two 'credit card holders'....wtf?



Tote 4:
http://www.ae.com/web/browse/product.jsp...
$29.50

I like this one, but its not my first choice. I'd rather get one of the other three...this one is a 'backup'. It has a zipper inside...which I like.

Which one should I buy?



</question>



<additional details>



If it helps any, I want to kind of "stay away" from american eagle because about 90% of my clothes are american eagle...and I didn't do it on purpose...lol.



"katiepie"- nobody is original. K'? I don't care if someone has the same bag, if i like it, then i'll get it!

I like the first one. If it doesn't have a pocket, you can always get crafty and sew one in! Or just get a little drawstring bad and safety-pin it to the inside.

i wouldnt buy numbers 4 or 2 because they are light colors and will get dirty very easy...
ive actually considered gettin numbers 1 and 3 for school
i think numer 1 is the best choice. its super cute and practical. plus you its easier to open cause you dont have the drawstring like you do on number 3

Get the Abercrombie one. You need to check the measurements on these bags. Some of these totes do a poor job in holding all your books. I hate my books sticking out.

I wouldn't get any.
It is a popular brand in when the first day of school starts a lot of people will have it and that won't make you unique.

I would go to www.wetseal.com or www.forever21.com they have cute things that you don't see around at a REASONABLE price.

You could always try eBay for lots of fun, cheap stuff. They also have brand-name items at fractions of the original price. And no, not all the items are used yard-sale goods. As a matter a fact, eBay is connected with many online retailers. But if you're buying clothes from any online retailer, make sure to measure your size and also check out sizing charts. I hope this helps you!

waaay too pink for my taste

but if you're going to wear those shoes, it's better to stay simple. dark denim jeans or black pants could go with it, & possibly a bright pink, orange, OR green neon t-shirt. :]
maybe like this:

http://www.wetseal.com/assets/ws/product...

http://www.forever21.com/images/large/46...

http://images.journeys.com/images/produc...

or if you really want to wear that shirt, then... you could try daaark demin jeans with converses or vans.

i definitely like the first ones the best



there are a bunch of people that like and have the second ones
but i just don't think they look that great

the third ones are cute too
but i wouldn't wear them too often

pants:http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...

shirt:http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...

vest:http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...

they'd also work with these shoes

nah, they don't. They like you to show some skin sometimes, like with a halter or short shorts. Also, they love labelled things, like when a shirt says "hollister" or "american eagle", instead of trying to guess whether you got that shirt at the Good Will, or its supposed to look like thaat

i'm sure you already know that who you are is a lot more important than how to dress when it comes to boys (and life in general). that being said, a lot of the straight edge dudes i know typically don't go for rocker chicks. but i do know from my experience with alternaboys that they really don't give a crap what you dress like, as long as it's legit to your personal style.

Guys will like you for being yourself.  The ones that want you to "show some skin" are only looking use you.



if your signature look is who you are, that's the way to be.  although it doesn't hurt if you can find some more feminine type clothes if you're going out some place nice or to a dance or something.  It reminds the boys that you're a girl if you can be glamorous in more ways than one.

Depends on the guy.  If you have reason to think that he likes that kind of music then maybe he would like that.  Or if a guy liked music in general it might show that you aren't just into the latest fad or the latest one hit wonder.



But for me personally, probably not.  I guess the most important thing is just be yourself, wear what feels comfortable and natural to you.  If you just be yourself, then you will attract the guy that likes you and not some false image of you.

it depends where you bought them from and how much you bought them for.  if you bought them on e bay for around 100 dollars than they're fake!!! however there are some e bay sellers that have authentic jordan shoes but the jordan 11's are usually priced around 400-500 dollars...depending on the condition,color, and size..don't be fooled by having an authentic shoe box and card that comes with the shoes because it is not hard to make those.

They are both really cute. I think it depends entirely on your body though. If you are tall and skinny, the first one, but if you have more curves, the second one. Just an opinion.

The second one. I think it's really a great shpae because it has the ruching affect and the frills at the side are so in with this seasons must have trend of ruffles, frills and anything feminine, it was seen at so many designers on their spring summer catwalks. Such as lanvin, stella mcCartney and many more.

The colour is great as it packs a real punch and is so summery, fitting in with this seasons trend of brights.

The first one in coral! I love that! Make sure it goes with your skin tone though. It's light and summery and I love the ties in the front. I don't like the second one as much. I just don't like the poof thing, but its a beautiful dress.

I think the first 1 looks better but in my opinion I think it would look really nice if you wore a white dress- but not too hot - like the second dress in this pic:

The yellow one is very pretty and perhaps a little more wedding'y than the fuschia dress.. but go for the one you will wear again and you like. Perhaps order them both and see what the look like on.. things look different when we see them on ourselves. Also, remember to consider accessories... choose the dress which you know what you want to wear with it and whether your gona have to go out and buy matching things!

Have a wonderful day at the wedding =) Am sure you will look brilliant in either dress.

I like the coral in no. 1 (I think the lemon is a little dull and that no.2 doesn't quite look special enough for a wedding).
Before you make a decision why don't you have a look at this coast page, a lot are in the sale.

I want to become a fashion designer BUT..(advice needed!)?



I am 16 years old, and i'm very sure that i want to head into Fashion for a career. Problem is, on the island I live, there are no fashion institutes or any Magazine outlets [Vogue, Teen Vogue, Elle] that I could work for in the near future [as an intern, for example]. So since I am going to college and going to study art with other subjects as well, could anyone help me with what I can do after? Do I need to leave my country for sure to succeed in becoming what I want? The closest fashion school near my that I can think of is in Italy which is still a pretty far away place from where I live.

get a load and sell your clothes on the internet first.. I'm pretty sure vogue would want someone who's clothes can actually sell from experience.. also maybe you should aim a little lower first? maybe topshop, new look, primark?

If you want to become a Fashion designer, then I suggest instead of going to college and studying art, you should go to a college that specialises in art and study Fashion design, fashion design and manufacturing etc. With the qualifications it wll be a lot easier to find and do an intern-ship, and some colleges even offer guaranteed placements at various places after studying there. You could go on to working for various designers, or even just designing for retail outlets, such as H&M and TopShop.

Keep in mind to do this you will need to get good grades in both Art and English especially, and make a portfolio. Most importantly you've got to be good at sewing and would start making clothes now.

You also said that you would like to work as an intern at Vogue, Elle etc. I'm going to tell you now, that this would not be the kind of intern you would want to do if you want to be a Fashion designer. They would not have opportunities for you to design clothes.



However, you may want to study fashion journalism, fashion photography or even styling at college, and these courses would be what hi fashion magazine would want to see when picking an intern. This is aming very high, but don't get your hopes up (:

Oh and I think you would have to move if you wanted to go to a good fashion institute.

I like the contrast and rich color. I adore the plunging neck line. I'm not so sure about the "ruffles" personally, but I am sure someone can pull it off.

I would go Blue for a guy But green would be even better if they have it. Would so a fun side of you. red gets old and boring look at all the people who went through the red cell phone phase and got bored.. black is classic. but in reality we are talking laptop are you using it for work or just fun. because for work I would go classic  more professional fun or school blue or dark kelly green would be fun..

I like both too for you. Both will show the same amount of scratches and damage, but I feel like the red stands out and looks a bit more unique. It will stand out against the rest of your things and might be a conversation piece.

**ALSO--consider the other color changes! The red notebook has a black keyboard with silver detail. The blue notebook has all silver.

if you know the colour coordination of it all, then stick with it, if it is blue for instance, nice blue pants, preferably not jeans, nice blue top, shirt, blue shoes, high heels if preferred, and so on.

I have the same issue with a wedding I have to go to in Oct.!  Fortunately, I have a very nice pants suit, it's a little too dressy for work, and with the right accessories will look just fine for a wedding.  Look for something similar in your local stores, make sure you ask yourself, if you would wear it to work, then it's probably not dressy enough if you would.  Don't forget to accessorize, that will lift anything you wear.

something tidy and that fits the occasion - hot pants at a gay wedding is fine, but a woman dressed in a smart trouser/jacket outfit is most suitable for a wedding ( unless the bride is screaming for a dress - in that case, a blue demin boiler suit... lol.. j/k)

Dress nice, dress comfortable - try to get in the middle of those.

or if you are a guy, wear a dark blue sports jacket at least... lol  (oh, and undies)

I am not a "dressy" person either and normally for a wedding I would wear a nice pair of trousers and team it up with a corset top (for a bit of glam)

Saying that, I was at a wedding over the summer and broke with all tradition and wore a dress... I felt a bit weird at first but so many people kept telling me how lovely I looked I soon relaxed into it... so maybe shocking people can be a good thing.

I found some nice shorter/different style skirts but they were over £15.

For something under budget and shorter/more interesting try TK Maxx, H&M and Primark. They're all probably full of the kind of thing you're looking for.

If you were answering this question in an interview you would say something like:

You could talk about the enviornment and costumer service you've had before.

Wearing female clothes?



I'm finding the allure of female clothes ( skirts, tights, underwear ) more and more inviting and don't really want anyone to find out. Should i just try a pair of tights or panties on or try to forget the whole thing.

It's lucky there are very few females out there who like guys in fem clothes as i have always found it difficult to say no to any females and would probably end up doing something i'd regret

You're finding out who you are and what you like. I have no problem at all with that. Guys try shaving in unorthodox ways or in unorthodox places and they learn in an itchy way why the hair is there in the first place. These are just things that people do. When I'm on my 12-speed bicycle, I will sometimes pedal a little further than I have before just to see how my body will react the next day. I am experimenting and pushing myself a little to not just make myself stronger, but to determine my limits. Back before 1987, I drank too much. It nearly killed me. I quit. It has been 21 years now of no alcohol. I discovered it was no good for me at all. I stopped using it. You find all kinds of things out about yourself. It is good to experiment. Use your head and explore to your heart's content. I personally have never been moved in the direction which interests you, but I can tell you here in writing if you wanted to slip into something soft and comfortable and feminine it wouldn't bother me a bit because in my opinion, that is your business. That is between you and you. You may find you like some things and not like others. Like heels will be out while soft clothing will be in, like undergarments... everyone is different. I like clothing which is loose-fitting. That is because I move a lot and make quick movements and don't want to have my clothing confining me. How else can you really find out what you like until you give it a go?

It is all so low-key. No big deal. No fanfare of trumpets. Just grab the angora or the panties or silk or whatever. You will find out fairly quickly what you like and what doesn't work for you.



Then come hair styles. You will experiment there, too. You know, finding footwear that is right for you is yet another area of your life where it pays to get it right, so you have to try a lot of things which do not fit your feet right before you find the right footwear.

Then come friends. You try this person and that person, and finally you meet someone and the two of you "click."



Source(s):



I hope I have helped to relax you about the whole thing. It is so low-key... no major event, here... just have fun with it is what I would tell you if you were standing in front of the bed with a whole lavish wardrobe laid out before you, just waiting for you to start trying things on.

Sent to you with positive energies frm Chris in South Portland, Maine, U.S.A. I am 65, and all my life I reinvent myself every day. You have to be that aware of yourself to be of much use to others, as well. Stay current with yourself. Find what you like, leave what you do not care for far, far behind you. This is a recipe for a good life.

Just put them on..it's not gonna hurt anything. Besides, the fashion of our culture is starting to mix the genders anyway. If you go to Seattle, you'll see a ton of guys walking down the street in tight, girl pants. And just the other day I saw an article in the paper on the fashion industry selling pantyhose marketed to men now. Lots of men claim they like the added support. (and they do help circulation) But beware.. wearing pantyhose too often will squeeze everything together in there and cause you some abdominal discomfort. Doing it once in awhile won't hurt anything, though.

Try a whole outfit and wear it around the house at least for 5 hours, with heels and a bra. Believe me if you still like it after that period of time you are a sucker for punishment. I hate wearing all those clothes all day they dig in, fall down, creep up, and are so uncomfortable. But you'll never know til you try so go for it.

What should I wear? I'm thinking black mini dress. I'm not sure where to buy it from though! The budget is probably around $400 or $500 max. on the dress. Heels are covered, my mom will lend me a pair of her Diors.

Uhm... are you kidding. Mini dress? To the temple... or just the party... mini dress to a temple is a horrible horrible idea. Part, doesn't matter, if a dress is that big of a deal to you, i think you mine wanna get your priorities straight... what are you 13? 14? spending that much money on a dress that you'll fit in for a year or two... wow...



I honestly can say, at my bat mitzvah, i wanted no girl too out look me. But I think the most important thing was how much work I put into it... but its a boy... bar mitzvah... so who cares what you wear.

I am a black-shoe lover myself, but contrary to what most people say, you can in fact wear black and brown together because they are both neutrals. Keep in mind, khaki is another version of brown.  I personally think brown pants, a black shirt and belt, and black shoes look fine.  Not my favorite outfit, but it looks ok.  Now, on to your friend.
It is ok to wear brown shoes with black pants as long as you don't wear black socks, you do wear a black belt, and the shirt (or coat or both) have brown in them.

You see a lot of so called celebrities on TV doing it and to me they look awful. It probably ranks along with wearing a smart jacket and jeans with brown shoes. A lot of celebs do this as well. The top gear trio are notorious for this as to are the celebrity chefs.

Skinny jeans for petite girls?



I am 5ft2 and love skinny jeans, however the pairs I own all seem to be too long and gather at the end, despite being from the petite ranges in Topshop and Miss Selfridge. Does anyone know of anywhere from experience or heard of anywhere that sells good fitting skinny jeans for petite girls?

Ah, see when i first read your question i thought immediately 'Topshop' and 'Miss Selfridges' - to be honest thats the only place that you can go for a good pair of skinny jeans for petite girls. I'm considering getting them myself as the ones i get which are a 30" leg seem to be getting quite baggy on the leg.

Sorry i can't be more help :)

H&M girl skinny jeans are the best!
They have loads of different styles and colors.  Brought some earlier this year and they were £15.
I know you have already mentioned the petite range in Topshop, but I just brought some dark blue skinny jeans and they are so nice, I wear them all the time, but if your short on money I wouldn't buy them seeing as they are £30!

I have this problem too. I have to fold my black jeans up. 5ft 2 is still smaller than a normal petite right...that's how tall I am. I would say just fold them up or go to a tailor. They do really nice ones at different leg lengths in New Look and Topshop  but I buy jeans from Dorothy Perkins. I haven't bought any jeans from New Look or Topsop but give them a try before you buy. You have reminded me to buy a light blue pair for myself too. OOH....TRY TAMMY@BHS!!!

Hope I helped

Which of these pictures should I send to a modelling agency?



I am in contact with a modelign agency. They want 10 photos, NOT PROFESSIONAL ONES. "Home photos", they told me.
So, I have to choose 10 photos from my portfolio.

They want:
two best dressed
two with the best make up
two prettiest
two $luttiest
two innocent.

So, which of these photo fit the categories they told me?

This is my flickr album, with 63 photos in it (4 pages).

Can you tell me the number of photos for each category, and, if possible, the motivation beyond your choice?

Thanks!

$luttiest: none of them are that $lutty.
innocent: 31. && 24.

i used to model && heres a tip: most of your pics are all full body standing. you might want to get some just head shots, sitting, etc. modeling agencies want to see that you are versatile. the more different looks you give them the better.

hope that helps.

ok i'm 4'6 and i basically just get my pants from old navy...they are the ones that fit best and when they say short or petite they actually mean it. i still have to get them hemmed like 4 inches but that shouldn't be a problem for you since you are a little taller.

someone said get them hemmed but pants unless they are staight leg look stupid hemmed more than 5 inches and most place that say petite just use the same pattern and make the legs shorter. what you need is a place that makes a different pattern so the whole jean is porpotional.

I'm in the US, but theres jeans all over the place for short people.  In fact they are easier to find.  Even in clearance and sales, theres always the short jeans left.  Even though I'm only 5'5, I have long legs, and can only buy jeans that comes in different lengths (inseams) so that I can get the longest ones.

You go buy jeans with no certain length that is supposedly ok for any height, they are always too damn short.

If you ask me someone short has it easy to find jeans.  They make every size from tiny 0 to huge 18 in short lengths, so I really dont know whats the problem.

IF you are very very tiny and thin, little girls jeans could fit.

I don't have an answer for you, just sympathy. It isn't any better in the U.S. I'm the same height as you and all of the petite or short sizes drag and get stepped on when I'm barefooted or wearing flat sandals. If I wear shoes it is usually ok. 
I do wish the clothing industry would take notice that there are many petite women. Both of my grandmothers were shorter than me!

Added: Several people said "get it hemmed". For me that is not acceptable. There should be sizes right off the rack that fit. I shouldn't have to pay extra for tailoring and I really, really hate to fool with cutting and hemming. Just my rant.
(I think some idiot thinks it is funny to hit everyone with a thumbs down. I do wish some people would get a life.)

Do you mean the black, knee length, wool efforts with the turn-back collar and the split at the back; if so they are called Crombie coats or just Crombies. Genuine Crombie coats are very pricey though, and most of the ones worn by bouncers are cheap copies, but still called Crombies.

My Country Tweed Hat got half inched, where can I get a good replacement?



In respect of a surly set of travellers and their mono-browed-cyclop sprogglets as they clambered into a trough full of fodder and wares gathered by myself and fellow charitable workers from the village, namely buns, biscuits, butcher scraps and the like, I sang a wondrous Hymn in lew of the Harvest, "Harvest Dreams". Standing upright as my booming baritone was accompanied by happy slurpings and belchings, I saw from the corner of my eye a most peculiar thing. 
A huge Monster! Trampling through the fields gobbling up the livestock and going "Rrraaaaaaaaagggh!" Breathing fire it sent a farm up in flames! The inhabitants were running around going "Help! Help! My heads on fire!" 
Next thing, I was flummoxed to find myself faced with leering travellers. Having just ate their fill, they smirked, preened and fawned about the place laughing as I was subject to them taking it turns to wear my tweed hat pulling faces and smirking behind their grubby hands. One even did this affronty blowing a continual and spluttery raspberry and flapping his arms about like a squid with Elton John tip toeing behind it . .. but I understand through his Father's gestures he was a bit "Special".
Well. . . this smacks of the Supernatural thought I, as I drove away. Looking at the rear view mirror, they were all jumping about jabbering and still lauding my hat such as it was. Remarkable. Ah well, if it makes them happy who am I to deny them such pleasures eh?

VG, the molestation you suffer by monsters and tourists makes me grit my teeth. Caramba, is nothing sacred anymore? Not even the cap on a man's head? There's nought to do but to invest in a sturdy cloak with a practical hood attached. The cloaks with disappearing qualities are rather dear, and a pain to acquire unless you are in cohoots with a Wiccan, but you really should inquire about a dagger on discount, considering the many shifty hoodlums you encounter in broad daylight.

I had my beach bonnet snatched and mouthed to bits by the horrible werewolf that inhabits my kitchen. I'm taming him with cooked chicken and an old cotton cloche.

Converse chuck taylor sizing?



okay i know that all converse are mens sizing and that you go down two sizes for womens so normally in women's i am a size 8 so i would presumably get a size 6 in men's however i wasn't sure if they ran big or small additionally because if they ran small then i would probably get a size 6.5 in mens and if they ran big then a 5.5...any ideas?

Yes, you go down 2 sizes, but Chucks have women's sizing on (most of) them now...perhaps try on some women's at a store to figure out what fits. I usually wear a 9 in women's shoes and have always bought size 7 Chucks.

Where can I find a light blue blazer?



I need a light-blue blazer for a costume, where is the best place to find one? They only seem to come in dark colours like black, green, red and navy, and I can't find one in the shade I need.

I think it's going to be a matter of luck whether it's dept. store clearance racks, thrift stores, or consignment stores.  Then, too, "light blue" can cover a wide range of blues.  Good luck! Sometimes that will do it.

It's difficult to say without seeing you.

I am sure however, that your head is probably quite normal in size, and you are a good height for a boy.

If you check on the internet there are hairdressers who can take a photo of you put it on the computer and try different hairstyles, slightly longer, straight, curly etc, then you could see and get some help on what would look best for your face shape/head size:)

Liar. I got 30B from it too, but I usually wear 32A. That thing is messed up...go to a department store (like Macy's or Mervyns) or Victoria's Secret and get measure there. I'm sure it will be more accurate.

21 year old needing some wardrobe help?



I have a black suit (black pants, black jacket)...would that look weird wearing it to an event? It's not formal but women are wearing cocktail dresses and some guys have blazers. I don't have a sports coat though...Also, it's at a hotel with a rooftop bar / lounge area. What kind of shirt should I wear underneath? Or would a suit be too much? Should I just wear a nice shirt?

Yea. My guess is if there wearing Blazers to something not formal, then they are also wearing jeans. Hmm try something Longsleeved thats casual with jeans or slacks. w/e.

take something to get changed into also as clothes wet with beer dont feel good unless your too drunk to care.

Heels will make your legs look super-long
Converse or canvus pumps will look more rock-chick/emo
You could wear boots or uggs over the top in winer too

flats normally if you're going to school or something, but if you want to go for a little different look, wear converse.
flip-flops are tolerated by some, but its really up to you.
i wear flip-flops with skinny jeans during the summer.

Going on a student exchange to new york for 4 months over winter.....what to pack? and what to wear?



Hi there iam going on a student exchage trip to new york, from november through to febuary, i have heard that the weather can be really cold, i will be doing a lot of walking in the cold weather, which iam not looking forward to, i know it sounds silly but iam not a big fan of wearing huge coats and jackets so thinner items of clothes would be better, i dont have a clue what to pack and what to wear?, so a lot of help is needed, also you hints and tips for keeping warm would be helpful aswell. thanks

It is freezing there!! I live in Philadelphia so it's pretty close but its worse there. Bring jackets, sweaters, boots (uggs), gloves scarves. your going to freeze with thinner items.

Winter in NY is cold -- definitely need a warm coat, hat, gloves etc - there will probably be a few snow storms.



Mostly casual clothes - jeans, sweaters, T-shirts etc -- Students dress very casually. New Yorkers wear a lot of black, so you'll fit right in w/ that :-)  -- but on the other hand, you can dress as unique as you please, because nothing can be too crazy in NY city! There are some very unique characters there!



A few nice outfits - if you go to any nice restaurants, etc

Not sure where you're coming from, but try not to flip out about the skyscrapers -- that's a dead giveaway you're from out of town :-)



Have fun!! New York City is the city that never sleeps, so there's ALWAYS  something to do!

If condoms come in different sizes, why are there no changing rooms in Boots?



I think there should be a boot cut condom, skinny fit, hipster fit, straight. Maybe have them on coat hangers and attach little numbers to them, try them on, ask the retailer if they have them in a size seven, maybe take them back faulty if you have a reciept, get a refund.

Where could I buy a 80's prom dress?



Okay, so my best friend's sweet sixteen has a 80's prom theme (which is...sort of a let down considering some of her other ideas, but whatever), but I don't have anything to wear. All my mom's clothes from the 80's aren't dressy enough. I have no idea where I could buy one other than, like, ebay, but that won't work because her party is this Saturday so I don't have time to get a dress shipped to me. Do you know any store (like a pretty well-known store) that sells 80's dresses or maybe even a site that has rush shipping? Or could I make a dress somehow? I don't have a sewing machine, though...and I pretty much fail at that kind of thing.

Put it in some water. Or age...
Baking soda and water will brighten it once it gets too dull.
You can also try leaving it in the open for a while...

I didn't know about this till I read your question...excuse me while I go throw up...Listen, Im all for everyone getting theirs but to be so "in-your-face" with it while others are scrapping by...stock market falls nearly 500 pts..again, highest unemployment rate in years, and gas prices that are making some people pick between driving and eating meat...seriously.  I love Hova's music, I think he is one of the most gifted urban poet this side of Nas but it becomes clearer and clearer that top 40 rap music is completely out of touch with how most are living.  I don't care many r and b singers and rappers come from humble beginnings but how many years of living like a millionaire does it take before you forget what it was like to struggle and see those with money flaunt it...and how that made you feel...

Exactly, we aren't just bitching about Beyonce's profound lack of style, we are bitching about people who are soo out of touch. I have a master plan though! Lets make a wadded-up tampon Tiara and sell it to her for a cool $15 Million and then give all the money away to as many charities as we can!

My engagement ring, and most recently an anniverary band my husband just gave me to celebrate our 5 year anniversary.  if you were asking more specifically for what type of jewellery i like to wear more often, i prefer rings, then bracelets, then pendant and last earrings.

rings... they're definately my favorite!! i have this annoying knack of losing jewelry (well, necklaces at least) and i find that it's easier to not lose rings because they're on your finger and won't break off or anything like that :) plus they're pretty!!

more specifically though... i can't choose between three items... the first is this beautiful, heart-shaped locket with a red, heart-shaped garnet in the centre that my mom got for me for a matric dance.
and the next is this silver bracelet i got in colorado last year. i really love it!! and last is my white gold ring that my parents got me for my thirteenth birthday!!

hope i answered your question properly :)

Earrings cause you always have so many choices and cause they are easy to find and can be really practical.  Whenever i visit a new place I always make it a point to buy at least one pair of earrings there.

If you mean the short cropped sweaters or jackets that have short or long sleeves and only cover the shoulders and the upper part of the back, but not the front of the body, then that is called a 'shrug'.

The trick is to wear what is in fashion all right now...unlike other stores Top shop is like a fashion catwalk



You got to know like you know whats hot and whats not. so do your homework: browse shop windows, and look for the trends that suit you. the key is smart/causal and accessorizes (and something bright so you stand out/ but not to bright/ just like a top or an accessorize) for the interview.

when you get the job what to wear because your will be in the environment seeing the trends and then you can mix and match to your own taste



here is a little home work i did earlier....good luck

What are some good everyday shoes?



I need shoes that are leather. I want them to be cute, plain and comfortable so I can wear them everyday. I don't like ballet flats, exercise shoes  or skateboarder type shoes.
I have these http://www.cathyjeanshoes.com/5076.html already and would like something along the same line. Any ideas?

Thank you in advance. :)

there are tons of different colors and designs of converse all-stars & one-stars. they're only skater shoes if one wears them like skater shoes. otherwise, they're stylish, comfy, and cute (slightly similar to yours)

Those are sneakers. You cant and shouldnt wear sneakers everyday.Your feet will spread. Get a nice slip on leather shoe from "Payless" or Macy's or Wal Mart on 34th street in Manhattan, Walmart has a shoe dept in the back on the first floor. Or buy a leather CLOG. You can wear thick or thin socks with them.Dont for get winter is coming. Good luck.

Its called a gauge.
And if your totally cool with scarring your earlobes beyond all belief for the rest of your life, go for it. Im not judging, just telling you. When your sixty, your gonna look pretty stupid with big floppy lobes. My friend John stretched his and his lobes ended up snapping(Dead serious, I watched it happen) and he had to undergo plastic surgery to fix it all. And it really hurt him. Crazy huh? Most people dont know that can happen.

Both are obvious fakes. For the first: I can tell it's fake because of several things including the wonky logo, the C's are linked the wrong way.  The stitching is sloppy.  They don't use that type of hardware on the straps of the authentic bags.  I can't find that style on the Chanel website, or any style similar. It was discontinued due to a flood of cheap fakes.



The second bag is even more obviously fake because of the shiny cheap plastic material and the tacky embossed Chanel logo.  Again, it's not on the Chanel website and I don't think they even made a bag like that.  Plus the site it's on- "Top Saler" states in the fine print it sell replicas, or as they are know by people in the Fashion business "counterfeits".  It's a standard china-based webstore that sells counterfeit brand and designer names.  I've seen many of these sites before."Top-saler" is notorious for spamming anywhere and everywhere on the internet.  The purseforum message board lists website that sell authentic and the ones that are know to sell fake, and "top Saler" is listed in the fakes. Everything on the site is fake and they have instruction on how to circumvent border seizures, which means they know they are selling counterfeits.

I would take the photo to a chanel store or concession and show them. they will be able to verify it, and if it is a fake they will thank you for showing them, it's becoming a real problem for designer brands.

yes.
dont buy one online.
chanel bags cost at least 800$ if you're lucky. 
some ways you can tell if its real, are if all the stitchings are absolutlely perfect. the product is made in italy/france, and the inside of the bag is pink. they are only sold at chanel stores.

It sounds fine to me. I think it all depends on the shoes. Are they high heels or flat. If they are flat then you are totally fine, if they are high then it may look a little slutty but i still think you can get away with it.

Which of these pictures should I send to a modelling agency?



I am in contact with a modelign agency. They want 10 photos, NOT PROFESSIONAL ONES. "Home photos", they told me.
So, I have to choose 10 photos from my portfolio.

They want:
two best dressed
two with the best make up
two prettiest
two $luttiest
two "holy".

So, which of these photo fit the categories they told me?

This is my flickr album, with 63 photos in it (4 pages).

Can you tell me the number of photos for each category, and, if possible, the motivation beyond your choice?

Thanks!

The album is here:

46, 48, 51, 53, 54, 55, 58, 63 and 69.

I think those are the best pics, but obviously thats only in the first page!!Good luck! xx

Real modeling agencies want a professional portfolio, not a collection of "home" photos.  They especially don't specify sluttiest, and holy.  Some thing's fishy here.

what are those all in 1 things you are wearing?! hideous!!!
Im sure modelling agencies want professional photos though and these have just been taking at home which doesn't look very professional at all! 
You are very pretty but not sure these photo's will get you anywhere in the modelling world!

Prom dresses! Help please?



My prom is quite a way off yet but ive started searching for the perfect dress. The way i see it, the prom is an excuse for me to wear an outrageously gorgeous dress, something big and cinderella style, with ruffles and the works. I want a floor length one, but this might be a problem because im quite short. I like aquamarine, but i want to find the perfect dress rather than go by colour.
Any suggests of individual dresses or shops would be appreciated.
Thank you!

New Look has some gorgeous ones. Most of the people I suggested it to on Yahoo Answers loved it!
There are some absolutely brilliant black strapless ones. Do take a look, you'll love them!
Don't go for floor length if you are short! That's a fashion crime! Keep it soft elegant and classy! And remember shorter the dresses for short girls, the better. 
Debenhams or H & M might be worth another look!

Do u like these guys skinny jeans (girls- are they hot) + how should they be worn?



i have recently started wearing these

http://www.thevintagerevolution.com/mens...
http://i5.ebayimg.com/05/i/000/f2/73/1dc...

With a studded belt, vans flats and a band hoodie I think they look awesome. Girls what do you think (im a tall and thin guy too) - Hot??

Your thoughts. :) Thanks.

also-  the thing is that they are low rise - They sit really low on the hip area. Trouble is my boxers stick out when I bend over or something or they ride low at the back if my tshirt or hoodie rides up....

Should i wear them a the waist (they dont actually sit round there so impossible)?
or
below the waist and my boxers tend to stick out?

Hey yeah they're very cool and indie!
i love when guys where them.

you should wear them on your waist..becuase below you just lose the whole indie effect.

But: make sure they're not to tight becuase its like not good for sperm as it increased the temprature which defeats the purpose of having them outside your body in your balls lol.

Hi...  Here's the answer you want and it's factual - trust me... And it just doesn't apply to white JEANS !!!  (OMG!!!!)  It applies to all feminine articles of outer wear..
The color WHITE is a summer color...  Labor Day signifies basically the last day of Summer, so in other words, put away your white high heels, your white skirts, and white SLACKS, and bring out the darker shades...!!! Factual.....
And I myself, being a transvestite, even know this fact...
Enjoy...

you can wear skirts, lots of women have stretch marks -- I'll go out on the limb and say 80%, but probably more.
just because you have a mark there or here doesn't mean you can't wear something. you need to be confident :)

Yes I think you should be able to wear short skirts in the winter months, obviously with the wooliest tights you can find though! Otherwise you will freeze! The biggest pro is that they cute and with really thick tights on and boots my legs are just as warm as if I were wearing trousers, with the added bonus of not having the bottoms of my trousers all soggy and sticking to my legs, which I hate!

I know a lot of girls who to the in skirt thing and shorts in the winter when clubbing still because the clubs get so crowded and Hot even in the winter  often the will throw on a pair of tights with the skirt to keep legs warmer and the tights come in so many colors now. The cons since I am from New england and it snows and is cold in the winter the downfall is going from house to club it is cold. the pros would be still looking sexy as hell when you get to the club and staying cooler in the crush of 400 people on a dance floor.

hmmm That's a tough one! I think you like color, you know. You wear almost everything so I guess that's your style.



Think about it, do you like jeans more then skirts, must you wear sun glasses even when there is no sun, ask your self all these questions. If you like almost anything, then maybe your fashion foward type a person.

Me.... I wear nothing but black, never do I wear color. I hate wearing color, I feel like Ima look fat. Sounds weair but its true!

I've just recently started discovering my style. Before I would wear and buy just everything, but now i've started college and i have to choose an outfit every morning. I'm finding that like the outfits I feel best in- do collectively create a definite style (different to anyone elses but still a style). So my advice would be to decide what you feel best expresses the type of person you are, or you want to be seen as, or what makes you feel really good and true to yourself. DUmp the rest of your wardrobe or edit it or whatever and you will have a personal style! hope i helped........

<question>



Why are fashion models so freakishly thin?



Every you look in the media they show these emaciated looking women who look like they should be in an Ethiopian refugee camp. With their ribs and  bones popping out every where. What is the allure of them? I remember when models actually had gorgeous shapes like Cindy Crawford and Claudia Schiffer, Why has they media made women have such a distorted view of beauty and are women actually buying into it?



</question>



<additional details>



To Queen E: Great answer. I agree. These poor women are on the brink of starvation and they look revolting in those beautiful clothes. I'm a fashion major and I have always been disgusted by the industries gross lack of negligence to actually take the proper measures to ensure that these models are healthy. I think clothes look better on shapely healthy sized people not twigs.



To Laura_S: Good to hear your getting help for your issue. I must agree that it's good to be healthy slender not starved slender. Alot of these women are so thin that they don't realize the jeopardy their health is in. I think it's insane that women should be held to these impossible standards of thiness. Not to discriminate against natuarally thin models but there are those that are setting a bad example for young girls and women. Which needs to stop. It's sick and kills innocent people due to the fact that this is what people set their physical worth on.

I pretty much think it's disgusting. I also appreciated models who had curvy and actual shapes back in the day. I think the media is trying to set a new example but putting curvier women on ads and on the runway, but I think people still have a distorted image of what beauty really is and what a model really needs to be (thin and tall). To me, it is still the most disturbing thing I see almost everyday, I love fashion and I watch runway shows religiously,but honestly- everytime I see a stick thin model, I don't look at the clothing, I look at a suffering person who will die soon.

I've asked this question many times myself, and never found an answer... But what I think is that



1. either fashion designers want to save money by making the smallest clothes possible for their models.
or
2. The media intentionally wants to ruin every child's self esteem for their own sick and twisted reasonings..or maybe for a good laugh...cuz their jerks.



also..



population control... you make people extremely skinny and sick, and they will die soon.. tragic really.

Actually, the really top supermodels AREN'T super stick thin.



Look at Adriana Lima and Giselle Bundchen. They're gorgeous!
There ARE some models who are stick thin, but many agencies or fashion designers won't let them be in their shows or whatever.



It's kinda a stereotype that all models are like skeletons. Some may be, but the majority are very healthy.

some people find the super skinny look attractive, myself included. i am in treatment for an eating disorder though so my opinion on this may not be that great. i don't think its right to publicly celebrate their figures though because it tells girls that being an average shape, unlike these emaciated women, is being fat and makes us all feel fat even if we arnt. like teenage girls need more pressure on them these days
to the person who said about Adriana Lima and Giselle Bundchen not being too skinny for super models or whatever, your wrong. Giselle Bundchen is 5"11, 115 lbs. and has a bmi of 16 (bear in mind that under 18.5 us underweight and under 17.5 is 15 % below recommended body weight

Nail Patterns????????????



In Lady Gaga's song 'Just Dance', there is a close up of her fingernails, and she is wearing a nail polish pattern - a checkered pattern.



I was just wondering if anyone knew where I could get my hands on a stencil or something to make a pattern like that on my nails?



Any help would be greatly appreciated

What do people think of high waisted shorts?



I am 14 and just bought some high waisted shorts in a dark denim.
What is your opinion on high waisted shorts?
I have pretty good legs, so I don't think they look too bad on me.
Also, what are some good t-shirts / singlets to wear with them?
Thanks a lot for your contributions :D

Since it's a casual date, dress simple! Don't go all out. However, if you do want to dress up, put on a casual dress over leggings/jeans. Put more effort in your makeup/hair and how good you smell rather than what you wear... and be confident! Confidence is always sexy. Have fun.

Can anyone tell me if this is true?



I was getting ready for work this evening and I had put on dark blue scrub pants and a scrub shirt that is mostly pink and has some, not much, blue in it.  I asked my bf if it looked okay and he said "Yes but I thought you were supposed to wear darker colors on top:"  Meaning in his tiny world of fashion sense he was under the impression that the bottoms of clothes should be a lighter color that the tops?  Has anyone else ever heard of this and is it true?  I won't even get into the issue of why my bf would even have, let alone care about, such information.

It's either or.. Imagine jeans. Which top would you wear for dark denim? A light one.



As long as the colors contrast each other well, it should work out fine.

What is the ultimate, all-time classic, never out of fashion pair of men's jeans?



We're having this debate at work. I'm sat wearing a pair of bog standard Levi 501s that were my fathers, and I think that these are the ultimate pair of men's jeans...timeless and under-stated.



HOWEVER, there is a rival faction in the office! They think that CK or Bench (etc) jeans with ripped knees are the classic pair...cast your vote and settle this argument!

It depends on age, are your colleagues older than you? If so this is probably why.

That actually made me shake my head a little bit when I read it...



You don't need to be a certain size to wear them. They aren't called "skinny" jeans because you need to be skinny to wear them. I wear skinny jeans all the time, and I'm not exactly a size 2.



If you like the look, and you feel like you could rock it, then gd it go ahead and buy some! It's not the style, it's the confidence that you need to pull off the style. YOU have to



MAKE
IT
WORK



^^ So go out and buy skinny jeans. And pull those betches off.

I wear whatever I think looks good on me and the clothes have to be comfy otherwise I just can't stand it. It's hard for me to find clothes that flatter my body because I am tall and skinny. I like buying clothes from Target and Urban Angel in Pumpkin Patch. I live in Australia so we don't have a lot of clothes options.

Most people won't buy certain things used--and hair accessories is one of those things. You can try washing them and sterilizing them--but don't be surprised if they don't sell.

You may wish to consult with an advertising agency and see what they can do for you.



There are so many things you can do to reach out to potential an existing customers to advertise a new product. Try to be creative. Your business can't survive if you can't brainstorm at least a few ideas.

Kim Kardashian's *** is FAKE! Google her or take a peep at her sex tape. Where that *** appear from? Not to mention the fact that it looks retarded. If you already have a "big ***" why do you want a "bigger one"  Does your *** make you who are? Or lemme guess, since the face isn't worth a second look you have to divert the men's attention somewhere else!

And by cheaper I'm guessing you mean less expensive than the more expensive genuine, but not some seconds (or rejects).

I don't understand why so many people attempt to buy fake Tiffany's. Tiffany's is not overly expensive, and many sterling silver pieces can be purchased for $100-$200. For the quality Tiffany's is, that's really not bad. Don't even consider buying anything that isn't directly from the Tiffany store or site; it's just not worth it.

Why do women wear high heels and hurt their feet?



Honestly, I have never worn them because I am 6'1 and do NOT need to be any taller than I already am, but I have seen what wearing them can do to feet and it disturbs me that women would subject themselves to permanent foot damage just to make their legs look better. What are your thoughts about them?

Welll I would think before a woman puts them on her feet, she should know how to walk in them. I never go out of the house with heels on, and I've never had problems with my feet. My mom was also the same way and her feet are perfect. I guess its not for everyone.

Well not being rude here but you seem a little smug. .not every woman is lucky enough (or cursed) to be over 6 foot.  So obviously you dont need them.
p.s  I wonder if you would have the same views on heels if you were 5'1...somehow i dont think so....

Honey, don't let it disturb you. People don't wear heels just to make their legs look better, lol! Some people wear them because they are short or their outfit looks better with heels. I can tell you that I wear high heels everyday for work and don't have a problem. Sure some types of shoes are not good for wearing all the time, but some are. So just because you don't like wearing heels, don't let it disturb. If you were shorter, you would probably wear heels too.

Not just your feet...the muscles in your calves shorten over time, and make it uncomfortable to not wear heels eventually...just a thought, I'm no lady but my g/f suffers from this a lot.

I agree that they are terrible. I guess women wear them because if they are short, they want to be taller, or just because they look stylish. I saw a few months ago that flats were coming in style, and I was happy...But it looks like the heels are back...

Well, I'm 4'11" and I don't wear heels either. I am comfortable with my body and how short I am. I think women wear them because society has programmed them to feel "ugly" if they are not over a certain height. Just look at all the supermodels, every one is over 6 feet! They do hurt though, I must admit I have tried them on to see what I would look like. I liked them, but not enough to deal with the pain.

Well, women wear them for a number of reasons.........



To make them taller.
To make their legs look long and endless.
Or because some shoes are just so cute you can't imagine your life without them.



They are sore at the start, but after a while they'd don't bother you.



But High Heels are actually kinda bad for you.
They put pressure on your womb and all the stuff down there, and reduce your chances of having children.

I love high heels. They can be painful sometimes, but they are also a lot of fun, especially when you are 5 feet tall, like me. I've worn heels fairly regularly since I was 14 or so and 7 years later: no damage. For now, I am grateful for a little extra height so tall people don't just run blindly into me!
I don't wear heels everyday and I'm comfortable with my height without them, but I firmly believe there is nothing wrong in wearing them if you so choose!

I'm only 5 ft tall and only wear heels to special occasions or nights out.  If you get a decent pair of heels they actually aren't uncomfortable at all.  I wear them to dress up outfits mostly, but also they make legs look longer.

No. Those are quite obviously fake bags. Personally, I'd be embarrassed to walk around with a fake designer bag. People will realise that it's fake and make condescending remarks- believe me, I do everytime I see someone with a fake. Support your favourite designer and buy the real thing- not some lame attempt at a recreation.

NO! If you are going to spend this much money on a fake bag go with coach or something. At least it will be real.

I don't think it matters that they are fake, I think those look nice especially that red Chanel. I'd say go for it.

i have the same issue i usually just get dark jeans and shirts that go with it u have to remember gothic is an art form not truley a way to dress u need the mind set to make it work and punk and emo can be pretty much anything like tore jeans and a vintage shirt with converse and vamp is an light flowy dark dress and heals its more of the suduction feature of the dark side but here is a site i  found when doing a google search



http://www.goodgoth.com/



also hottopic has a plus size section on their site and debs can also has some clothes that can be used as punk or emo fashion

You can get those clothes anywhere, its more about how you put them together and accessorize then where you get the actual articles of clothing.  Just get a lot of dark clothes, and rev up the eyeliner and jewelry and maybe hair dye.  For emo/punk, ripped jeans and pins couldn't hurt either.



And for the other idiots who commented, you don't have to be a certain size to have a certain style.

Stop being rude people, shes not asking for you to comment about her size, and i dont see how it would matter.



Hot topic & Torrid for sure, they have some hot clothes there.
&& don't listen to the ignorant people.
the only person who opinons matter about you, is yourself.
