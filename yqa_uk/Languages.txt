Can anyone help me out with this?



I have received 3 diff emails, how can I tell if they are coming from the same computer?  I have located the IP addys but I believe that I have just the server IP.  Is there a way to get the personal computers IP, so I can check into this?

Text is a noun being used as a verb. Better grammar would be to say "I sent him a text yesterday" which is in the past tense.  8~)

Can someone who speaks french please translate this?



in 2007 i went on a holiday to dorset, in the south of england.
i went with my friends, their names are, joe, jo, grant, jack, hollie and chloe.



we left at five o'clock in the morning an went their by coach, it took around three hours to get there.
the journey was boring and very tiring but we passes the time by talking and playing games.



during the journey we ate sweets, we got of half way through the journey and went to Macdonald's, i had a burger, chips and coke.



when we arrived we was very tired, we went to our dormitories and chose our beds.



we stayed in a motel for 1 week, there was some adults with us to look after us and too cook.



the motel had a big lounge and a dining area, there where 3 large dormitories, the boys slept in one and the girls in the other. there was also a playing field outside and it



had goal posts so that we could play football, there was also benches if you wanted to sit down.



the weather was good, it was usually sunny and hot as we went in august, so we went to the beach quite often.



in the morning we all woke up around 7 o'clock and then we met in the lounge, we then had breakfast together and then we talked about what we was going to do through



the day. we done different things every day,  we visited museums and zoo's throughout the week, but in general we spent our time on the beach.
most of the activities we did were on the beach too. we built sand castles and played in the sea. there were also amusement parks there, most of the boys spent their time on



the go karts. i also enjoyed playing golf.



usually we ate in the motel, we had different food every day, but we at out sometimes, my favorite meal was in Nando's as i like chicken a lot.



when we were at the motel together we usually watched horror films for fun, and then went camping outside and slept in the tents.



i think dorset is nice place, it is the countryside, places like swanage where the beach was were good too, they had a lot of tourists there.



i would like to go there again some time in the future with friends as it was very fun.

By the way - a lot of people on here are translating your text using online translators... so be careful - you can tell the ones that did because 'grant' has been translated... and shouldn't be, it's a name!



But anyhoo here's the genuine advice. Split your sentences up into short sentences. eg in 2007 I went on holiday to Dorset. Dorset is in the south of England.



This way the french is easier to translate and online translators will be more accurate (however just for fun, tranlsate into french then back into English - it'll give you an idea of the accuracy of the translators)

you need to try and think 'what do i know how to say?' and use that, instead of struggling with complicated sentences... remember, in language homeworks and exams it is easier and acceptable to LIE about what you did in your holidays or whatever

Hello ! It's longer than the other text... you aren't able to do it yourself or you have just some words in french ?



En 2007, je suis allé à Dorset pour les vacances, au sud de l'Angleterre avec mes amis Joe, Jo, Grant, Jack, Holli et Chloé.



Nous sommes partis à 5 heures du matin et ( I don't know what "went by coach" means, sorry ^^ ), le voyage a duré environ 3 heures. Le temps était long, c'était très ennuyant et fatiguant, mais on a passé le temps en parlant et jouant. Nous mangions des bonbons durant le voyage et nous nous sommes arretés au milieu pour manger chez Mac Donald's. J'ai pris un hamburger, des frites et du coca.



Nous étions épuisés à notre arrivée, nous avons été dans nos dortoires et avons choisi notre lit.



Nous sommes restés dans un motel pendant une semaine, mais des adultes étaient là pour nous surveiller et pour nous faire à manger.



Le motel comportait un grand salon et un espace pour manger. Il y avait également 3 grands dortoires, les garçons dormaient dans l'un et les filles dans l'autre ( but I don't understand, if you say that the boys slept in one dormitory and the girls in an other, there is still an other dormitory... You sure there are 3 dormitories, and not 2 ? ). Il y avait également une aire de jeux avec des buts, nous pouvions donc jouer au football. Il y avait quelques bancs si on voulait s'assoir.



Il faisait ( you pronunce feusait, and not fèsait, warning ^^ ) beau et chaud comme nous étions en août, nous allions donc assez souvent à la plage.



Nous nous réveillions tous environ à 7 heures du matin et nous nous rassemblions dans le salon. Puis nous prennions notre petit déjeuner et nous parlions de ce que nous allions faire pendant la journée.



Nous faisions différentes activités au long de la journée, nous visitions par exemple des musées, des zoos pendant la semaine, mais en general nous passions notre temps à la plage car la plupart des activités que nous faisions se déroulaient sur la plage. Nous construisions des chateaux de sable, et nous jouions dans l'eau. Il y avait aussi des parcs de loisirs, où la plupart des garçons passaient leur temps à faire du kart. Moi j'aimais beaucoup jouer au golf.



Géneralement nous mangions au motel, où nous avions de la nourriture différente chaque jour, mais nous mangions ailleurs quelques fois. Je préférais aller à Nando's car ils font un bon poulet et c'est ma viande préférée.



Quand nous étions tous ensemble au motel, nous regardions des films d'horreur pour s'amuser puis nous allions dormir dehors, sous des tentes.



Je pense que Dorset est un bon endroit, au bord de la mer. Il y avait beaucoup de touristes. Je voudrais y retourner plus tard avec mes amis, car c'était génial.



If you need some help with the french, you can ask me, because I see that you have difficulties, don't you ? And excuse me if my english is not very good, I hope you understand me !



By !

Please please... check my grammar...?



Good morning, sir (professor?). First of all, nice to meet you. I appreciate you giving me a chance to be here today. My name is ~~~ and applying for ~~~ national graduate school of business administration, especially in the accounting track. I graduated from ~~~ university with a B.S degree in February this year, majoring in computer science.



I worked for AA corporation for more then five years. In my previous job, I was in charge of budget planning, accounting, and general administration(??) for R&D groups. That’s why I have practical experience in management field.
I think that I should study a lot to be successful in the field where I want to work in as soon as possible. Working in this field make me deeply interested in management field and then give me a career goal, a certified accountant with a CPA or a researcher in this field. That’s why I applied for this school.

You most definitely need  some help with the  grammar.My name is ... and I am applying for the National  Graduate School of Business Administration  .Now I am not sure what you are saying when you wrote especially in accounting.If you mean  you want to major in accounting then you should write  after the school of business administration majoring in accounting instead of using especially accounting because especially shouldnt be used there.You just need to communicate and write  down what you want to get across in a professional manner.You might need to have some help in writing down what you want to communicate across.Dont be afraid to have a professional help you.You want to look good and come across as a bright individual not a middle schooler.

A Few Japanese Sentences...?



Can a native speaker (Soph or someone) tell me the だ／です and る／ます versions of these sentences?



-You missed the dorm meeting.



-If I had known you were here I would have gotten you.



-Besides having to pay the penalty [fee], you don't really have anything to worry about.



-Since アントンさん had already notified the 寮長 that he had バイト, I figured everyone else was out as well.



-My house to New York City is the same distance that 三鷹 is from 新宿.
-Yeah right.



No online translators and no non-native speakers please! I know enough Japanese to tell the difference.



Thank you!

Dear Lynne:



I'm very nervous for meeting you after all this time we've been sending letters. I'm very happy that you finally decided to come and visit me. In all this time we've became very good friends and we will have so much fun together this following days.



I think we should meet in the Park West around 5 o'clock.



So you can`t recognize me, I'm gonna describe myself, cause we've never sent pictures of us.



I`m short and medium build.  I`m a young woman in early twenties as you may know.
I have a straight blond hair and a fair complexion. I usually dresed in jeans and a jumper or shirt and wear flat shoes.



People think about me I appear cheerful and a kind person when they first meet me.



Moreover I´ll be dresed with a read headband and with it, you will be able to recognise me easily.

Dear Lynne,



I'm very nervous about meeting you after all this time we've been in contact. I'm very happy that you’ve decided to come and visit me. I feel after all this time we've become very good friends and we will have so much fun together these following days.



I think its best we meet in the Park West at around 5 o'clock.



Because you won’t recognise me (as we've never sent pictures of each other) I'll describe myself:



As you may know, I’m a young woman in my early twenties. I’m short, medium build, with straight blond hair and a fair complexion. I usually dress in jeans and a jumper or shirt and wear flat shoes. I will make sure I wear a red headband so you recognise me easily.



People often say I am cheerful and kind when they first meet me and I hope that is the case when I meet you too.



See you soon.

It's a colloquial phrase that is similar to "That's the way the cookie crumbles." "Oh well, too bad." "That's just the way it is."



It is American in origin, I think it relates to American pool and the first break in a game.



Hope this is helpful.

Old Norse is the North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during the Viking Age, until about 1300.
The languages spoken in the Faroe Islands and Iceland are Faroese  and Icelandic respecitvely.



Danish is official in the Faroes Islands and widely taught in Iceland formerly a Danish possession.

What does “beat me to it” mean?



I heard a line from a TV show about a criminal investigation. The cop went to a suspect’s home. When the suspect opened the door, she said: “I went to give that boy a piece of my mind and to tell him to stay away from my son. Then I saw that you beat me to it.”



I know “beat me” means I don’t know but this meaning doesn’t fit here. Then, I googled this term, it seems like a common phrase. Could you shed a light on this one?



Thank you in advance.

Basically, "beat me to it" means that the cop went and did what the suspect was meaning to do before she could do it.



Here on yahoo answers, or on other internet sites, it can refer to someone who's going to give the correct answer to a question but is "too late" (for instance, if someone else posts the same answer to this question before I do, they just "beat me to it").



The more active a place is, the more likely it is that a bunch of people will all psot the same answer in quick succession. The last question I answered was about the angle between perpendicular lines (90 degrees btw): it was the first on the "list of new questions" for me to answer and I answered it in about 20 seconds, but when I was done someone else had already answered it. Thus the person who posted the answer first had "beaten me to it."



The only hope for someone who's been "beaten" in terms of time is to compose a detailed, too-wordy answer in the hopes the "quality" of the post will be rated highly. Like my answer above. The more room for creativity, the more room for a better rather than a faster answer to be granted. In my earlier example of the angles, it's pretty much impossible to give a better answer than "90 degrees" but in this case if I make the meaning of the phrase particularly clear I might well win "best answer."

in this case it means that the other guy got to the boy first, gave him a piece of his mind and told him to stay away from the suspect's son.
You beat me to it means, beat (arrived before, did it sooner, achieved something higher or better) me, to it (usually it is something that the person has said before that they wanted.
Examples: She wanted to be the first to say, "happy birthday" to her boyfriend but his mom beat her to it.
I wanted to vote against something but the state beat me to it by changing the whole policy.
The father wanted to tell his son not to catch up to his 6' 2" but the son beat him to it by only growing to 5' 11".
The man sped up and knocked the woman aside as he grabbed the door and held it open for her.  She glared at him and he smiled and said, "beat cha to it."

It means someone did something you were planning to do, ahead of you.



For example, I wanted to buy that new laptop which was on sale, and you went to the store first and bought it ahead of me, you "beat me to it".

I think what you mean to say is  " Chris, on this rare  occasion , is wearing  a  shirt. He usually is shirtless  because he says it is  liberating and  he loves showing off his lean body."



I assume there is a  picture with it?

What do you think can i add? its a letter for english class, but it so short, im spanish?



Dear Lynne:



I'm very nervous for meeting you after all this time we've been sending letters. I'm very happy that you finally decided to come and visit me. In all this time we've become very good friends and we will have so much fun together the following days.



I think we should meet in the Park West around 5 o'clock.



So you can recognize me, I'll describe myself, because we've never sent pictures of us.



I`m short and medium build.  I`m a young woman in my early twenties as you may know.



I have a straight blond hair and a fair complexion. I have a dark  blue eyes. I usually dresed in jeans and a jumper or shirt and wear flat shoes.



People say that I appear cheerful and a kind person when they first meet me.



To recognise me more easily i will be wearing a red headband on the day.



See you soon.

Inverted : no, I did not use a translator, it's my own French. I don't know where you're from but your French is awful, so don't criticize the others who at least tried their best, even if they used a translator and that some of them have no idea of what they wrote.
I was born and raised in France, did all of my schooling there, so I think I know what I'm talking about ; )

It means something like, "You enchant me crazy."  or, "I am crazy for you."



encantar means to enchant, "Me encanta Mexico" means Mexico enchants me.

I think it would be something like "estoy loco, me encantas tu," and this means "I am crazy, I like you so much."



"Encantar" is to charm, to delight; to fascinate,
but it is also to bewitch, cast a spell on, so if you like the guy, you could try "llego tu brujita" (here comes your little witch, in Spanish it sounds much better than in English).

Ich habe dich lieb covers the "I love you but not in a romantic way" aspect.



Du bist wie eine Tochter für mich means "You're like a daughter to me". I don't know how to combine them.



"Ich liebe dich wie eine Tochter" is creepy and incestuous-sounding, I think.

What does “for good” mean in this case?



It is very interesting that “for good” in the dictionary has another meaning--forever. However, I was wandering the below sentences mean “good deeds” or “the opposite of personal gains”.



1. I am relieved that you used that brain of yours for good.



2. do sth in the name of good



Thank you in advance

Dictionary.com has 58 definitions for the word "good". Here is the first one, I think it covers both your examples.



1. morally excellent; virtuous; righteous



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Thank you very much. I use Dictionary.com a lot. The thing is too many definitions sometimes confuse me, like playing a match game. As an ESL learner, I am not sure if I mix the right meaning with the right definition.



Today is a big day for America and the world. May God bless you and all of us.

Your second example doesn't even use "for good."
Your first is the literal meaning (although it can also be the shortening of a longer phrase, ex. "for good reasons").

Dear Lynne:



I'm very nervous for meeting you after all this time we've been sending letters. I'm very happy that you finally decided to come and visit me. In all this time we've become very good friends and we will have so much fun together the following days.



I think we should meet in the Park West around 5 o'clock.



So you can recognize me, I'll describe myself, because we've never sent pictures of us.



I`m short and medium build.  I`m a young woman in my early twenties as you may know.



I have a straight blond hair and a fair complexion. I have a dark  blue eyes. I usually dresed in jeans and a jumper or shirt and wear flat shoes.



People say that I appear cheerful and a kind person when they first meet me.



To recognise me more easily i will be wearing a red headband on the day.

Dear Lynne,



How are you?  I hope you have been well since the last time I spoke to you.  I hope your family is well. (Maybe you should describe what you have been doing since the last letter you wrote!).



I'm very nervous about meeting you after all this time we've been sending letters, but I guess that is normal. I'm very happy and excited that you finally decided to come and visit me in Spain. In all this time we've become very good friends and we will have so much fun together the following days. (describe what you will be doing, where you will be staying, any sights you'll see, if you'll go out at night, your friends and whether you will meet them or what they think of her- you could even describe some of them so she knows what they look like when she comes over!)



I think we should meet in the Park West around 5 o'clock. (maybe say where abouts in the park you will be meeting, ie. near a bench, next to the swings or the pond, etc.  If you give more details you'll have more words!)



So you can recognize me, I'll describe myself, because we've never sent pictures of us.



I`m short and medium build. I`m a young woman in my early twenties.  I have a straight blond hair and a fair complexion. I have a dark blue eyes.

Race: English/French Canadian
Age: 26
What will buy: COFFEE!! and none of that starbucks crap.  Low acid, medium-to-bold, hot coffee.  Offer with options (sugar, cream, flavor shots, etc).  Fresh Cider donuts to purchase along with it would be a plus.
Price: between $0.75 and $2.00 for a large, good cup of coffee.

Do you know of any summer programs to learn spanish while teaching english/volunteering?



Does anyone know of programs (that are not too expensive) where I could learn spanish while teaching english or volunteering? I only know basic spanish currently, but I would like to go next summer, and leave as close to fluent in Spanish as possible. I have heard that you can work for your room and board, and maybe even get paid, or get a living stipend. I also would like to go with my boyfriend, and live together.

I personally don't feel like that no. Although most counties speak English, it is as a second language so naturally if you are in Germany German people will speak German to each other.

If you're in Germany, you should expect them to speak German; it's their native language, and you shoudl respect it. They don't do it to talk about you, or to irritate you. I lived abroad for a time, and even the people I socialised with would speak in their native tongue. It's your job to fit in with their culture, not the other way around.

Tenerife, is going to revive a once-thriving tourism business. The island was once a premier holiday hot spot amongst the elite, but a lack of investment caused it to fade off the holiday destination map. Tenerife is making a comeback as the place to be when you want the perfect holiday.



Tenerife used to enjoy a thriving holiday business, but has had tough compettition against Greece, Turkey and Egypt. While other countries were developing and improving their tourism aspects, Tenerife choose to take it easy. This has lead to a dramatic drop in tourism.

its just the accent that makes it sounds different to those people who know the language.



vocabulary should be fairly the same.

{ Cymro bach....'Ychwanegu' is a formal way of saying 'add'. If you were writing to a headmaster or to a solicitor, then, yes, you would use 'ychwanegu'. 
ishe and shwmae....are these in the Welsh dictionary??..No!
As for his version being used throughout Wales....Rubbish..
it's not used anywhere north of Aberystwyth.Most South Waleans don't know how to mutate proplery anyhow..'Yn fam i',(my mother)
'yn frawd i'( my brother)....even 7 year olds up here can mutate better than that.}

As you are writing to add someone to your contact list I doubt you will be corresponding to them in formal language.

You weren't thinking of saying..
"I am an aquaintance of an aquaintance and I desired to include you in order to say 'Hello'"...were you?

Stick to one of the versions I gave you earlier..that's how we would say it here and in ALL of North Wales. Try Cymro bach's feeble attempt as well , see which gets you the best reaction. We can argue on here all night about which version is better....but the proof of the pudding...!

Rolyn yn fy marn personol i mae adio yn fratiaith oblegid mae'n gair sydd yn tarddu o'r Saesneg Add.



Ychwanegu byswn i'n defnyddio yn lle adio.



Rolyn in my personal opinion Adio is slang welsh because it comes from a corruption of the English to Add.



I would use Ychwanegu instead of Adio.

Ychwanegu is by no means formal it is used in everyday speach informally and formally.



I wouldn't use Roly'n version otherwise you'd be restricted to the north western peninsula of Pen llyn and maybe into bangor if you'r lucky, My version is used throughout Wales.



Mêt - norhtwalian word - english equivalent Mate pronounced the same



Adio - Adding - A word we only ever use in mathematics here, another very northwalian corruption of an ENGLISH word,

Japanese translation - please can you check it, and some questions about Japanese grammar and vocab



kono koohii dochi no hou ga suki desu ka? atsui no ka atatakai no desu ka?

Which of these coffees do you like (or does it mean prefer in this case?)? The hot one or the warm one?

What does this mean?

Dochira no koohii ga ii desu ka?

The bit that confuses me a lot is the Dochira no koohii. What does dochira mean, and why is the particle no used?



Is there other ways which are more common to say 'Which do you like more, the ______ or the ______?'

The way my book says is:

ringo to mikan to dochi no hou ga suki desu ka

And the answer:

ringo no hou ga mikan yori suki desu.



I like apples more than *mikan*

Is there a proper translation for the word prefer? What is it? I know mikan is a fruit, but that's just from reading it from a list of fruit.



How do I say 'Which fruit do you like?'



(not 'like more')

<answer>



Since no one else has answerd yet, I'll give it a try.

"Dochira no hou ga ii ("better")/suki ("prefer") desu ka" can be translated as "Which is better?", "Which do you like better?" or "Which do you prefer?". They all mean the roughly the same thing in your example sentence.

"Dochira" is just a different way to say "dore" or "doko" or "dare". It kind of means "Which one (of these)", "Who (of these)","Where (of these)". Usually, the idea of choosing one out of others is implied. There is a casual form of "dochira" that is "docchi".

So, "Dochira no kohii ga ii desu ka" would be like saying "Which out of these coffees do you like (prefer)?" or "Which coffee do you like?".

Grammatically you need the particle "no" because "dochira" is being used to modify the noun "kohii". However, in conversation this "no" is probably dropped to make the converstaion flow a little better and sound less formal.

If you're comparing two things (ie: apples and mikans (tangerines)) then you can say simply say something like



"Ringo wa mikan yori suki desu ka" ("Do you like apples better than mikans?") and most people will get what you're trying to say.



The "ringo no hou ga ii/suki" expression just further emphasizes that "you like apples more/better (than other fruits)" a little more and the "mikan yori" part just adds more specific information about what fruit you like apples better than.

You could say "mikan yori ringo no hou ga ii desu". I think this way is a little more natural sounding than you book's version, but are correct.

If you want to say "What kind of fruit do you like?" or "Which fruit do you like?" without adding the "more" or "better" part then you can say it a few ways (I think).

"Dono kudamono ga suki desu ka"
("Which fruit do you like?")

"Donna kudamono ga suki desu ka"
("What kind of fruit do you like?")

"Kudamono tte, nani ga suki desu ka"
("Speaking of fruit, which/what do you like?")

"Kudamono no naka de dochira ga suki desu ka"
("Out of all the kinds of fruit, which do you like")

I think all of the above are essentially just different ways to ask the same thing. The first two are probably the most basic and easiest to remember.

I might have made a few silly mistakes so perhaps someone else will come by and correct them.

Hope that helps.

If it is being asked this way:

If you say "dochi" it means "which"... there are always two things and you have to choose one which is better or best or you compare...

Dochira no kohii ga suki desu ka? means...
Which coffee do you like?



From my own point of view the usage of "prefer" and "more" varies with the usage of  "ii" and "suki"



Which is better Hokkaido or Okinawa? 
Hokkaido to Okinawa no dochira  no hou ga ii desu ka?

answer: Okinawa no hou ga ii desu.



I prefer Okinawa.

Which do you like more Hokkaido or Okinawa?
Hokkaido to Okinawa no dochira  no hou ga suki desu ka?

answer: Okinawa no hou ga suki desu.



I like Okinawa more than Hokkaido.



Which fruit do you like?
Dochira no kudamono ga suki desu ka?

I hope this helps.

The previous two answers are correct, a prig is self righteous, and overly concerned with morals (other peoples).

You are absolutely correct in both of your guesses. The term is only ever used in a derogatory way, never descriptive. (Unless someone was described as "a bit of a prig" as part of a profile).

You're very welcome.

Are you referring to studying German or referring to studying IN GermanY...? School and university as well are two entirely different things.

If you decide to study at any German university in the SOCRATES exchange program, for example, you won´t need to be able to speak fluent German. Again, it depends - which subject are you studying? Different universities offer different subjects, there are rather internationally lined universities that offer several subjects in English.

We don´t have colleges; schools would certainly require a certain knowledge of German before you start studying there, simply for the fact that all lessons (except the foreign languages) will most likely be held in German.

Why don´t you edit your question and let us know what exactly your plans are? Otherwise I´m afraid your question is slightly too broad to be answered. :)

If you're talking about a year abroad, then yes, most universities demand that you have a basic level of the local language, even if you're going to have all your lessons in English. But don't worry, a reading course (2 hours a week for a year or two) would usually be enough.

Depending upon to whom you are speaking, you might want to phrase your sentence in a more easily understood manner. Instead of telling them what is wrong, first explain what is right. Then ask the person how they might improve upon it.

The simplest turn of phrases are often the best, and disguising the issue with jargon can be  even more upsetting than a frank appraisal.

If this is someone else's concept within your firm and you do not want to upset them then go for:
"You have tried hard and  I/we like what you have presented. The idea is innovative and interesting. However it needs to be backed up by more data, additional information, and provide clarification as to how it can be widely implemented. It has real potential but needs to be more finely tuned".

If it is an external proposal that you do not want to accept, use the same terminology but omit the "You have tried hard" at the start.



If it is something that your firm is developing and you do not want to put off a potential customer "This is new and we are in the process of backing it up with additional data, more detailed information, and  clarification as to how widely it can be implemented, but it has great potential and is at the cutting edge".

Burns was not a Scotsman. Legally he was English, a borderman, so I imagine he wrote in Geordie.

They are in his idea of a Scots dialect.  Burns was a Romantic poet and believed in the myth of a Celtic race.  He wanted to turn his accent into a sort of language in order to emphasise his distinctiveness.  Read it aloud and you soon find out that it's simply accented English with a few local slang words in.  It's a perfectly valid way to express poetry and quite an innovative one for its time.

A large number of his poems are in Scottish, but he also wrote  in Scottish English and some in pure English. 
His first published book was called "Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect".

A swear word offends the susceptibilities of other people and treats with contempt things which they hold sacred. An obscenity gives voice to things which normally we do not refer to because they are considered indecent. We tend to describe both misuses of language as swearing.

Japanese: what does 'tte' mean and 'asatte'



Came across asatte as one word, no idea what it means. Do you?

I also see 'tte' used alone in song lyrics. One example from the top of my head is 'aishiteru tte'. The tte always has two 't'. Can anyone help me with this?

asatte (明後日) means the day after tomorrow.

while asatte is a full word itself, the other tte you mention are conjugational forms. ex: katte kudasai 買って下さい (please buy). katte (買って) here comes from the root word kau 買う.

the other use of tte, like in your example, means that the information given was a relay. ex: aishiterutte 愛してるって means "he/she said he/she loves (you)". another ex: you ask your mom if your father is going to the meeting, and your mom says "he said he's going", that can be translated to japanese as 行くって (ikutte).

anyway, asatte is a completely different independent word.

<answer>



'asatte' has been explained by the first answerer..

tte as used in your example sentence (lyric) 
explained very simply means 'you(or whoever) said/say...)

It is the shortened form of '..tte itta' or more formally 'to iimashita' (I wrote the past form but it can come in the present form too etc..)

So, 'aishiterutte' means either 'you said you love me' or 'he says he loves you', etc..

To know the subject and the tense, we need to look at the whole context.

EDIT:

Oh of course 'tte' has other meanings and uses like the one mentioned by the first answerer.

あなたはずっと私にとって最も大切な存在です。
anata wa zutto watashi ni totte mottomo taisetsuna sonzai desu.

Note: I translated the word "number one" as "最も大切な(most important)" because it's more natural. But if you really want to use the Japanese word for "number one", you can replace "最も大切な" by "一番の"(ichiban no).
You can replace 私(watashi) by 僕(boku) if you are a man.

When you replace it with "ichiban no", what is the whole sentence in romaji?



And if possible: How would you write "onii-chan" in Japanese?

Thanks again, both of you. =)

I think that there are two separate issues here. If the court made a contact order, then that decision stands. However, if the father has been charged with fraud, the outcome of this case might affect the actual practicalities of the contact order (if, for example, he serves a prison sentence or has to spend his weekends doing Community Service). In general terms, the fact that he is dishonest does not affect his right to see his child or children. It would be different if he were charged with a violent crime.

</answer from>



<answer>



Because he was the son of William Burness and "Burness" was the surname he went by until he was 27 years old. He only changed the spelling of his surname to Burns in 1786, two years before his father's death.

Hmm... That seems to be English, Spanish and maybe Portuguese (or Latin or Italian) all mixed together.

(1) Ok, first let's transcribe it to a more understandable language mix, which is Spanglish in this case:

"Hello! Where is the bordel? Muchas thanks, hombre".

(2) Next, let's translate it into English:

"Hello! Where is the bordel? Thank you very much, buddy".

(3) Finally, here's the Spanish version, in case you're interested:

"¡Hola! ¿Dónde esté el burdel?" Muchas gracias, hombre."



NOTES:
a. That was my best interpretation. I'm not sure if that's the original meaning.
b. The word 'bordel' is (archaic) the same as 'brothel'.

"Adam" :



The personal name 'Adam' derives from the Hebrew "noun ha adamah" meaning "the ground" or "earth," A literal translation is "man of the red earth".



In Arabic 'Adam' (آدم) means "made from the earth/mud/clay".

It is still a Hebrew given name, and its Biblical usage has ensured that it is also a common name in all countries which draw on Judaeo-Christian heritage. In most languages its spelling is the same, although the pronunciation varies somewhat.



'Adam' is also a surname in many countries, although it is not as common in English as its derivative 'Adams' (sometimes spelled 'Addams'). In other languages there are similar surnames derived from Adam, such as 'Adamo', 'Adamov', 'Adamowicz', 'Adamski' etc.

It's like most expressions. Someone trying to say something profound using language. It will either mean something to you or it will mean nothing. I mean if you have something to say speak plainly. I mean you are either selfish or you are not. You will either share what you have or you won't. Now that's clear and easy to me.

Basically, you can't take anything with you when you die, in order to live an unselish life, give, donate, laugh, share, and you will see the positives in life and know true haapiness and experience what life is supposed to be.  However, the opposite is true, greed, selfishness, etc, will only allow you to live a sad existence where you can only see the negatives in life.  Look around you, those that are greedy always think someone is trying to take their things, those that give unselfishly are blessed with happiness.  Soul vs Material things.  It is in the bible.

I think that the key is in the last words: "in the midst of abundance", which indicates that the person in question is not in need and has sufficient to eat, drink, wear, etc. With sufficient available, the person leading a pure (that is, virtuous) unselfish life does not grasp at anything as being his own and for his use only, but is prepared to share with other people and to acknowledge their claim on what is available.

1) If you want to live a pure life, free from selfishness etc

2) when you have everything (in the midst= surrounded by, abundance = a lot of everything)

3) you must not consider (count) anything as your property, viz. only for you, (one's own)

in different words (please forgive the non English-mother-tongue-person , living abroad); if you want to live a unselfish life, when you own everything, you must consider NOTHING as your own



+++++
A different reading approach
just remember Gospel and richness: the problem is not having richness, but being tied to richness, considering it as the life purpose 
( " a god" to adore, to live for); 
suddenly all plans of yours will be cancelled if God calls you (death).

I wouldn't be caught dead using them. How sexually insecure you have to be to use an lame expression like "no homo"? And "pwned" was cool for maybe a whole month, before it became a joke.

You mean, you want to rank them in age?

You can use "first, second, third, fourth"  (example:  David is my first son.  **is my second son.  *** is my third son.  **** is my fourth son)

or you can use, "my eldest son..........my youngest son..... "

Or you can just tell their ages and let the person figure it out. (David is ___.  ** is ____.  *** is ____....etc)

Well, you can say them in any random order, but here's how I would do it...

"My oldest son, David, is 11 years old. Joey is 9, Robbie is 5, and my youngest, Josh, is 2."

Obviously, those arent the ages or names, but yeah.

Both ways are proper english.  You are doing just fine with the language.  Keep it up.  You can also add, "who is ___ years old" for additional clarification since you have four sons.

"Elder" is the same as "older". So David is Joey's elder brother.
"Oldest son David, next son Joey...."
"First son David, second son Joey..."
These would be common ways to describe your sons in English.

WHAT???  Just call them SON #1, 2, 3, & 4...Don't they have names? Call them by their DAMN names!! WHAT ARE YOU ASKING??? Names don't come in languages. David is David and Joey is Joey! Most things in America aren't "American" per se...English is a mixture of many languages. RELAX...and call those children by their given names.

The only way you'll improve your speaking skills is... speaking. I suggest you try to join a conversation club or hire a tutor to practice. It's not the same with a friend because your friend won't tell you when you are wrong, he doesn't want to hurt your feelings..
Make an extra effort and speak English at work, whenever they talk to you in English, answer in English. Just one step at a time, start with short sentences, then you'll feel more confident to have full conversations. And forget that idea that your English skills are bad, confidence is the most motivating factor, other people make mistakes too, so don't worry.

My native language is English, and I'm learning French in college. To practice my pronunciation and comprehension skills, I downloaded a bunch of French songs and sang along with them in my car all the time. It helped a lot.

Also, another thing you could do is find another person who is also learning English as a second language, so you can both practice having conversations in English. But make sure this person does not speak Vietnamese so you won't be tempted to switch back if you're getting frustrated with English.

And, just know, speaking is the most difficult for EVERYONE.  And, the only way I learned Spanish (to speak, after ten years of study) was to go live there.  I had to live in Spain to learn to REALLY speak.



Practice with anyone that you possibly can.  Get to an English speaking place when you can.  And spend at least 4 months, but optimally over 10.

Learning any type of language, even English, is not something that can be learned overnight. If you want to improve your English skills by your own, I suggest that you read a lot of books first in order to improve your vocabulary. Then, as much as possible, try to practice writing and speaking in English. Last of all, just practice and practice and practice. If you don't practice speaking in English how will you be able to know if you are improving, right?



You know, I'm a Filipino and our native language is Filipino. I also had a rough start in learning English. But, due to years of self-studying through reading and practicing, I improved a lot. Just be patient.

There are a lot of websites that can help you improve your English. You can also download some software in the internet or buy some English books. It's entirely up to you.

I hope I helped you. Good luck!

<answer>



In Spain, the letter z and c before e or i is pronounced exactly like "th" in the English word "thick". This sound only occurs in Spain, it is not used in Latin America, where bot these letters have the same sound as "s" (hard "s" as in "bass", never soft "s" as in "rose").

The letter "d", especially at the end of a word or between vowels, often sounds like the soft "th" sound in "then", but more often is hardly sounded at all.

Theta as in the Greek letter?

I know an Argentine girl who when she says something with a LL it sounds like "th" + "s"



Like, "Me llamo Antonio" would sound like, "May th-samo An-toe-knee-oh" if she said it.

In Spanish though, she can pronounce English properly.

In the context of a sports game you'd say "Deutschland vor!"
It rhymes with "...noch ein Tor!" (=another goal!) ;-)

or "Vorwärts, Deutschland!"

This should be a correct translation.. most people get theres off translators.

so..... Gekomme auf Deutchland,
Kommen auf deutchland ETC
are grammatically incorrect in german
So you could be saying something compleatly different to what you asked. :)

He is obviosly refering to cheer for a country in Sports (football for example) otherwise he would say "come in Germany" so the German girl before me its right, its: Deutschland Vor!!



Please think a little before answering, specially if English its not your mother tongue, so many "translator answers" when this question is intended for a German speaking person.

why do you use plural? did you have many diners with this person?

After 1 dinner you have to say: merci pour cet excellent dîner



merci pour ce merveilleux dîner



merci pour ce charmant dîner

after several dinners: merci pour ces excellents dîners



merci pour ces merveilleux dîners



merci pour ces charmants dîners

the adjective depend of the sense you want to say or to whom you want to write it.
between 2 friends: merci pour cet excellent dîner
between man and woman (hot feelings!): merci pour ce merveilleux dîner!

You're not learning "Irish" or "Hispanic."  If your teacher is calling them this, they are misinformed.  Both are demographics, neither a language.  Now, they may have meant learn the local grammar (as in Irish) and study the Spanish language, but since I was not there, I can not say for sure.



Now Irish can be considered a dialect, but Hispanic is not one.

It is correct to say "if I were her I'd change my mind". I'd representing I would and I'll representing I will. When talking of oneself you can state what you WILL do. When refering to others and their objective thought we are only assuming to know what they WOULD do, thus WOULD is the correct word, so I'd is the correct abbreviation.

Hope that helps. :)

Hi... everyone is right.



The correct way would be: ¨If i were her, i would (i´d) change my mind¨ 
By that you mean you are not her, so the action is unreal and therefore the consequence must be written in the same form, which in grammar is called the subjunctive form and , as i said, is used for unreal or hypothetical actions.

I would or I´d.



I only wanted to reinforce what everybody has just said!
Take care. :)

"If I were her, I'd change my mind." 
Were is used here as a sort of continuous present so "I would" or "I'd" is suitable. "I will" is future therfore not suitable in this context.

while gramatically correct, this statement seems to be awkward

a more comfortable way to say the same thing (depending on the context, of course) would be something like:

That's not a good idea
or 
That's not the best decision
or
If it was me, I wouldn't have made that decision

or something like that

Hispanic Studies



I originally posted this: 
I have to learn Irish and Hispanic in class, I’m Irish so I know what Irish is but what language is Hispanic??



This is what I have to study: 
Both of these courses comprise core subjects drawn from English Literature, History, Philosophy, and Theology, and elective options drawn from subjects such as Communications & Media Studies, Creative Writing, Drama & Theatre, Irish Studies, Languages (An Ghaeilge, Hispanic Studies), Psychology, Social Studies, and World Religions
Have a look at this site, it’s my college, perhaps I got it incorrect but at 5am!!

There is a difference between Hispanic, and Hispanic Studies. You need to post the whole thing before asking us for an answer.
I'm guessing Hispanic studies involves the history and/or culture of Hispanics.

The subject description from the link you gave:

Hispanic Studies – These courses are suitable for beginner- and intermediate-level students of the Spanish language.  As well as developing students’ language skills, the courses also explore the cultures of Spain and Latin American nations through a consideration of Hispanic art, cinema, and literature in translation.

Hispanic studies is NOT a language course, though it may be 
a) taught by the language or Spanish department and
b) taught IN spanish

It would be a study of all things hispanic...culture, literature, history of all the countries where Spanish is spoken.  It would include some things that are native american, as those are parts of the culture of the Americas, and fall under the rule of Spanish-cultured countries....

So, it might include things from Spain, Mexico, Central America and the countries in South America where Spanish is the major language, and a couple of the Caribbean Islands.

And might even include something about the history of the American Southwest, where Spanish colonization played such an important role.

In using your example, 'Champion' appears to become a Noun. So the use of 'The' is necessary. However, if you were to classify 'Man United' as a collective they become 'Plural' and 'Champion' becomes a 'Plural' too. You then don't need the 'The'!

'Man United are champions'

I hope this helps in some way...

vita sentimentale

It actually means sentimental life.  According to my grandmother, there is no real translation close enough to the actual English term 'Love life'.  But according to her, this is the closest you can get.

LOL even though the translation Elisa got is correct (RARE in online translations) i can't believe she didn't use common sense and just have a native speaker translate for you.  luckily her translation is right.  it doesn't register w/ her that maybe you might want to have a NATIVE SPEAKER give you a translation that you are going to permanently have on your skin for the rest of your life.

NOTE: ANYTIME SOMEONE ASKS FOR A TRANSLATION THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GET TATTOOED ON THEM....NEVER USE BABELSHIT OR GOOGLE!!!!!  WHY TATTOO SOMETHING THAT VERY POSSIBLY WILL NOT MAKE SENSE.



anyway, amare la vita is correct.

EDIT: omg Ck's answer is completely wrong!!! amore la vita does NOOOOOTTTT mean love of life.  it means 'the life love'.  that is exactly what it means.  La means 'the' NOOOOTTT 'of'.  of is Di.  love of life would ACTUALLY be Amore Per La Vita (liter: love for life.)

am i seriously the only italian speaker on this question?  everyone is either like 'well, i think this is how you say it, but i'm not sure.' or, 'here's a google translation that's completely wrong that you are going to be stuck w/ the rest of your life.'

IF YOU DON"T SPEAK ITALIAN&lt; DO NOT ANSWER ITALIAN QUESTIONS&lt; THERE ARE OVER 75 MILLION NATIVE SPEAKERS THAT CAN TRANSLATE THIS JUST FINE!  IT IS NOT DEAD LIKE LATIN.  GOOGLE IS GOOD FOR TRANSLATING ONE WORD ONLY.  ITALIAN IS ONE OF THE MAJOR WORLD LANGUAGES!  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.  YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS POOR GIRL SPEND A FORTUNE TATTOOING A SENSELESS BABELFISH TRANSLATION ON HER SKIN THAT SHE WILL BE STUCK W/!!!!  NATIVES ONLY.

"He became known as having the biggest schlong in showbusiness. Well I wouldn't go that far. He liked to get his knob out at any time. Once, in the early days, we'd had a few drinks and were running around naked. I was always the one with the camera. We came home from the tour and I completely forgot about it and just bunged the film into Boots. I got a shock when my sister picked it up. It didn't look good."

According to Google Language it is:

Él llegó a ser conocido como el mayor espectáculo en schlong. Bueno, yo no iría tan lejos. Le gustaba llegar a su mando a cabo en cualquier momento. Una vez, en los primeros días, nos había unas copas y se corren de un lado desnudo. Siempre fui el uno con la cámara. Llegamos a casa de la gira y me olvidé por completo al respecto y sólo bunged la película en Botas. Me dio un shock cuando mi hermana recogió. No se ven bien.

"Virilidad gigante:

Él llegó a ser conocido por tener el pene más grande en la farándula o (del negocio del espectáculo, supongo que se trata del negocio de la pornografía).  Bueno, yo no llegaría a tanto.  A él le gustaba sacarse el pene por cualquier razón (en cualquier momento).  En una ocasión, en los primeros días, nos habíamos tomado unas copas y andábamos desnudos (run around naked no necesariamente quiere decir que uno esté CORRIENDO en ese estado de indumentaria o falto de ropa, quiere decir que uno ANDA DESNUDO,).  Yo era la que siempre traía la cámara.  Llegamos a casa de la gira, yo había olvidado por completo (lo sucedido), y nada mas retaque la película en unas botas.  Quedé pasmada cuando mi hermana la recogió.  Las cosas no se veían nada bien.

Hi,



In the first sentence,  using both "believe" and "seems" is somewhat redundant.  "The system you have set up for the "$200 cash" seems to be little more than a confidence game to use other peoples' ideas."

In the second sentence you seem to be saying the opposite of what it appears that you would want to say.  You say that "unless I do not receive..." when it appears that you really mean "unless I receive."



Also, saying legal court is somewhat redundant and not well phrased.  You could say a court of law, but the context is probably sufficient to indicate that the court you're taking it to is a court of law rather than, say, a tennis or volleyball court.  Also, you have misspelled "receive" if you are writing in USA English. 
So, you could say, "Unless I receive my "$200 cash" compensation, I will definitely  take this matter to court."

Hope this helps.
FE

It is my opinion that the system that you have employed for the ¨$200 cash¨ is nothing more than a fradulent means of obtaining other people´s ideas for your personal gain.  I am hereby informing you that if I don´t receive my "$200 cash" compensation immediately, I will be taking legal action against you.

L'omertà è l'atteggiamento di ostinato silenzio atto a non denunciare reati più o meno gravi di cui si viene direttamente, o indirettamente a conoscenza.

Il termine omertà è di origine incerta, si trovano tracce del suo uso già a partire dal 1800. Alcune fra le teorie sulla sua origine la collegano alla parola latina humilitas (umiltà), che sarà poi adottata dai dialetti dell'Italia meridionale e modificata in umirtà. Dalla forma dialettale si potrebbe dunque essere arrivati alla forma italiana odierna.

L'omertà è molto diffusa nei casi di reati gravi, soprattutto se commessi dalla criminalità organizzata, come mafia, Sacra Corona Unita, camorra e 'ndrangheta. L'utilizzo del termine omertà nell'ambito giornalistico, allude ad un sentimento di solidarietà verso la responsabilità dei crimini che tende a giustificare l'insuccesso dell'azione repressiva da parte dello Stato. Appare dunque, come un viatico finalizzato a purgare l'inadempienza di una seria politica della sicurezza, giustificando l'insuccesso attraverso la colpevolizzazione di singole cittadinanze che di fatto risultano mortificate sia dalle azioni criminali, sia dall'accusa di complicità.

L'omertà può essere praticata anche da una comunità, più o meno estesa, governata da una autorità non riconosciuta. In questo caso i tentativi di autonomia ed indipendenza a carattere criminoso, come per esempio il terrorismo possono essere coperti dall'intera comunità.

<question>



Could someone help me translate some English words to Thai and help with pronunciation?  This is not homework!?



I am trying to find a really unique name for my Siamese kitten (she is a stray that just walked into my house!)  and I would like to use a Thai name.  Here are some things I might like to call my new kitten in Thai:

Snowflake

rice wine

winter

fluffy

sweetie (or any term of endearment)

cute



pretty

soft

cream

If you could tell me how these are spelled and pronounced in Thai it would be greatly appreciated.  Also, if you could include any popular (or just interesting) Thai cat names that would be great too!  Thank you!

Could you help me with this phrase "little more than"?



I know “little more than” is like “no more than”, using in a negative sentence. I post the below paragraph to let you know the context. My question is that peer recognition is a positive concept plus a negative one -- a long shot, and the two contradictive concepts are under “little more than”. So I am confusing about the point of this sentence.

(source: NEWSWEEK)
They may be teenagers posting videos of themselves dancing like Soulja Boy, programmers messing around with Twitter's tools to create cool new applications or aspiring game developers who want to create the next big thing. But what they all have in common is a somewhat surprising willingness to work for little more than peer recognition and a long shot at 15 seconds of fame.

Peer recognition in this context is not a negative thing - it is the thing that the teens , in question, wish to attain.

In your sentence it means "not a lot".

In this sentence "My breasts are little more than two aspirin on an ironing board."



it means (What is that word that means parallel expression?) but still the same

first you are confused,not confusing-he's saying "it's surprising that they'd be willing to work so hard for such a minor thing"-peer recognition is not considered positive by the writer/speaker.

"little more than" in this pargraph is emphasizing that they are prepared to work many hours etc for little or no financial reward but just to be seen as cooler by there peers.

In this case, the use of the term is exactly as you suggested- if these people (in the article) are lucky, the very most they can expect to gain is a tiny little bit of recognition.



Another way we can use the term is to say "&lt;X&gt; is basically &lt;Y&gt;". For example, "the boss' treatment of his staff was little more than bullying." This means that, in this case, the boss' behaviour pretty much bullying and we can't really pretend that it was anything better.

Hope that helps. It's a funny thing, English!

The author expresses "surprise" that they are willing to work towards these two goals ( peer recognition & 15 seconds of fame ), and using "little more than", the author conveys his belief that "peer recognition" is simply not enough.

Peer recognition here is viewed as a negative concept. I would interprete it as suggesting there are higher and more noble aims in life other than just trying to get noticed by your peer.

translation: In the sense that as for this composition, "composition of message being used, hiragana, katakana and Chinese character, very it is one of the English spheres with it is not understood". Japanese is, or



Kind of rough, but they have a bit more meaning behind their stuff in Japanese.  Phraseology is disconcerting sometimes.  Almost backwards at times. Last sentence seems to be incomplete.

This sentence meaning is, "The message's hiragana, katakana, and kanji are not being used by the English-speaking world because they cannot understand it."  I think writing in Japanese is especially difficult and it's an amazing thing an English-speaker can learn, I'm a professor, it's a little tense.

It would be like this:

This sentence means "the sentence(s) in the message is(are) written in hiragana, katakana and kanji. How can I imagine this is written by a native speaker of English?"
I think it is difficult to write Japanese. It is amazing (that you can write??? - I don't know what it refers to) Do you teach English? You are a teacher. I am a bit nervous.

I don't know the context and the subjects are omitted. This might be wrong.
Hope this helps.

If you're trying to type something in an alphabet your keyboard doesn't allow, try googling something like "Russian online keyboard", only replacing whatever language you need for "Russian." What page are you referring to?
