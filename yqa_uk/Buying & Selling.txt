<question>



I want to buy a VW Golf from a VW dealership but after doing a HPI check there is still finance owed on it.?



Does anyone know if this is normal? I am going to speak to the dealership about this but I'm concerned that they are just going to say that it's normal to try and sell me the car. 
Is it normal for franchised dealers to sell cars that still have finance shown against the car? Is it a case of the finance has been cleared by the dealer when part-exchanging the car but the HPI details haven't been updated yet??
I'd be very grateful if somebody could point me in the right direction on this.

It's certainly not usual for franchised dealers - they should have done this themselves & sorted out any problems.
If I were you, I'd shop elsewhere - they're obviously pretty slack with their paperwork.

Leave it. There are hundreds of Golfs for sale out there, buy one from a dealer who's got his act together. Preferably not a VW one, since they'll skin you!

Safety is paramount for you and your baby. Subarus are safe cars but they are not reliable. They're in the bottom 5 of JD Powers ratings for dependability. Far too many problems that require a lot of down time in the shop. Same with VW. They make very safe cars but you can't depend on them to always get you to point B.



A certified used Audi with quattro is your best bet. They're built like tanks, very good on gas (87 or 89 octane) and quattro is the safest of any all wheel drive system available today. And the certified warranty means it went through a 300+ point inspection. More than double any of its competitors. And you get complete factory warranty coverage for 6 years or 100,000 miles from the day the car was first sold.



A two year old Audi A 4 with 30,000 miles still has 4 years or 70,000 miles left on the warranty. Quattro is the best all wheel drive system made. And no other car is built as solidly as an Audi. Just try bending the hood on one. Or put all your weight on any door that's open. The door will not sag or bend. And the hood won't buckle or bend either.

I'm a Nissan sales manager. I own an Audi A6 with quattro and my wife has a Q7. I also have a Nissan company car. Any time it rains or snows, or if we're taking a trip, we use our Audis.

Should I trade my 99 Blazer for a 92 Integra?



I own a 90 acura integra RS, and I love it! I get great gas mileage and the car is awesome. I also own a 99 Blazer with hardly any problems. It has brand new tires that are oversized, a nice body, and only minor problems, such as the electric seats won't work. It has 135-140k.



I had an offer for it. I don't understand most of this stuff, but I don't think his Integra is worth my blazer. So should I even accept the Integra or not? And if so, I was thinking he would have to pay some, since kbb.com says that the integra is worth like 13-1600 and the blazer is 21-2900, although we were asking 3500 because it comes with the new, oversized tires and a new CD player and stuff. This is the guys message --

"its a 92 integra ls 5 speed.



body has aroound 200k  the motor has around 90k  and it has the posi trac  lsd tranny with about 45k.



it has new brakes and rotors front and back  and i bled them but they lose pressure when stopping.  it stops but pedal goes to the floor.  and it idles funny sometimes.  i think it might be a vaccuum leak somewhere causing both problems.  and i think it might need a motor mount or tranny mount soon.  i took the drivers side windo off track cuz the switch quit workin.  i was gonna replace the whole interior with gray so i popped it off track to put it down.



it has many new parts though.  i replaced the timing belt, drivers side axel, plugs battery, and some others all within the last 250 miles.



the body is solid. has some paint issues. i fixed some dents and rust spots.  i ran out of paint.  it looks good though. just needs a lil touch up."



Thanks in advance!

do not buy this 92 integra, as u can see in his descrpition he had a engine swap so something bad must have happened to the orignal motor.. the brakes loose pressure and sink to the floor because the master brake cylinder is bad - 250-300 dollars to fix it, the problem of it idlling could be costly, motor mounts and tranny mounts mann this car is falling apart dont buy it ur better off with ur blazer

I am about to purchase my first car. Im interested in this corsa. Does it sound mechanically ok?



does it sound like it is a bad car which is going to break down a weak after bought.



2001/Y Vauxhall Corsa 1.2 SXi 3 Door

This could be a very cheap little car for someone wanting a sporty Corsa.

It's generally clean throughout however as you will see from the photographs, the front bumper is slightly out of alignment. The paintwork is bright and the car drives well but there is slight driveshaft clicking when the vehicle is on full-lock.

Only 41,000 miles - we have the last three MOT certificates verifying the mileage and a couple of service invoices.

MOT'd until December 18th 2008.

Starting at £1,000.00 with NO RESERVE!!

I suggest you need to have a real good look at this car again.
Drive shaft clicking after 41,000 miles should not happen in
normal conditions, it`s much too early in the cars life.
Are the front tyres new or nearly new. Is the owner quite
young. Why is the front bumper slightly out of alignment.
Not trying to put you off but the car might have been thrashed
which would explain the drive shaft clicking.

don't buy it, the clicking noise will cost  u money, and the bumper out of alignment means it has had a bang. there are plenty of cheap cars out there that are in perfect order it just means looking a little longer, good luck, don't buy someone Else's problems.

I'd avoid this one;

http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/2001-Vauxhall-Cors...

What you failed to mention is that it's a Category 'D' write off, which means it's been an insurance total loss.
This devalues it seriously, as any future insurer may not pay out to repair it in the event of a claim (although they will pay out on any other vehicle involved in an accident with you).

The bumper misaligned will probably be due to missing or damaged parts hidden behind, this could cost hundreds to fix.
As above, that's a pretty low mileage for driveshaft noise, and if it's that simple, they would have fixed this before selling it.

It was recorded damaged in 2005, so it's a bit of a coincidence to only have the MOTs since then, so the mileage could well have been different prior to it's accident.

WALK AWAY FROM THIS ONE.

I got it after an I sued a drunk driver for slamming into my old new car. I sued because it was her 5 DUI in 11 Months. And also, my medical bills were ridiculous. I got enough money from my insurance and my lawsuit to buy it. It is a descent car. I get 24 MPG, but it is lacking certain things that a Crossover needs.

2) Less Plastic
3) Blind spot Mirror

I love that it has Microsoft SYNC though. That is one of the most wonderful inventions since the telephone. Also, the Vista Roof is really nice. I love how it is so big. Also, the MKX is styled really well.

Cheap cars for charity rally?



Hi guys,

Does anyone know of any websites that are reputable where I can look at cheap cars?  I am doing a charity rally next year and the first rule is that the car must cost less than £500. That's not to say it can't be worth more than that, i don't think anyway, but trying to find someone willing to sell a car for less than it's actually worth could be tricky.  ideally we wanted something like a Renault Espace, one of the old ones obviously, but i don't think we are all that fussed.  There is about 10 days solid driving across Europe mainly down motorways so it must be a good runner that is fairly reliable, I've had enough bad experiences on rallies!!!  if anyone knows of any reputable sites, i'd appreciate it very much!

Best bet is Ebay or Auto Trader. Bear in mind the bottom has completely fallen out the used car market just now, particularly where bigger cars are concerned. An Espace would be OK but they can be a bit troublesome. I'd look for an old Volvo estate or similar. You'll be surprised what you can get these days for £500!

Ebay's your best bet, but look around locally: In the pub last night, I bought a lovely Volvo 850 2.5 estate - MOT, tax, new tyres, 130k miles, private number plate, cruise, aircon, etc. - £300! Bloke is emigrating & wanted rid.

Both Snooper & Road Angel are good options for speed camera detection and will also have the speed camera databases loaded, though you will have to pay extra for updates.  You also need a system that can detect the radar guns some of which have a quarter mile range.  Remember that the average speed cameras can't be beaten as they measure the speed of a vehicle and the time taken over a set distance.

When you say 'speed detectors', what exactly do you mean?

It is legal to have a system (Road Angel, MicroGo etc) that warns of fixed camera positions by GPS location.

It is ILLEGAL to have a detector that locates cameras by radar.

Like the other posters said you can access previous dealership service history by providing the dealership with the VIN of your car.  They will usually print you off a copy free of charge.  However, it is important to note that these service histories are often incomplete as more expensive procedures such as tranny flushes and even spark plug replacements are often handled outside of the dealership.  One thing that dealership service histories do show however is if the car has had repeated warranty claims made on it.

I checked Kelly Blue Book (kkb.com) and it looks like Billy is right on. You're looking at maybe $700 for a trade it.
But honestly, I think trading in is kind of a scam. They'll tell you they're taking $700 off but some how they'll find a way to sneak that $700 back into the price of the car.

If you sell it to a private party you could probably get $1,200. But that takes time and energy. Another option is to donate the car (tons of places on the internet), then you can take a deduction on your taxes and you get to help some one out. A lot of places will come pick the car up and you don't have to hassle with it. Just an idea.

That depends if you're trading it in to a used car lot for another car. Or trading it in to a new car dealer. If you're trading it at a used car lot you may get $200-$400 for it, if the body and interior are in good condition. That means no tears in the seats, headliner or carpets and no dents and/or paint fade on the outside.

If you're trading it in to a new car dealer, I doubt anyone will take it in on trade. I certainly wouldn't. There's too much going against it. It's almost 13 years old, it has over 90,000 miles (the kiss of death for any car) and I would have to try to find a wholesaler (used car dealer) to buy it from me.

If it's going to make or break a deal, I'd give you $200 tops. You should count your blessings if you do get that (or more). The way I see it, if I can't find a wholesaler to unload it on, I could always donate it and I and my dealership would not be out much.

The bottom line is this ... would you buy at 13 year old car with 125,000 on it? I don't think so. Neither would anyone else. I wish you good luck.

The Focus is the most "Grownup" of the three, but I don't know if you see that as good or bad..  The Corsa is OK around town, but I wouldn't want to drive one a long distance.  The 206 is very popular for some reason - they sound very tinny when you shut the door and drone on the move (especially the diesels).

small cheap to run and cheap - you're likely to have a few scrapes.
also insurance will be lower - my daughter has a daewoo matiz - its tiny but 5 doors - really cheap to run - maybe not the coolest car in the

Color me crazy, but could you ever see yourself rolling in a Citroen 2CV? They're cute, reasonably cheap to run (besides breakdowns,) and most importantly, rest in the near-mythical class-1 insurance bracket. Yes, class 1! I guess its 1200LB curb weight and .6 liter motor means that if you hit another car at full speed, they'd just need a new bumber and bonnet, hence the cheapness to insure.

Get a small, classic car such as a Morris Minor, Classic Mini or even a Triumph Spitfire. These cars are low insurance groups for the kind they are. You are more likely to keep them as you become more attached to a car that has character (like my mums puke green morris minor which needs restoring) and they can also be reliable if properly maintained. If you become a member of owners clubs spare parts are no problem (MG MINI & MINOR) to come b y and are relatively cheap and they can also help get an extra discount on your insurance. Don't go anywhere near your Clio's, Corsa's or Saxo's. Get some British motoring history, keep it running, enjoy your time with it and love it.
the insurance quote I would expect for my hand me down Saxo is about £1200 for my dream car MINI I will expect about £750.

Skoda-Fabia,small and reliable.Its VW built.Try to find a Skoda in the small ads,rare.If theyre not up for sale that often,it may mean that not many people own one,but also they are a good car,because theyre hard to find one to buy.In a survey Skoda were also in the top 5 for reliability.

Subject to personal preference all these are arguably OK choices. However the Peugeot will be much more expensive for certain repairs owing to the manufacturers extortionate parts prices; if it goes wrong that is. The Ford is possibly the easiest to own all things considered.

Depends on your budget really - a basic runaround car like a Ford Ka is fairly simple & you might want to chance buying one from the small ads in your local paper, I try & judge the person selling as much as the car eg if its someone older & has all the Service history receipts MOT's etc or some chancer whose selling a car for a mate has no paperwork & who really is probably trading.
If you have any mechanic freinds who could go with you it can help you avoid buying junk or get a better deal.........

It belongs to the finance company, they may sell you it. Get rid of it now and don't be a nice guy and tell people. Just get rid of it. Have you put the papers in your name Yet, if not, sell it as the old previous owner.
Richard, do you know where they live? Take it back with a couple of geezers. They didn't lose the paperwork, they said that so you wouldn't find out about the finance.
I'd go round with the boys unless you know anyone in the Police who can have a word witht them.

&gt;&gt;  since been done and has come back as outstanding finance



If there's an outstanding financing, then they (the sellers) cannot have a clean title - and the car is NOT theirs to sell.

If they gave you a clear title, then the report was probably in error.

If they did NOT give you a title (clean or not), then they never sold the car and you can get the money back.
===
In the end the DMV will let you know what is the condition of the title (lien or no lien on the car).

Caveat emptor (buyer beware). Theoretically, you've paid for something which wasn't theirs to sell. Get back in touch with the seller & see what their response is. Unless they have a very good excuse, you're in trouble and you will undoubtedly face losing the car & your money whatever happens next.
You don't want the police after you, so contact the finance company & put them in the picture as to where the car is & see what happens.
You should also contact the police unless you had a satisfactory response from the seller, reporting the sellers as fraudulent, as if you don't, you're in the process of handling stolen goods.
DON'T just try to sell it on unless you're not worried about a fine or imprisonment & a criminal record.

You may have to sue the seller in small claims (unless that amount is over their limit) if that seller is unwilling to pay what they owe on the car right now.

Or get in touch with the finance company, hope they don't order the car back, and maybe they start badgering the previous owner for the rest of the money.

Or just keep paying and eat their cost, too.

Maybe you need to learn from a lesson like this!

are you in the US or UK?

US you'll need about $3K to $4,000

plus minimum of $200 a month for insurance and gas.

If you have taken drivers ed, get good grades, are added to your parents existing coverage and take a higher deductible you can save some money.

In the uk, road tax and insurance is at a high , for a fist time driver extremely high. I would go with a vahxhall corsa,citroen saxo,or Peugeot 106 as these have relatively small engines e.g 1.0litre,and popular among first time drivers. i know it's not power full but you don't want 2 get caught speeding in your first few years.For example a peugeot 106 is in group 4 for insurance which is relatively cheap as the groups go from 1-21.Hope i helped.

Reliability and Land Rover are antonyms. It looks like they are only considering foreign vehicles. Look at the Mercedes ML line. You may be surprised how affordable they can be, especially in pre owned. Also, the Nissan and Toyota are great SUVs, and the Highlander comes in a fantastic Hybrid edition.

As below, the Discovery shouldn't even be an option - unreliable, ungainly, uneconomical. The Volvo is the only option, but in the seven seat 4x4 market, the Japanese excel - You can't go wrong with a Nissan Pathfinder, but anything by Toyota or Mitsubishi is a good bet.

the disco is very unreliable...i know a guy who has had it in the garage loads of times and they still can't fix the problem. the xc90 is a good choice though, comfortable, stylish and very practical.

as mentioned before the likes of toyota with their landcruiser and nissan with their pathfinder are also good options but if it's style you're after you could also consider the audi Q7. it's german so it's going to be reliable and despite it's sloping roofline it still has 7 seats. drives nice too. it's the one i'd go for if i was in your position :-)

As for the 6 series i think its a lovely looking car the boot is a bit awkward but still looks good as a whole i would have the m6.

I love them all, even the 1 series, the 3-series has just had a face lift with terrible new rear lights (out later on this year). The new 7-series (out later this year) is absolutely gorgeous.

The 1-Series Range: OK, Needs To Be More Agressive
The 3-Series Range: Needs A Completely New Model, Coupe And Convertible Are Fine, They Need To Make The Normal Saloon Look More Like The M3 Saloon
The 5-Series Range: Superb In Every Way
The 6-Series: Superb
The 7-Series (Old and New): Fantastic
The Z4: Looks Great, But Its Time For A Change
The X3: Not Too Bad, Needs New Lights
The X5: Perfect
The X6: Excellent

Personally, I think the 8-Series was the best looking car BMW ever made.

But all of the above is just my opinion. To be honest, if I were gonna buy a BMW, I'd head straight for the New 7-Series, it's ugly at first, but look at it a couple of times more and you'll like it

Now we think a friend may have an ideal car for sale- but this means we have to sell ours.  What are our options, and what would you recommend as the best way?

PS this is a UK and Ireland question for those with difficulty with their settings.

Auto trader is the favourite amongst people I know, as it reaches a really wide market that way, and cars seem to sell really quickly. You can do it all online and it's very straightforward. Ebay motors is another option, especially if you are selling a bit of a banger!

You could try the local papers too, or just put a sign in the car window.
If you need to sell it quickly if you look in the car section of your local free paper there are usually people who will buy any cars - though for a rubbish price!

If you're in or near the London area, you can put a free ad with photos onto Gumtree - I did this with mine a few months back & got about 8-10 calls in the first couple of days, & sold the car within the week.

Otherwise, like the others are saying, try Fish4, AutoTrader, Exchange & Mart etc...

Good luck!

My first car? Need help! Thanks!?



I'm only 16 at the moment but I'm going to be 17 next year and that's when i can start driving lessons. I don't earn much money because I'm on an apprenticeship so i only get a set amount of money a week witch is £80 so i get £320 a month. What car is ideal for me? I'm thinking of getting a Renault clio. Also will a loan to get the car out be a good idea as i don't earn much? I'm going to save up as much money as i can before i start my lessons though.

Don't rush into anything, take your time and look at all the options, if you don't earn much, its very unlikely you will be able to borrow very much.  Also think about tax and insurance, and running your car, it isn't cheap these days, and at your age the insurance is going to be quite hefty.

im at the same point, except i can start lessons next month!
id say you really need to look for a car with good mpg and cheap insurance, so preferable a small(ish) one
you really dont want to be owing anybody money while you're so young so i wouldnt get a loan if i were you
you need to save as much money as possible cos once you pass you'll need to buy the car and thers insurance (like a grand)
ask for money for your birthday as itd help

I'd save up & buy what you can afford - finance for a car is never a good idea, you can buy really decent cars for around £500, and it'll mean no monthly payments, which will hhelp towards tax, insurance, maintenance etc.

Kia Rondo

a five-door crossover vehicle that debuted at the 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show. Based on the front-wheel-drive platform of the Kia Optima, the Rondo is shaped like a small minivan offering spacious legroom and headroom. Sharing engine, transmission and chassis components with the Optima, the Rondo is offered with a 162-horsepower 2.4-liter engine or a 182-horsepower 2.7-liter V6. The four cylinder comes with a 4-speed automatic while the V6 has a 5-speed automatic. Available in 5- and 7-passenger versions, the Rondo offers optional third-row seating that can fold down in a 50/50 split.



Highs: 	Ride, quietness, powertrain, access, versatility, controls, standard ESC, available third-row seat.
Lows: 	Unsupportive seat, steering wheel doesn't telescope, suspension noise.
The Rondo offers an impressive amount of room for its compact size. With seating for up to seven, it has minivanlike utility with the dimensions of a small car. It competes mainly with the six-passenger Mazda5. Built on the same platform as the Kia Optima, the Rondo also shares its 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine, as well as the optional 2.7-liter V6. Expect fuel economy of 21 mpg overall with the V6. Fit and finish is very good, and access is very easy. The ride is comfortable and quiet, and the powertrain is refined. Handling is not particularly agile, but it is secure. Stability control and curtain air bags are standard. (ConsumerReports)
.
Bottom Line Price Range: $15,156 - $18,328

this has been sold successfully in Europe for many years under the name Carens. It has a great warranty and is reliable.
the only negative is the low resale value but for a vehicle that comes fully loaded for less than the base price of a similarly equipped Toyota or Honda it's a great value.

I think you should get a van. They're built for many people and there roomy. Or you can get a navigator. I have one and it fits 7 people there expensive but if you get an old one it may be in your price range. You can also get an fx i also have one it fits 5 but the seats are like cups. and hopefully your not a tall family cuz then you'll probably bang your head to the car when you get in. and one of the drawers in front are made of cheap material an it scratches and dents easily.

The new 2009 VW TDI:  http://www.jdpower.com/autos/articles/20...  I just drove a Sedan and its really nice.  The sedan was priced $22 -24,000.  I think that the Sportswagen is nice, much more room for a family.



It doesn't smell like a diesel when running, its quiet and runs good.  Diesel fuel may cost a little extra, but the difference is more than made up by the mileage.

Fuel mileage better than a Prius

Contact the seller and ask them if they will accept a PayPal payment, if so, then create an account, have them send you a PayPal invoice or money request and PayPal will take it from your account without the seller having access to your bank details...you can use a credit card, or a bank account transfer to pay them.

For something as big and as expensive as a car I would sujest you arrange a meeting to look at it first and pay then. on line payment is always a bit of a risk and if it is for a £1000 or more it is not worth it.

Step outside of your house and deal in person with real people.  The risk of getting ripped off is reduced 2000% if you look them in the eye and negotiate the deal.

Here are some good cars to look at.

1) Lexus SC400/300. I had a friend in College who had one of these. For some reason, he wanted to trade cars with me for a weekend. I have no clue why he wanted to trade a $50,000 car for a 2003 Saturn Ion with 124,000 Miles. But he did. That car is one fast car. If you are not good with tons of power, I would turn away.

2) Acura Integra. This car is a modifiers dream. It is very common, but it is easy to find parts for, and you can get them for a good price. But, if you have some money left, I would invest in a stranger security system. This car is one of the most stolen in the US.

3) Toyota Celica. To say the least, this is just like a lower powered, not as good looking, Acura Integra. But, the good thing about this is that you can get one that is newer than the Integra for a lower or equal price.

4) Nissan Altima. This is more of a midsize car, but it offers safety, some performance, and a great resale value.



Good Luck



PS. I would avoid a stick shift if possible as a new driver. I know it is more fun, and makes you feel like a better driver, but it is not worth it. I had a Saab 9-3 as my first car and I wanted a stick shift. I got one and it just set me back. It is impossible to talk on a phone and drive with a stick, and traffic is a nightmare. Just a heads up.

Drivers, Owners and dealers: 1999 Land Rover Discovery II for sale !?



I have 1999 land rover Dis II, I just bought it for $3300, minur problem in the engin and minur problem in the transmission, I fixed both of them for $750 and another minur accident in the front left side (Driver side) I didn't fix it yet. To fix it I need Bumper,fender and turn signal, I found out that it is going to cost me $2000 just to fix the minur accident in the front. I am going to sell it without fixing the accident. So what do you think? How much I should ask for? where the condition inside and out + the engine is perfect. thanks so much.

&gt;&gt; Advice for a beginning female car salesperson?

Yes.  Don't.
===
&gt;&gt; I have also had great experiences/success selling *things* in the past.

Yes.  The difference with car sales, is that you don't just sale an item for a price already pre-determined.  With car sales, you are often trying to sell a car for the MAX - even to the point of screwing the client.  That is NOT honest.

Read the post / question here. There are many people who get screwed by NEW and USED car dealers.  And you may think I won't do that. But you will have no choice.  In a car dealership, the sales person don't have a final say in the deal, it is the general manager who does.  And he will push to screw each and every client.

Read few books on buying new cars (from a buyer's point of view).  You will be very surprised at the number of TRICKS they play on the clients.

===  Now this part is my opinion ===

I think it will make you a less of a "good" person to live like that.  Personally having worked in NYC wall street for a long time, I've seen many good people turn slowly evil.  I had to get out even though I lost my six figure income.

I agree with the previous poster. If you're good at sales, you might consider a different product. My cousin was a car salesperson and he felt he had to be dishonest and take advantage of people in order to be successful.



As far as the techniques they teach sales people (which I must admit are probably pretty affective with most folks) they tend to drive me away.



After an 'innocent' test drive, they basically get you to sit down and ask, "What will it take to get you to drive away in that car tonight?" When you try to explain you're only looking, they'll start in on, "What if I could do 'blank'. Would you buy the car?" I hate that kind of pressure, but as a salesperson explained to me, something like 90% of the time people walk away, they NEVER come back. So they're under a lot of pressure not to let you leave as well.



Another tactic is to for them to focus in how monthly cost. "What if I could get your monthly payment down 'blank', would we have a deal?" Then when you ask what kind of interest rate that is, they distract you by asking how your credit is. Bottom line, it's a scam.



Then in order to get out of the place they basically force you to either be (what seems like) rude and just walk away (with them following after you asking, "What if...?", or buy the damn car. Again, this probably works on a lot of people.

The person I just bought my car from gave me straight facts, was polite, and didn't pressure me at all. It was so refreshing I felt really comfortable trusting her and bought a Honda Pilot from her.



Unfortunately, that's not what makes most car sales people successful.



I don't know if this helps, but good luck in your career choice.

As above, the most cost effective is to ask a friend who knows about cars, or pay a mechanic from another garage to take a look.
The AA & RAC will give thorough vehicle inspections with written reports;

AA;

RAC;

as stated above, you'll pay over £100 for either of these services, but they are very thorough.

if you find a mechanic to inspect the car, tell him in advance, I want this car to run well. If it doesn't, you won't get my business.

It's tough to make guys understand. If they say the car is good, when it's not, they think they'll make money.

I'm older, so I could care less. I climb under a car and look for rust, oil leaks, you name it. You're better off to educate yourself.

65MPH Electric Car ?



People drive round in massive Audi petrol or diesel cars, spend £60.00 on fuel, use up OUR Environement, then have the cheek to moan about fuel prices.

But, would you be interested in buying an electric car, fully enclosed, Corsa/twingo sort of size, that did 65MPH maximum speed.

All you have to do is connect a 3 pin round plug lead to the side of the vehicle, the other end to a mains power supply, let it charge, then you can drive it.

Just think : No More Fumes!

Price : £15,000

Available in England (Made in Norway)

I would consider it, if it was able to go a reasonable distance in between charges. 65mph, however, is a little limited considering that is the speed limit on most major interstates and if you are not driving 10 to 20 mph over it you will be getting a lot of dirty looks.

I'll consider it when the refuelling issue has been solved.
My current car (neither an Audi nor massive) needs a 5-minute refuel every 600 miles (approx).

Also, 65mph doesn't leave enough in reserve to get out of trouble when someone in front does something stupid on the M25 - and presumably that speed is on the flat, so it will not be able to maintain a reasonable (i.e. safe, taking into account the speed of other road users) speed on the hilly sections of the A27 near Hove.

Not everywhere I park is in easy reach of a mains power supply, so that isn't actually a convenient refuelling method.

An electric car isn't fume-free - it just moves the fumes from the car to the power station. Before the UK moves to mass take-up of electric cars we need to overhaul our power generation to improve its cleanliness, and increase its capacity to cope with our transport needs.

I purchased a 2005 VW TRANSPORTER but 2 days later the engine ceased - How & Can i get my money back ?



I was the highest bidder on a VW Transporter 05 plate - 2.5 tdi, on Ebay. The description stated that it had a small stone chips on the bonnet and the bumper was slightly damaged,he said he was being over critical at that- the pictures looked like it was only cracked.  After a very long journey we finally saw the van, the stone chips was actually deep dents, there was a few cratches on the van. When we was looking at the stone chips - the seller opened the rear doors. 
When i saw the bumper it was badly split & dented, I immediatley stressed my concerns, asking when it had been hit from behind and was the frame work under the van ok, as i am not a mechanic, I wouldn't know what i was looking for.
 The seller was adimant that the damage was only to the outer bumper, and deucted £100 from the £5,300 i paid so i could purchase a new one.
 He told me that he had buffed and polished it the day before - i collected it.



When i got home i took it to a garage to get a quote for the bumper and was told the frame work was very buckled, the back door was jammed and only opened from inside, plus it would not lock (the lock swivled round). When close upto the van there was a fine green mist of paint on 1 panel. To get all these jobs done plus the frame work straightened - it was going to cost a small fortune.
 I tried to call and email the seller - who ignored me !!
On my way to pick up the parts (only the 2nd after purchase) the engine ceased. 
I have made contact by letter stating what is wrong with the van and i want a refund as the seller is a trader, this is clearly stated on the ebay listing but he had not registered as a trader and he said he was a trader who got his vans out of companies with 0 owners on the log book. As he was ignoring the letter, my partner sent him a message,



and the seller contact the police who phoned and said he had been threatened but wants to pay back all of the money, he will contact you tomorrow. He never made contact, i rang him to see what arrangements we could make and he told me i would not get a F***ing penny and see his solicitor, and slammed down the phone.
I dont know why he went to the police because the message was not threatening as such, just said how would he like to be ripped off with that amount of money and this problem will not go away. I think it may not have been the police who called. I have left negative feed back and i did not pay a penny through paypal - what can i do ? Is there a way to get my money back, as i read traders as to adhere to the sales of Goods Act. What steps should i take now, and i can't really afford a solicitor to take it to court. I appreciate your help and thanks in advance. x

If you paid with Paypal you can file a complaint and consequently get your money back (as the item was not as described). However, this can take time as he can just deny it and it could end up with you losing more money (as you have to pay to try and get your money back). If that doesn't work - you're not covered by any federal law so there's nothing you can really do.

EDIT - OKAY, I've looked it up and you ARE covered (Item significantly not as described). Look at this:
http://pages.ebay.com/help/tp/inr-snad-p...
and read about how you start a dispute (with paypal as your, sort of, lawyer). You should be able to get your money back within 30 days.

Hope this helped and let me know how you got on.

If you paid through Ebay, you may be able to go through them for assistance.

I'm not sure as I have not used that service in a few years.

Otherwise, check your local auto consumer laws.

If you were in the USA, you are pretty much out of luck as this sale would be considered "AS IS" and you assume any risk with the vehicle upon purchase.

Also, there was NO EXCUSE for you not getting the vehicle inspected.  There are mobile auto mechanics that can travel to a site to inspect a vehicle for you.  For such a costly investment, that is stupid not to have that done!

The good condition book value for your car is around £700, the exhaust & stereo won't add anything to the resale value, and 'a few bumps & scratches' should reduce it by around £100 per damaged panel (the cost of repair & respray).
Very unpopular, unreliable cars, you may struggle to sell it at all, I'm afraid.

I am not sure what taxes you are refering to. If you buy a car in Britain to export it permanently to France because you live there permanently, then you should register it with French number plates. This is not cheap, you have to go to your prefecture with a certificate of conformity from the manufacturers and various other documents. You will need a 'Controle Technique' (French MOT) and you will have to have the appropriate headlights or you will not pass the controle technique. You will then get your 'carte grise' and French number plates and then you don't have to pay road taxes as there are none to pay.

If you buy a car in Britain and take it to France because your permanent residence is in France, you should notify the DVLA in Swansea, just as you would if you moved house within the UK. Your English Insurance will only cover you for a short while then you should get French insurance. When you get French insurance they will tell you to get French number plates as soon as possible.

Generally speaking the most reliable small cars are Japanese. Honda, Nissan etc. Always look for full service history. Usually abbreviated to FSH. If the car has been serviced regularly, the chances are it will be in reasonable health. Modern engines do high mileages these days, if they are looked after. Quentin Wilson did a super booklet on buying a used car which would be invaluable to you if you can locate it!

I don't know what some people's perception of British and Foreign cars are BUT....

NIssan's Micra is British  -  built in Washington Tyne & Wear
Toyota's Yaris is, I believe, built in France
The Corsa is, or was, built in Spain.

i dont know the guy, the car is a bit out of shape, its £1250

so we agreed to leave me the car but take the keys, tomorrow he's coming to leave the car and to take the cheque, how can i make sure that he's not gonna take it when im not around (since he's keeping the keys) and how do i know its not stolen? is there some paper i can just ask for to keep until things are sorted out? please help i never bought a second hand car before

Dont know where you hail from , but, why dont you go to the bank and get cash so that you can have the car asap and get the registration etc now.
 Also, you need a signed reciept for the money and car, with his name on it and positive ID like a license etc. Which you need to photo copy and write all the data down.

Answer is probably don't buy it. You can take the registration number to you local police station and ask them if the car is stolen and is it registered to the name and address the seller has given you. Be very careful

If you don't like the deal, just walk away!  There'll be plenty of other cars to buy.



However!  Traditionally, people buy used cars with cash, because of all the scams and fraud going on, the seller doesn't want to get ripped of by you when he gives away his car for a rubber check.



If the car is somehow missing before you get keys and the title ("pink slip") then call you bank and tell them to stop payment on that check!

Get a bankers draft from your bank - it costs roughly £2 but it's easier than waiting for the cheque to clear. Ask to see the log book (V5C registration form) and ensure the car does belong to they guy that is selling it (ask to see id if necessary).



Like a previous post says, you can contact the police to see if it has been stolen). An additional check you can make is to run a hpi check on the car. This will give a lot more details (just click on the link below).



Also cover the basics - make sure the car has some service history, with a valid MOT, tax disc etc.



I wouldn't be too worried about the payment terms - there is no way I would sell a car to someone and accept a cheque, there's no telling if it will bounce.



Good luck, and I hope you enjoy your new car!

Be sure you've run a CARFAX.com report before you even think of buying the car.  Get the vehicle identification number and look at the history of the car. 
As prior post notes, your intuition is your guide!  Should NEVER buy a used car without a thorough mechanical inspection so you know what needs service.

In a private purchase it would be very uncommon for a stranger to accept a check.  How does he know it's a good check or that you're not going to cancel it?

You should just go get cash and give it to him so it's done.  That way you'll get the keys and the title right away--that's how you'd know it's not stolen by the way.

You will need a friend in the car business, someone who you can trust and has a wholesellers license. They can take you to the Manheim Auto Auction in the bay area. I use this frequently to purchase highline cars and some bikes for my business.

Google Manheim Auto Auctions for all dates, times, and inventory at the auctions. This will include a Nationwide list of auctions.

No, I have rebuilt a couple of series Landys and know lots of people who have them.

You will find it near-on impossible to insure as a 17yr old as many of my friends have found out.

If you're really set on one, contact the National Farmers Union insurance dept, the just MIGHT provide cover, but it will be very costly, Land Rovers can inflict a lot of damage!

In addition to insurance concerns you need to consider the cost of upkeep. If you have a limited budget you may consider a car that is smaller and newer that would need less in the way of parts down the road....

First of all, good for you that you're after a cool old classic and not some grotty blandmobile!...now the bad news...
You'll never find a S11 lightweight Landie for anywhere near £500, unless you take it home in a bucket. Even a S111 will be pretty well ruined at that money. They are primarily sold as working farm machinery, don't forget.
I'd say a minimum figure for a half decent Landie would be a grand, sorry.
Insurance may well be a problem too, but you're going to get stung at 17 regardless, so be prepared for at least a £1000 bill.
For £500 why not go for something like a Triumph Herald or an old Vauxhall Viva or something from the late 60s? Have a scout through the classic car section of Ebay and see what takes your fancy.

The Manheim Market Report which provides dealers with a tool to determine the wholesale prices of vehicles can be adjusted for regional differences and for the season (time of year).  I'm not real big on Geography but Northhampton and Birmingham sound like they're not far enough apart to have any real difference in prices.  My guess is that they would be the same since the MMR wouldn't be any different between them.  However, auction fees could be very different and the only way to know what they charge is to call and ask them to fax you a copy of their Buyer's Fees.

If you have a dealer's license, you can buy the software from them that gives you the latest, up-to-date auction prices at all your local sites. But if you don't have that license, you won't have access to any of their information. And you won't be able to attend any dealers auctions.

If you have a family member or friend that's a dealer, you can ask them for the info. Hopefully, they'll share it with you.

I collect goods for our local air ambulance charity and due to lack of funds have decided to swap my car for a suitable van. must be long wheel based and a high top. car is currently out of mot but will happily put 12 months on for the right offer. will be sad to see her go, but needs must...as they say!!!
thanks for reading

sounds ok, but a word of warning . it will cost you hell of a lot more to insure a commercial vehicle ( van ) so if cash is short you could be shooting yourself in the foot. good luck.

Not sure about best,as that is subjective.
But the coolest I think,is nitrous oxide if it is a gasoline scooter.
They have very small shots of nitrous(some use C02 type cylinders) for these and they can be very fun.
If it is an electric scooter,than maybe look at getting a battery with higher amperage to spin the electric motor quicker.
For the nitrous kit,just do a search for scooter,moped,nitrous or something along that line.
For overamping the motor,you should be able to talk to a local vo-tech automotive instructor or simply start learning more about electronics.
Maybe do a search for RC cars or power wheels,as that is where I learned it.

It says 4 wheel drive by the features and I did not know they came with 4 wheel drive.  I would look into that.  Mileage is pretty high but the price is pretty low too so the deal is not bad.  I just do not trust when people don't even know what features the car has, especially if it's their own car.  They certainly use a lot of tire shine.

it could be a really good deal if it was true, but look at the feedback on the seller. it's 0. so this could be one of the people that you would buy from and he would never send you this item. plus don't forget international buying rules is different than local rules. becareful. thanks.

I bought a car on finance with my wife but we have now split and im looking for a way out of the finance?

Unfortunately, there is no way out. The car is in your name. You're responsible for paying off the loan. The only way out is to sell the car and pay off the loan. If you're upside down in it, you'll have to pay the difference to the lender to complete the sale. If the amount is too much, you have only two choices:

1) keep paying on the car until you're at a break even point, then sell it.
2) let it go into repo and destroy your credit for 7 to 10 years.

If it gets repo'd you won't be able to finance anything, not even toothbrush, until it's completely off your credit history. 7 to 10 years is a very long time to go without credit. And the lender will sell it at auction then sue you for the balance still owed after it's sold. It can have your wages, bank account, money market account, etc. attached to collect what's owed them.

You do have another alternative but it's along shot. If a close family member needs a car, ask them to take over payments on yours or share the payment with you. Either way, the car stays in your name until you can pay it off or have it repo'd.

it's not good news at all but it's what you're facing now.

Photo's can be deceiving, also you can't tell from photos if the car needs a replacement gas cylinder or clutch or engine etc. It's better off taking a professional with you to check the car out in person, and why would he be selling it so cheaply?

My guess it it has a lot of miles (150,000 or so) given the price.
Either that or it has a marked (totaled, reconstructed/salvage) title.

Or maybe it's got another problem.

It's based on a Paris-Dakar style of bike, so it's pretty tall compared to most other 125s on the market.  It's a solid, reliable bit of kit, too.

6'6"???.....forget the 125. You've gotta weigh at least 210-220lbs and that little 125 will be dying under your weight. Go for either a 250 2-stroke, or get a 400-450 4-stroke. Both Yamaha and Honda sell excellent bikes and they will fit you like a glove (I'm 6'4" myself). Never once had an issue fitting on a 250+ dirtbike, but the 125's are better suited for guys under 6' and 185, preferably 5'8" and 150lbs. KTM also makes a pretty nice bike, but I can't speak for their quality. In general, you can't go wrong with any of the bikes that are available, so go for the one that looks the best to you, and is in your price range. Good luck dude!

Rusty body for a '98? Not good. If it's surface rust, then your okay structurally. A starter will run for about 100 bucks if you put it in yourself.  Did it not come with ac or was it taken out? If so what was taken out? If it was the compressor, then that shouldn't be to hard or too expensive, but if it needs duct work and an evaporator and a condenser, then it will be expensive.

If they're only asking 500 for it then you'll probably have the money for repairs..i'm not really sure how much all that stuff will cost. Also, how many miles are on the car? thats a big deal. Its a toyota so it'll definatly last you awhile if you put the work into it, and an older car for a newer driver is great idea..I hate when these rich kids are driving around in hummers and mercedes for their first car..your a new driver..its almost guaranteed you'll hit something. haha

Dude whats your price limit to get a car?

If it has the things listed wrong with it it probably wasn't taken care of and there are probably countless more things wrong with it.

I wouldn't get that particular one, but a corolla is a VERY reliable car and gets good gas mileage. Look for one in better condition thats costs more. You can find em for under 2.7k.

I am 20 years old and drive a BMW, people look at me weird?



It is not the latest BWM but a 2004 model and all my uni friends drive, saxo's, 106's, 206's etc.

Should I sell my car and just get a standard car so I fit in?

I admire your choice, good luck to you.



I had been looking at a few of these cars for some time, I thought the second hand prices were very low.



One of my  Daughters has one, a great car , fantastic to drive etc.



I had some unwanted stuff to sell and I placed an ad' in the local paper, nothing to do with cars.



A BMW pulled up in the drive, a very young couple got out , I showed them my stuff , they knocked my price down a bit, OK fair deal!



I helped them load it up in their car boot, I said to the young woman, "nice car surprising how cheap they are to buy now is 'nt it "?



She said " Yes but sushsss no need to tell every one"!



Do what you want and good luck to you, all I will say is that much as I like the car any repairs will cost a fortune, much more than a pair of new slippers.



I had a mercedes , fantastic car, once it started to go wrong it cost me a fortune, same with my Daughters BMW.



But you will learn all this as you go along , it's all part of this learning curve thingy.



Enjoy while you can.

Nah don't bother... BMW's are (as you know) great car's...

And if you like it, then you should drive it... they'd probably look at you weird if you drove a Ford Ka or something too so don't worry about it.

Plus most BMW's are built strong... always good when your a newer driver!

For reliability you probably need to look at the Japanese brands.
Honda comes out pretty well, as do Toyota and Nissan.

Hi, I am an ex driving instructor and used to teach in a Corsa and currently own one.  In my opinion it is a perfect first car as they are very economical with fuel and have literally one of the best reputations out of any car for reliability.  Thats why they are used by many driving schools including BSM.

yes  you can get a decent truck for 4 thousand dollars. as for the lift, carpet, and leather seats it all depends on what brand and type you get and who you have install it. I recomend either a toyota or a ford. i also recomend instead of putting in different carpet to get the vehicle duralined inside as well as underneath. it helps the truck last longer

its not a bad deal, but there is better out there.  go on autotrader, and have a look.  i have found 2 mini coopers with 20,000 less miles for a few hundred pounds less.  they are 6 months to a year older than the car you have there though.  that was just a quick look as well.  dont rush into it.  you could probably haggle a couple of hundred pounds of the prince shown.  the used car market is quite slow at the moment, so there are bargains to be had.  you just have to ook for them :-)

The bonnet catch is the famous one, although rarely happens and many cars were taken back to the dealer to get it fixed. It is french though so watch out for stuff like switches. I had a clio as a courtesy car and the indicator stalk broke.

On a bike, you are a staggerring 25 times more likely to have an accident on the same stretch of road as you are in a car - this has to do with loss of control (usually through loss of grip) running out of braking space/time (cars easily out-brake the best bikes), being hit by drivers who didn't see you (bikers often ride too fast and 'come out of no-where', as the drivers who hit them say) and trying to corner too fast (bikes are great at straight-line speed, but good road cars out-handle them in bends, in the wet especially so.



In a car, come accident-time, you have a collapsible steering-column, seat-belt pre-tensioners, air-bags, a laminated windscreen, soft dashboard materials, a safety cell and crumple-zones to absorb impact and prolong the collision.



The squashed biker they were hosing off the road yesterday morning, not a quarter-mile from the hospital, lacked the benefit of any of those systems.

After years of driving, I took my bike test this year and bought a very nice Triumph Bonneville.  I only use it on nice sunny / dry days, and it looks and feels great to ride.  It's true that the risks are much greater on a bike, but a large part of the bike test these days teaches you to anticipate, and ride defensively.  As long as you're sensible and don't push your luck - the price is too high for that.  You can derive a great deal of pleasure from biking, it's more economical, better for the planet, generally easier to get through town, and more invigorating than driving.  I say go for it.

Renault Megane 2005, Hatchback or Sedan?



Hi guys,
I have recently decided to buy a Renault Megane 2005 with very little mileage & good condition. I mainly need it for my daily commute to work. I have shortlisted  a Navy blue Sedan (engine 2.0, leather interior, sunroof, 6 CD changer etc.) & a Black Hatchback (engine 1.6, cloth interior, no cd player etc.

Now I am confused between them. The engine power doesn’t make any difference for me and also, I can get a new cd player from the market which plays mp3’s and has a inlet for ipod to install in the hatchback & again the 6 CD changer looks outdated & not that appealing.



I like the hatchback but should I go for a bigger car just cuz when a guy is touching 30’s he’ supposed to have a bigger car when his friends are driving SUV’s?

Appreciate your comments. Thanks

Raza

If you are trading in your old car (the one with the payments) a new car dealership will pay off your old car and add the difference in to a new loan.  Difference meaning the difference between the actual value of your car or trade in allowance and what is owed on the car.  If you owe more than what it is worth, they will put it into your new payments.  If it is less, then they will use the difference to lower your loan.  Example your trade is worth 5000.00 and you owe 6000.00, they will add that 1000.00 to your new loan.  If your trade is worth 6000.00, and you only owe 5000.00, it will lower your loan by 1000.00.  Usually people owe more than the vehicle is worth and end up "upside down" with their payments meaning they will always owe more than the actual car is worth.



However, if you are not trading in your vehicle, this option is not possible, and you will need to open a new account for the new car.



Talk to the dealership where you are looking.  They may have a better answer for you.
