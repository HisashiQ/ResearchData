Don't mention any names, that's against community guidelines.  People who block probably report also.



"The other two are so opinionated..."  I bet they're the same two blocking me!

I've never knowingly been blocked. However, I felt that I had to block someone the other day -- someone who only ever answered my questions (I being her only contact) and who was becoming increasingly abusive. I am prepared to put up with healthy debate and crossing swords with people who hold different views from my own, but I don't see why I have to put up with arrant rudeness from someone who doesn't make any attempt to understand the question or give any thought to a providing a reasonable answer.



I hope that I never have occasion to block anyone else. Maybe this person can start answering other people's questions, in which case it will have been worthwhile.

I don't honestly know if anyone has blocked me or not.  I wouldn't care if I was though.  Not everybody is going to like me, I'm bound to offend someone sometime.  I can just honestly say that I'm sorry if I do offend someone and if they want to block me, it's fine by me.  I could not care less.  To each his own!  :-D



Life is too short to worry about silly stuff and silly people who feel they have to "show you" by blocking you...HA!  It just seems infantile to me.



Edit:  Haha  That blocking cap reminds me of a childhood song:



"Everybody hates me, no body likes me, I guess I'll go eat worms!"



I'm sorry, that silly song always makes me laugh and remember how silly it all really is.

Here in Arkansas, we were told to bring ID to the polling place...A drivers license, utility bill or any documentation that confirmed our name and address.  We presented our ID and the clerk found our name on the voter's list which contained a facsimile of our signature, next to which we signed our names.  It was quick and simple and assured each voter that his or her vote would not be diluted by fraudulent voters.



I would recommend the system to other states.

I think the problems that arise are so easily remedied. The voting process isn't rocket science, but you would think so. Why can't every polling place do the exact same thing. It's not wonder there is confusion. It should be required by all polling stations to ask for a valid picture ID, period. Common sense doesn't seem to prevail. The church where we voted had lines going in all directions, and had moved the location to a smaller building. It was ridiculous, knowing there would be a bigger vote turnout this time. Make you wonder sometimes doesn't it? I bet elementary kids would have better sense that what goes on.

No.  I voted absentee & mailed it in about 12 days ago.  It did require my signature.  They check all the signatures on the envelopes of mail-in ballots before counting.  Most of them are checked before election day.



In our county, I think we have almost 50% who are on permanent absentee status & always vote by mail-in ballot.  Almost everyone at work voted a couple of wks ago, after much discussion of the measures.  It's very convenient.  If we don't get them mailed in time, we can take our ballots to the polls or to other places at designated times.

Here in S.C., we could either show our driver's license or our voter's registration card. I showed the lady my license, as it's always with me, besides, it's the law. Schools here were closed today but when I lived in Ohio, I don't recall the schools being closed for election day. Many people voted at the local schools, but they were still open.

You are right about not having a voter registration card. In the county we live in now, all we have to do is sign our name. In the county we moved from we had to have a card. We live in the same state. I don't know why the difference.

You raise a very good point, everyone is supposed to be asked for either their voters registration card or other legal identification. If the people working the site is not doing that then someone should report it.

No, I'm more apprehensive. Worrying about the tax package he has
prepared, that maybe aimed at the poorer classes of people. I think
he said he'd give another $1,000.00 to everyone. Now let's see if that
happens. I was afraid for either big party to win. So I voted for a third
party. I haven't seen the tallys of those at all.



So now I'll keep my fingers crossed and see what happens soon.
I'm sure he'll give an acceptance speech, and maybe he'll mention
some things he hasn't already. Like what will he do about the border
issue. One subject he and McCain never were able to discuss. What
did they have to be afraid of? That people might not vote for their
stance on that? I have read that three presidents in the past, uprooted
all of the illegals and sent them packing. One was Ike, and I forget the
other two. It took Ike two years to make it happen. But he did it. So
why can't a president today, do the same? One president, sent the
illegals back when our troops were coming home. He wanted to ensure
jobs for all of them when they came home.  I believe it was the same
for another president as well. I think it is rediculous, that those we
do deport, come back and repeat the same crimes over again. Or
maybe to more extremes. The question, is, why do we make it too
easy for them to return? They should face a real penalty for a second
time offense. Let them stay locked up, as we would be, if we did
wrong in their country, or even just suspected. Things are unjust.

Me staying up isn't going to make any difference, I voted and now I will have to wait like everyone to hear the results, but for staying up for the count, I don't thing so. I will either be relieved or disappointed and hearing it on the news in the morning with a good hot cup of coffee with be just fine.

Normally, I would stay up until 1:00am or more to here the results. Tom Brokaw would always stay up late for the results or tell people to stay tuned to The Today Show later that morning.



Now I worked night hours, so here it is noontime, and I haven't gone to bed yet. I want to go to bed soon and hopefully wake up  around 6:00pm to here the early results on NBC  News with Brian Williams. I am sure Tom Brokaw will be there for his wisdom. Love to see and hear Tom Brokaw. I fear the bad news, so I will probably go back to bed anyway. This will be hard for Tom Brokaw  being without his friend Tim Russert who was always the expert on elections and the scorecard. They say Russert's son will make an appearance.

Southern..I stayed up late last night and watched the SNL Presidential Bash.  I decided to turn off the radio and news stations last week.  Ran into that program and had a few laughs.  It felt pretty good.  I'm usually up to 9 or 10 so if it isn't called by then, I'll find out in the morning.

Absolutely not! Skinny dipping is about an expression of freedom, and an unbinding freedom that can be enjoyed by any race, religion,sex.
If this is what you choose to do, then go for it and express your freedom proudly an enjoy!

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



I don't know Mr. Ed that well, but I do remember being very favorably impressed with one of his answers a long time ago and writing to him about it.  He did point out (at that time) that he could be a little short with people at times.  Ha ha.  I guess from your question, that he was accurate about that assertion.  I guess, because of having experienced his friendlier side for a while, you might now be feeling that his temperament has changed.  I doubt that it really has.  I think he's the same old guy, but is currenly just running into a spurt of questions that get under his skin, and you're now getting to see the shorter side of his temper.  None of us are loving angels all the time.  And I doubt that Mr. Ed would ever classify himself as a loving angel any of the time.  He's, in my humble opinion, probably more of a "matter-of-fact" kind of guy.  And by that I mean, if you write yourself a financial plan, and you follow it, you won't have to worry about crying poor-mouth later.  We all have our days when people can bring us to the end or our wits because no matter how hard we try to help them with common sense advice, they keep repeating the same mistakes.  One such mistake is living outside our means.  The people who are cursed with that problem are doomed to be crying poor-mouth until they die.  That's the way it'll be if they don't learn to live within their means, and foolishly insist on trying to project an image of affluence while living among their poor neighbors.  Who do they think they kidding?  Their neighbors certainly know they are putting on a phoney front.  I think it's these types who wear down Mr. Ed's patience and move him to allowing his temper to flare.



Two of the categories that Mr. Ed focuses on are Credit and Personal Finance.  Those have to be the categories that "affluent-wanna-bees" most likely hang out in to cry about how their poor financial state is due to the government being stingy with social security money, etc.  The truth be known, their situation is most likely because of poor planning on their part.  And I say "most likely" because I know that there are situations where little old ladies are left out to struggle by men who've taken financial advantage of them by leaving them penniless.



Because I'm not on YA very often anymore, I've taken the time to check out Mr. Ed's profile, and I was very impressed with his numbers.  This guy has a 43% Best Answer record.  And two thirds of his answers are in the Credit category and Personal Finance category.  Those two categories are notorios for cry-babies who can't admit that they've got to get serious about how they handle their finances.  For some reason, they think the government should supply them with whatever extra money they believe they need to live the life style they feel they deserve.



So, my recommendation, and I hope I don't come accross as preachy, is to give Mr. Ed a little slack when he goes through spurts of venting over the frustrations one can experience over trying to help people who won't help themselves.



There's one such lady on pipes up here on Seniors every once in a while who got a student loan to get a better education and earn a better living during her work years, and I'm assuming did well income wise, but spent beyond her means and decided not to pay her student loan back to the government (thinking she could get away with it because others were saying the were getting away with it.)  Well, ha ha. The government got her in the end.  The government is now deducting those long overdue student loan payments from her social security benefits.  I suspect trying to survive is a real bear for her now.  And although I have sympathy for women who were financially abused by their husbands, I have none for the likes of the lady who chose not to pay back her student loan.



I don't think Mr. Ed would care about her either.  What about you?  Would you feel sorry for the lady who didn't pay her student loan?  Mr. Ed hears such stories a lot, and I can understand his reluctance to show sympathy.  So, I think this might be part of why Mr. Ed might sound a little hostile at times.  Just a good guy affected by frustration over his efforts to help others I think.

i truly appreciate those you give me  support -- as for hostile -- most of the times if i give a "hostile" answer it is aimed at a person in "my opinion has asked a stupid question" and yes there is such a think as a dumb question -- yes i do have a dry humor and also i know that i have made statements and no reflection here either the person did not read what i said or it went right over they head!!!



i will admit i do not have time for folks who have wasted there savings or did not save and beside all of the warning has went into retirement expecting ss to pay all the bills --- and than sating around and bitching that the govt should do more!!



i will take the time to say i am sorry if i have step on some goodie two shoes toes but i will in the future continue to give the same type answers!!!

i was 16 and what my friend and i were doing in a pasture in the middle of the nite i have no idea but im sure chemicals of some sort were involved. Well I got the idea to use the jack cause we were in it up to the back bumper. needless to say with no solid ground for the jack, my shoes already gone, she and i walked about a quarter of a mile to my house...woke everyone of course. Took me two days to get that oklahoma red clay off my feet. i'll save for driving into the edge of a man made lake hole for another time. i have a lot of stories with me and chemicals. lol

We were stuck in the mud in Yreka, California years ago at a rodeo.  It was raining and it took several of us to free the car.  I won't forget because I ruined a new pair of jeans and the mud didn't do my shoes any favors, either.

I have literally been stuck in the mud The first time I remember was when I was 12 and went fishing with my father. He was the serious fisherman, and I was the explorer.  I always would walk upstream while he fished and once found myself in a sticky situation. I thought I was in quicksand and about to die. The scream I let out brought him on the run, only to laugh at me, there in the mud up to my knees, all over my clothes and face.  Being my hero, he saved me from the mud monster.  We often laughed about it for  years.

Yes, but, one time when I was young we were out drinking on the "back roads" and was about 15 miles from town or a sole!!  Listening to the radio it ran our battery down!  We went to a nearby oil well and took the battery!!!  I'm sure the pumper was pi**ed off but we didn't have to walk!!!

What a great story but being a stick in the mud actually means someone who don't want to do what everyone else wants to. Like when kids go and steal fruit there may be 5 or 6 kids and everyone wants to go do it except one, he is the "stick" in the mud. Being "stuck" in the mud means it is very hard to move, like I might be after a long day very tired and making myself get up to do something I might say I feel like I'm stuck in mud. I hope over time we can hear more of your adventures with Lenny.

I somehow managed to get my car stuck in the mud.  I thought I would be smart and get out to inspect the damage.  I was stuck in mud up over my ankles about 5 in.  It was terrible. I finally got back in the car and waited for over 2 hrs. for someone to come bby.  Wow, what a trip.  I sure don't want to ever go through that again.Not only was I discusted but very ashamed too.  My ex told me NOT to go that road in wet weather but hey, I knew more than he did-----right?  LOL

Has this ever happened to you?



TWO DIFFERENT DOCTORS' OFFICES



Boy, if this doesn't hit the nail on
the head, I don't know what does!



Two patients limp into two different
medical clinics with the same complaint.  Both have trouble



walking and appear to require a hip replacement.



The FIRST patient is examined within the
hour, is x-rayed the same day and has a time booked for
surgery the following week.



The SECOND sees his family doctor after



waiting 3 weeks for an appointment, then waits 8 weeks to



see a specialist, then gets an x-ray, which isn't



reviewed for another week



and finally has his surgery scheduled for



6 months from then.



Why the different treatment for the two



patients?



The FIRST is a Golden Retriever.



The SECOND is a Senior Citizen.



Next time take me to a vet!



And it's going to get worse if we have social medical care...*sigh*

Seniors, did you use the paper ballot, or the new "electronic gadget" to cast your vote ?



Were there long lines and a long wait, at your polling place ?



Did you experience any trouble with the machines?



Were they easy for you to use ?



Did you like them?



To avoid being "chatty", your quick answer to the questions will be sufficient, and please, no "gloating" and no "sour grapes".



Thank you.

I had the electronic voting machine and I questioned the person that was there to introduce it to voters.  I asked about the chances of a crash and then while I was voting I looked down and saw that it was also registering on a receipt type paper so I was reassured. I liked it it and think its more accurate  and easy to use.

Here in S.C., they have the electronic voting machines. This was my second time using them, & it's so much easier & faster than using the paper ballot. The first time I used them, I asked for help, & they were very nice in assisting me. I explained that in the north where I voted, they didn't have the electronic machines. This year, I needed no help. The line was long........behind me. I went early, knowing what I'd run into. Glad I did.

I used the paper ballot - mostly for the novelty of it. It was nearly the size of a bath towel it was so huge - well over standard legal size. I was so amused that anyone would consider a paper ballot anymore. I just couldn't resist.



I live in a rural part of the country and even there, I could have used an electronic device - but after decades of using "machines" to cast my ballots, I simply couldn't resist marking a real X next to my choices.



However, in the future, I would not be averse to returning to technology to vote. Just so I CAN vote. That's the whole premise isn't it? Not the medium used.



Fortunately the lines were short although the polling judges said that there had been a record turnout - and this was in the middle of the afternoon.

Yeah, I feel all safe and comfy seeing the changed NY skyline after Bush and his cronies were finished with it.



And of course the tens of thousands of human beings who have been murdered overseas to keep his war machine ($$$$) going.



And all the hurricane victims here who got no help from him as well.



Oh - and the cute way he has tried to force Israel to divide into two states, with Israel's portion being a teeny little strip about 9 miles wide down the middle of millions of arabs pouring in to wipe it out. And the division of Jerusalem, when he is aware (and actively working for) the Arab agenda to destroy Israel and murder every last Jew.



Of course Obama will do this last part as well, it's a globalist thing, didn't really matter who won, for this. McCain would have continued the destruction of Israel as effectively as Obama will now.



Bush should have been impeached after 9/11 and after stealing the elections twice.

I voted for him.  But when I saw him standing on that pile of debris in Manhattan, with tears in his eyes, I became devoted to him.  I would gladly have died for him and for what he did after.  His prompt military action against al-Queda and the Taliban was wonderful.  I LOVED him for everything that he did during that horrible time.  I did, do, and always will.  Bar none, he had the most difficult presidency that this country has ever known.

Although I am English I will miss George Bush, he never did me any harm.  I always thought he looked comfortable and if anyone messed with him, or his country they would be sorry. I was always glad George Bush was friendly with the UK. He made a few mistakes when giving speeches but what the heck so do half the British MPs. George Bush junior  was like his dad he seemed like a nice man as well.

I actually started to miss him long before the election...when the Democrates did everything in their power to make it appear that he was the bad guy & then ran with it.  I will miss his kick-*** philosophy that I think he should have used MORE of when the war first began!  I only hope he will use his free time to help get the conservative point of view equal time in the new liberal majority that has just taken over my beautiful country.  THANK YOU!

It all boils down to words again. Having the heart of a servant. Well My first thought is no and I hope no one else does. Servant being the name slave owners used.It made me think of their broken spirits.  Then I read a couple answers and have to agree you can have a servants heart and do so many wonderful things with it. I guess I must have somewhat of one as I enjoy helping others and teaching them to help themselves. I helped a lady who had stumbled on the street one day. A person watching the whole thing said isn't it a shame there are three healthy looking young men standing right there but only the female reached out to help. We are in a sad state in this world, people think so little about others and their needs.

It of course would depend, as long as it was something I could do considering the physical shape I'm in, and wasn't illegal. I may be older but I'm not gone yet and doing things "out of your box" will help keep you young. You must exercise your mind to stay sharp, as well as exercise the body, and what the heck, I'll try it and if I like it I may do it again. I do have some friends that can still cook up some strange things to do, I used to be the instigator, but have passed that title on. I still get involved though and sometimes it turns out to be great fun.

If it's against my moral and religious beliefs then no way would I even consider it------but------other wise I would consider it.  I've done many things that I didn't feel comfortable with that turned out to be good and sometimes not so good.I guess I'd have to know what was expected of me and what I'd be willing to do.  It really all depends on when, where, and with whom I guess.Not much of an answer but what come to mind.

Have you met someone on YA, who wanted to be friends, but dropped you without saying why?



after exchanging a few e-mails?  This happened to a friend of mine & she feels badly, as the woman wanted her friendship, then vanished. I told my friend that the woman was never a friend in the first place. My friend has seen that so called friend's Q's & A's to other people since all contact with her ceased.  Your thoughts please?



</question>



<additional details>



I spoke with my friend after I posted this question & I asked her what the e-mails these two shared, were about. She said they spoke of pets, family, weather, & chit chat things. I know my friend well enough to know she wouldn't say anything to hurt anyone. She's a rare friend & we treasure each other's  friendship.

I was in the process of making contacts, but when I opened my email public - I got some horrendous emails and had to close and go private, but I did inform my friends/contacts and I hope to try connecting again at a later time.



The situation you are speaking of - makes you wonder why.



I hope everyone on seniors, don't mind me feeling like I have friends here.



I just need to be cautious for the time being, while it is checked out.

That is how the internet is. People seem to forget that whoever they are conversing out there with is an actual person. And sometimes they do things with online they would never do in realtime with friends.  Then too, there are those out there who do not understand that some people see the written word (e-mail, letters, cards, etc.) as tools to cultivate a friendship.  To them, friendship is only dependent upon doing things with each other in realtime or conversing with each other in realtime.  Dropping people from their friendship list does not have any effect on these folks.



Once "burned," all of us seem to learn what to expect out of this form of communication.  It is sometimes a difficult lesson to take though.



Good luck to your friend.

She just stopped emailing me even though I did try contacting her . I tried to think what it was I said to offend her...over time I began to realise she really didn't have the same sense of humour as myself...so maybe I made a joke of something she said in an email... that's the only thing I could come up with. Show your friend these answers and I'm sure she will realise she is not the only one that has had to deal with this sort of thing. Let her know there are really, good, kind, thoughtful people out there.

NEVER!  I'm not that anal.  I spent a lifetime as a secretary.  This isn't an important document.  This is fun.  I'm sure as heck not going to WORK!



Besides, I can spell...now typos, everybody has one of those occasionally.  People can either get over it or block me.  Whatever pleases them, pleases me!



Edit:  Although, I must say, that crap that kids do irritates me a bit..."RU OK?"  I fear for our future!  No doubt about it.  We really DON'T speak the same language!

Why, YES, I DO, thank you!  It's such a delight to know that others may recognize my attempts to always express myself fully, completely, and accurately, regardless of how short the answer should be.  I do try to inform as well as entertain, but neither could be accomplished if I fail to communicate effectively.  If I fail to proofread and spell-check, I fail to communicate.  Oh, HORRORS!

I am aware of the category I have chosen.

I have never heard of one, but I know a girl that appealed to the humane society locally when her family took the money she had for pet food. They gave her food to last her through until the next month.



Another Idea, you could start one, get donations from your friends, or buy at dollar tree or big lots and give by referral only, such as by church, humane organization, or regular food pantry, so that you are not taken advantage of.



Good Luck, God Bless You.



You may also wish to post in community service for more ways to make your idea work.

What are your thoughts on Michelle Obama's dress last night?



I thought it was very unusual, not the normal kind you would see on THE night your husband is elected President. Watching all these months, both Michelle and Cindy McCain were both very classy dressed so I was a little shocked. If it were me, I would have picked either a Navy Blue, Royal Blue, Red Suite, or even an autumn color. If I remember correct, Cindy had on a Gold or Yellow suite. I have respect for each lovely lady. I just wanted to know what you thought. Thank you ahead. (Why is Yahoo picking Sports &gt; Golf for this question? That's strange. So if Yahoo can pick that catagory, then I can pick Seniors catagory. lol).

In Central California we have gangs (black gangs) sporting the colors of red & black.  It certainly was a shock to see the entire family dressed in those colors.  In fact, it just reinforced the fact that the Obama family seems to lack what is needed in the white house.  I hope they can learn quickly & catch on that they are no longer just regular "folk".  It's time to step it up a notch & learn some of the finer things in life in order to stay in those circles of the other worldly Royals!



I thought they looked like someone else planned the outfits for them.  If so...that person should be fired ASAP!



Edit:  It's essential that the new first family understands that they really DO have an impact on their own race & what they wear has the ability to send a message to a part of life that they may not even realize exists!  That was my main point.  I enjoy those TD's.  It tells me that many are in denial over racial tension & boundary lines that currently still do exist in 2008.

I agree with you.



Both wives have looked stunning all through the campaign, but last night I kept thinking Michele was still wearing part of her Halloween costume.  I admire the woman, but it really was a strange choice of design, wasn't it?



Oh well, I suppose her dress is really unimportant right now.

It was an unusual dress and perhaps she should have turned to her husband and asked the age old question.... "honey, does this make me look fat?".  She is not a heavy woman at all, but the dress did add some pounds in the wrong places.  She looks great in J Crew!

I looked at the entire Narcisco Rodriquez collection including this dress.  If she wanted to wear that designer, there were more flattering choices for her.  The dress is really not so bad as it was shown on the runway.  It has no jacket or sweater,  but by adding the bolero sweater, she obscured the shape of the dress and made it look weird.  It was hard to see what the dress actually looked like.  There are really more flattering choices for her in this same collection-- a lovely ivory colored dress that's very sophisticated and a more tailored deep cranberry dress that would have looked amazing on her.  Shame she chose this one, as far as I'm concerned.

Many people think that Michelle Obama's dress was hideous. I've seen way worse dresses out there. I wouldn't wear it, and she probably could have chose another dress, but she was just trying to look unified with her family. Her daughter, Sasha, was wearing a red dress. Her other daugher, Malia, was wearing a black dress. President Obama was wearing a black suit and a red tie. Her dress wouldn't be something for one to wear on the red carpet. However, it tied her family's outfits together. As a family, the Obama's looked classy and elegant.

I thought it was pretty. I wouldn't look good on me but it did on her.
Nothing is wrong with unusual and the word normal is subjective, very subjective.  The word classy is also subjective.



If a person tried to avoid every color that just so happened to be associated with some gang somewhere  that persons choice for clothing would be very limited.
I am all for ignoring such things and just wearing what you like and what looks good.

We are not the ones confused.  If we pulled a prank when I was in school in very short order you would be holding your ankles and someone would be swinging a large nasty wooden paddle at your butt.  I have been out of school since 1962, I have kids old enough to be your parents.
Sorry I didn't have a great 'prank' for you to pull.

<question>



Do you now feel safer knowing Obama was elected?



With the fact that Israel already has broken the truce with the Palestinians, and the stock market is down already..what are your feelings.
I honestly feel this was just an election of white versus black..and that really is sad.
Anyone share my feelings?



</question>



<additional details>



EDIT: For anyone saying this was not a black versus white election..have you in your voting life ever seen lines like we all saw yesterday? Or the strong number of black people waiting to cast there ballot?.
And besides me, did anyone hear the black man who was interviewed on his way out of whereever he was after registering to vote in this election saying he HAD to register because this was the first time a "Black man" was ever nominated. He knew nothing about what Obama stood for and didn't seem to care..all he knew was he was black!



CLARITY..no that he is biracial was not lost on me, and it was very noble of him to visit his grandmother.
maybe he should have also visited his Aunt who is in this country illegaly



Prosperi: exactly who are "people like me", would they be people who have an opinion contrary to your's.
You're wrong, I have no anger, I'm just stating facts as I know them.
Youy\ say all the stories about McCain are not true..but I guess it's ok for Obama not to produce the birth certificate showing he is a citizen of the US.
You don't know me, so don't judge me.



EDIT; it's really sad when someone can't give their opinion without being accused of being "so full of hate!"



BARBARA: I'm on a soap box? All I did was ask a question which is what this "open forum" is for. As for people firing back at me..who threw the first volley..was it me? I think not.

First , that is what Obama supporters do, "they" are the ones who  spread hate by accusing anyone who does not agree with them as haters.  Not all of them do that but most do and that is frightening.



It s like a hypnotic mantra with them and I am not kidding..
Second..no I do not feel safer some thing very atrocious is going to happen.very shortly.  I am looking in my crystal ball right now, seriously we are in big trouble.  Just wait until they start throwing people in jail for not agreeing with them.

Seems like you asked the question of the year. And I understand completely how you feel, however I have to admit I have seen lines as long as yesterdays, in small town SC. It was Bush vs Kerry and there were some pretty aggravated voters then. And that's one point I would like to make here; I've heard there would be angry voters no matter who won. YA aside I haven't really heard anyone in the real world complaining about the results. So I have to think that it wasn't really all that Black and White (By the way this doesn't mean I'm right). Additionally it's a very well known fact that most voters (all colors) vote for charisma, now that should be a heart breaker I would suspect. In a crunching moment, well actually dozens of them, I have spoken with co-workers and many friends, who have a firm commitment to vote for someone and can't, with any kind of conviction, intelligence or in plain english tell me why, other than they will either 1.) end the war or 2.) end the financial crisis. And that's not to mention how many Americans don't even understand the electoral vote or have a clue about most of the Constitution Articles or any Amendments. So when you comment on the Black voter you really are describing the intelligence level of most American voters Black and White.



When I think back to Nixon's second term (This is the guy that promised to get us out of Viet Nam during his first term campaign) it astounds me that people take their concerns to the level they do these days regarding Obama or Palin and there experience level. According to the constitution you need only be a natural born citizen and 35 years old to run for president in the United States. So how do you determine who would be best for the country, regardless of what you saw or heard it's only a snap shot in time, and time changes everything,.

I am sorry but I don't share your feelings. Israel and the Palestinians have been at this for years, this is not a result of the Obama election.



This was not about race as so many are saying/thinking. I was about real plans and real change for America. I might have voted for McCain if he had been as eloquent and positive in his congratualtory speech during his campaign but he was just another mud slinger with no plans and no positive outlook unless he kept them to himself. He is a man of war and we dont need anymore war. We need peace. With Obama I truly believe that America has finally come together to work for the same goals, building America back.51 percent of the Americans that voted were white. Now that tells me a lot!

You asked if anyone shared your feelings. It is obvious that the overwhelming majority do not. You said you feel sad. We feel joyful. You said this was an election of whites v. blacks. It wasn't. When you project your own mindset onto reality, it is natural that reality will look adversarial and ugly. You stated no facts, only gullible opinions. As Abraham Lincoln said, "Most people are just about as happy as they make up their minds to be."

During the campaign, I watched carefully as two candidates performed under tremendous pressure.  One remained calm and stuck to the campaign and issues at hand; the other became frustrated and frazzled and allowed his campaign to spin out of control into one mudslinging sound byte after another.  I said to myself, "Which one will be the best diplomat to solve the problems of our nation?"  And you know what? I chose Obama because he has proven the ability to stand strong and get the job done.



Race had nothing to do with my choice, but I'm actually glad that our country has finally broken the race barrier by electing a non white as president.  It sends a message to the world that we indeed can work together as truly United States.  I think that if he chooses his cabinet as well as he chose his campaign team, he'll prove to be one of the best presidents in history.



There is all kinds of anecdotal evidence that you can dig out to prove your racism theory, but one fact remains:  Obama couldn't have won without significant numbers of votes from white voters.  I believe that I heard that 42% of white women voted for Obama.  So you see, it's not just a black thing.  It's an American thing.

Dear one, you cannot have it both ways.  Since you opened a can of worms on a pubic forum, you are hardly in the position to complain when someone fires back at you. Just remember that the next time you want to stand on a soap box.



Obama is untried - that's true. He faces one of the most difficult of situations ever faced by a president-elect. But who got us there?



Remember, there was a budget surplus and the longest time of peace in our country when that evil man took office illegally in 2000.



Absolutely I feel safer now that, after some 50 years, there is no Bush that has been elected to office. Hopefully we can now clean our house and get back on track.



So if you're not happy - you can vote for someone else in 4 years. BUT remember, this is a public forum and if you want to play, you can't go around demanding that people not judge you.

Your last line shows so much about your logic & anger...Yes, I feel safer knowing an intelligent man is the leader now...Colin Powell spoke this morning to people like you saying your fear is unfounded...the top people in every area of expertise are supporting Obama...McCain is the son of an oil heiress & his war story was fabricated for him...do a search for Vietnam Veterans Against John McCain & watch him tell the truth on the videos...he admits he was emotionally out of control, crashed his own plane, injured himself, gave secrets away, he was known as "songbird" because of the secrets he gave so easily so he could live in luxury...his father bought him the senate seat..his father was the reason he got through school at all...look for the video of him in the hearing with the representative for the POWs families....I can remember someone obstructing the POWs from coming home...I remember hearing about McCain & didn't understand why he was getting away with this & being told he came from a very wealthy family...I remember my aunt & her friend discussing it & her friend said he always acted like he came from a poor background...she said that he always got away with everything & used his POW story to get what he wanted....the videos are of him so look around & find them.....you ask about Obama's family but McCain is the one who have the turmoil with family...his brother goes to a reunion every year with the McCain family & they are black cause they were the family slaves...but who cares that is really not our business...look at how McCain treated the military.

I'm not sure which election you were watching but more white people voted for him than blacks did. That, in my book, just might be a hopeful and positive plus right there. White people REALLY wanted him elected!! Obama won't be physically IN office until January. How can we be critical of anything until we give him a chance? And what I really don't understand is that many many people have been so cruel about his being black......why are they "blaming" or "bashing" him when he had no choice of who he is? He had no choice in being black/half black, green, pink or whatever. Just like all of us and the way we are. NONE OF US had a choice in the color of our skin. Besides, if you look back into your own history and genealogy everyone just might be surprised on how many of another race/color we all have from way back in time. So when we bash someones skin color, are we not being a little 2-faced and phony? And one more thing that I don't get is which President has TOTALLY stuck to all their promises?? Everyone of them is at fault for that. If any of us were to get behind that desk in the oval office, trust me, you would have to change some plans and promises if something didn't turn out right.  Anyway to answer your question......yes I feel better and safer that Obama is there.

No I don't.  He's just a politician like the rest of them.  They all talk about their big plans and how much they can do for the country, but Congress always has the last say.  We Americans need to pay more attention to our state representatives and how they vote.  If this were just about white versus black then he would have lost.  The Palestinians broke the truce twice last week and the stock market has been up and down for several weeks.  I did not vote for him, but he's my President, come January and I will stand behind him.

I do not agree with you! I am white, and an American Citizen over 60 yrs. old and my Mom just turned 80. She would not agree with you either.



This was not an election of white versus black as Obama had a white Mother and was raised by a white Grandmother. His father was a black man from Africa who was a college student when he fell in love and married a fellow college student who just happened to be white. His father returned to Africa and remarried.  Both of Obama's parents are now deceased. His white grandmother who raised him died two days ago. He was very close to her.



Obama has equal white and black heritage. And both white and black citizens voted for Obama to be the next President of the United States! I think that about 61% of voters in the United States who voted for Obama were white.



He is a very smart man who will work well with both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate and in the House. He will also do well with leaders in other countries!

Safer?  No way.  The fact that the Obama Family showed up wearing Red & Black said it all for me.



Those are well known gang colors.  The youth of America has now handed themselves over to the New New World Order just to attempt to prove to the older generation that they can have it all & shove it down the throats of those who do not agree with their TACTICS....Welcome to SOCIALISM...with a twist this time around.......they ALL have an education to make them think they know it all.



I'd like to give a big THANKS to the Republicans for giving it their best shot.  It's unfortunate they didn't play hardball sooner.  The Democrates took that kindness for weakness & now I'm afraid we're all gonna suffer because of it.



Then the media adds to the mess by making a HUGE issue over race during the campaign & as soon as Obama is elected...WHAM!...suddenly it's all about blacks & whites & evangeslistics all over again.



I will be watching less to no television after the digital/analog converter boxes are a requirement to receive "FREE" TV.  The only thing that seems to be free on TV is the ability of the sponsors to fit into the diatribe of the highly opinionated newscasters who have never or rarely worked a real job in their lives...yet they tell us how we should think act & spend our money.



I am almost ashamed to admit that I am an American now that my country has elected a person who calls themselves an African-American, rather than an American of African decent, to represent the USA...It's a sad day for me & it shows a complete LACK of knowledge of what my own grandparents & so many other people came to America for in the first place.....TO BE AMERICANS....First & Foremost.  I can't back a person with no moral character....that has nothing to do with his skin color...Call me old fashioned & racist if you'd like...that's just the way I feel about this INSANITY that has taken over the RATIONALE of my country.

The only thing I can look forward to is knowing that I shall soon be gone from this earth.  It hurts to know the mistakes of the past are being repeated in my lifetime & I could do little to enlighten others to the hidden agendas that are once again being played on the American People.  My generation did themselves in & that is about as safe as it gets, right?  This whole thing is coming full circle & women will once again be seen as breeders & money makers for the massive flesh trade when the jobs stop & the food giveaways dry up & the prisons are full.  I already feel my eyeballs popping out from the pressure of it all.



"Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death", now seems to have meaning to me.  That's the ONLY "Safe" feeling I get from all of this dumbing-down of the American way of life that is taking place with the electronic age of brainwashing!

I'm not quite a "senior",but what i would say is I've learned that, no matter what happens, how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow.



I've learned that you can tell a lot about a person by the way he/she handles four things: a rainy day, the elderly, lost luggage, and
tangled Christmas tree lights.



I've learned that, regardless of your relationship with your parents,
you'll miss them when they're gone from your life.



I've learned that making a "living" is not the same thing as making a
"life.."



I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance.



I've learned that you shouldn't go through life with a catcher's mitt
on both hands. You need to be able to throw something back.



I've learned that if you pursue happiness, it will elude you. But if
you focus on your family, your friends, the needs of others, your work
and doing the very best you can, happiness will find you.



I've learned that whenever I decide something with an open heart, I
usually make the right decision.



I've learned that even when I have pains, I don't have to be one.



I've learned that every day, you should reach out and touch someone.



People love that human touch -- holding hands, a warm hug, or just a
friendly pat on the back.



I've learned that I still have a lot to learn.!

I haven't had a LONG life yet, but what I've learned so far is:



Be kind to others.  You never know how much someone else needs a smile, or a hug.  You could save someone with a smile.



You get more cooperation being kind than you do by being a b*tch!  If you are nasty to someone, they aren't going to help you no matter how right you are.



For most people, the only thing that matters is the bottom line.  The bottom line is always money.  And that is a sad, sad fact.



I've learned that for me, the only things I value are:



My family and pets
God
PEACE & NO dramatics
Friends



As long as the above is ok...NOTHING else matters a damn.

1.  I'm never going to be first in line on the highway, so I might as well go the speed limit.



2.  If at first you don't succeed, make sure that it's worth trying again before you do it.  Don't waste your time on stupid stuff.



3.  If someone is looking for an argument, make it hard for them to find it.



4.  There's nothing more important than family.



5.  Don't make promises you can't keep.



6.  Save for a rainy day, but don't save so much that you don't enjoy your life.



7.  Don't buy stuff that you can't afford.



8.  Look for the good in all people, but don't be blind to their faults.



9.  If you're wrong, admit it.  Someone always finds out.



10. Trust your own instincts.  If you have a bad feeling about something, you're probably right.

Hi, I communicate with a young man in Algeria and he has told me that they "Treasure" the golden set and is happy that I gave him a chance to Learn from me! I went to www.sharedtalk.com to meet people that I can learn French from but found so much more. They tell me about their way of life, send pix and of course they want to practice their English too.
Of course there's always Mexico where you can live very well with very little money. You can have a housekeeper for about $5 a day, a cook and whatever else for pennies of what it would cost here.
Florida seems to be the choice for so many as well.
I would pray on it before deciding.
Good luck

I fondly remember as a young child, the only time my Dad would be home right after work was on election day. My parents were avid voters, one a democrat and one a republican and they would go together(Mom didn't drive or have a car)to vote after Dad got home. Every other work day Dad would stop at, what they called, a beer garden for an hour. So when Dad was home early(actually on time) from work, I knew it was to vote. That was Pennsylvania back in the 50's, don't know now.

No.  I think it is just states that tend to be "dry" for other things.  Here in Michigan we are only dry from 9:00 PM Christmas Eve to 6:00 AM December 26th and every Sunday from 2:00 AM to noon.  There are several counties that are dry all day Sunday,too.  I think it is more a township or county thing rather than a state thing.

Well, there is no rain in today's forecast.  And, as far as alcohol being sold, it's like any other day here.  As a matter of fact, we have a neighbor who would always say something like, "It's November 4th, Election Day, and I'm going to need a 5th (of whiskey) to get through it."

Any Wusses in the Room?



A few months ago, I had finally found this place where everything isn't about sex and  stupidities. However, I haven't been on here in a long while because of unforseen interruptions. Now what I see is that you are all feeding on each other's negativity. Please don't give up! You can get it back! There's no place like this place and it's because of the chemistry you all have with each other. I wanted to be a part of that and I still do. Maybe you all could just try a little harder to find more interesting questions instead of waiting for the others to come up with them. I really hope you guys don't abandon each other...or me!



</question>



<additional details>



I guess I used a stronger description of what I saw on the question, "What is happening"? Instead of negativity I should've used decention or something like that. I used "wusses" to catch your attention, I didn't mean to put you on the defensive, sorry. Maybe if you read the comments on that Question, you'd get what I meant.



I meant dissension.

LOL. . Yes, I will honestly admit to being a Wuss ! No offense taken here Tink.  You mentioned not being around lately, so let me answer your question this way. . . A wuss according to the dictionary is a weakling, a chicken, a wimp, someone who is afraid. . . One thing that makes me afraid is being expelled from Yahoo Answers . . . I love this site !.  The rules state that after so many violations (no amount given) your account will be deleted, and you will loose the privilege of being a Yahoo member. These violations come from questions and answers that are considered "chatting" etc. and just last month I received 9 of them.  Half were appealed and reinstated.



You will notice that some of the regulars are gone, or possibly under a new name. A lot are just reading and not participating due to the amount of violations being given.  So, using this criteria, yes, I am a wuss. . . I now try to answer carefully because of all the hoopla !

Not wusses, just those who have learned to be wary and cautious.



Look at the thumbs down already....there's part of your answer. And as JJ explained, even the most interesting and thought provoking questions get reported and removed.



So it has nothing to do with dissension. Just the reporters getting what they want....frustration.

No wusses here!  Haven't you heard?  Old age ain't for sissies.  Please hang around and contribute often. You don't have to be old but it is appreciated if you will mind your manners.  Our group gets very small on some days.  It's the best section of Yahoo Answers because most everyone here can think, spell and form complete sentences.  Not much trash to wade through.



Good luck and my best wishes to you.

The wording of your question itself, may cause some to go on the defensive.  As for me, I am neither a "wuss" nor am I feeding off anyone's negativity. Judging all by what a few, in your opinion, may be doing, is very unfair of you.



edit: Thanks for the "thumbs down." It's what I expected.

I hear ya!!  I was off for a few weeks because of back surgery!! My first question was about the surgery wanting other peoples feedback as to what to expect......got deleted!!  Ask another question wondering how people took Arnold's remarks about Obama's skinny legs.....got deleted!!  But when an old man has more that 23 TD's you don't have to guess who reported it!!  So, when I ask a question I expect it to get deleted but I do get to read the answers and that's what I wanted anyway......heck with the points!!!

I wuss in this room, till I went to the fridge for a bottle of 'bollie', so I guess I'm a wusses, but I couldn't be answering the question if I wasn't back again. So I suppose now I'm an isses. Isses Wusses does it really matter? I'm more interested in whether all these peeps who have their photo thingies like pretty cartoon characters are really as young as they're making out?

I must have missed something. This is still a good place but the only mention I heard anything about was a question asked about why there was so few in here anymore.



With the elections going on, I think some have concentrated on those rooms or since there seems to be a lot of nastiness in the Political stuff, maybe some folks are backing off and taking a breather.



In the year and a half I've been on here, many folks have come and gone. Maybe it's a little boring or folks are busy "winterizing".



Course us older folks still say something about sex occasionally but we couch it in cutesy terms. It's only fun to talk about it if we know some young person some where is grossed out about it.

What a caring person you must be to ask such a question. Not everyone has the right personality or apptitude to be a carer of anyone let alone the elderly.



I would say that patience, humour, stamina and understanding are the most important attributes.

Compassionate and empathetic personality with a sense of humor and a great big heart. I know that when my time comes, I will be very fortunate to have a caregiver with these virtues...I think you have to be a special person to do this kinda work but good caregivers are few and far between so I say go for it. However, you may be the only contact to the outside world this person has so it's a Very important job, paid or not.
You being shy, in my opinion, should'nt be a negative at all. Anyway, you'll only be shy for a little while till you get to know your charge. It may even enable the elderly person to feel useful in helping you out of your shell. Good Luck and God bless!

To be a carer you need to be patient and friendly.  Nonjudgmental and don't jump to conclusions or assumptions about people.  Be a good listener, not just to what people say, but to how they are as individuals.  Everyone is different with their experiences and what they need from a carer. so don't be hurt if a person does get frustrated with you.  I t might not be you personally, more the situation they are in.  it is an incredibly important job and if you are willing to persevere, there's no reason why you shouldn't make a really good carer!

Were these onlookers not sick?



Police have criticised a crowd of people who encouraged a suicidal teenager to jump from a shopping centre car park.



Shaun Dykes, 17, died after he fell from the site on the roof of the Westfield shopping centre in Derby on Saturday afternoon.



The teenager, a student at Heanor Gate Science College, climbed over a railing on the top level of the shopping centre's car park at 2.30pm on Saturday.



A group of onlookers gathered to watch while trained negotiators spent three hours trying to coax him down.



Witnesses said the mob taunted Shaun, who lived in the Derbyshire village of Kilburn, and shouted: "Go on then, jump."



Students from Shaun's college were nearby and heard the goading, according to his headteacher Rob Howard.



"One student told me he could not believe people place such little value on life. It's almost like they are in a television show. It's unreal," Mr Howard said.



"The sad thing is that a couple of the students, if they could have got close enough, felt that they could have made a difference. It's very traumatic."



Police condemned the onlookers and added that their presence did not help their attempts to save Shaun.



"We are disappointed that people decided to stop and watch, and some people decided to pass comments," a Derbyshire Police spokesman said.



"According to one of the police officers involved it was a small minority of people who were saying things. There's really no specific offence if people were passing comments."



The spokesman added that police did not know what had been troubling the youngster.

No way should they have been encouraging Shaun to jump! No way.
If I was there, I wouldnt hang around to watch, or yell at him to jump off, I would have left, but hoped that he didnt jump. That would have stayed with me all day - I would feel quite shocked and unable to comprehend what I saw. They are really sick!

It would! I am still in content with a friend from Scotland that I met when I was 15. (I'm as old as Barack Obama.) One of my student's father was a sailor that went into port in the Ukraine and a local teacher gave him letters from her English class to mine. I'm still in touch with her, too. It's lots of fun to get letters from other countries. I was only in contact with someone from Japan for a short time, but he showed me how to write my name in Japanese characters.



Perhaps you can try the countries at the bottom of the page in YA and ask there if some would be willing to write? Try Googling it, too. The agency I went to is no longer in business. Good luck!

In Islam, making images of living things is generally seen as a big no-no, since you're only supposed to worship Allah, not other beings. This means that when it comes to decorating their mosques (temples), they use geometric designs instead of pictures of saints and things. Do a Google image search for "geometric Islam" and you'll come up with loads of beautiful designs: the link below is a good starting point...

This is easily the most intelligent question on race and/or ethnicity I have heard! Every single culture has amazingly beautiful art! There is no exception to this! From ancient tribal cave paintings to modern lineal abstract, from your local museum to the Louvre. It's all astonishing and all our wonderful commonality. ART is the ONLY thing that actually matters where the differences in race and gender are concerned, and it is all magnificent in it's own way!

Halloween and Christmas (if religiously acceptable) are the best times to do crafts.  You can do some really fun things.  I have taught elementary school for a few years (grades preschool-5th).  I am still fresh and excited about doing activities and crafts!



It depends what kind of equipment you have to work with.  Laminating machines can be your best friend!  However, you can also buy the self-sticking clear laminating paper at Wal~mart or craft stores



Feel free to email me and I can give you some ideas.  I love doing things the kids have never done before (and will probably never get the chance to do).

Some blacks I talk to like to blame whites but didn't we sell our own people to Americans, does that make us ultimately responsible?  The reason why I am asking is because I hear other blacks talk about it like people owe us something but in reality there is no one alive in the US that was a slave or owns/owned a slave anymore

There were many hands in that pot, black, white, and other.  Don't let anyone try to convince you otherwise.  Only bias fools with an agenda suggest anything different....but then begin to trip over their ethnocentric words when they realize their tale contradicts other tales of theirs (talk to an Afrocentrist about Egypt and slavery) or makes no sense at all (some people actually believe a handful of white people enslaved an entire continent of millions....and then suggest the latter are strong, competent people).  Its even funnier to watch them try present slave owners and traders of their own color as martyrs or kind saviors, or suggest that these non-white owners and traders were somehow oblivious of the reality and existance of chattel slavery....all of which is in complete defiance of documented fact and sound rationale....

Long before black slaves were brought from Africa to America, they were brought to England. England owned Jamaica where they developed large sugar cane plantations. Blacks from Africa were shipped directly to Jamaica but bought by the country of England. All European countries had slaves before America. There were slaves in America long before America became the United States. There were not only black slaves. There were Asian and white slaves as well. African Kings sold their own people into slavery. Asians sold their people into slavery. Ireland sold their people in a different way. They offered them a way to get to America. The families that sponsored the Irish, paid their way here and then it took years for these Irish people to repay that debt to buy their freedom. So although, everyone has felt so sorry for the black slavery, you hear little about Asian and Irish  and others that were enslaved as well. The Native American were slaves to the white man. But, we never hear about this. We only hear about black slavery.

I think the anger is not just from the inhumane treatment of human beings, but the free labor many received from enslaving the blacks, not to mention the companies that made tons from the sale of blacks.  I do believe that the corporations who have made their billions on the backs of blacks do owe blacks money.  However, if that were to happen, the taxpayer would really be the one responsible for the payments because the corps would raise prices so as not to see a dent in their checks.  So, the best thing to do is for people to just get the heck over the past and live for today and tomorrow.

First you have to understand how the slave trade started.
Blacks weren't the first ones Europeans put into slavery, you know that right?? Native American were first, but many died of the hard labor and the lucky ones escaped. Then they went to Africa. Orginally on a peace mission. Talking about 'come see our king' etc etc. Then they kidnapped important chiefs. Then they chose to exchange them for commoners. Only in the 18th century did native Africans participate. And it's not like they want you to believe. Europeans try to take NO responsiblity for the slave trade... LIARS!!
It's way too much info too type here... I swear the history is LONG!
AND YES YOU DID SELL YOUR PEOPLE!! INDENTURED SERVANTS WERE HERE LONG BEFORE SLAVES!!! And what is an indentured servant you ask? A European that was sold to pay off his debt.



And even though slavery ended in 1865, racism still exists. What's worse, the segregation period from 1865 til about 1985.



The stuff white people, commoners like yourself, did to blacks to keep them down is HORRENDOUS!! Did you know ya used to go to church, and then go to a picnic to watch a black man get lynched?!?!
And, he may not have been black like we see 'black men' today. ONE DROP of African blood made you black. So if you're mothers great-grandmother was black, guess what, so ARE YOU!!  Ah ha!!



The 100 years after slavery allowed everyone is society but descendants of Africa to prosper. In fact, whites did EVERYTHING possible to prevent blacks from making a living. If a black person had a store, a white could loot and attack it, even kill the man and his family, with no reprecussions. If a black man had a car, a white person could again, kill or mutilate him, steal his car, threaten all the black people in the town, with no reprecussions. In fact, it was accepted.



This is the history they don't want you to know. But open a book. Because it's there.



And then people complain about black people in the ghettos... but who drove them there? Who would not allow them to live ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE CITY, regardless of how much money they have. You people are sick and ridiculous.



Who's responsible for slavery in the US? THE US!! a.k.a europeans, begining with the portugese and followed by many, including the infamous British.



Oh, also, READ a book. Many of the Africans who came to America before SLAVERY was skin-based became wealthy, as they were viewed as indentured servants and could by their freedom. They owned houses and land and even intermarried. Of course, America could not be the great country it is without free labor.....  and the violence they used to keep it that way.



(And, for you ignorants who believe Africans are the only reason Africans were enslaved... ask yourself... who treated them like cattle? But worse? )



And blacks are owed... but it is something that can never be repaid.  The damage is done. All we can do is make our lives better for ourselves and our community. DONT LET THE OPPRESSOR TELL YOU TO FORGET ABOUT THE OPPRESSION.

Im white. My family has only been in America for 3 generations. They escaped from slavery in another country, came here poor and never owned a slave ( If anything they were treated poorly even then because of their cultural differences at the time as well ). To blame all slavery on white people (or any other generalization of people based on color) is an ignorant generalization. I think it is safe to say a vast majority of Americans believe slavery was a terrible thing AND a lot of white people unjustly blamed have never in their families history owned or would have considered owning another human being. Slavery was not America's alone; it existed ( and still does ) in other countries as well. The blame game is nothing more then another mask for a ridiculous prejudice.

I have found nothing but the most beautiful, untouched expanses of forest and some of the best people I've ever met while travelling.  I also have played music on the steps of the Parliament building with my concert band, escorted by the RCMP, and went rafting down the Ottawa River.  Not to mention that I've gotten some good French practice from them.  I was only "eh'd" once: at the Hardrock Cafe in Toronto, and ONLY once.

First of all your WAY prettier then Brandy but I've heard people say she's looks part Asian because of her eyes. To me you look African American or even West African, not Blasian. This is a true example of a Blasian; Chanel Iman:

and some which can't be repeated here.  And the meanings of words often get misinterpreted, like say f aggot, which does not mean same in UK as it does in US.

Select an age category: 20 years old



Gender: Female



Questions:
1.Define the meaning of adventure travel and cultural tourism?
Adventure travel: People who go for these reasons wish to define who they are buy submissing themselves in a place far from home, meeting new people to learn about themselves and gaining independence and more knowledge of themselves.



Culrtural Tourism: People who travel for these reasons want to learn more about the world it self and open their eyes to the different cultures, perhaps to be appreciative of the things around them back home. they also seek to increase their knowledge about history and how we came to be today.



2.Explain the differences between adventure and cultural tourism in your understanding.
The differences are above



3.Do you prefer adventure travel or cultural tourism more? Why?



A bit of both, I suppose doin it for myself and self growth, but also learning about other cultures is fullfilling



4.Where have you travelled to?
Around australia, Thailand.
Am going to europe next year for 5 weeks



5.Why are you travelling?
I m traveling to learn more about myself, to meet new people, have fun!, learn more about other cultures.



6.What are you interested in mostly?
Right now im more interested in Adventure...im only 20 so i have a bit of self searching to do, but in the future i think i will lean more to the culture side of things

I have to do a debate for my AP Enviormental science class. heres the topic. "urbanizing major city's is a good way to control population growth." I have to agree with it. Here are some ideas I have so far...



-Citys can provide for a large population
-They maintain a large stable economy
-More job opportunities, less unemployment.
-More people are educated, and enrolled in school
-In most big citys, people walk instaid of using fossil fuels



What other arguments could I make to support this? 10 points up for grabs.

well at least we are free to choose our own values even if some people's values are pretty shocking. I personally would rather meet a someone married to an animal than a muslim extremist terrorist - sure the western world is a bit weird and loose but no one is forcing you to behave or worship according to their rules. remember if a woman is raped in some muslim countries she is considered a criminal and is punished for it what the &*&*& are those values I think that the majority of muslims are pretty cool but anyone that seeks to push people apart has a problem.

Do you think that "Police State" restrictions should be put on the most violent of inner cities? Why? Why not?



This would be temporary, but it would be extremely invasive as well.



"The term police state is a term for a state in which the government exercises rigid and repressive controls over the social, economic and political life of the population, especially by means of a secret police force which operates outside the boundaries normally imposed by a constitutional republic. A police state typically exhibits elements of totalitarianism and social control, and there is usually little or no distinction between the law and the exercise of political power by the executive."



This means random search and seizure, check-points, increased police presences, curfues etc.



Do you think this would help or make things worse?

Noise. I would say that is number one. When I was a teen, I drove my parents and grandparents nuts with my rock and roll. The weirder it was, the more I liked to play it because it would get to them. I had the record by Steppenwolf called "the Pusher" in which John Kay repeatedly says, "G*d D*mn the pusherman". Well one day my dad came in my room and grabbed that record plus my record of Chuck Berry's "my ding-a-ling and into the trash they went. LOL. Luckily he didn't break them because I retreived them from the trash later.

1. Younger pups (I'm 36 years old) who think that Disney's genetically engineered pop stars are the musical sum of existence. It gets on My nerves when kids consider Hannah Montana/Jonas Brothers an awesome artist, and not those allegedly "n00b" guys like Metallica (pre-black albums), Jimi Hendrix, Soundgarden, etc.



2. The young pups that DO like more worthy music (Pink Floyd, Pantera etc.) that go no deeper than what gets played on the radio. Perfect scenario:



"Man, what the HELL album is THIS?!"
"Pink Floyd's 'Atom Heart Mother' album."
"Oh, wow. I thought the only 2 albums They ever made was 'Dark Side of the Moon' and 'The Wall'"

Does PETA only use videos to bash meat eaters?



Of like slaughter houses, and graphic images of animals being slaughtered?  Do they not know people know this?  It's not like people are bringing these animals to your front door and slicing them in front of your face.  Why do they post images of pets like dogs and cats in hamburger buns, to mock people for eating meat?



Isn't it a bigger crime for people to wear dead animals than eat them for protein?  Just curious on your thoughts.

My gal they are too much. I am all for protecting living creatures and stuff. I mean like pandas though you know elephants and shi. I like my chicken ell done please, and my burger with cheese. I almost got killed I told you. I thought it was a nudist protest and I took off my clothes and joined in the action until some a s s noticed I was munching on a chesseburger. I ran for ten blocks nude and then got arrested for indecent exposure. Hubby had quite the laugh and  I swear I do not have sympathy with them. I respect everyone until they chase boogie nude without boogie wanting too. oh no Peta is bad. I am all for some of the good they have done, but they erase that with their aggressiveness. Passion does not have to be violent.

Actually, they do it because the videos work.  My kids will not set FOOT in a KFC, and haven't for almost five years after seeing a video about them on the PETA site.  I personally believe animals can be raised ethically, killed quickly without knowing what is happening, and make a delicious dinner!

Why do you white people keep telling me to go back to China?



I am of Filipino heritage.  My parents originate from the beautiful tropical island paradise of the Philippines.  Ignorant white people tell me to go back to China if i criticize the United States.  This is puzzling to me because I'm Filipino and not Chinese.  I am puzzled that white Americans think they are real Americans when it's actually the Native American Indians that deserve the label.  I am not saying all white people say these ignorant remarks, but a majority of you white people do say that to me.  I am a patriotic Filipino-American which means I can exercise my right of free speech in order to question conventional wisdom and shake the foundation of societal order.  How come white people tell me to go back to China?  Why don't you white people go back to Europe?  Oh wait....you white Americans are unwanted Puritan Pilgrims aka Rejected Euro Trash.

Some white and people in general are just plain ignorant and have not been properly educated on people of different cultures.  They assume since you look a certain way,then that is what you are. They assume that because you are of asian culture,you are automatically chinese. We all need to learn about other cultures and be able to distinguish who is who so that we do not cause conflict and bad feelings between one another. I am hispanic,and I have had people think I am chinese,filipino and hindu. Some people are just too lazy to learn about other people.

Yes! But that's my opinion, so don't assume that I'm right. 86 pounds seems really small, you definitely should talk to your doctor about it. You might not be eating the right foods. But also, if you want to gain weight, DON'T DO IT BY EATING JUNKFOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You might gain weight from that, but in a less than flattering way. Your overall health will decrease and your skin will be really bad, and that's just two of the downsides. I repeat: DO NOT TRY AND GAIN WEIGHT BY EATING JUNKFOOD.



Instead, use a dietry supplement used specially for gaining weight. You can buy these at pharmacies. If you're unsure, talk to a doctor, a pharmacist or a dietician. I strongly recommend seeing a doctor, for a checkup. They willl be the best judge on this.

Do you think that "Police State" restrictions should be put on the most violent of inner cities? Why? Why not?



This would be temporary, but it would be extremely invasive as well.



"The term police state is a term for a state in which the government exercises rigid and repressive controls over the social, economic and political life of the population, especially by means of a secret police force which operates outside the boundaries normally imposed by a constitutional republic. A police state typically exhibits elements of totalitarianism and social control, and there is usually little or no distinction between the law and the exercise of political power by the executive."



This means random search and seizure, check-points, increased police presences, curfues etc.



Do you think this would help or make things worse?

Why don't Americans like Peta and vegetarians?



I keep reading questions where Peta is described as terrorism and answers where vegetarians are mocked. In Ireland Peta is known as an association which promotes animal rights and I buy all my cosmetics from them them as they dont test on animals and I'm vegetarian.



Ok most of the world isn't vegetarian but when you see the videos Peta shows can't you see that they are promoting something good? Was it terrorism to show the Germans auchwitz after the war? jeesh

Think of it this way. Helping the homeless by working in soup kitchens is a good thing.



Helping the homeless by blowing up other peoples homes and showing them what it is like to be homeless is bad.



Both have the same goals one is just very extreme.



Peta goes to far in their efforts to help animals. Often they put animal rights over human. I'm sorry but if I am faced with the decision to eat something that came from a human or something that came from a cow you bet I'm gonna take the cow

I don't care about vegetarians as long as they aren't preachy and let me eat what I want.  Whatever I eat to nourish my body is my business and doesn't affect anyone else but me.



And there are WAY too many starving people all over the world who wish they had ANY meat of any kind to eat, so get I find the concept of being picky and judgmental about what other people "should be allowed" to eat extremely offensive.



PETA are a bunch of ignorant douchebags who get off on trying to control and dictate what society does.  I have NEVER seen anything positive that PETA has done to actually benefit animals.  Their latest hijinks's, where they are trying to force Ben & Jerry's to use only human breast milk in their ice cream because they say that cow milk represents "cruelty" is one of the most bizarre and disgusting things I've ever heard.  Ben & Jerry's should sue for harassment.

I can't answer for all Americans but I will give you my opinion. Vegetarians I generally have no problem with. Some vegetarians can be rather sanctimonious and annoying about their eating habits and yours but I can deal with that.



PETA, on the other hand is described as a terrorist organization because they are a terrorist organization! Their extremist rhetoric, funding of violent campaigns by the Earth Liberation Front, arson and intimidation campaign against university researchers has convinced me ot that.

It is the extreme nature of some of PETA's actions and statements that is dismissed by many in the USA.  And please don't ask questions that apply something to all Americans, or all women, or all whites, etc.



PETA has earned a reputation much like the extreme groups who blow up abortion clinics ... in their minds they think that everyone should believe as them and they do not really want to hear no for an answer.  I am sure that there are some more moderate PETA members who are not so much into forcing their beliefs on everyone else, but those members are lost in the PETA headlines when the group takes some extreme action or releases some press release (i.e. Ice cream should be made from mothers milk instead of cow's milk).  I believe that some of the extreme actions have hurt the animal rights cause because many times now people completely dismiss anything that is associated with PETA.

It is a cult correct.
it is very dangerous.
Inform yourself how the whole concept scientology works.



In germany scientology isnt allowed to call itself a church.
They are registered as a company.



And hopefully they will be banned cause scientology and our basic law are 2 opposite things.
It is hostile against our basic law which grants the freely development of the spirit  and the task to protect the human



Na..they simply dont have enough money to cause serious trouble in the market.



Just one little thing under many:
They regard and even call non-scientologist as ´´Raw meat´´
Scientologist have the intellect and the spirit to lead the world.
They must lead the world in order to save it.

Cheap labor, and part of the process of bringing us to a one world government. If everyone has to leave their home country to have a chance at success (or even a decent life) then nationalism can be easily destroyed. If anyone complains just label them as racist.

The best place to get Brazilian products to prepare any Brazilian dish would be Rio Bonito Market, which is the only Brazilian supermarket in NY. There you can find a variety of cheeses, brazilian soft drinks, cooking ingredients, frozen products and even a butcher shop in the back. They also sell cooked food and household products from Brazil. You can find salgados and Brazilian juices, beer etc. A great variety.
It is located in Astoria Queens. The address is the following:



3286 47th ave near #34th ST. 718- 728 4300



There is also a smaller version of this market as a deli type located 3112 36th Ave  718- 706 7272 and in the same block you have other brazilian stores but for a greater variety go to the supermarket.



By the way they also offer travel agency service, sending boxes to Brazil and wire money.



If you are in Manhattan then you can try 46th St between 5th and 6th Ave a couple of Brazilian stores but not with too much variety.



Good Luck!!!!

Is it true that, back in the 1980's, many whites were fans of Larry Bird because he was white?



It is interesting watching Spike Lee's old movies.  He seems to suggest that white people liked rooting for Larry Bird, maybe because they were happy to see a white basketball player finally do as well as the black ones.  Could there be any truth to this?



I'm not interested in comments about Spike Lee.  I'm only interested in this Larry Bird idea.

well at least we are free to choose our own values even if some people's values are pretty shocking. I personally would rather meet a someone married to an animal than a muslim extremist terrorist - sure the western world is a bit weird and loose but no one is forcing you to behave or worship according to their rules. remember if a woman is raped in some muslim countries she is considered a criminal and is punished for it what the &*&*& are those values I think that the majority of muslims are pretty cool but anyone that seeks to push people apart has a problem.

Is the snailmail penpal club Science Fiction PenPal Club still going on?



I found the club back in the early 90's. It was advertised in the back of Starlog magazine. A woman named Deanne or Deanna ran it. Basically it was a snailmail penpal club for science fiction and fantasy fans. I remember she sends you a form you fill out, you check your favorite movies/shows/books etc and you can add some. Then you send it in and she sends back (I think it was for eight dollars) a penpal list that lists peoples addresses age and their interests. I know this is a long shot but I'm hoping that this will jog someone's memory

Some Mexicans are very sensitive about this.  Yes, the telenovelas love to show Western-looking people who are considered attractive in Mexican culture.  It has to do with the whole issue of the Spaniards who conquered and whose descendants, for the most part, still rule Mexico. So, to answer your question, you have both.  There are very many Mexicans of strong Spanish blood, but more who have mostly indian blood.

They are considered Latino/Hispanic. However, that is an ethnic group not a race. The actual race of most Mexicans is either Native(Metizo) or White(Spaniard) though they can be of any race really. I've seen Black,Asian, even Arab Mexicans.

Why are southerners, especially state employees, so passive aggressive and rude?



Transplant from NY. Has anyone else who has moved down south noticed this? The worst are secretaries, though southerners pronounce it "seckateeries". I just don't understand the lack of straight talk and the tolerance of incompetence. Any other transplants notice this strange phenomenon?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Didn't take you long to catch on.



There is a favorite (passive/aggressive) technique that Southerners do. They "kiddingly" insult you. This works 2 ways for them. If you don't respond and confront them, after you leave they brag to friends, "I told him to his face that he was a jerk".  But if you do actively confront them, they say, " I was just kidding... you don't have to be so nasty".



The other thing that you mentioned regarding secretaries, is that they assume that they have the same authority as the person that they work for - therefore a judge's secretary usurps the authority and demeanor of a judge.



This phenomenon was mentioned by the novelist, Taylor Caldwell when she said that, "the less authority someone has - the more they like to throw it around".



If you are living in an area away from the large metro cities you need to recognize one crucial factor. Unless you were "born and raised"  in the small town you live - you will NEVER be accepted no matter how many centuries you live there. Southerners have to have known your "mama and them" growing up - or you are persona non gratis.



The other factor is that in small town South - if you aren't a Mason - you can't even be elected dogcatcher.

Do you think that if you have a strong regional accent (ie North London, New York etc) and you deliberately moderate it to sound less dialectic, it can end up inhibiting part of you personality? Is your accent part of your personality?

Your personality comes out in what you talk about not in what accent. Accents can be changed but not personalities.

i think your personality usually reflects your personality. those that grew up in a lower class tend to have a different personality and accent because of it

Early days people were more close to the nature, had natural food with less amount of fertilizers and other chemicals like insecticides used, most of the grains were non hybrid which could give more nourishment to the body, also old days people were more immune to the nature changes, which gave them more resistance power naturally.

they have adapted their strength through their need for survival.. they work harder and do more physical activities compared to modern people these days. they eat all natural foods and they never had the negative effects of today's modern technology. an example would be the processed foods which often have side effects to our health with their preservatives. and also the smokes and harmful gases created by technology.

Application of the term "Indian" originated with Christopher Columbus, who thought that he had arrived in the East Indies, while seeking India. This has served to imagine a kind of racial or cultural unity for the aboriginal peoples of the Americas. Once created, the unified "Indian" was codified in law, religion, and politics. The unitary idea of "Indians" was not originally shared by indigenous peoples, but many now embrace the identity.

Is there a a single racial/ethnic group/people of color that white people have not colonized and murdered?



it seems to me that every racial/ethnic group/people of color have been victims of white murder, colonization, and cultural destruction. why do white people as a group tend to do this? in the grand scheme of things they are the vast majority yet have this uncanny tendency to imperialize (i know its not a word) every culture they come across. let's say we lived in a microcosmic world where each color/race/ethnicity was subject to the constituional laws of the US. white people would be convicted of murder, rape, destruction of property, assault and battery, reckless endangerment, etc etc., the list of violations is interminable, and they'd have been executed/thrown under the jail without doubt. what is wrong with white people in general? they have some strange psychosocial urge to create chaos and killing whereever they go. back to the microcosm thing, if each race was reduced to a child in a sandbox, so you had one black child, one white, one latino, one arab, one asian child etc., the white child would be the one assaulting the others and taking their toys, so my question is what the f*uck is wrong with white people. is it there natural genetic collective response to being a minority that they lash out like this?

What is the average welsh mentality?
I know it's not good to stereotype but I was just wondering. I never here anything about the Welsh and so I assume what I read about them. There's not much news to read about as well. I would love to know how Welsh people think, e.g. about themselves, about others (especially other races), about their heritage, about ways of dressing, food, health, honour, family, religion, their future etc. Wikipedia just provides general information but I need info from some Welsh folk themselves, please.

Wales is a beautiful place full of lush green mountains. The people are friendly for the most part. They dress the same as the folks in england they eat the same foods, although probably more lamb, there religions vary just like any place.

Most of them do it for kicks because people, apparently like yourself, jump on the chance to be offended.  Trolls crave this, and sensitive people continue to feed them while complaining about them....secretly enjoying the drama as much as the youngins.  The majority of answers deemed "racist" or offensive on here are just responses which disagree with what the offended person believes.  You should be a hell of a lot more offended by the self-righteous wanna-be thought police on here than by the troll children or adults with unpopular opinions.

What do you expect? Honestly, don't waste time getting offended by the internet. That is really just a stupid mentality to have.



a) the internet is not real life
b) you can be anonymous... in fact think of it: People only say racist things when they can be anonymous on here (as you say)... but that doesn't mean they don't think it in real life. So really there is just as much racism online as there is in real life except here people can say what they are really thinking.
c) You are welcome to GTFO
d) If people are racist or not they have as much right to say what they want as anyone else. This is a Western site. In the West we have democracy.

I just think feminism has reached a global scale, and now the focus is more on cultural acceptance.  Feminists no longer want Muslim women to take off their hijab or to go around dressing like Britney Spears, now its about embracing cultures and traditions so long as the women from these backgrounds feel empowered and strong.  The only drawing line, is violence.

A question to african-americans (or anyone who knows)?



I lived and worked in france for about 6 months, and i met this african-american guy, only he was african-french. He spoke english so at the bus stop we chatted a little, and when i arrived at work i wanted to share with my co-working friend that i met my first person out of work, cause no one spoke english and he was the first.



And i tried to refer to him as african-american cause i know that is the right terminology. But i got confused and i didn't want to sound racist again (like it happened with the japanese guy to whom i refered to as jap without knowing it was kinda racist)



So, my question is.



Africans who live in america are refered to as African-americans
What about the ones in france? or the uk?



I know people consider racist if i say 'negro(although it is the right terminology as far as i know, like white = caucasian), black, colored, of course the N word ' and i suppose there are more words i don't know.



I got away with referring him to 'he wasn't french-french though so he spoke english weird enough, he was african-dark-like'



My co-worker understood what i meant and just giggled at my silly atempt.



BUT!



can someone please enlighten me with a more general word that won't put me in the racist category? cause i'm rather confused...



</question>

if you're in america and you're talking about him just say "black guy"; the person you're talking to already knows he was in France.  this pretty much goes for whatever country you're in when you talk about him.  Just call him what that country calls africans.

<question>



Black men and the down low?



OK, the black community in America is plagued by this problem of the so-called "down low brother." Basically, it means that there are some black men living heterosexual lives but secretly being intimate with men. The problem is that these men are in such denial. They do not see themselves as gay or bisexual- yet  secretly sleep with men.



Now, in terms of being on the "down low." Is this a problem that mostly affects black American men? What about other types of black men (like African, Caribbean, Latin)? It seems like this is presented as an American problem. Black America does not have the level of homophobia that is present in some other black cultures. So would this be a problem for other black groups besides American?



Share your opinions, experiences.



</question>



<additional details>



This is a problem in the black community. Read a book called "On the Down Low" by JL King.



There are other titles about this topic also.



And, usually they get discovered when their women contract HIV from their behavior. Other times, the woman may have caught them (even though they tried to keep it on the "down low")



Lisa- that's so true. It is illegal to be gay in Jamaica and has gotten many people jailed and violently killed. Do you think that in those outwardly homophobic societies, there would be a rise in down low practices since they can't be open?

how do you know this if they're on the "down low" as you say? I mean they ARE being "secretly" intimate right? It doesn't make sense how you'd know the secret lives of so many black men. I haven't noticed this "problem" actually must be just you.

It seems most people are just ready to pawn this problem as a Black American problem...mostly because most black men fear the stigma of being regarded as feminine and want to put up that tough guy front...as for ir this is only African Americans who knows...... there might be other black men out there doing the same thing but on a more discreet level.... in my opinion if you sleep with men you are gay no matter how much you tell urself otherwise

My opinion is that downlow blacks are in no greater number than secretly bisexual/bicurious people of other races. It just was publicized because blacks generally tend to be more homophobic, especially black men.



It's my contention that there are tons of black men on the downlow, as well as black women, and white men and women and other races as well.  So, I'm sure it's the same for the non-American blacks, whites etc.



And the ones who scream anti-gay rants the loudest usually are the ones trying to hide it the most.



Source(s):



HIV is one thing. Yea, blacks have a high rate of HIV, and much of it has to do with homesexual behavior. However, to say that down-low activity is a problem primarily in the black community I do not think is accurate. I can tell you bisexuality is prevalent among all cultures, but like I said, it is being focused on in the black community because of our traditional religious values where most American blacks view homosexual behavior in a worse light than other races.

I think it depends on the individual guy and also the culture. Speaking from experience, a lot of black/Latino men seem to like women with more curves. But sometimes, white guys do too.

Probably the same reasons they might be racist/discriminatory towards any other group.  Most stereotypes are built on top of a grain of truth, even though that small element of truth may be historical or may not apply in any way to the person being discriminated against.  If you are not part of the in-crowd, then you become part of the out-crowd and may be misjudged or mistreated as a consequence.  It isn't fair and it isn't unique to any particular nationality or faith group.

Last time I checked, there was only one race; the Human Race.



I don't believe its racism. I believe it's either ignorance or intolerence of others.  Besides, if you are a minority in the Country you reside you may feel that everyone is a bigot. Thinks about it.  If a muslim lives in the U.S. they will feel some hatred towards them.  If a Christian moves to say, Saudia Arabia, they'll feel hatred towards them to.

I think we all understand what she means by "Racist", so lets not get pedantic.



People do often say "they blow people up", but this is clearly just a tiny minority. I believe most muslims to be good people.  I think people are just scared of what they dont understand, so they treat muslims badly.



I respect muslims, as I do all people who really believe in their religion. They worship God just as many christians and jews do, they just call him "Allah" Many Christians also refer to God as "allah"  (this is a common term for God among catholics in Malta, and many Christians in Africa

Islam for most of its history has been a religion of hatred and violence toward the rest of the world .



It is a world religion largely because it was spread by armed conquest.



Any people who did not convert to islam when ordered to by Mohammed and his successors were declared by mohammed  to be the enemies of Allah and mohammed and could be attacked, invaded, pillaged and enslaved at will( mohammed was allowed first pick of the captured women who were shared out as booty among his followers)



This was the true meaning of Jihad ( NOT a war of selfdefence pure aggression) which Mohammed later declared not only a right of muslims but a religious duty--- and it went on for a staggering 11 centuries.



As late as the 19th century the arabologist Doughty reported that arab fundamentalists  in S arabia wanted to unleash a fresh wave of conquest on the nonmuslim world.

Read about some of the problems they have been having in Denmarrk , in particular, since Muslims have been migrating there to escape the civil wars in their homelands, like Etheopia. Read about the civil wars in there homelands. Read about the changes that have taken place within the faith over the last 60 years. You wll better understand the rise of the "extremeists" and who they really were and how that came about, and that they weren't just a stray band of crazys, they actually changed religion within homes and brought about what Christians would consider a revival. It didn't just affect a few.

You'll even find those with more of Scottish or Irish tinge to their voices.  However, when I ran across folks from other provinces, they don't have that very obvious British sounding accent. It's closer to American except some words are pronounced differently like "aboot" for "about"

I used to think the accent in the Northern US and Canada was pretty much the same until I went up to Victoria, British Columbia and stayed there for a week. I found out that many of the locals (especially those who are upper middle class or higher) speak with a very distinctive British sounding accent...almost like something like the "Queen's English" you'd expect to hear on a PBS program. In fact, it's said that people in Victoria are "more English than England."  (but after going there, I'm not fully conviced that's a compliment lol)



You'll even find people living in Victoria who have more of a Scottish or Irish tinge to their voices. This is particularly true in the working classes.



However, when I ran across folks from other provinces, they don't have that very obvious British sounding accent like I heard in Victoria. It's closer to what American in the Northern US speak except some words are pronounced differently like "aboot" for "about"  or "oot" for "out."  and "sorey" for sorry.  If one watches the Anne Of Green Gables movies that came out in the 80s, you'll notice this difference quite a bit. Now I do have to say once I met a gal from Nova Scotia who did have the Canadian accent but with an undertone of the stereotypical New York accent in it...but she'd never been to NYC.  Weird, huh?

Not really. Hell, Americans don't even have a uniform accent. I'm from Brooklyn and I can bet that I don't talk like someone from LA, Cleveland or Atlanta...and I don't even have a typical Brooklyn accent. So unless you find people with neutral accents, I'd say there will always be differences but some may be subtle.

The word nosy just changes curiosity to a nasty definition. True there are some people who take it to an unbearable level. But we educate and make ourselves aware of things that we otherwise may not have known if we didn't ask a question. In life you will come across circumstances that you would have been the wiser to have asked . Sometimes it is definitely better to learn from anothers experience.



Everyone has there opinion of how far someone has to go to be classified as nosy. It comes down to respect. That comes from both sides. So don't be so quick to judge someones level of curiosity because of your level of tolerance.

Would you feel better for a person to come out and say, I don't like you because you're _insert your race_..?



Would you feel better for a person to come out and say, "I don't like you because you're _insert your race_," rather than try and hide it.



I would feel so much better for a person to come up to me and say, "you know what? I don't like you because your black." We could have this deep discussion and argument. It'd be great. I hate it when a person is a closeted racists and makes secret generalizations. I hate racial profilers. They need to just go up to the customer and say: "you know what? I'm going to follow you because you're a minority. I don't trust minorities and because you are one, I assuming you're going to steal."



Sure, I might give them a few punches to the face, but it's so much better than to have someone hide it making it more uncomfortable for both people.

So you would reward honesty with violence? Black people seem to think violence solves  problems-so typical.

I would thank them for there honesty and then ignore them. They may be ignorant fools but, at least they are honest ignorant fools. That is way better than someone who smiles to your face and then says bad things about you behind your back.



Punching someone in the face may make you feel better for the moment but, you will end up in jail and possibly sued. Is someone's ignorance worth all that? Who cares what they think?

Both, yes arabs can be pretty and oriental asian can be pretty too.



but since most of asian countries have higher developing so the women probably look neast and clean than the arabs but that doesn't mean arabs aren't pretty. they just don't have much make up and most get very fat because of pragnancy a lot of childs? but indeed they could be pretty too.



the example of pretty arabs,  princess lalla of morocco and nadine nijem, nancy ajram and anabella hilal.



the example of pretty far east asians : Lui yi fui, Wikky Chao wei, Carmen Lee etc.

Kelly Rowland is cute but some of her features are too big for her very slim face, where Beyonce has a wider face that goes will with her features. Skin color can not make a person prettier or uglier, a clearer complexion, nice features and bone structure do. http://www.showclix.com/event_pictures/K...
http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2006/ce...
It would be more valid to compare a person who is on the same level or less then Kelly, like Keyshia Cole. If people say she's more attractive then you could say it's about complexion.

I agree Kenya Moore is a darker complected woman who in my opinion is more stunning as well as Jessica white.

No, but many people prefer Beyonce because she has lighter skin than Kelly. The standards of beauty in America were defined by the Europeans, so the lighter the skin, the "better-looking" one supposedly is. A load of BS, but that's America for you...

No, because  Kenya Moore http://kenyamoore.com/home.html , who is Kelly's complexion or even darker, is absolutely stunning and could give Beyonce a run for her money any day of the week.



Like Incognito said, symmetry determines beauty and symmetry deals with the size, position of the facial features in relation to eachother.

This is a good question, but it's scary to think about. I just moved to the second largest city in Germany and have to travel back home at night, so I have to start carrying mace and not listening to my iPod so that I can be aware of my surroundings. Just being aware and alert at all times is a good way to stay safe. Oh and always scope out an escape plan.

I think when it comes to being out alone, I think common sense should prevail over weapons.  Especially when dating, and dealing with the opposite sex.



Mace is a good answer, but the woman would have to be on the defense since you have to be less than 10 ft away from your attacker.



Carrying a gun wouldn't hurt, but how many women want to think that the only way to feel safe is the necessity to carry a weapon?  While handgun education and training is not a bad thing, it's need should be evaluated in depth.



Self defense is always a win-win solution.  The woman gets in good physical shape and can defend herself with out the use of a weapon, and will feel more secure knowing that she has the power to keep herself safe.



Know this, not all crimes against women, that aren't Domestically related, involve guns.  A good number of adult males (not MEN) who attack women use their force as a man, or a knife, or other weapon.  Guns are usually used for robberies.



Domestic violence is a whole other issue.

A woman's #1 line of defense are AWARENESS and COMMON SENSE.  Be AWARE of your surroundings, and act accordingly WITH COMMON SENSE.  If your surroundings are a dark alley, don't be a freakin idiot and walk down it by yourself.



I carry a firearm, am a good shot, and am confident using it....but for many women this is not a good idea.  If you are not comfortable using a weapon when necessary, it will work against you.  Perpetrators take weapons from gals all the time, or they put them in a position where they can't get to them.  If you are not the type that can aggressively use a weapon with confidence, leave it at home.  If you are, carry it and keep it easily accessible.



Self-defense and mace are always helpful.  Being extremely LOUD is also.  But, again, common sense and awareness beat these elements hands down.  *Most* women are attacked in situations they could have easily protected themself in...lock your doors and your car doors, don't go dark places alone if you don't have to, observe who and what is nearby.  Don't look like a scared or absent-minded victim and you *likely* won't be one.

You said it yourself . Being alone. The more people you have around you ( trusted friends) the least likely you will be subject to a violent crime. Self confidence acquired through learning self defense is good. But can lead to over confidence. Always look to your local law enforcement for pamphlets on the subject.

The Bible says your body is a Temple of the Holy Spirit. God doesn't want you to harm the Temple. Cigarettes harm your bodfy, therefore, God doesn't like that.

I don't know about the point of hating cigarettes. But we who
are believers are temples of His Holy Spirit who dwells inside
us.

Then a cigarette is just a plain idol.

And Almighty God wants us 100%. And He deserves the 
number one spot in our hearts.

Why on earth is this in this section?

I don't know about God, but all people should hate cigarettes, they harm your health, stink to high heaven, damage those around you, and kill you years before you would otherwise die, while taking decades of health away leading up to the death.  Tobacco is incredibly destructive, and should not be used by anyone.

Now I do understand that young gay men have a higher percentage of smokers than young straight men (for various reasons -- trying to appear straight when they are young teens, oral fetish, etc.) but those numbers are getting better -- and I still don't see why this question would be in this area.

Ah well.

If your asking that if god hate gay well he doesnt.

Its the people who hate gay: not god it is believe that god created all man kind and give us a right of passage so i dont believe none of  that god hate gay crap that is a bunch of lies.

If he does does then heck with it show me the proof that he hate me for being bisexual and i believe in god i will turn away from him if he comes down here preaching saying all sorts of crap.

I am tired of the church saying these type of things the church dont know nothing about me or the world we are just preaching to a complete nothing but air looking at the sky and seeking his help.

Just a few months ago the church offended my family saying that god hates gay how the heck does he knows i just left and cursed the damn church my life is full of all these craps and i sure hope that god does not hate gays.

I grew tired of holding it in god will except me rather he like it or not because i did nothing wrong other then to sit here doing nothing.

I wouldn't worry yourselves over people like that, they are not worth it, and who cares if god loves you or not at the end of the day if you have got someone in your life that loves you and you love them, who needs god, when you have love.

sneak  out  of the  family  thing  and pay  the  consequences  later.  grounding  or  whatever



go to  the  boyfriends  thing  but  explain that you have  had  to  sneak  away and  you are  now  in a conflict and  see  what  he  says.

tell  him  there  was  no  way  you  were  going  to  miss, this  even  if  it  means  getting  in  lots  of  trouble  at  home.  he  might  let  you  off the  hook  but



see what  his  mood  is  like.



dont  leave  if  he  really  wants  you there because  you  promised.



your  word  is  all  you  are



and  your  parents  should  appreciate  that.

it  sounds  like  they  hit you with this at  the last  minute  and  its not really  fair to  expect  you  to  cancel long standing commitments. but  if  you  ask  them  they  are  more  than  likely  to  say  no, you  are  staying home.

if  anything



you  can  call  your  folks  from  your  boyfriends  and  tell  them  you  wont  be  able  to  make  it  home.



that at  least  puts  your  parents  in  the  bad guy  position

Should i tell my ex that there may be someone new in my life?



We have been childhood friends since birth,dated in our teens and now slowly trying to rebuild a friendship again,i hate feeling like i am doing something wrong and i don't like the fact of being seen with someone else in fear it will ge twisted back to Tony(ex),he's a really great guy and i would never do anything to hurt him.The guy knows the 'quick facts' about my history and he seems cool with it,if possible i really would like him and Tony to be friends...i am not sure what i would do if they hated each other,Tony is a massive part of my life and to cut him out of it would kill me.



</question>



<additional details>



To be honest it pains me calling Tony my ex.. :(

Life yeah?



Tony hit me twice,the first time i was forgiving but the second time,i don't want to be one of those poor souls always worrying if it will happen again...so i split up with him. :(
But not gonna say more as i will just be repeating qoutes from previous questions of mine(and which would bore people.).



Heck and i feel even more guiltly as i am sure,without meaning to,using this guy.If Tony had not hurt me then we would still be together,but he really scared me those 2 times and living in fear of someone you love is not acceptable.

Don't purposely hide this new relationship from your ex, but you don't need to tell him its your life and you are entitled to live it.

Tell him if you want to but don't feel its something you have to do.



Just be careful as it sounds like you aren't completely over your ex, you have accepted that things will never go back to being that way with him but emotions are still there, try and step back and remember he is just a friend and make sure this doesn't interfere with your relationship. Although if this new guy knows some of it and seems ok with it so sounds like won't be any problems as far as he is concerned.

If you do tell your ex don't rub it in is face although to be fair it doesn't sound like you would anyway.

you need to sit down and talk to Tony about this. he is old enough to have to accept your not going to be single forever, and that there will be new people in your life but he has to know when to take a step back and see he isnt the only person. Let him know he is special and you appreciate him but he is a very good friend kind of relationship. eventually, introduce them and see how things go, you might find they end up good friends. good luck and i wish you all the best in your new relationship :) x

It sounds like you're still not over Tony.  (((hugs)))

If you're still in contact with him, then I guess the best thing to do would be to tell him you may be dating someone else (especially if you're concerned that others may tell him).

That being said, it's really, really hard to get over someone if you still have him in your life.  I think it may be unrealistic to expect your new boyfriend (if it turns into a relationship) and your former boyfriend to be friends.  They can be cordial to each other, but I doubt they will end up best buds.  I mean, the new boyfriend could end up being jealous of the old boyfriend, especially if you secretly still have feelings for him.

So, right now I think you should concentrate on the new prospect you have.  It could turn into something great!



Good luck!

**EDIT**  If Tony hit you twice, this changes everything.  I really think you shouldn't even be friends with him, let alone worrying about him being friends with your new guy.

If Tony hit you, then you need to not date him. That is it. I think it would be a good idea for you to tell him that you are talking to somebody new, let the idea sink in that you have a new prospect, get the three of you together and go hang out if that is what would make you feel the most comfortable. But yes, let him know about the new guy.

That's a very touchy situation b/c you don't want to hurt either one of them.  Since the two of you still see each other, it would be impossible for you, without blatantly lying to him, not to tell him you're seeing someone new.  Just tell him as gently as you can that you wanted him to know that you've started seeing someone but you don't want it to affect the relationship (friendship) that you have with him.  Good luck...

EDIT:  GOOD FOR YOU for being strong enough to recognize that staying in a relationship with a person that hits you is NEVER a good thing!  {{{{Weevil}}}}}

When i'm goin out to hang round with my friends who are girls she asks me why don't i hang around with more boys
My dad is scowling at me quite a lot and it's quite unnerving
Also when we all might be watching tv and they're chatting if a gay scene or the word gay is mentioned they seem to shut up until like 5 mins after it's finished.

It seems like they do based on what you said. if you think they will be supportive you could tell them. Coming Out is a great experience. i came out when i was 16 (I'm 18 now), turns out my mum knew my whole life haha.

Chances are they already know, if they are not homophobic I expect they will be supportive and if not it's your life not theirs, give it a try!

Presumably if they do know, rather than you being a bit paranoid about innocent gestures and comments, then if they had a problem they'd say something to you.  If they do know and are not saying anything, they probably want to let you 'get on with it' and be happy.

What you are describing is a stereotype. 
I'm gay, and I do not dress like a man.
My best friend is a gay guy and he does not have any of the stereotypical mannerisms. The same is true for a couple of my other gay friends who are guys and girls.



The media enjoys spreading stereotypes like the ones you described. . .It's our duty to stop the vicious cycle of generalizing and categorizing.



For the gay people who do fit the description, who cares if they dress or act that way! That is who they are, and they are comfortable with that.

When you are born GAY you act according to your personality and makeup.  When you are born STRAIGHT the same thing.



Nobody, ACTS one way or another.  What you call "silly talk" with regard to gay people some call "straight" talk silly.  You cannot put a group of people into a box and say everyone is the same.  Are you like your family?



Do you have the same way of talking as say, your Mother or Father.  Do you act SILLY?

Once you have broadened your horizons a bit; meeting other people, you'll see that there are all kinds of things people do to be either noticed or that is the way they really feel they must express themselves.  I drive down the road all the time and see people picking their noses.  I know that they would probably not do this during a nice dinner out, but what they are doing is totally unconscious.  A lot of the mannerisms you notice are developed during that person's early years and were never corrected, did not seem important enough to be corrected or were corrected and that was ignored.  When I was little, my only friends were my older sisters.  Naturally, they became my role-models and so I wanted to be like them.  However, I grew out of that phase once I got to high-school. Please understand that it takes all kinds of folks to make up a world.  Peace to you.

You are actually only asking this because of the "gay blokes" you have seen that act this specific way, there are plenty of gay men that do not act feminine at all, you just do not notice them because they are not the feminine type. As for the lesbians that dress like men? That is because they are more butch, it is the same thing, you only notice the butch lesbians because they are out of the norm. There are a lot of femme lesbians that you wouldn't even know were lesbians because they just don't look it.



As for "why". The why is because that is how they feel inside. So they dress and act on there outside the way that they feel on their insides. They don't do it "on purpose" like it is an act, that is how they are, that is how they feel, and so that is how they behaive. The same way that the class clown acts silly in class, that is because he is silly inside, or the girl that is always checking her hair and makeup, that is because that is how she is inside, that is why they act the way they act. To them, it isn't "silly talk and mannerisms", to them, it is just how they are.

The fact is people are different just because some people are a certain way doesn't mean all people are.  You could say why are all straight men wife beaters?  Of course they are not all wife beaters, but some are.  I could go on but the point is simple.  If people are 'effeminate' or 'butch' that doesn't mean that they are any more worthy of criticism or judgement any more than anyone else.  If you don't like 'em or they make you feel uncomfortable, don't associate with 'em!  As to why they do it, they just do, it is something or a way of life they feel comfortable with.  If that kind of thing 'floats their boat' then let it - it's their choice!  Just don't make blanket statements assuming that everyone is a certain way, because that just makes you seem stupid!

They don't but they may feel they have to because others do.

I would say that the reasoning behind a gay man (I say 'a' gay man because I do not want to generalise) acting 'feminine' is because (in my opinion), to come out about their sexuality requires them to accept themselves as againsts the majority. Heterosexual men are not under this kind of pressure and are comfortable going with the majority's ideas on what is 'masculine'. Once the door has openned to accept yourself as homosexual in spite of being under disaproval, that man may also decide to open himself up to other things they would like to do that aren't usually considered acceptable for his gender. It could be that many heterosexual men may enjoy the freedom that females have in dressing in brighter colours, letting out emotion, dancing when they want etc. if they gave it the chance but are not used to going against the norm.

It depends on how you look in a dress.
There was a guy who used to frequent a restaurant/Irish pub where I worked.  One New Year's Eve, he dressed up in a slinky black cocktail dress and pumps.  This guy was a very manly, somewhat muscular, Northern English working-class bloke. He rocked that dress, looked hot (and I don't fancy dudes)!

Are there opportunities for English/Spanish/Portuguese speaker in Cologne/Bonn/Dusseldorf?



My girlfriend has been transferred to Cologne and I'm now looking for an opportunity not related to language teaching in this beautiful town. The small detail is that I don't speak a word of German but I'm fluent in other European languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese).
If anybody have some tips or ideas of places that might need someone with this languages and background experience in tourism and public sector I'll be very much grateful.

Everybody will want you to teach one of the languages. it sucks, but that's usually the way it is in a foreign country. You get typecast quickly into teaching unless you were placed by a company in that country.

losing looks, little money etc etc plus ofcourse you are likely to have faced multiple losses like job via retirement, loss of parents, loss relatives/friends, may be lonely etc.

Hello,

Well I'm 55 but do not feel it and your scenario does not have to be. Here is why:

1) LOL, like they say only mad dogs and English men go out in the noon day sun and with that philosophy as well as constant facial cream and oil treatments from my wife, wrinkles have not appeared yet.



2) I kept physically active, not fanatically mind you but well enough to work in the garden, ride bikes load and unload trucks etc so I am not lying around like an invalid.

3) We baby boomer types do not have that big generation gap that we did with our parents "Great Generation" so we have kept up with all the changes and have been far more accepting with regards to society.

4) There is no need to suffer seeing loved ones go if you include friends over a wide span of years. I am involved in many community activities and have friends from 20 - 85 years old.

5) My type of work is not physical so I can do it until 75, assuming I have no crippling illness. Even if your nest egg is perfect, it is foolish to lie around or go to bingo or golf courses all day. Take courses from woodworking to foreign languages and your mind should stay sharp barring biochemical problems.



So all in all you are the Captain of your own ship and can make what you want out of old age.

By the way, Iwas amazed at how fast the years flew between 25 and 50... they seemed to go 5x faster than my first 25 years; can't say I wasn't warned and I'll pass this on to you!

Cheers,

Michael Kelly

Could  my friend be  gay?



my friend seems to have a secret life that seems more important than anything. for instance, he arranges to meet me for a drink and then doesnt reply when i text to confirm. he waits till after the time we meet then texts me with some excuse. he can not be contactable for up to a week and he did tell me he had been involved in sexfinder on the internet once when he was drunk but with women. he has confided really sensitive things to me but none of this  has explained his unreliable and illusive behaviour .

Oh, Sweetie, those are 'straight' traits...not gay...  Have you ever heard of a gay guy missing Happy Hour...geeez NO...well, not unless they were in a horrific accident and the ambulances route to the hospital didn't drive right by the bar where you were supposed to meet...now really!

Sounds more like the action of a straight man than a gay man.  Anyway if he is truly your friend, his sexuality shouldn't make a jot of difference. His reliability, is something for you to decide!

It would be absurd to or not to welcome somebody merely on account of their race.  There are other facts to be taken into account when making such a decision.

I am from the UK, although currently living in Korea.

In 2002, I spent three months in China.  I took away from that trip that generally Chinese people are very welcoming, giving and friendly.

Despite the language barrier, the Chinese would try to help you in any way that they could.

Towards the end of the trip, though, we tried to avoid asking for directions as it would be embarrassing.

The Chinese, working as a chain of total strangers, would get you escorted to your destination.  Here is an example using London place names:  You would be at Paddington Station and ask Person A how to get to the National Gallery.  Person A would find someone (Person B) taking the Bakerloo Line Southbound, tell them where you wish to go and give you to Person B.  Person B would find someone (Person C) getting off at Charing Cross, tell them where you wanted to go and give you to Person C.  Person D would escort you outside the station and find somebody (Person E) going past the National Gallery and give you to them.

I can't imagine that a chain of strangers in the UK would help a foreigner in the UK - but the Chinese often did that in China without thinking twice about it!

I very much welcome visitors to the UK - we have a fantastic country which I love to show off!  Please welcome all visitors to the UK warmly!

the basic rule of thumb is that each is easier when they are not in their home countries. if an american girl is looking for her hugh grant in shining hackett armour so to speak, she'll be more likely to be open, and a british girl might do the same for her johnny depp or mr pitt on the other side of the blue.

are swedish girls easy? many will tell you yes. but speak to a swedish guy.  it's a basic case of home-field disadvantage.

I feel bad for her for having such a terrible example set by her parents.  I don't know why people defend her and her family.  This girl is under 18 and admits that food is like a drug for her.  Letting your children entertain any addiction is uncalled for.  If her parents were drug addicts and she became one, we would hold her parents resposible.  But, because she is obese, we like to be politically correct and pretend that it her parents are not to blame.

Does anyone remember Chic Murray?



Chic Murray, the famous Scottish actor and comedian, is the subject of this page, which has been dedicated to him. Scottish humour is appreciated throughout the World but Chic's humour is both unique and incredibly funny. It's very difficult to do it justice in print but here goes anyway ...
 Visiting London, Chic was asked by a stranger, "Do you know the Battersea dog's home?". He replied, "I didn't even know it was away."
 When staying at a Rothesay hotel, there were the usual toast and marmalade (in little round pots) on the breakfast table in the morning. When the landlady came into the room, Chic lifted a tiny pot of honey and said "I see you keep a bee!"
 It's a small world, but I wouldn't want to have to paint it.



My mother was so house proud that when my father got up to sleepwalk she had the bed made by the time he got back.



My father was from Aberdeen, and a more generous man you couldn't wish to meet. I have a gold watch that belonged to him. He sold it to me on his deathbed. I wrote him a cheque for it, post dated of course.



I made a stupid mistake last week. Come to think of it, did you ever hear of someone making a clever mistake?



So I gave him a wave. Actually, it was more of a half wave, because I only half know him.



What use is happiness? It can't buy you money.



I met this cowboy with a brown paper hat, paper waistcoat and paper trousers. He was wanted for rustling.



If something's neither here nor there, where the hell is it?



My father was a simple man. My mother was a simple woman. You see the result standing in front of you, a simpleton.



I had a tragic childhood. My parents never understood me. They were Japanese.



I won't say I was slow developer, but our teacher was quite pleased to have someone her own age in the class to talk to.



If it weren't for marriage, husband and wives would have to fight with strangers.



After I told my wife that black underwear turned me on, she didn't wash my Y-fronts for a month.

Yes I remember him... but you sound as if you'd make a good comedian as well, ever thought of taking it further and maybe getting some of your own material.

It's sad when you think of just how many 'funny men' and women we've lost or they just don't appear anymore.



Morecombe and Wise was my favourite, I loved Dave Allan, Ruby Wax is great, and Billy Connolly, there's so many really great comedians past and present.

In all seriousness though, just sit your folks down privately and politely tell them. Anything of this gravity (like sexuality, gender identity, and "dress roles"?) will take a little time to get used to. Plus it's better that it comes from your mouth rather than them finding out from some nosy, gossiping neighbor.

this  is  a  private  matter unless  you  plan  to  wear  womens clothes  ALL the  time.



in that  case  i  would  wait  until  i could  afford  to  move  out  of  the  house. 
it  also  makes  a difference whether  you  simply  dress up as a  female,  or if you  want  to  become  one. you  need  to  make  that  very clear  distinction.

Your parents would proberly freak out really bad.

But if you want them to know really bad, I'd try to ease it in.

Maybe start with a pair of tight girls jeans and then a top or



somthing.

Hope you find a way to tell them.

Consult the closest of your two parents or even if you have a sister (or close female cousin) your age about your cross dressing. I would not go to breakfast dressed that way. I would talk to them seriouisly and try and explain why you want to do this. They will probably want to know when it first started or maybe they have suspected all along, not sure. You should do some research on your part to try and understand your situation and the consequences better. Does your school have programs that might help you or any places in town that provide information for CD or LGBT community members?

If you have two loving parents they will accept you for the way you are. Depending on your age they might accept your "cross dressing" only in private, or do you want to make wear women's clothes all the time? Maybe a close friend or girlfriend would be someone you could talk to about this before you let them know.

Are you transgendered or is this just a cross dressing curiousity. Some web sites and links might be helpful. Good luck.

Is this something that PLAYAS have learned?



"If a relationship is based upon the desire to get sex, then you will find yourself addicted to it, but not him."

Is this why a lot of "players" are overly confident, because they don't desire the true person, rather the activity they can get from someone?

Also, when someone is realllllllllllllly nervous around a person IMMEDIATELY and always afterwards, does that mean they most likely feel true love for that individual since true love, like lust, can be felt right away?

Pop culture is whatever is popular at the time. Whatever Hollywood or entertainers are doing or wearing there is a certain group of folks that follow it. Pop music is whatever music is the most popular out the different genres at certain period of time. To me, people who listen or follow pop culture have no sense of creativity or self esteeem. They just can't be themselves and march to the beat of their own drum.

It has a big problem.
One one hand it want to be down on the streets with "the kids" and on the other it wants to be superior and elitist. You can't be both.
This leads to its followers being sneeringly arrogant to those that do not think as they do and submissive to the music and musicians they worship. Just like all the urban scene kids in places like Notting Hill and Hoxton.

So long as they don't get given the lime one then I'm fine.
That's all mine. I hearby shotgun all green/lime fruit pastels and fruit gums.



Edit: Sweet Delusion and Lime Kitty shotgun rules. I see no shotgun above me, there all mine. The hats cute Lime Kitty but if thats a lime pastel or fruit gum you're going to have to hand it over.

Integration is nonsense



For years as a child i was encouraged not to be racist and to see other races/ colours and creeds as equals. I stood in protests in the sixties fighting for the rights of immigrant and non british citizens to have a right to be treated as equal and be encouraged to integrate into british society. Now 40 years on I find that those same people no longer want to integrate but to create ghettos and no go areas. Many are trying to change areas of the UK into small versions of their mother countries and the British Culture is being suffocated in favour of minority groups who hide behind a Cowardly Government obsessed with political correctness Has this all gone too far now?

You are correct.



This country's immigration policy is appalling and now we're suffering on all fronts.

Time to shut the borders, hunt down the illegal immigrants and boot them out.



If nothing else, it's a start.

I'm far from racist, but it seems many of those we tried to integrate had their own agenda.

Hardly a question,more a statement of fact, whoever can come up with a solution will be sure of my vote.
But this is human nature the world over, on a visit to Duneden, South Island,N.Z the radio played more Scottish music than you would hear in Edingburgh.
I should not comment as I am Irish living in England and only play Irish music and listen to radio eire, mix with fellow country men, etc

Like I said its human nature and we generally stand by our culture and roots.

Sorry, buddy but it is already too late, British Culture has already irrevocably changed - there are more curry shops in the UK than fish & chip shops, & it just isn't the Indians/Pakistanis eating there, it's you.

Immigrant groups have always ghetto-ized, they feel safer that way and they can provide each other with support, esp if their english is poor.

I live in Canada, a former UK colony, probably the most racially and culturally integrated place in the world, and we still have problems getting along, esp with the native people who we took the land from :)

I think the idea of integration is a wishful fantasy - the reality is it is human nature to attack that which is perceived as 'different' or 'not the norm' therefore ghettos are form partly as a protective gesture and partly out of sheer arrogance.  I by no means advocate racial violence in any form, but having been on the receiving end of some racially motivated violence I am called to mind an Enoch Powell quote
"She is becoming afraid to go out. Windows are broken. She finds excreta pushed through her letterbox. When she goes to the shops, she is followed by children, charming, wide-grinning piccaninnies. They cannot speak English, but one word they know. 'Racialist,' they chant."

I like the industrial look a little more then the Gothic look, but they are all fun.  I was into costuming for some time so I was surprised by Loli Goth given how heavily it took from Victorian stuff&gt;  Though at the end of the day I am more interested in the package then its wrapper and I find that much of the current goth/punk/emo mentality gets a bit on my nerves, but then I am an old fart and they usually don't really care what I think.

I don't fancy Goth folk, but they do look amazing and really make an effort.  It is attractive, but like art.  All those piercings too can be so fascinating and then most folk conform, get a job, spin on their treadmill...



What I find attractive and what I actually fancy are strangely dissimilar.  Those I actually fancy are not always in presentation packaging, but I can see the quality of the goods inside.  That and I know potential when I see it.

I'm sexually attracted to (some of) them, but I never imagine settling down with a goth girl or forming a real relationship with them. I'm not goth in any way- I can't imagine we'd get along that well.

I AM ATTRACTED TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHICKS...I FIND THAT I AM CURRENTLY MORE ATTRACTED TO BUTCHY CHICKS THAT SKATE BOARD AND DO STUFF LIKE THAT, GOTH CHICKS, EMO CHICKS, PUNK CHICKS (I AM PUNK/SCENE) no i don"t cut myself...I DO NOT FIT INTO A CERTAIN GROUP OF PPL @ SKOOL, I CAN GET ALONG W/ MOST PPL...BUT ITS PREPPY PPL THAT I USUALLY HAVE A HARD TIME AGREEING W/. I LIKE CHICKS WHO HAVE THAT I DON'T GIVE A FUK, HARDCORE LOOK OR THAT INNOCENT LOOK. I ALSO FIND THAT I'M REALLY ATTRACTED TO CHICKS W/ SHORT HAIR OR SOME KINDA CRAZY SHORT HAIRSTYLE.

SOMETIMES I LIKE A PERSON WHO'S SENSITIVE AND SOMETIMES I LIKE A PERSON WHO TAKES SHYTT FOR WHAT IT IS AND DOESN'T GET ALL WORKED UP ABOUT SOMETHING STUPIDD!! :]

THOUGH I HAVE YET TO MEET THAT SPECIAL GIRL WHO I ♥. (i have not been in a relationship w/ a chick yet but before i used to date guys just to fit in so no one who realize that i'm gay...not many ppl who know me know i am a lesbian, except for my mom).

I love the gothic look. Especially if they have dark wavy/curly hair and pale skin. Creamy white skin in contrast to red or darker colours seems to make them glow. When I see one, I sometimes have to resist the temptation to touch their face. It's kind of sad. :x Corsets are really nice also. Actually, I really like all types of lolita fashion too. Hmm... But not all girls suit the fashion... so it depends on the actual girl I guess.

I don't think that makes you weird. Women have beautiful bodies and some women are sexually attracted to them in fantasy but not always necessarily reality.

Hair. Smell. Perfume was one of the first things I noticed and I was really drawn in. Eyes themselves don't really do much for me - only when there's eye contact & I find that really arousing. There are the more obvious sexual things but I find the whole "package" of a woman arousing; just everything about her. I think when there is that amazing sexual chemistry, there is nothing more arousing.

It sounds like you are suffering from anorexia, or at least that's the way you are headed.
That is a very, very dangerous disease. It's a mindset that may eventually end up killing you, if you do not watch out.

What I think you should do?
I think you should talk to someone about it. A psychiatrist would probably be the best solution. Or a teacher you trust, perhaps. I know that you probably do not think there is anything wrong with you whatsoever.. But please, listen to me! I have friends who have gone through the very same thing. One of them almost died from it! Do you want to end up like her? Act now, before it is too late.

..I wish you nothing but the best!
Good luck.

PS: If you want to lose weight, go on a diet. Talk to a doctor. Do NOT try to starve yourself under any circumstances.

Don't! Being skinny is very overrated. Learn to love yourself for who you are! Being a size 1 is not a ticket to overnight acceptance and appreciation from society.

Besides, starving yourself is extremely unhealthy. You need a daily intake of certain vitamins and minerals that can only be supplied by a healthy diet, or your health will take a serious downfall.

The fact that you've asked this question would suggest you know you're doing something very dangerous and you're actually asking for help.  You might not think so, but you are.
You need to make an appointment with your doctor and ask to speak with a dietitian too.  If you try to starve your body it will just hold onto any reserves it has, you'll lose weight faster by eating sensibly.

eating nothing is not the way to lose weight.

if you seriously want to lose weight and quickly i would recommend eating  an unlimited amount of fruits, vegetables and salads and top up with a limited amount of wafer thin ham, chicken etc... as they contain very little calories. when i need to lose weight i do this. i know it is not healthy in the long run but sometimes needs must and all that. i have lost 5 lbs in 4 days doing this.
ps. drink plenty of fluids as well as this helps

i have tried this for 9 days and only lost 1pound, all i drank was water and didnt eat a thing. but its the beginings of anorexia and people usually have anorexia for 6 to 10 months before they have a significant weight loss,



Trust me on this one though, i lost 4 and a half stone in under 3 months by cutting out completly sugar, alcohol and carbohydrates, u only eat veg and salads and drink only water, i stopped doing this about 6months ago and have not put any of the weight back on

(if u must try the 4day starve thing the best thing to get rid of the headach is a mini mars bar and a coca cola)

9 stone= 126 pounds. At 5'3", you probably don't look skinny, but I doubt you look fat. How old are you? You compare yourself to other girls, but what you don't understand is that even if you could lose weight, you would look different because you have your own body type. Comparing yourself to another girl is foolish. You sound very obsessed. Whether you can really understand this or not, your desperation is due to some other emotional issue. You are using your weight as a distraction because what is REALLY bothering you is too intense to deal with. Even if you lost that weight, you'd still not feel good about yourself. Why do you think anorexics continue to starve themselves? Because it was never about weight to begin with! They just latched onto it and forgot what was really wrong...

hey, well for starters your not exactly fat. and i know you told people not to tell you this but i think its important seeing as youl put more weight on if you do it. if you starve your self your body goes in to starvation mode i.e anything you do it your body will take all fat because it needs it so when you start eating again you will put on a lot more weight. not too mention its very bad for your health. try eating healthy i.e dont snack have some fruits for breakfast a salad for lunch and then fish or chicken with out any fatty sauces and try not to eat anything thats been fried. if your old enough you could join a gym if not then you can do exercises in your room go for a jog out side ride a bike anything. please dont starve it really wont work. a diet and exercise will allow you to loose weight and tone.

It is actually ok not to eat for a few days and fast every now and then. Not eating can actually be good if used appropriately and for the right reasons.  Juice and water fasts can purge the body of toxins, clear the skin, make your think more clearly, and increase your health.  Fasting can make you feel sick because your body is starting to feel the toxins being purged from your body rapidly. If you do it too long and too often however, it can be extremely dangerous.

You need to understand the difference between thin and anorexic. Thin is losing fat and toxins from the body.

You can stay thin by excercizing, eating a diet of fruits, grains, and veggis and by drinking pleanty of water. Get a juicer and a blender and make drinks, juices, and smoothies. Stay away from processed foods, mean such as hamburger which is full of fat and grease, twinkies, fried chicken and other similar foods.

If you eat a natural vegitarian diet, excersize regularly, drink pleanty of water, go to bed at a reasonable hour and get pleanty of sleep.  You can eat unlimited veggies because they are processed quickly through your body and give your body the nutrition it needs. You can have a few whole wheat pieces of toast a day with cinimon and olive oil. You can have some fruit and oatmeal for break fast as oatmeal will help rid your body of colestoral. DO NOT GO ON THE  ATKEN'S DIET, IT CAUSES PERMANENT DAMAGE TO THE BODY. The Atkins diet has you eat fatty food with little nutrition. With the atkinds diet, you lose water weight, but not very much fat.

If you do these things, you will have the body of a movie star. Many movie stars eat a vegitarian diet or more vegitables than the normal person.  Being a vegitarian is the key to losing weight. I am thin. I knew a guy who was thin and when he got of a vegitarian diet, he got fat again.

Also, DO NOT drink diet sodas. Nutrasweet causes obesity and weight gain. If you want soda, get charged water and add juice or pick up some natural soda's at your local health food store.

I am a guy 6ft 2inch and weight 13st and i totally know and understand what you mean all my friends are skinny and they can eat whatever they want and not put a pound on. But my starving yourself that aint the best thing to do trust me in fact you will put weight on then loss it quickly. I use to be 16st stone i was very heavy then i dieted takes a long time but worth it and that way you aint at risk of any health problems.

I suggest watch what you eat nothing high in sat fat, fat or sugar and calories. And exercise a lot i know this aint what you want to hear really nothing is going to get rid of headache and feeling sick.

Um. I think it would take you about two weeks of starving yourself to get the results you want. In two days you might lose a few pounds but in the long run starving yourself is counter productive because right after you have finished starving your self and you eat your first meal, your body will make a mad rush to store a great deal of body fat to prepare you for another starving period. You will end up gaining more weight than you lost. This approach will then lead you to an eating disorder and poor health. Have you seen the pictures of starving people in africa? They have bloated bellies. Starvation does not work. Only a combination of diet and exercise will help you to sculpt your body. That is another thing. Do you want to lose weight or change your figure? Starving your self will not make you more shapely. I suggest, that if you are serious about changing your body, you go see a nutritionist and an physical trainer, or whatever they are called. If you keep with a personally designed program, you should feel some results in about a month and you should see some results in two to three months. All good things come with time, and no, there is no quick fix for body sculpting. If you are hell bent on ignoring the truth because you do not like it, you may try lipozine or similar drugs to help you lose weight, maybe then you will listen to reason.

If you starve yourself the fat will eat itself, and you won't lose any weight. Try this:
Breakfast: 1 Mini Wheat Bagel with butter 7am
Snack: 1 piece of Fruit or 1 string cheese 10am
Lunch: Salad ( As much as you want with no meat) Any dressing 12pm
Snack: 1 piece of Fruit or 1 string cheese 3pm
Dinner: What ever you want just be reasonable in portion size 6 or 7pm
Snack: 1 cup of non butter popcorn 8:30
Good Night

Try this it may work for you. I know it worked for me. In 9 months time I went from 300lbs. to 224lbs. I'm still going strong, and I feel great. Good Luck, and don't starve yourself. Time to let go of the candy bars; cake; Ice cream, and you will be fine.

I went through this already. It worked! Except I was REALLY weak, sick, and moody all the time.

When you lose weight by not eating you will lose weight but when you start eating you will GAIN weight faster. Losing weight this way fools your body to conserve energy so when you DO eat your body won't burn as many calories so your metabolism will slow down.



( I'm a major health freak so listen to me please. I don't want you to go what I went through. )

If you really want to be skinny REALLY bad then I suggest you go on a balanced diet and WORK OUT at least 30 minutes everyday. Anything that involves physical activity and sweating.

Here's your diet plan. If you eat whole wheat, fresh fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, lean meats, and drink nothing but water then you will lose weight. Sodas and fruit juices have a lot of sugar. Stay away from sugar! More healthy foods please. Also eating more of small portioned food will make you lose faster because your metabolism will always be working.

Breakfast:
Whole Wheat Toast - 2 slices
2 cups of Cottage Cheese.
Fresh fruit - Bananas  / strawberries/ blueberries/ apples/ or watermelon. & water

If you don't like cottage cheese then have EGG WHITES. no yolk with some cheese.

Lunch: A sandwich with whole wheat bread, NO MAYO, a lot of vegetables, cheese, and chicken breast.

A light Dinner: A ceasar chicken salad with any kind of dressing with vinegar. No heavy dressings like ranch or thousand island.



If you don't have time to make a breakfast then grab a protein shake with some veggies & snack and go.

The reason why I wrote so much is because I can't stand another person starving themselves to lose weight because it doesn't work forever & you will damage your body.

I lost 30 lbs in 3 months. Have fun and eat healthy.

I've been to N/A meetings and they really helped me. They reminded me that i'm not alone and there ARE people who understand what life is like on drugs and who are inspirational in that they too struggle with life without drugs.

In an N/A meeting people get up and just speak about whatever the subject is for the day. Subjects might be things such as 'relationships' or 'hope'.

You dont have to speak if you dont want to. In fact its a good idea first time you go to approach the leader and let them know who you are and tell them that you'd prefer not to speak. You speak when you are good and ready.

Introduce yourself to people and just be yourself. Be prepared to give a couple dollars in donation to help the group do things like rent out the meeting space and such. Though you dont have to donate if you dont want to.

I think you'll find that you'll be able to relate to a lot of people there and they'll be able to relate to you.

I wish you luck and serenity.

The whole concept makes no sense to me.  Conservatives are fighting tooth and nail to eradicate LGBT rights (and some are working to eradicate *us*) so why would any self-respecting LGBT person want to align themselves with that party?

mostly nothin.
they went naked... but since its a party, i don't think you're gunna want to have naked people running around. generally head bands, peace medalians, blue circle glasses, mocasins, brown stringy belts, a tie dye shirt, and i don't know what kinda pants... look at costume websites to get ideas but find your own stuff to wear so it doesn't look to fake.

it depends what shelf it is on, then its up to whether the shop keeper serves you or not. Being straight I don't know how gay the mag is. Is it in the Maxim, Nuts envelope or is it more like Penthouse and Rustler? 
In Manchester there is a shop that sells guy mags and stuff, i don't know what the scene is like where you live but there may be a similar shop in your town

<question>



Why do half-caste (mixed race) people look like North Africans?



I have noticed that multiracial people tend to resemble the Arabs of North Africa, (Tunisians, Morroccans, Libyans, Algerians etc).



Why is this? Bearing in mind that from what I've read, the blacks of sub-saharan Africa didn't mix with them.



</question>



<additional details>



Do you people even read the question, and the details?



North Africans are Arabs. There has been very little mixing with black Africans, because there was a huge desert, which prevented Blacks from being there, until recently when cars and planes were introduced.



Beetroot, I have referenced sources, if you'd like them?

Oh, and some advice: don't say someone is wrong until you can prove it. Hope that helps.



Beetroot, once more you failed to prove anything, except that you're an ignorant fool unable to discuss things without resorting to petty insults.



Others, not one of you has really answered the question. You do not deserve your points.

because North Africans have mixed African and European ancestry. Don't believe all that you have read in books. Alot of mixing happened century's ago. The Egyptians were mixing thousands of years ago and in that time they was no such thing as a racial hierarchy, people in the Greek and Roman times didn't have the racial prejudices that we have torn the world apart with.

I think you are making the mistake of assuming "mixed race" refers only to a black/white mix. In actual fact it covers a much greater mixture of ethnicities and is not related to skin colour.

Since your relationship with him is over (even if you still love him), there's nothing you can do if he falls for someone else (even if it's your best friend).



And if she really is your best friend, then you should be happy for her.  I guess, this guy is cool because you still love him.  But you have to face the reality that it was not meant to be.  Because if it is, then why are you not together anymore?

You've set him free.  If he comes back to you one day, then maybe that's the right time for you guys to be together again.  But for now, it's him and your best friend.

Hurts, yeah, but you need to learn to accept it.

If she still experiances feelings for her ex then she must talk about it with him or she wont get anywhere in life.
If her best friend is doing this for his money the she needs to tell him that because even if there isn't a chance between her and him don't let him be heartbroken too.

Firstly, my advise it, "Get over it." He was your X remember? Meaning, that there is nothing more between both of u, although u still harvest the feeling for him. 2ndly, he has no more feelings for u. It takes 2 hands to clap. If there is no commitment from the other party, u can never make it.
This is indeed a blessing in disguise. If this had not taken place, u will never have thought that your bestfriend will backstab u. No point crying for the spilt milk. Whatever happened, definitely happened for a reason. Take this in your stride and things will be fine. Cheers!

Unfortunately as much as that sucks there's not much you can do about it. He's your ex bf so you can't expect much from him, he's not gonna care that she's your bff. On the other hand, if she was a true friend then she wouldn't do that to you. That's like an unwritten law, you never hook up with your friend's ex's, everybody knows that. So to hell with them! Find yourself someone better ;)

It is a personal necessity.

I think sometimes people become so focused on the idea of it's social unacceptability, or it's "abnormality" that they begin to become more private and self-concerned because society just doesn't seem to like, accept, or understand them just the way they are.

Also, mentally, I think if someone has been hiding that, as I said before, is socially unacceptable, and is very life changing because they have never expressed how they have been feeling for so long, when they let it out, it seems like it is what your life has to revolve around.

No I don't think it is destructive self indulgence, but I think to alot of people who don't understand the process or feelings of coming to terms with sexuality, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc, it can off as very selfish and destructive to relationships and people around them.

By people feeling that they HAVE to "come out" - they are just confirming that there is something about themselves that people have to know, that there is something so wildly different about them than the rest of the population that they need to proclaim it to everyone.



When someone is straight they do not ever feel the need to go around telling people about it. Why do gay people then feel they have to, or that it is expected to announce their feelings to the world? It is especially stupid when people "come out" and make a big announcement to the world, when they are not even in a relationship! I mean, why tell people who you are looking at? Straight people dont!



It's the kind of talk about needing to "come out" blah blah blah that convince 14 year olds who maybe are confused feel that they MUST tell all and sundry that they are gay, when who cares what anyone is or is going to be when that person is a child?! It's taking away the fact that straight feeling teens may not always be that way and also gay feeling teens may also change their minds... It's making people choose a ridiculous unnecesary label!



Nobody should ever need to come out, unless it's to someone they are about to embark in a sexual relationship with!

I'm pretty sure it is, not necessarily because they come out and say it, but I'm pretty sure if you said you were vegan and then put on a leather jacket, i'd be pretty confused.

The vegan groups and animal cruelty groups tend to go hand in hand.

Yes.
Being vegan you eat and wear NO animal products.
Some everyday animal products people don't usually think about that aren't vegan: honey, yeast (breads), Worcestershire sauce (anchovies in ingredients) and some sugars are processed with bone meal.

Do you sometimes worry that you may look better in pictures than in person?



Does anyone take a bunch of pictures and post the ones that look the best even if they don't really look like the real you? Does that bring up pressure when you're going to meet someone in person for the first time?

I believe I look better in my pictures and its a constant struggle to try and live up to how I look in them. The thing is, I'm not photogenic at all, the pictures of myself that I usually post on Myspace or something are the best ones of the bunch. If I were to post the other ones then I would definitely look better in person but I don't want to post pictures in which I feel like I look hideous on. But I would much rather prefer that people find me better looking in person than in pics. I know people always compare you to your pics when they finally see you in person.

i think everyone does that. take a bunch of pics and choose the best to put up on myspace. my problem is the opposite of yours, i'm not photogenic, and i look better in person. you shouldn't have to feel like you need to live up to your pictures, other peoples' expectations of what you look like. a lot of people look a little different from their pics. just do you, if they have a problem with it, they shouldn't look:)

and i noticed that this question is in the lesbian gay bisexual and transgendered section. that's funny.

Honey....a LOT of people do the SAME thing you do.



Everyone takes at least a few bad pictures.  You are being WAY too hard on yourself.

Cameras aren't completely accurate (actually far from it, unless it's a REALLY expensive camera).  They represent you in 2D.  What people see you as is 3D, with all of your beautiful features accentuated.  Because cameras don't normally reflect your true dimensions, many times pictures that you take will not look like who you really are and what everyone else sees in you.



As for the mirror, well that can be misleading as well.  Think, you see yourself EVERY DAY.  You're so used to yourself that even when you'll look absolutely gorgeous, you will find something bad to say about yourself.  Why?  Because you're not satisfied.  You have a preconceived notion in your mind that you don't look good, so you see what you expect to see.  However, that really isn't how others see you.



I can assure you that absolutely EVERYONE goes through this.  It's nothing to worry about, honey! =)



Honestly, I hate taking pictures unless they're with a really good camera (like a DSLR or something).  Truthfully, people VERY often compliment me on how wonderful I look, but when I take a picture with a crappy camera I just want to hide!  Haha



It's a phase.  It'll pass!  =)  You're not alone in this! &lt;3

A photo is two dimensional, you are not, I'm sure you look better in person. But, most importantly, if someone is interested in your photo enough to meet you then your personality should be what they judge you on. If they are only hung up on your looks then there isn't much there to build a friendship on.

Most people post their best ones on such websites.
But for me it's the opposite.

I look a lot better than I do at photos, this is why I don't take any pictures of myself.

I get all nervous in front of the camera and my lips start shaking...and the photo is the worst!
lol

So, I post pictures of me when I was 10 on such sites, because those are the cute and good looking ones.

The Democratic party has turned "political correctness" into its own form of censorship.  If you don't agree with the message they are currently espousing then you must be saying something wrong.

Personally I believe in freedom of speech and the right to have differences of opinions.  In fact I like nothing more than a good debate.  What I don't like and I think any rational person wouldn't either.  Is hard headed ignorance.  That is refusing point blank to see that you are in the wrong and need to reform the way you may view something.

To be more specific to your question.  I'm not quite sure what you mean by 'critical of homosexuality'  If you mean critical of someone who happens to be homosexual - then I would ask does your criticism have anything directly to do with their homosexuality?  If so that is where there may be a problem as homosexuality in itself isn't really that controversial it is about what 'floats your boat' not really contravening any laws of nature.  However some people do use homosexuality as a means of excusing bad behaviour eg promiscuity, extreme opinions or actions and so - that I don't agree with and I think would be a valid means of criticising on the grounds of being homsexuality.

My point is just criticising someone for being homosexual isn't really a valid or logical argument.  Criticising a person because of the way they choose to use their sexuality might be.  As to why people can appear overly sensitive.  it could be due to their own ignorance, lack of education, misunderstanding your motives or fear of actually being proved wrong!

Because society finds bigotry to be a major turnoff. People are accepting because they want to be accepted. Therefore, they surround themselves with accepting people. If you aren't an accepting person, then, kiss being accepted goodbye. This is why being a bigot is getting harder and harder.

I would try and bring up the subject, and then kinda work it in asking him if he'd ever thought about giving you head, or just be like "meh, prove it". You'll have to turn to your 1% gayness, and let it do the talking!

Many gay/bi guys want to do gay things with straight guys, due to them being the "forbidden fruit" as such. Do what comes naturally in the situation, but don't seem to pushy if he's not willing, don't want to risk you friendship.

Good luck, and have fun if it ends that way =]

He wouldn't have said that if he wasn't interested in you.

If you are comfortable with that, then go for it.

If you aren't comfortable, then don't.

Jerk each other for a couple of laughs? LOL well then. How old are you? If you are of legal age of consent, then go ahead and experiment. But if you are not, I would suggest that you go play some ball or something, get your mind off of it.

people don't seem to be concentrating enough on the fact you have a girlfriend. i'd try and sort out your sexual problems with your girlfriend before playing away from home. but if you must cheat then i'd say it sounds like he was hinting. offer him one first and he'd probably follow suit. if you're not brave enough to do that, bring it up as a joke and keep daring him and see how far he takes it. but i'd advise you to sort out whether you want your girlfriend or this guy cause i'm not sure you're 99% straight.

There was less crime, whatever statistics tell us.  We were a united nation and neighbours knew each other and helped each other.  There was no multi-culturalism, which I personally don't like.  Children were more polite and obedient and there was very little traffic on the roads.

Seeing as how the world gears everything towards the youth such as t.v,music, clothes, hair styles, and the like, do you blame him? The best of life is the past and the present is not the way things should be. Just because it's 2008 does not mean what was once right is now wrong and what was once wrong is now right. But look around you!!! People do what they want, what feels good. Having a good time seems to take top priority and as far as money, people worship it and no one thinks they have enough.

When I was young, we were told be in when the street lights come on.  We were brought up more strict.  We got a crack in the behind when we were bad, (mouthy, late, or not polite).  I didn't like it, but I grew up with more respect for my elders.  I remember a girl friend making fun of an older woman (we were about 12), she was hunched over.  I was hurt for this woman and I swore from that day on, I would never hurt an older person.  Many years passed I lost my job after 23 years, I was lost.  So I did volunteer work for a Senior home with my Collie, she looked like Lassie.  It was one of the most rewarding things I'd ever done.  Helping others and being kind is such a reward and helping thing for you and the person(s) you are assisting.  I all the bad good be reversed to good, what a wonderful world this would be.  Love, be kind, and you will be rewarded 10 fold.  I continue to help others when I can. Those days I miss, respect yourself too!  Hope this helped.

There was much less crime and people took responsibility for their actions. There was more morality and less looking for instant gratification. Hard work was rewarded by employers who provided secure jobs. There were less electronic gadgets and people werent being replaced by machines. There was less interaction between races but more respect for others overall. We taught our children values and discipline and to follow the golden rule.

Yes it does feel like the world has changed so much, the electronic age, the computer, and lo the TV, with the lens zooming in and out and giving us vertigo. there are occasions when I just want to see programs that do no have this speedy lens circling and zooming around. Of course you know that God created Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve !!!  That is different. Children were a blessing, and then they got a dog (or other pet to care for) now the Pets are first, and children are too expensive!!! Well............changes.......

Has your dad kept up with the world today or is there some time period in which he seems to prefer?  I read 20 years ago we were inundated each day with more information than most people living in the 17th century received during their lifetime.  Don't quote me on the century, but you get the idea.  What I see about today's world is the lack of any time to reflect.  There is no sense in learning about something in depth because it will all be different tomorrow, so why bother.  There is a shallowness in today's thinking which is deeply disturbing.  Everything is condensed to a sound bite (or is it byte?).  People are impatient, utterly rude and self centered today.  Diversity has brought unintended consequences.



My grandkids think I'm off because I like old things, keep my old clothes, stay in my old house.  It's sort of funny really, because I'm connected to the internet all the time.  My 7 year old granddaughter learned about landlines at my house and was absolutely in awe that you could talk to somebody from the kitchen and the bedroom at the same time.  She also accused me of being rude because I don't answer telephone calls during meals.  She has yet to learn telephone callers don't have eyes through the phone.

There comes a point where you sometimes want to say enough, I'd just like to sit in the same spot and rest here a while.  And that can be something our society should start doing.

I am in my fifties and the world today is indeed my world. I try not to whallow in the past to which alot of seniors seem to do. I try to keep up with current events and I try to move with the evolution of technology. If you are filled with the joy of life the world doesnt seem foreign. Your father sounds like he had a hard life a life where he was not encouraged to find his inner self but to be self sustaining and that is where he found himself. He needs a passion a hobby and then our world today will be his world and wont seem so alien to him.

Our world has improved. Child molestation is no long pushed under the rug neither is child beatings. People do not beat their wives and feel they have a right to do so. Equal opportunity for women and the injustice towards racism and intolerance is exposed. Children are living a healthier life due to vaccine and so all in all things have improved. Yes crime is on the rise but then again think of lynchings and murder and how many innocent black and other minorities were falsely accused. There is help for the alcoholics and recognition of it being a disease. Help for leukemia so children often recover. Cancers so many of them today are treatable. I will never look back in nostalgia, I look ahead in advancement thank you very much.

It's a sign of the changing times and some need more of a period of adjustment than others.  Just going to the grocery store is an adventure. We still have our old choices but now there is more exotic fruits and vegetables than I ever thought possible.  I have tried a few new ones but some of us are set in our ways. We all want the same things in life. A  safe home for our family and good accessible health care.

it's hard to see the bad side of what's happening now ,eg climate change ,due to our own greed and stupidity ,more crime ,more violence.(when was the last time u slept on the front lawn on a hot summers night?)
good changes ,health care, treatment of diseases ,space exploration ,easier life styles  ,education.

I'm pretty sure it would be Saudi Arabia. It's where the most fundamental muslims are. They have capital and corporal punishment for homosexuality and even promoting it is a crime punishable by imprisonment. Their media is heavily censored and there is basically no homosexuality represented in the media. Whatever LGBT community there is in Saudi Arabia is very underground and secretive.
Other countries, especially in the middle east and Africa still recognise homosexuality as a criminal offense and, in many places, mostly muslim dominated (i'm not stereotyping, i'm sorry, it's just a fact), homosexuality is referred to as sodomy and is punishable by death. I think Saudi Arabia is so bad because of how fundamentalist they are.

The only folk any good at taking the pis* out of the Scots are us Scots.  Those who take the pis* (and are not Scots) are just trying to cover up their jealously! Ha Ha!  We are good a laughing at ourselves!

So Suzie:  I got this new replacement credit card from Bof A yesterday, only the only company name on it was American Express.  I called the office and got a sweetie who explained it all to me but I told him I didn't want an AmEx card.  I asked what was my current BofA APR and he said 9.99, I said cancel the card.  Answer: why?  cause I got a much better card I've been using at 6.9. He says, Who was that?  I said, RBS.  He said who is RBS?
I said (with much flourish, like I owned the company), well, that's the Royal Bank of Scotland....do you think they will go broke?  He was dumfounded.

Don't let them bother you.Who are they anyway?Pelly-Wally bams of the highest degree with their tounge hinging oot thur erse.
They don't know that without the Scots the world would be so much different.Think of all the achievements.There are far too many to list and mention.
What I will say is there is a type of Scots-person who is a false Scot and thats yer pollytician doon there in London.Like that guy Gordon Broon.A shifty eyed article thats nay guid tay enyboady except his Maw.
In general most people love the Scots.They know we are a nation of kind hearted people and animal lovers.Well thats what I say to my Rangers supporting chinas.
Whatever you do treat their ignorance with patience and fortitude.They cannae help being educated by an inferior education system.Its noo their fault.They're mare tae be pitied then persecuted.Show them love and gie thum a wee cuddle every noo an again whilst ye pick thur poakit.

I don't think there is any mainstream place that you can do this but there are clubs that cater to the M/s lifestyle. You might want to look that up on the net and decide from there.



The only other thing would be to find a group online that is M/s and ask them.

I can answer this one for you.

There are BDSM themed cruises and vacations that you can take that encourage that type of behaviour, or possibly fetish themed Conventions, which are usually just a weekend thing.

Not knowing where you're located makes it a bit more difficult to find something local, but the link for Hedonism is below, it was the only one that immediately came to mind.  Also a link for the Rubber Ball, and a travel agency, but I'm not entirely familiar with them.  Good luck!

Find a masculine woman or effeminate man. I'm sure most people have some same sex fantasies, without being gay or bi. I don't think anyone is completely one or the other. Just find a person that you're comfortable with Maybe it doesn't matter what they are.

You may require a partner of both sexes. Being with 2 other bisexuals is a possible solution. Or, you might fall in love with a person of one sex as your significant other and have an open understanding that you (or maybe even both of you) will need to continue to experience sex with the opposite of your partner. After all, many bisexuals want committed relationships, but need both to be happy.

How to smile more?



Recently some one commented that I should smile more. I know I am a very introverted person and am usually serious. Its not that I don't find things funny, just that I don't find every thing funny. But any ways I was really bothered by the comment and it made me think maybe I should I do something to make me a better person? I think I am happy with my life but this comment is really bothering me. Help. Maybe I need to enjoy life more? Idk any more. :-(

Help Me Please? (UK)?



My four year old daughter just came home from her morning at school in tears, i asked her what was wrong and she looked up at me and asked "mama, why does Jamie keep telling me my mama and mommies are dykes and should burn in hell" How on earth should i deal with this? I've explained to them what different orientations their are and how some people are prejudice against it. It seems today is not my day. How can i cheer her up and also how can i approach Jamie's parents in a civil manner?

P.S Telling me i shouldn't have children and that i am certainly messing up their life by being gay is not helpful, its small minded, i can't make my children gay, just like straight people can't make their children straight. At the end of the day all i can teach my child is love is love no matter colour, creed or sex.

i will be going into see her teacher when i pick up the other two that attend this school, both me and my partners will be there for them, although i will be the only one going into the meeting. So in the mean time, i made her her favourite snack and let her play with her paint set in the dining room. Needless to say we will be having a family meeting tonight in regards to bullying and how its important to respect how other people choose to live their lives and their opinions.

I'm shocked another child of your daughters age would know such insulting language.  If that child learned it from their parents you're probably wasting your time approaching them.  If you feel your daughter is being bullied at school it's something you need to take up with her teacher.

Im gay, and my partner and I talk about adoption often....

If anybody said that to my child, I would be finding out who their parents were and having words. Go to the school, kick up an almighty fuss because this is NOT on.

The diplomatic approach came from others here, but I think we need to empower ourselves, just as Black people have so successfully done in order to gain respect, us Gay and Lesbian People need to start asserting ourselves.

He would not be saying this if had not been told, and you need to be make his parents aware that not only has it upset you, but you are not going to tolerate it in the slightest.



As for your daughter, she has probably realised she has two mums instead of a dad and a mum, hell most black people only have a mum, so its all swings and roundabouts anyway, just explain people love who they love, and she is entitled to love anybody as well.

Im sorry for this, I can imagine it would be horribly upsetting that this has happened and I only hope you find the solution you search.

I really admire you, i am thinking of becoming a parent myself but am a little afraid, but i have come to the realization that its their opinion but that doesnt make it correct.



your daughter will eventually realize that there is nothing wrong and that the only thing wrong is that the people saying mean hurtful things like that are wrong and she wont want to play with them anymore.

I would tell her she's a very clever little girl who realises she has two mothers and tell her that this boy isnt as clever/grown up as she is, he doesnt understand yet and to ignore the things he says.
Children are cruel,  it should be brought up in the school, there are childrens books out now where the parents are gay, for reasons like this, the school wouldnt tolorate racial bullying, so they shouldnt this.

I hope it all goes well x

Sounds like you are doing all you can do really. Possibly the school could deal with the parents of the other child or you approach them in the school grounds.

Also she's only little so if you distract her enough she'll move on from it and should forget.

Can I just say I was so shocked and angry when I read this, I can not believe people still impress on their children that sort of attitude!

Because shes 4 she probably wont understand, but find out who this Jamie is and have a word with this parents. No one should have that statement made about them, gay or not. Just try again to explain to your daughter that some mummies like other mummies and some mummies like other daddies. And just say to Jamies parents that your very offended by what he said and that they should punish him for it, or speak to a teacher

you have to reitterate that mommy and (your partner) love her as much as the next family do whether that me mommy and daddy.  4 years old is very young to try and instill views and i think your daughters class mate has obviously heard a conversation between her parents of a negative nature. Perhaps when you next take your child to school, try to confront the parents of the other child and explain your concerns that you have towrads their childs comments and how they are hurting and upsetting your daughter.  Children have a right to be children and shouldnt have to put up with this biggotted behaviour.  I hope it all goes well and let us know the outcome

i think your doing exactly the right thing by explaining what you have to her, you have no need to feel guilty or bad about this and make sure your daughter does not pick up on your feelings if you are down about it. Honey, we are never going to completely eradicate hatred and prejudice from this world, but if we all keep our heads up and show the bigots they no longer have an influence, we win

First of all let's not lose sight of the fact that we have an innocent and beautiful 4 year old child that is being hurt. With that said, get up off your backside, contact your child's school and establish an appointment. Also schedule one with "child protective services". Go to the meetings and present your case firmly showing you will not back down. Showing up in person let's them know you are very serious about your complaint and it sends this very psychological message.



Inform them there is no options, the harassment must stop immediately or legal action will be taken. You have an inborn instinct to protect your daughter and being a human you will also be setting an example to her that wrongs can be righted.



Tell your daughter also that the boy (offender) is wrong, and he nor his parents have the authority or right to determine who is or who is not going to hell. Tell her it is simply silly for them  to think otherwise.

Also, let her know there are people on earth who aren't very bright and she has simply met one of them. Teach her also not to hate, but to pitty and have compassion on such people because they will lead cold and miserable lives.

Now, get up, walk over to the phone and set this defense of your daughter in motion....



Hope this has helped...

I am sorry to hear of your daughters upset, children can say the harshest things, it is likely that Jamie is being influenced by what others around them are saying, i.e. their parents. I would not advice approaching their parents directly but instead opt for an approach were your daughters teachers and Jamie's parents are present. that way with a third person as an intermediary such as a teacher there is less likely to be abused hurled at one another and a constructive conversation can occur to help in your daughters best interests.

Sex with married neighbour, Part 2?



Hi guys, thx for the advice earlier but since i posted the question, things have progressed somewhat. My hot married neighbour had left the marital home and moved into a hotel room. Yesterday i collected some stuff from his house and took it to him. Anyway, against my better judgment, one thing led to another and we ended up in bed where he topped me. Afterwards as we were lying in bed he asked me whether he could crash on my sofa for a while until he finds a temporary place while he and his missus try to work things out but Im afraid I might be opening a whole can of worms. Help! The spirit is strong to resist but the flesh is weak!

What Should My "Occupation" Be?



Before the season, I made a bet w/ my friend Mindy (a Rays fan) that the Mariners would make the playoffs and the Rays wouldn't. It seemed safe, but I lost. Badly.



We both get really into Halloween, so the winner got to pick the loser's costume. Mindy is hot, so I thought I could pick out something skimpy for her--she turned the tables.

She said I have to dress as a girl for Halloween weekend--"shave my legs and everything" (whatever "everything" means?).



She said I have to post to an open forum, asking the online community what to wear. She picks the winner from the posts. Keep in mind I am 5'8"ish & 136lbs.

Do they believe that the Latin-American women are beautiful?



As the women who are Colombian, Venezuelans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans, Mexican, Peruvian, Argentine, Uruguayan, Chilean, Panamanian, Costa Rican, Guatemalan, do they believe that the Europeans are beautiful for you?

Thanks.

Or course.
Those are mixed races and are very pretty, especially for Dominicans, Europeans and Puerto Ricans.
But my vote is for Native Americans.
But not all Latins are pretty, I have seen some unattractive!

I always grew up wanting to speak spanish and be latin american.
I do not know where the idea came from so i must have felt they were beautiful women from a young age.
I'd still say generally they probably are, but i'm not going to apply that to every single one of them.

Also i've accepted who i am now, no self hate going on or whatever.(Just to add)

I think stereotypically south american women are known as 'sexy'
Personally i prefer the men :D

Relationship question.?



So, Im 14, and i know im kinda young to be asking these questions, but I really don't feel like going to my mom and asking her!

So, me and my boy friend have been dating for a week and two days now, and im quit confused on how he wants to take things.

Hes so confusing, I really have no clue what to do.

For example, I was talking to him the other day, and he was acting quit weird. So i was trying to get whatever was wrong with him out, so finley he said that our relationship was moving too fast, and i totally agree. We've been dating for a week now, and I love you has already been said. He said it even be-for we started dating, so i said it back, and truly i know im only 14 but iv never felt like this, he makes me feel amazing, like im the only person in the world he cares about, so i said it back.

So when i asked him how we where taking things to fast, he said it was about sex, and love.

We've talked about sex, we talk about every day.
Once again i know im too young to do these things.
And if i do have sex with him, i should wait, so it can really mean something.

So i agree about how we need to slow things down.

BUT, this is where im confused.
After saying that, when he had to go he said " I love you Amber. "
He just got done telling me, we should say this till we where farther in our relationship.

Then, that next day, he was saying he couldent wait till i was in his bed, and how he wanted to " bone " me.

And how this weekend, we where going to do things.

So then that where i come in, and freek out on him for sending me mixed emotions.



What should i do?
I really do have strong feelings for him, iv never felt like this about ANYONE!

I think i love him.
I think i want to have sex with him?

What should i do.
Should i keep things going slow, or should i jump to things?

take it slow, and make sure you both buy and have condoms.
If you are not mature enough to take care of this, you are not mature enough to move your relationship into sexual territory.

Your 14, young and have the capability of feeling love and lust. However, if you are not 100% sure you want to take it that far then don't.
I felt like that once, I was 16 and madly head over heals. And we did it but then I found out he was doing it with everyone including a 13 year old and my best friend.
Point is, make sure you Know! Some guys say anything to get into a girls pants so be sure he has the same feeling towards you, and that he's just not saying  things and playing games.

Baby, you are both soooo young. Sounds like he is trying to be responsible.  He knows you two are too young to have an intimate relationship.



TWO weeks..you don't even know if you really like each other yet.  If you are compatible.  Wait until you know each other a bit better.  Sex will just ruin  things if you have it too early.  Will mess with both of your heads and hearts.
.How could either of you love each other?  You don't even know each other yet. KEEP IT SLOW!!

Serious question about possible work mate, may be transvestite?



i recently did some work on my work mates computer and found transvestite porn, ok not too much of a drama perhaps he was curious, then to confirm my suspicion's, another work colleague looked on the history of his computer to find an array of trans-fetish web-sites and search for local gay bars. he's also told me and others about times he's gone out "fancy dress" as a woman /school girl, and convinced other guys to buy him drinks. now i have to go away with him for 6 months with work, hes a very brash and arrogant character. do you think i should confront him about it or let sleeping dogs lie.



</question>



<additional details>



just to clarify i am very secure with myself married, straight and very happy, the guy in question ridiculed me for having a bi- friend who ive known for years, and makes out he's homophobic. this is what i mean by brash and arrogant



second thing in order to remove the virus from his computer i had to go on to recently viewed, and my other mate was looking for a website he visited we, were far from snooping

i was fixing it for him as in favour! he asked me to!

advise him that some iffy web-sites tend to get attacked with e-virus that gets transferred to the viewers computers.



Tell him you had to clean up his archive, and appologize for deleting any passwords that he might have had, becuase you really had to dig into the system, viewing a lot of history to clean it out.

You want to confront him about matters of personal choice of how he spends his leisure time?  That's ridiculous.

You spend your leisure time how you like and he spends his leisure time how he likes.  From the sounds of it, there are no problems with his work life.  There is nothing you have any right confronting him about.

If you feel uncomfortable spending six months with him, ask your manager to reconsider the assignment.  If he feels that there are no changes to make and you still don't want to go away with him, ask for your P45 and look for another job.

You cannot make innocent other people (even if they are part of a minority group) a scapegoat for your own insecurity.  Once you are confident with yourself and accepting with yourself, you will not feel so jealous of people who are secure with themselves.

What he does in his private time is not your business and has no impact on you.  Looking at porn on his work PC however is not OK and you should do something about that - its irrelevant what kind of porn it is.  Going away with him for six months should not be a problem - you donothave to make him your friend.

My boyfriends parents..?



My boyfriend's parents are homophobic, or just think being gay is wrong and is a sin. His parents don't know that he is gay, or that we are dating. The other day they were talking about how most vegetarians are gay, and my boyfriend is a vegetarian. Do you think they are coming on to him? If they do figure out he is gay and he comes out he told me he would be kicked out of his house, he is only 17 and wants to wait till he's 18 to come out so he can get a house first. If his parents figure out before then, what should he do? What should I tell him to comfort him?



Whoever answers all three of my questions with the most detail will get the best answer.



</question>



<additional details>



I live in Ohio, and he lives in Maryland. My parents are also wanting to move to Arizona. I think that if he were kicked out he would lose his car and cell phone so there would be no way for him to get to Ohio unless he had his friend take him.

They 'might' be coming onto him. but without confirmation like you or him telling them, or them catching you, they probably won't throw him out.

If his parents kick him out before hand, If you can, invite him to stay round yours, or ask him if theres a more accepting relative he can live with.

To comfort him, tell him that his parents still love him, its all down to their religion, but overall they hate the sin and hate the sinner. they may be misguided, but they are trying to be good parents in their own eyes.

I think you should keep your head high. If his parents truly love him they wont kick him out.. It sems like what ya'll have is special and that is a great thing! If it does happen just be there to support him, and let him know things will be okay, and what you should do is just do what you can make sure he has a place to go and make sure he knows you care about him because times like these could cause problems just make sure you stay strong for him!!! I think things will be okay and keep me updated I am hopeing the best for you and your boyfriend.

Well, I have never really had this problem. I told my parents after I joined the military and was already living out of the house. But my boyfriend back home did have this issue with his mother. She hates the fact that he is gay, but she did not throw him out or anything. Because that is her son. She still gave him s**t for a while, like by taking his phone and his car, and all that jazz. Now do I think they are coming on to him. The answer is yes. The probably already know he is gay and are just waiting for him to tell them already. Thats how my older brothers were. My parents and everybody else had no clue but all my brothers knew i was gay. So I think that if they do find out for sure and they still get pissed. Perhaps you both can work on getting a place. Renting a little apartment or something that is affordable until you can both get on your feet. To comfort him all you must do is be there for him. That is what he needs. Tell him how much you care about him and how much you hate what is happening to him. That is what he is going to need. I hope this helps in some way shape or form. Take care!

No parents would like to have a gay child not because of anything else really but probably because as everyone seems to look at it, it looks like a very complicated life.  If he seems obvious on his actions on being gay they might have a hint that he is.  Even if they do find out, they would be hurt and that's for sure.  But hey listen, lets not just jump to conclusion right away that if his parents finds out, that they would kick him out. It might turns things around differently than he expects it would be.  They love him and lets not just measure their love for him.  As the saying goes, lets cross the bridge when we get there.  Don't think too much.

It's hard to tell from a one time comment, but I'm guessing they have their suspicions and are hinting at your bf.  Would being kicked out be so bad for him?  If his parents are really THAT intolerant to kick their own son out of their house because he is gay then maybe it's a place he shouldn't be. My guess is they already know. He should see if there are any relatives or friends of the family who would be willing to take him in. How about you? He should get a job to prepare and gain some independence.  His folks may even think better of him.  You should tell him you care for him so much, and will be there for him whatever happens.

Parents have a felling for what children are up to. It likely they sense something and are fishing.



Maybe he could ask them to demostrate where they get these sort of ideas from as none of the vegetarians he deals with are with another guy.  (call their bluff)



He cant control his parents.

There is no much you can do to comfort him if he is kicked out.



There is an organisation called PFlag. They support parents of gay children.  Support as in educate. 
There are also many gay support places around. 
He and you need to seek these out as you may soon need them.

Maybe have the local details on hand in case he can use them.



If you only need to wait until your two are 18 then I suggest do that.



Keep it in your pants and plan for the great escape.

No matter how bad it gets, fight on as the end reward is worth the effort.

I doubt that they are coming on to him. parents tend to be very blind when it comes to these things. they would have to go down the checklist of gay things: horribly skinny, has the accent, you know the stereotypes (not that i ever thought that being a vegetarian was ever one...) but that doesn't mean that they would realize it in the end.
What should he do? He should start talking to relatives that are okay with it. Or if he doesn't know if they are okay, he should ask questions like their opinion of gay marriage. Essentially set up a network of relatives and friends who accept him for him. Develop a backup plan to keep him off the streets. 
What can you tell him to comfort him? not much other than that you love him and will be there for him (that is if you are at the L word stage yet). Essentially you should hold him, make him feel safe in your arms (as lovey dovey as that sounds, it is a horrible comfort to know that the person holding you is protecting you).

there is a possiblitly they r coming on to him but if u guys r "manly men" then they might just think its a joking way of callin him gay.

if he get kicked out before he it 18 thats a shame. but anyway maybe he should look into moving in with a family member that he can be open with or maybe moving in with u? or another friends. in the mean time he should work on finding his own place so when he is 18 he can move out n feel comfortable in his own house.

to comfort him...just tell him all the options he has, if he is kicked out. help him find possible places he could live until he is 18. tell him u love him [ if u do] n that things get better b/c they always do.



best of luck to u n ur b/f!!!

First off I don't think they are coming on to him if they were they would kick him out right. They might be suspicous though so try not to be intimate or even too friendly anywhere around them until hes out of the house. If his parents figure it out before then they can't legally kick him out because he's not 18 but if he does he might want to get a job and start saving and if at all possible if he ahs any 18 yr old friends or any friends he can stay with for either money or help around the house he should do that. Comforting him in any situation is a must I would comfort him and let him know that no matter what he at least has you and things will work out in the end.

I'm not sure that individual members of the BNP hate you as a black individual.

They just don't think that you shoud be living in this country, and they would argue against the term 'black British'. The BNP believe it is impossible to be both. They would seek to remove you and your Mum from our land.

They would also discourage your Mum's boyfriend from having anything to do with your family - they disapprove of inter-racial relationships.



Ten years ago, BNP leader Nick Griffin said:

Without the White race nothing matters [other right-wing parties] believe that the answer to the race question is integration and a futile attempt to create "Black Britons", while we affirm that non-Whites have no place here at all and will not rest until every last one has left our land."



BNP supporters claim he has changed his mind. You have to decide if a man who makes such a public statement can ever be trusted.

8 years ago today I was just starting to get my life back together after going through one of the worst depressions of my life.  After bullying myself through the loss of my son by trying to work myself to death for a year, I basically spent the following 6 months having a long slow nervous breakdown - and the f*cked up part was that I STILL refused to acknowledge that I was having any sort of problem.  In addition, several of the people I worked with decided that I was "weak" and that they were going to mess with me (wrong!).



After not sleeping for AT ALL for 6 months, not eating, working 12-hour days, taking excessive abuse at work, and getting involved with the world's biggest @sshole, I finally realized that I had completely emptied myself out and had absolutely NOTHING left.  8 years ago today-ish, I found a new job (literally across the hall from my old job, but for $12K more per year), pimp-smacked the @sshole out of my life, and started going to therapy.



I ended up working for a group of people that I truly loved, and I also was able to laugh my @ss off when my old team lost their contract a few months later (because I am evil).  That one job transfer gave me the amazing opportunty to work where I am now (I can't even begin to explain).  The world's biggest @sshole is still among my general group of aquaintences and all of his ex's seek me out when plotting his demise (because DC is a small town and karma is a b*tch).



Finally, while you can never get over losing a child, you can grow past it and let yourself heal, and although it has taken me years to realize how much damage I was doing to myself by internalizing everything and trying to be "tough", I think I have finally gotten to a place where I can finally allow myself to breathe - whereas looking back 8 years ago I didn't realize that I wasn't breathing at all.

I will watch the debate until such time that I fall asleep. Mercifully, it may be early. You know, the pundits go on till midnight pouring over and parsing every word. Mrs. Palin is to be commended for her past accomplishments. So, too, is Sen. Biden.  Although the VP is not the head of state the office bears much responsibility.



Let me remind you of Whitman's opening lines of lament to Lincoln:



" O Captain my Captain! our fearful trip is done;
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won --"



Yes, I will watch the debate. I can only hope I can make the proper decision the 1st Tuesday after the 1st Monday in November, 2008.

How do you know if you are bisexual?



In highschool I found myself having a crush on one of the girls I played volleyball with.  At the time I was not comfortable with it and it freaked me out a little.  I felt like the only reason I had a crush on her was because she was an open bisexual and therefore I wanted her to like me.  I am the type of girl who can have a crush on almost anyone.  I want every guy to like me, and if they're into it, every girl too.



Now in college I find myself around this same girl again, and the feelings are returning.  I am more open to it now, five years later.  But I am starting to question my sexuality. Now I look at girls and find them attractive. None of my close friends, I could never see them that way, but like strangers??? Any ideas?
Am i attracted to this girl because I want her to like me? or
Am i bisexual? advice thanks.

Bisexuals are people who are attracted to both men and women. Bisexuals sometimes get a bad rap. There are many myths and misconceptions about bisexual women. This article will attempt to dispel some of the myths about bisexual women.



1. Myth: Bisexual Women are Really Straight
Fact: Bisexual women are attracted to both men and women. Some bisexual women are more attracted to women. Others are more attracted to men. Some are equally attracted to both men and women. Where ever they fall in the spectrum, a bisexual woman is someone who enjoys intimacy with both men and women.



2. Myth: Bisexual Women are Really Lesbians
Fact: Some women may come out as bisexual before they come out as lesbian because either they're not really sure what they are, or they may think bisexuality is more acceptable than being a lesbian. Bisexuality can be a pathway to coming out as lesbian, but it is not always the case. Conversely, some women may come out as lesbian, but then realize that bisexuality is a more authentic identity.



3. Bisexual Women are Sexually Confused
Fact: There is a belief in both the straight and lesbian community that bisexuals cannot make up their minds which sex they want to be with. Usually it is the straight and gay people who are confused. The bisexuals know who they like: both men and women!



4. Bisexual Women are Promiscuous
Fact: Because bisexual women are attracted to both sexes, some people assume that they are more sexually promiscuous than other people. The truth is, bisexual women are as diverse as the rest of the population. Some may be having all kinds of sexual experiences, others may not have had any sexual relationships at all.



5. Bisexuals will Never Settle with one Person
Fact: Along with other myths about bisexuals is they myth that they will never settle with one sex because they will always be thinking about the other sex. The truth is bisexuals have as much ability to be monogamous as anyone.

College is a great time to question your sexuality and explore...



I am more worried about your admitted need to have everyone like you, it's not a productive emotional base, I suggest you visit your colleges on campus counseling service to help you find the reasons behind wanting everyone to like you and at the same time you can talk and explore your sexual preferences...

One way to help, does the thought of a girls down stairs, Breast, Legs, Smile, Eyes, Lips, Butt, Voice turn you on? (Sexualy?)



Odds are if that is the case then you are,



If when you think about phisical intercourse you get kinda grossed out, or turned off, then odds are you are just trying to get atteion off of her



Let me know I can try to help more if I know exactly the case



Good luck,
Hope I helped!!! ::))

I live in the middle of nowhere in Ohio...no southern hospitality here lol!  Being gay in any area is difficult, but out where everyone knows your name (not as friendly as Cheers either), it is extremely hard.  I didn't come out til I was 24...I'm 25 now!



Don't let where you live keep you from loving yourself for who you are and being who you are...it's important to your sanity hun!  Good luck out there in BFE

know who you really are..



no straight person nor gay person can tell who you really are, and there area alot of young people being led to believe that they should act like what is stereotyped as gay, bi etc. and no being gay is not your identity, it is but a part of our sexuality, sexuality which is just a small part of who we are as human beings.. Our personality is who we wish to be, no society can tell us how we must act.

Its nothing new really. Each government since the beginning of time has mostly cared about their own agenda. I believe if the founding fathers had been alive to see how things have turned out they would be so disgusted.



The tracking of citizens, privacy invasions, lots of red tape, loss of freedom, its all contributed to this mess. There's this old quote that says that all great empires destroy themselves from within first. What we're seeing now is the decline of the American Empire.



So what you need to do is always, no matter where you live in the world, always protect yourself, don't count on your government to do it for you.



EDIT: btw I don't think Capitalism is exactly evil, its better than living in a socialist country. We need to have Capitalism because that's what freedom means, the freedom to do things even in business but we need more checks and balances so we can avoid things in the future like Enron.

What is really going on, Grandma, is that the much vaunted capitalist system, which requires ever more growth is reaching its peak, and the signs of collapse are beginning to show more prominently.
What will happen, what will be done to repair it, or better still replace it, I don't know. We are living in "interesting times", and just have to watch the younger generation handle what their forefathers have let them into. We oldies can only advise, but our kids must bight the bullet and do the hard yards.

GO DO IT. Don't live with regret. Be smart about it tho. There are plenty of places to ride and camp that will still give you some contact with humanity.



Buy a satellite phone so you can contact others no matter where you are and also let someone know when you hope to arrive at your new destination so if you don't turn up they can turn out a search party.



Consider joining a bike club that does organised runs with a group, that way there is safety in numbers.



Finally, listen to your body. If the aches and pains are not normal, saddle up and head for civilization and a hospital.



You can still have your dream if your smart and do it wisely.

I applaud your sense of adventure. Take care of your health needs, then set out on your adventure. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, so don't let your age become an  obstacle in your mind. Age is just a number. You're still young in my eyes (I'll be 62 y/o on October 13th) so go for it. Just be sure to stay in touch with family/friends along the way & let them know your itinerary along the way also. I wish you all the best as you set out on your new adventure. Some your age or older, only wish they could do what you  are about to set out & do. Be safe & have fun!

It's not the fact that you are 62, it is you. What is home like. I'm guessing it is pretty gross if you are so keen to get out of it. But a bicycle is not the way to go. Long trips, long roads, you are a sitting duck to get struck and killed. That's not the answer you need. Camping out by yourself can get very lonely, too. Catch a bus and go fishing for a week-end or even a couple of days mid-week. The romantic notion of camping out is all well and good, but carting all your necessary gear on a bicycle means loading up too much. Your motor will soon wear out under the weight. If your health is not up to it, nor are you.



Boredom is your only problem, I would think. Obviously you have a computer, get to a library two or three times a week to get some instruction. I should do that myself because I know bugger all about how to effectively operate my own.



And what's wrong with building up a sex life at 62? E.d.? Use Viagra.
Magic stuff. You really should think of yourself as a horny old devil. I'm 68 and I still do. It's great. Can you have a dog? Now that's a mate you would relish to have. but make sure you allow him in the house. Of course he is going to widdle inside, but they soon learn. you will need to have a doggie door added to your back door to allow him out in the middle of the night, when he wants to go out. And in while you might be absent for some hours. A small dog with short hair is ideal.
Low maintenance. they give one a source of getting above oneself.
Call him after my name.

Homosexuals and Swingers, Do you think that if todays benefits were more easible to obtain would you still ...?



Would you still fight for the right of marriage if the insurance for health, the life insurance policies, and the next of kin polices was opened to the point that anyone could be put on the policies regardless of what kin you are to them.



I've heard that this is the main reason Gays want rights, so instead of fighting for marriage, why not fight to uplift the restraints put on these so called policies of rules and regulations and have them amended?



Or are you just one of those die-hards who are only fighting for the hell of it?

I don't have a problem with gays being in a relationship or even having some kind of civil union ceremony. I personally think marriage should be between one man and one woman. Period. As for life insurance policies, that is fine. For health insurance, that should be up to the individual companies.

Thank you for your opinion, I too believe marriage should be between a man and a woman.  I also believe that the benefits should be open to what ever the individual wants and request regardless of kinship.

I notice that you don't actually think we could possibly want to marry for love, and out of love want the benefits any straight people have to protect their families.  The right to marry the person you love is a basic human right.  Maybe the only reason we gays put it in terms of benefits is it's the only thing some people understand.  Because in some minds two people of the same sex couldn't possibly love each other- it's unnatural

So I'm straight (but open minded)
And I completely understand wanting to fight for marriage.  How would you feel if you and YOUR partner weren't allowed to get married, you were just insurance sharers?  Marriage is a concept created by society that symbolizes self sacrifice for the sake of the other, of the couple.  Marriage is beautiful, selfless, based on pure love (idealistically).  Sure, you get the practical benefits of shared insurance.  But I seriously doubt that you'd feel satisfied being nothing more than an insurance sharer with the person you love, and sleep with, and raise a family with.  Plus, disallowing gay marriage SHOULD be illegal.  Private weddings, like ones led by certain religious groups or whatnot, should have the right to deny certain people marriage.  But ANYONE should be allowed to marry publicly who is of age and not related (for safety reasons), because the Constitution does not say marriage is for men with women, RELIGION does.  So why does the government have this authority? It's mixing religion with politics.

As someone who is not a gay or a swinger, I don't think the government should decide who can and can't get married.  If fools wish to ruin their lives with marriage, go to where ever people get married, ruin your lives in peace and don't let anyone tell you you can't do something.  Good luck.  Sorry for butting in.

I don't know how swingers got grouped in there since that's a completely different type of thing, and I'm not even gay, but that last statement bothered me.  I would like all the legal benefits of course, but I would also like to have my commitment recognized just like any other couple.



I remember reading a story about a Rear Admiral who was killed during 9-11.  Her partner of THIRTY YEARS got nothing!



I was so appalled that this woman had devoted her life as well to her country and got nothing return, along with her deep loss.  For her partner to have made it to that level means that someone, somewhere was supporting and encouraging her, taking care of the homefront so she could spend time on her career.  Because I know how difficult it is for a woman to make that rank.

Dear Brett A,



I happen to think it is a very sexy thing to see a guy who is very manly wearing a thong, and I would really be turned on by that same man.  It would also depend on the type of thong, I am a person who likes to see the men in very silky type of thongs and feel his, well you get the picture.



I do not think I would like to see it above his pants though because I think thee is too much underwear being shown now and I am no prude, but at least leave something for us to guess at not expose it all for the world to see.  and besides some of these low riding pants need to be taught personal hygiene when it comes to underwear and all.



Well enough on that, so good luck and do not worry what others have said I think they are great on a sexy man.

you are 14 years old. I know because you write like one. You have soaked up so much rubbish, my dear, that you must throw it away.



It is quite okay for you to like girls. It's great that you get along well with the boys. You have feelings that you should be treasuring and you will. Time makes a big difference. Nobody expects a fourteen years old to flirt. Don't do it. Just be aware as you already are, you are only making yourself look silly. So, you just do not do it any more.



But you have lessons to take up your time and attention. Make your schoolwork your new and fascinating hobby. It is easier to aim for high grades than just to scrape through. Get grades that will make you proud of yourself. You are worth it. I have full confidence in you to do it.



Go for it, girl.

Marrying my American boyfriend PLEASE HELP!?



Hey



I am travelling to the US in a week, I have booked a return flight and will be staying in my finances house. We want to get married in the US and then return to England and live there.  I am not planing on leaving until we are married and plus my boyfriend wont let me lol.



We do not want to be separated at any cost and I am not leaving without him.  Please help us.  Can I apply for a Visa whilst in America and how do we get married, there must be a way we can do this?



What is the best thing for us to do, I am praying there is a way that we can stay together legally and not have to separate.  If I have to stay in the US illegally then I will, I am not leaving him and he is not leaving me.  Sorry I am desperate for a solution, please can you help?



Thank you!

Touching base with calley lookers and concerned citizens?



look all im asking is for the cops to take a look at these gloves i found out in the woods of ocala next to where i said i seen casey anthony's car on the 25th of june.right now i am putting myself in jeopardy just disclosing this Information.if she had assistance with this murder hide the body thing they are not in jail.so if i end up dead on account of this you will know what happened to me.i know this is really not a good place to ask for assistance in this but the cops are not listening to me .they figure they can handle it on there own i Guess.but this answers really does have a lot of good people on it i know.i read through from time to time.some of you are bored and make funnies out of it but the masses are just trying to help.this is what im trying to do too.do you think i like seeing my tax dollars go up in smoke on a tecnocality such as looking at a book and judging it by its cover.for christ sakes people please call the cops and ask them why they are not looking at this ocala angle harder.

I really don't have much time to check out other communities but it looks like you've received some great ideas.  If those sites aren't what your looking for "google" for senior Q and A's or forums.  You will probably have to wade through a bunch of nonsense but you can always refine your search.
BTW Shortstuff......You rock!  That rude answer was totally uncalled for.  There is no place in this community for smartasses like that.

My dentist has been very good, so far.  Thank goodness I am not a tax inspector.  I've often wondered if dentists have a little sadist in them.  Do you think?  (Now all of the dentists out there will tell me about painless procedures and how crazy I am.  Heee heee heee)  I'm one of those fraidy-cats who almost cries when she gets her teeth cleaned.  My one tooth extraction was 40 years ago and it was a true nightmare.

Pretty much what White Trash (above me) said. It's sad, but it's the truth. Politicians will say almost anything to secure the votes - short of selling their soul. Then again, they'd probably do that too if that's what it took to get into office.

How freely do you give out your phone number?



I've noticed something about myself. I've become increasingly guarded - not only with dating but with friends in general. I've noticed that people seem to be pretty free with handing out their phone numbers to people they meet; like networking. I have a problem with this because, to be honest, I'm easily annoyed with most people and don't want to form friendships or anything. Just keep it civil. I'm a hard person to get to know & I'm not as carefree as I used to be. I've lost "good friends" & I feel like they weren't there for me anyway. Think LC on the Hills if you watch the show. Don't mean to be trite.



Anyway, am I becoming antisocial? Or is this normal?

personally i try to keep my personal things in private,but sometimes i can give out my number if i know that me and the other person have something in common.
and i dont mean like dating purpose,but as a friendly manner.but usually its just email addys we exchange usually,as ive noticed that most of net-friends arent so longlasting.
sometimes i call my friend in the philippines,in japan,usa and sometimes they call me.jsut to say a quick hi and to know the other is ok and to hear a friendly voice now and then.
and its a hard way to huid up a friendship that is worth give out the phone number too,so i think most appreciate if someone is shring  their number.atleast i appreciate :P
and yes,its normal to be anticosocial ;)
no,thats not the question,its all about attitude and yes,most of all its all up to yourself id you want to share your number.

People can easily become telephone pests. The only way to get rid of them if they do is just to say so.



No, you are not being antisocial. the giving out of your number is a direct invitation for them to dial it. When you know you would like somebody to call you, then is the time to give it out.

It okay to have your guard up. But you can't totally clam up and not have a life.
As for the phone number deal, I don't give it out that much, I don't want some people I don't know calling me all the time.

There are people that like everyone to know their phone number... Not me. Sometimes I give it to new people, but only if there is a good reason. I don't like spending all day on the phone or having to change my number, if I start getting too many unwanted calls.

i can see the car as a coincedent if it was not for the fact that it was on the 25th of june and finding gloves in the woods not twenty feet from the sight out in the middle of nowhere



and im looking around this town at the cars and a bra is not that common on any car



the gloves are what cinched it up for me if they would just take the little bit of time it would be to check out my story put a cadaver dog on these gloves or check them for finger prints how long does that take when you already have a matching pair

I think I'm homophobic?



I'm so homophobic that asking this question in this section makes me feel uncomfortable, I confess this because I know its wrong. I know some gay people, and I don't mind them I treat them with the utmost respect. Is this a big issue, don't tell me to see a therapist. Because I'm not a nut case, but the reality of it is, that I have nothing but love for gay women, I would even take part in........ But with gay men its like I become some prejudices A hole. What are your thoughts?, is this normal way for someone to behave?

Homophobia is an irrational negative reaction to Gays and Lesbians. This is similar to a racist being negatively effected by Blacks or a misogynist being hateful towards women. While I believe most people have these negative feelings towards whole groups of humans they are completely ignorant of... the obvious problem is when these negative feelings grow into outward and violent action.



A little knowledge about those whom you have negative feelings towards, but are ignorant of, would do wonders.  What is it about gay men which makes you so uncomfortable? And does it effect you directly and personally somehow?



Good luck in your journey...

But i never get prejudice or act like a Ahole, i actually get scared or nervous around them like a phobia, and i want to get away really fast, its really weird. Personally i do NOT think its normal, you just need to open up more, and recognize that they are normal people and they just dont want to have girlfriends or wives, simple as that.

Well first the concept of "lesbians are ok and I would join in" ... well, no you wouldn't, because they're lesbians.  They don't like men.  That means they don't want to be with you.



It sounds like it all comes from insecurity about yourself.  You fear gay men, because you fear that a gay man might like you.  That's the trappings of the male ego wiggling and screaming.  Just because someone likes men, doesn't mean they like ALL men.  They, just like heterosexual women - and most people on the planet - have a thing called "standards".



Just as all women will not immediately pounce your d!ck as being god's gift to womankind, neither will a gay man do the same, thinking you are Adonis sent to earth for him to pleasure.  It just doesn't work that way.



What you need to do is see your fragile male ego for what it is, and accept people as being human freaking beings, rather than defining them by their sexuality.  That's your first step.  Come back later for step 2.

I think you feel how some homophobic guys feel.  Like a gay guy might have a crush on you or might approach you sexual, but babe, they are just as normal as you are.  So it wouldn't hurt to hold a conversation with one if they wanted to without thinking that they will come on to you.

You seem rational, and I imagine you could overcome this "phobia".  You don't need to be gay, experiment in gay sex, or anything else to get over your homophobia;  you don't need to agree with everything, or for that fact anything in gay culture, that doesn't make you a homophobe.  Look up what a phobia is.  It is a fear, and when you understand  that you have a fear of, you can overcome it.  If you "hate" the gay community, as a whole but not your friends, a logical person when understand his problem should be able to use his intelligence to overcome that.  Has someone done something personal to you?  If so, direct your fear or hate towards him!  It's easier to overcome a problem with an individual than a whole group.



And finally, perhaps learn to just not verbalize this hate or fear.  If you keep it to yourself, and each time the hate pops up, analyze why you have felt that way.  If you have no reason to hate, you will probably begin to get over it.



Thanks for the interesting question, and thanks for being concerned.

Tell your friend to try American Singles.com for her first online experience. There are many male players out there to stay away from because they love to play games. On A.S. members can submit a photo & write a little about themselves. There are also basic questions to answer so members can read the info & see if it's someone they'd like to Instant Message via the website. It's a great way to weed out the bad apples & then see if they're interested in anyone special. If your friend joins such a website such as A.S., eHarmony, etc. tell her to be very cautious as to what she tells men about herself, family, address, financial situation, etc. Tell her it's best to get to know someone via IM's, e-mails, or phone calls before meeting. The woman always needs to meet the man on her own turf, meaning in her city, not his, & not half way. They should meet in a public place & she should never take him to her home until they have dated for quite some time. A woman has to use caution & use common sense. She also needs to tell someone (friend/family) who she is meeting & where. She leaves the restaurant  in her car & goes home, & he does the same thing. The woman must make sure he doesn't follow her home.  Again, use common sense. One can never be too cautious. People will knock these websites, especially when they have never tryed them. My ex met his current wife on A.S., as well as my brother & his new wife, & a few other of my friends. Some work out & some don't.

It's a convenient way to get to know people,especially for people who for some reason have difficulty meeting the opposite sex.They may have lost touch with their old friends and don't like going out alone; Location,Children,Illness etc.
I would think reputable dating sites try and screen prospective clients to try and minimise and risk.



There will be conmen/women out for what they can get,money,sex,but that is the same with any meeting.
Used with common sense I think the advantages of a reputable site outweigh the disadvantages.

I did the shoe check on my BF... What did THIS mean?



Is he bi? Gay? Or straight? I told him there was something on his shoe. At first, he looked down in front of him and looked at his left shoe, nothing there... Then he looked back (sorta over his right shoulder) at his right shoe. Is he bi, gay or straight? Should I worry? I'm a female! He loves sex with me (or acts like he does) and wants it a lot.

I've heard of the hand check (where you tell them if their hands bigger than their face they're gay and if they put their hand to their face it means they're gay because they should know not have to check).



But I never heard of this one. This is just bizarre. Maybe you're gay. Quick! Check if your hand is bigger than your face!

For anyone who doesnt know what the shoe check is its where you tell them theres something on the bottom of their shoe, if the pop their leg up behind them and look over their shoulder theyre apparently gay, if they lift it up in front of them and look, theyre straight, happened to me and im bi (or bi-curious, im confused with myself lol!)but I came out as straight, sorry but this just doesnt work..
You cant just tell from their body language through them checking the soles of their shoes.. =D

America is a migrant country , it was established by migrants for migrants.



the only problem that is has with this is that it is not multicultural and therefore allows ghetto's of concentrated ethic minorities to build up in the cities rather than assimilate them as equals.



The only native Americans are the original tribes that inhabited the country before white man.



Everyone else is an immigrant or descended from immigrants.



On the base of the statue of Liberty in New York is a plaque that reads; ( Given to the US by France no less)



"Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,



With conquering limbs astride from land to land;



Here at our sea-washed, sunset hates shall stand



A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame



Is the imprisoned lighting, and her name



Mother of Exiles. From her beacon hand



Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command



The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.



"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she



With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,



Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,



The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,



Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,



I lift my lamp beside the golden door



...............That is why immigrants come to the US.

America's economy runs the world's economy. This country is strong enough as far as money is concern. Most of the people believes in justice and not in corruption, which is also a strong factor in America in compare to most of the countries. I think this are the enough reasons to attract lots of migrant in America.



The another reason is freedom. freedom of everything as long as you are not hurting others either emotionally or physically.

As a young man I'm seriously trying to understand why I desire men so much.?



Of course I'm gay, but I wanted to delve more into this subject.  I recently was surfing online and happened to notice an innocent advertisement.  It was a young man on a laptop laying face down on the couch with his shoes and socks off and was the main picture of some product or something, and something inside of me just became aroused just by his image...why is that, especially when there was no sexual innuendos there?  The picture was purely innocent.  What is it about the mans body that I find so attractive...i mean it's like why can't i have that same feeling when i look at a female...it just doesn't make any sense...i look at men in exactly the same way a straight man looks at a women...it's like we're exactly the same yet the object of my desire is what makes me different.  I'm not really interested in "who" the man is within...i'm just interested in his body...but why? There's something in me, that somehow desires to involve myself into something that promises fulfillment through sex when i know for a fact that that other man doesn't have and couldn't possibly have what i want...do you guys ever feel this way and then question your motives...sorry for the long detail i've just been up all night thinkin about a ton of stuff.

It's beacuse you're a guy. If you were straight you'd have the same urges if it were a picture of girl doing something totally innocent. That's why girls get annoyed with guys so much. They're too easily aroused. We're visual and it doesn't take much to turn us on.

Sexual innuendos are everywhere. You can recognise them, obviously.
you recognise that there is a thrill of sexual satisfaction in it. You are right. It doesn't matter that the other party is not involved or even interested, your mind is what leads you to desire.



I congratulate you for considering this area of ourselves. Many would panic. But do not overly concern yourself. Talk about it on this site if not with somebody else. human sexuality is the most amazingly wonderful sensations I think that you or I could ever experience. Treasure your sexuality. It is more precious than you could possibly imagine yet. I guess you are only 17 or 18, age is not a barrier to sensation, but lack of experience makes you cautious. That is normal.
Maintain that caution however. It is difficult to adjust but no more difficult than if you were dating girls. Experience is the great educator and your experiences will happen. Just let them.

Unlikely but you could be onto something there. I think you will find it difficult to prove such a thing because he does not even have sex with a woman yet is the father of Jesus.

If there is only one god, he cant be gay because there are no other males (or females) for him to be attracted to.



If there are lots of gods, they're probably as varied as us mortals.

Perhaps it would make you feel better to know the Biblical origins of the word:



Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary
Elder



a name frequently used in the Old Testament as denoting a person clothed with authority, and entitled to respect and reverence (Gen. 50:7). It also denoted a political office (Num. 22:7). The "elders of Israel" held a rank among the people indicative of authority.
--------------------------------------...



Of course, as time has gone on, the word elderly has come to mean old, and many have stopped treating their elderly as people of authority entitled to respect.

Elderly means old and the alternative to that is dying young.



Many do die young. You can't do a thing about getting older.
You can be miserable thinking negative thoughts.



Why not focus on your many blessings & enjoy



each day doing what is good.



Today could be your last or you could decide to enjoy &
embrace each age you are. It's only a number.



You are only as old or young as you think.



Choose to smile a lot, its contagious.

Yes, the government has no business denying equal rights to any person on the basis of his or her sexual orientation. That includes equal marriage rights.



In a civilized society, church and state are separate, so if a particular church chooses not to solemnize marriage between same-sex couples, the government should not force it to do so. By the same token, if a church wishes to solemnize same-sex marriages, the government should not prevent it from doing so.



In this way, the government can remain neutral.

That is something that applies in ALL sexualities.



I am hetro but am also repelled by "some" women, but mainly their personality HOWEVER if you are referring to the attraction side then that also applies to all sexualities.



Hetros can find certain people very unattractive of the opposite sex in the same way as someone that is gay does.



It is all a matter of preference, regardless of the sexuality :0)

Of course. Everyone has their preferences, their "type", their turn-ons and turn-offs, and of course emotionally, personality wise, people are different.



Straight, gay, or otherwise these choices will be made about who you want to be in a relationship with. Straight people aren't all attracted to every member of the opposite sex in order to be straight, and you don't have to be attracted to every woman in order to be lesbian?

I gather you are new to this? If you are attracted to the same gender in a sexual way and you identify as a woman, then you may be lesbian or bi-sexual, regardless of whether you don't get attracted to every girl that moves. However, if you are just a pervert asking a stupid question, you need to realise thet this is a serious subject and lesbians who are identifying genuinely suffer and sometimes get confused, which can have devastating consequences, so if you are not serious, you need to know this is not funny. Life has a way of sorting things out, if you are genuine you will get there, try not to worry, it will be ok, if you are not genuine, life will deal you with the consequences you deserve.

You look like the japanese rock/pop type male.. sadly Australian/American society doesnt really like change and everyone wants everyone to look stereotypical.. you look very delicate..truthfully who cares what anyone else thinks? Flaunt your image loud and proud, you have a very individual look, just be true to yourself, if you like the way you look.. dont change it, if someone calls you gay, dont ignore them like you cant hear it..thats just immature..they'll start calling you deaf..take all the abuse head on..but come up with your own remarks to add to fight back with..if its someone you think you could argue with..with out hurting yourself socially, make them see that you cant be walked over.. put them in their place tell them theyre hair looks like pubic hair or their face looks like a vagina..



but if its a girl just tell them they look like a lesbian (no offence to the LGBT section theres nothing wrong with looking like a lesbian, but todays society, straight girls dont wanna hear that I should know, when some one has a go at me by saying that im gay I use their homophobic dendencies against them and call them what they dont want to hear =D)

I don't need to look at your photo to know that whether you are gay or not is on the inside of you, not the outside. Everyone thinks I look straight because I am femme, used to be married and I have kids. However, I can assure you that I am exclusively attracted to other women, to my thinking that is what makes me gay.

I don't think you look gay. A lot of gay men end up looking buff and hypermasculine. This is because gay men are attracted to masculine features--if they were attracted to feminine features, they'd be straight.



So, no, you don't look gay to me.



You do look androgynous, which is also very cool. From an aesthetic point of view, your features are classically beautiful. You could be a model. If people at your school are making fun of you, it's because they are jealous and they fear that they're not as goodlooking as you are. There are probably a lot of girls who have a crush on you!



But you also look too young to be worrying about what a bunch of online creeps like us think of you. Please be very careful and don't reveal any personal information online.



My advice is this: You may be straight, bi or gay. You may even be trans. It doesn't have anything to do with the way other people say you look. Kids in school call each other "gay" for all kinds of reasons; mainly because everybody is totally, terribly insecure.



So ignore what people say. Tell them what you think of them, if you feel like it. They'll worry about it just as much as you did. And remember there are plenty of boys and girls in your school who will want to hang out with you, so don't worry about some jerk who you think is more "popular." Most likely, that person is the MOST insecure of all.



You have the right to determine who you are for yourself, and in your own time. There's no hurry, but once you've figured it out, don't let anybody bring you down--you have as much right to exist as anybody else.

What a memorable day for you! I wish I was in your shoes & could  meet  & maybe shake the hand of John McCain. I think it'd be nice if you were to dress in causal attire but no jeans. Wear a semi dressy shirt & some dress slacks/pants. Don't pay any attention to people like Jack X. Just consider the source. He probably isn't even a registered voter, & signs his name with an "X."

Eh, nowhere in the world is TOTALLY accepting of homosexuals.
I have a friend, who is Indian. She told me about how people frown upon homosexuality. It's pretty strict in some places. Russia is pretty, bad, apparently.



The first piece of advice I would like to submit is that no matter who you are, you should not be pushed into your shell because of what peoiple think of you. I know this is really hard.



Australia is slowly getting better with homosexuals, and they are slowly learning that you can't change a persons orientation, and a persons' orientation can't change them.



England is more than likely like Australia. I think they will be accepting.



As for night clubs, I'm pretty sure they do have them. Good luck on your search for "the one."



You will be entitled to as much respect as a straight person has. Good luck. ^.^

I can feel just a glimpse of your situation in my shoes...believe me, I have a few indians friend told me sometimes they are overwhelmed by their rigid culture, They have to marry with their own people, they can't be gay...and if you are a rebel and trouble-maker..only your parents can punish you, but your family and community will talk sh*t about you..is that true?

nobody turns gay. if it was a choice then no-one would choose it. It is a hard life being gay and unaccepted in society...



sorry but people are born gay, they may not realise it until puberty when the hormones brings it out.



EDIT: danner who is the 8th answerer i think. If you think we have parts that fit for a reason then... lol?? a penis does fit into an anus and it is safe if you do it properly, you can easily avoid damage. (Same as the vagina, can be damaged easily in sex).



Also why would the male "G spot" be located in the anus if it were never meant to be used for sex. Are we meant to have a pleasurable 'exit'?



The anus can be used in hetero or homo-sexual sex; and is used for the purpose of pleasure. The same way that vaginal sex is used for pleasure (far more than pro-creation). So where is the difference...



Todd: The anus is the most sensitive part of the male body (yes more sensitive than a penis). This is why you will find that the majority of gay people will prefer to 'bottom' in gay sex, and also the reason you will find many straight people using anal stimulation for pleasure.



Look in this link to see how gay people get pleasure from their anus. Don't worry it isn't graphical... it is just an article.

If you want an educated answer about men being gay,



"
As males have a Y chromosome and females do not, a mother’s body may be more likely to recognise a male foetus than a female one as foreign and generate a strong immune response.



Other research has shown that this response can strengthen with each subsequent male pregnancy. This may affect the way that the brain develops sexually.



“If this immune theory were correct, then the link between the mother’s immune reaction and the child’s future sexual orientation would probably be some effect of maternal anti-male antibodies on the sexual differentiation of the brain,” -Dr Bogaert

I turned gay because I discovered that I liked sex with men.  Simple as that.



My own thoughts are that some people are born gay, some people are made gay by their surroundings, and some people choose to be gay.  I think we're all missing a trick by looking for a common cause.  I believe there are several causes.



There are people who believe that they have no choice to be gay, and I think that's very likely.  But they do have a choice to engage in sex acts.  Whilst being a homosexual maybe beyond our control, getting jiggy is.



Anal sex is pleasureable because of the prostate gland, which is stimulated through pentration.

One, I don't know how it is for guys, but for girls: We grow into it. We don't come out of the womb all decked out in rainbows, and I assume most gay guys don't either.
As a child, you are who you are. With no regards to sexual orientation whatsoever.
As soon as you hit puberty though, that's when you realize what kind of things you like.
It's the same for all humans. I don't see why people don't understand that.
And also, a guys prostate can be stimulated from anal sex. It's just a big bunch of nerves waiting to be pleasured.
It does hurt the first few times, but so does hetero sex.



With the right amount of lube, you can make it easier.
So yeah, don't be silly about this.
People don't "turn" gay, they grow into it.
Duh, lol!

Politicians and church leaders gain power and stay in power by creating issues that drive a wedge between people. This tactic has been used throughout history (eg: feudalism, slavery, racism, sexism, divine right of kings, witch trials, inquisition, the Crusades, so very many more). Same sex marriage is the current social issue they have latched unto since there is still a large enough portion of the population that is willing to be swayed through "biblical" arguments. Fifty year from now they'll have found something new to latch onto--hatred keeps butts in the pews, money in the collection plates and hypocrite politicians in office. Anyone who knows history should never be shocked at the ability of people in power to cling to hatred and controversy.

Many councils run a scheme for the elderly where things that help safety and security are done by volunteers, she may have to buy the door and they would fit it for her.
Phone her local council and find out if they run a similar scheme, if not, try Age Concern as they would know of any entitlement to help.

*sigh*
Yes. It is possible.
If a plastic surgeon can make someone's ugly inbred cousin look like a movie star, they can flip a penis inside out and make it into a vajayjay.



You know?
It's not simple.
It's not cheap.
And it's not easy to get to that point.
You have to have psychological evaluations, hormone treatment, a support group, and months of post-op recuperation.
It's not a snap. It's a life-changing journey.
So don't speak so simply about it.

straight men do 'do' it in other women's butts... It's actually really common. If you don't beleive, look it up on one of your porn sites.



You also contradicted yourself in the last sentence you wrote. You think that women are cute but you say you have never been attracted. Well thinking they are cute is an attraction.



I think you have homosexual tendencies, this may or may not be a phase and may or may not develop into more than just tendencies. Only you will know that, sorry but nobody on Yahoo answers will understand your sexuallity more than you do.

You'll not find answers with porn, they're not an accurate depiction of lesbians.

okay this was honestly HILARIOUS..
A couple of nights ago at dinner my mom starting choking. Everyone looked up [all 3 of my siblings and my father] but no one did anything. She proceeded to bang on the table, but then made a face like she was fine so everyone was like okay, cool. So then she was still choking and she looks at my dad and I'm like "Dad I think you should do something and he's like, "What do you want me to do?" hahaha. So finally my mom was all right and she's like. "Thanks a lot!" So my dad says "WHAT! What was I supposed to do?" She's like, "You could have done more than picked up your fork and continued eating!"

Hmm.. I'd have to say.. when my friend and I were at her house and we were "modeling" her dresses.
What happened:
Her sister was in the laundry room while my friend was walking down the hall in a long dress. Then her sister came out of the room, & there was a crack of thunder heard outside. She FREAKED out and fell on her sister, all the clothes in the basket scattered. On top of that, she fell in such a manner that her dress slipped up and I could see her granny panties.



I think we laughed for a good 15 minutes.
Ahh, good times, good times.

Lesbians...  Am i overreacting?



Guys don't answer this. The majority if not all of you wont understand. So to lesbians out there, if one of your guy friends rang you and he didn't normally, then he said "wanna talk to my mate?" and then he mumbled something to them. and then his mate (who you'd never met or talked to you before) picked up the phone and greeted you with "Lesbian eyy?" In a perverted voice (not even saying your name or hello), would you hang up and be annoyed? at both your guy friend and the guy who said it. Or would you be fine with it. I'm a bit of a feminist. I took it quite badly and just hung up and got in a mood, but my friend thinks im majorly overreacting. What do you think?

Sounds like Lesbian Eyy was a prelude to him acting like an idiot. You just picked up on it before he was able to say anything offensive to you. I think girls have a sense of when a guy is about to be an as*hole before he's actually an as*hole. Its not because we're physic either. Its because when you've put up with dumb guys and their dumb comments for years, you tend to know and anticipate their response b 4 they even say it. You're friend shouldnt be passing the phone off to his guy friends anyways. I dont think you overreacted and your friend needs to be a little smarter with who he hands the phone off.

Lol i like the "retarded eyy?" answer but i didn't say anything coz i was in shock and just angry.
Anyway i chose this as best answer cuz i agree - i feel like he was just showing me off to his mate because i'm a lesbian which is so disrespectful. I'm not talking to him for a while. lol thanks :)

initially, u were not overreacting.  that was downright abnoxious.  but if you're still holding a grudge over it, you are overreacting.  the dude probs had a few beers, wasn't really thinking about how not to offend you...  u just gotta let it slide sometimes!  people are people and people are dolts.  lol.  if he does it again, confront him.  but until then, let it go.  :)

I'd personally LMFAO! I'd be a little confused at first but why would it be such a big deal? If your a lesbian why does it matter what guys want, it's not like they're going to get it. They were probably trying to mess with you, trying to get you to react, it's what they wanted. Well just my perspective.

Normal, I know that sounds werid, but at least the size of a pen! A girl wants a penis that can do justice



I lucked out with my fiancee' because his is really big lol (bigger then a pen :P..)



Buts it also has to do with your personality



Ya I know that sounds stupid, but if a man is a jerk and he has a pinky size penis, then that would make a girl laugh!!



Be confident tho, if you think you have a small penis and you go to have sex with a girl all insecure, she will notice it, and it will make her fell unconfertiable.



Hope I helped??
Good luck ; )

A friend of mine finally knows how i feel, what do you think?



A friend of mine finally knows how i feel, what do you think?
a so-called friend of mine who i thought i could trust, revealed to a friend who i'm in love with, the feelings i hid from her. Last week i tried avoiding contact with her because jealousy over took my entire mind(long story). She doesn't know this though. For 2 days i had the time to take my mind off of things and keep myself productive. But just when I thought it was all going well, the following day my friend tells me that he speaks with her and tells her everything about my feelings for her. He got so sick of seeing me so down and sad that he had to go up to her and have a 1on1 chat about it. She doesn't even know him. I got so upset after hearing what he did. We argued for an hour straight. I gave up and completely lost focus on everything. The fact that I am bi-sexual makes things even harder to communicate with others about my personal problems. I felt so pressured at this point that I opened up to my brother about my sexuality. It's a long story. However, surprisingly he supported me which brought tears to my eyes. To make a long story shorter, i spoke with the friend i'm in love with, explaining to her what really happened and why this all happened. I didn't want her to believe what this guy told her and the good thing about her is that she always trusts me no matter what. We had several conversations about 'these feelings' i have. And at first she wasn't sure but when she asked me if i was in love with her i paused and never really directly responded back to her question. she apologized and told me that she had a feeling that was the reason for all this and that she was too nervous to ask me. she begged me to answer her, telling me not to feel so sad, and how her heart was going crazy too. It took a while for me to respond back and before i could do so, she had to leave. the next time we talk i apologize for not responding. Then we continued on where we left off. She asks me all these questions of how i look at things regarding my 'orientation'. Her initial response towards my reaction was that she thought i looked at 'these feelings' as a bad thing. In this case, I reassured her. She said "I know that our love exists the way it does already."Then she tells me that she wishes we could share our love more but doesn't know of a way to express them with each other and if i came up with a way to let her know. Now my question is, the way she approached this, made it seem as if she feels the same way for me. Do you think she should be saying this if she didn't feel the same way? I mean we're both females. I know that we're both interested in women also. so should i tell her directly how i feel? do you think she'd even want to hear it?

oh my god!!! you have to tell her how you feel. from what I read it sounds as if she was hoping you would say it



''she wishes we could share our love more but doesn't know of a way to express them with each other and if i came up with a way to let her know''



If I were you I would firstly thank your male friend for telling her as it seems as if he did it solely for your benefit and then have a frank honest talk with your female friend and get to the bottom of where you both feel and see where you can go together!

It's good to seriously contemplate trying everything once, otherwise you'll never know whether you understood it well enough to have wanted to do it (if that makes sense!).



If something floats your boat, go for it and give it a go. But do it safely and with the right people / person / equipment (//ahem!//).



Best to leave the really extreme stuff to others until you've experienced the not-so-extreme stuff and are really switched on to it and build up from there.



That goes for everything, from curries and surfing to parachuting and on to er... "intimate relations".

Well, you are a bit stuck.  The only way to explore a man sexually is to be unfaithful (but that depends on your own definition of the word)



Maybe you need to be, just once?  (Possibly with her agreement?)

If she knows then why don't you agree with each other to have an open relationship? since you said 3some is out of question. otherwise there isn't that much solution you can do, unless divorce which i think isn't in ur mind. Good luck anyway!

Sometimes you can get a bit indifferent in a long term relationship. You can be complacent about finding ways to be happy and remembering why you need to be faithful in a long erm relationship. It's a hard one. Try to remember why you got together and find ways to be happy together and if you can't you are probably not meant to be together.

Baby Boy, you made the decision to have a monogamous relationship with her, a woman. Sometimes we have to look at what really matters in our lives and our deepest selves.  What is more important to you: loving and being loved in a good committed relationship or throwing that all away by having an "affair" with another man? You don't mention your age, but that "sexuality" thing will wan as you get older.  So, what is important to you right this moment?  If the desire to explore and play with your gay side, porn and fantasy may be enough.  Buy your girlfriend a strap-on and tell her what you'd like her to do with it.  But if she knows how you really feel about her, that you're faithful to her, then anything you may do with someone else, whether another dude or a woman, is going to hurt her and you know it.  So, either stand by her as you love her, or break up with her and start exploring your wild side.  However, don't let this go on.  If you're miserable (and not just frustrated), then play with some gay porn when you're alone.  These things have a tendency to work themselves out, but just be careful with her heart and your own.  Best of luck to you.

I still haven't worked out the best way of dealing with it myself! I''ve been faithfull to my fella for 6 years now, but I am Bi, we've always been honest with each other about how I'm coping with not having sex with any women anymore, and that's all you can do about it.  Flirting helps, My partner is very understanding of this and laughs about it as he knows I wouldn't do anything, but I don't know how that would work out with your partner as everyone's different.



I'm ok with it now I guess, sex would be pretty meaningless with anyone other than my partner now, whether they're a bloke or a lass, but I still get frustrated - but then I just have an imaginative w*nk!  And I agree with Bret, get her a strap on if she's ok with it.

Can a Malayalee men marry hispanic women?



I've always wanted to know, since the Malayalee culture is very strict. Lets say the Malayalee boy isn't very "Mallu" and he doesn't speak Malayalam or isn't brought up around the culture so much and the hispanic girl isn't very "ghetto" or she doesn't speak much spanish and isn't brought up around the culture very much meaning that she's as westernized as him. Do you think there is a good chance for marriage? Let alone success in that marriage?

At 60 he gets a free bus pass he needs to go to the Post Office to enquire about this. He will also get free prescriptions, I think as long as he is a British Citizen and has the necessary documentation to prove he is, he wont need to apply for free prescriptions it should be automatic. That's how it was for my mum and dad.



Empress you need to read the question properly, they never ask about retirement. In the UK people get special privileges  by default when they turn 60 regardless of whether they have retired or not. :/

He will be entitled to free prescriptions - Automatic



A winter fuel allowance - £250 this year I think this has to be applied for
Free bus pass - has to be applied for
Free swimming sessions - from April 09. not sure about this yet. If anyone in the house is over 60 and on certain benefits they also qualifiy for a grant of up to £2,700 for house insulation.  New boiler, cavity wall insulation, loft insulation.
this has to be applied for.
Its worth looking into all this properly or you may miss
out, because no one actually tells you what you are entitled
to.

Well, I'm assuming the land alone is worth far more than a couple of bucks.  I'm not familiar with the area, but it looks pretty depressed, and the abandoned home comes probably comes with a host of problems. She'll owe $850 for back taxes, and have to pay to have the yard cleaned (several thousand dollars). After being abandoned for so long, it's probably best to simply tear the thing down, again, several thousand dollars. She said she's going to sell it, but obviously, nobody wanted it to begin with (it was in foreclosure, and no doubt the bank tired to sell it before). I don't know if she really won anything, other than a pain in the butt. She'll have to pay taxes on it until she sells it, and if someone breaks their leg (etc) on her property, they can sue, and she'll be responsible. When winter comes, she could be fined for not clearing the walks each time it snows (or pay a service to do it when it does snow)... Also, that was Michigan, not Washington..

I really don't see the surprise.  Many people purchase worthless properties for their back tax amount.  She paid a $1.75 more than those people normally do and possibly with poorer title.  Between real estate taxes owed and real estate taxes and fees that will be due, she may have just purchased a liability.  If that house is in a worthless, drug-infested neighborhood she may never be able to COLLECT a penny of rent or get shot in the process of collecting.  She may be happy to sell it to someone else for $1.75.



On the brightside, maybe she can start a late-night informercial on buying properties for "less than" a Starbucks coffee, and then she can make some real money.

it was on the news in the uk yesterday where a man is trying to sell his 5OO,OOO home in a raffle as he can't sell it the normal way and if he dosen't sell enough tickets the winner will get all of the proceeds from the tickets already sold,less administration costs, so worth a go.

I've been watching a TV program called FLIP THAT HOUSE.  (or something like that)  They buy a tumble down shack for about $250,000, spend about $75.000 in renovating it and then sell it for $650, 000.  How did prices like this get so out of hand?!  $250,000 for a shack?!!!  I recently sold my two story home which had a basement converted into a den/game room for $75,000.  My deceased husband and I bought it 40 years ago for $9,000 and modernized it throughout the years a little at a time.  "We The People" have fallen victim to today's high cost of living.  Our elected officials should wake up and do something for the people that put them in office.

I saw the picture of that sad little house.  It didn't look like much of a bargain to me.  In many communities, including mine, I see the abandoned homes with the overgrown yards.  All I can say is this is a sign of the times.  People give up and go somewhere else.

I agree with banning these spelling tests, do you?



and here's my reason why. Years ago (60's) 7 year olds were subjected to these tests every Friday. The results were read out and the smarty pants were all issued with gold stars, sweets, and tempting goodies. Now the majority who "failed" were given the harsh treatment, no playtime for a week, write out the badly spelt words many times, and the eventual 2nd chance test the following week. Now my experience of this whole palaver was not of joy. Many's a night my mother must have been praying for a miracle as she put me through this spelling ritual. However i was a child of average ability, got there in the end, but feel for the kids who even got the cane for messing up their spellings. Anyone want to share their experiences?

I disagree.  School has been dumbing down for a considerable time, to the point one can gain an A* GCSE simply by turning up for an exam at the correct time.



Our poor illiteracy record in Europe's league tables is not going to improve unless children start receiving a decent standard of education and aren't given A* GCSEs as though they were sweets.

I think spelling tests are important especially now as so many kids write in "text language". If a kid has a problem with spelling or dyslexia this will be probably be picked up when they do tests.



I don't agree that kids should be punished for getting low scores.

I'd take the plasma TV, I'm easy to please.
But in the long run the $25,000 in gas would come out better in the total amount. That would last me for a lifetime, and it doesn't say it has to be spent on my car alone, . so I could also use it to gas up my sons and his family's vehicles and still have some left over.

yeah like i said keep it on the down low and wen your really ready to start telling your work mates, tell them wen your ready.



hope that helps

First, congrats on the new love! I think telling people is your choice, to be honest its nobody's business except who you want it to be, so I would only tell those who ask, this will help prevent you and your girlfriend dealing with people who would try to use your relationship status against you. Be honest, but tell only those you trust, at least now. I hope this helps you, and I hope you and your girlfriend have a wonderful, long healthy relationship!

Women, do you prefer gothic men or popular "Manly" man.?



Gothic: Long dark hair, possibly eyeliner, quiet, subtly good looking, romantic, would stand out from a crown, maybe a long leather jacket, pensive, but unpopular, sometimes moody, sensitive.
"Manly" man: Short hair, quite clean cut, has a good job, is well built and strong, "handsome" popular in the pub, likes football, but not much to him, probably uncaring at times...?

Of those two I'll go with manly man. Not many guys in my age group (late 20's) are "Gothic" anymore and tend to tone down to turn into the more "artsy" type. I used to go for that type when I was younger, however, my current boyfriend is the manly sort (but still caring). That's become more attractive to me as I've grown older.

Cutie pie Do you not realise that reverse racism is as bad as racism. It is the same thing with a different label.



It is putting one race as the superior of another. Please start thinking



I do not see how favouring a minority helps in any fight against racism. Follow a black for a day and see what it is like. i will tell you something everywhere I go they are accepted for what they are as people not blacks on the same terms as whites ie if you are an absolute pain in the a-rs- they are rejected  in the same way as a white

how can an organisation set up to combat racism be racist?  its aim is to make the police a less racist institution, not more racist

Not at all. They are simply protecting what they percieve to be the best interests of ethnic workers.



Allegedly, 7/10 ethnic workers in the british police have experienced institutional racism. Seeing as equal oppurtunities relatively guarantees employment in some cases, Far more subtle elements of racism are being used. Promotion denial etc.



The tokenism in high positions isn't really enough for them.(wouldn't be for me either to be honest) So they are taking a stand.



when 7/10 white workers experience racism on the job, they can start a club too &gt;_&gt;.

Yes, I think it's divisive.  That some black policemen have decided there needs to even be separate association for them shows that they are distancing themselves from non-black police.  I think that rather than create one cohesive, inclusive group, it creates unnecessary divisions.



Yes, you're black.  So?  Why do you need to make a point of about it and exclude others who aren't black?  Nobody cares if you're black, white or purple, just do the job you're paid to do.

I can't stand when white people start boohooing about reverse racism.



As a previous poster noted, how can an organisation set up to deal with racism.



If it was called "Police Association against racism" would it make all you white people feel better?



The question is why on earth would there be a need for a White Police Association when 80% of the police force is white?



It's funny that when minority communities organise themselves in order to deal with the imbalance in society, white people react so badly.



Does it make you feel so badly that minority communities are being treated fairly or fighting to change institutionalised racism?  You want to retain white privilege as much as you can, and don't like to see black people stepping out line - no working above your station..huh....

if anyone was divisive in the first place surely it was the white people telling black people that they're inferior and different. now that seemingly black people are showing signs that they're slightly different to white people, and people complain? seems silly to me.

This from the BPA site:



'The definition of "Black" does not refer to skin colour. The emphasis is on the common experience and determination of the people of African, African-Caribbean and Asian origin to oppose the effects of racism.'



http://www.nbpa.co.uk/index.php?option=c...



Go figure: A "Black" organisation that doesn't refer to skin colour.



God alone knows what it DOES refer to :oP



And for the record I think it's disgraceful. A bit like the BNP offering membership to whites only. Though I don't hear too many whites regurgitating that one as often as the BPA thing.

I think it is because 'coloured' has been used derogatorily a few times, while 'person of colour' hasn't.



Unfortunately this sort of thing happens all too frequently - someone used a word of phrase in a derogatory manner and overnight it is politically incorrect to use it any more.

I've never seen the movie but...



i think "colored person" refers more to a black person.  And "person of color" could refer to someone who is ethnic and has darker skin than say a white person.  Like Hispanics might be called "person of color" or a middle eastern person, also.  I think "person of color" is suppose to imply that the person in question isn't "white".



I don't see why, in 2008, anyone would use either of these terms to refer to a person.

the term 'coloured' when directed at people is considered offencive.  the word itself is not offencive more so the way in which it has been used in the past and the actions of the people who used it.  The term hold negative connotations as I'm sure you are aware.  Obviously you like to play the devil's lawyer.

I have never liked the term "person of color" for that exact reason. I've never been able to get anyone to explain to me why the two are different from each other. It means the same thing. If one is uncomfortable with one term, it makes sense to be uncomfortable with both.

Hello,



1) Sometimes the adults that are having the kids are not nearly as smart as some of the children. They're too busy keeping up with the Jones and don't dedicate enough time to rear the children.



In some ways they have it easier and in other ways they do not.



2) Some get away with things to a point but if the parents don't teach them, eventually society will. In my young days the worst that would happen was your peers or those you wronged would give you a healthy punch in the mouth or a kick in the fork. Today there are a lot more guns and knives being used and mistakes can be fatal.



3) In my country corporal punishment has gone to the supreme court already. Parents are still allowed to use reasonable force like spankings on children but they can't beat them with sticks, break teeth or bones etc.



4) In quite a few cases I have seen it is not good and bad children but good and bad parents that seem to make the differences.



Cheers,

<question>



Why is Kobe Bryant celebrated as a hero worldwide after he admitted to having sex with a non-consenting woman?



This statement was made by Kobe Bryant: " I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter."  I don't know if he can necessarily be called a "rapist", but why would such a man, rapist or not, be heralded as some sort of hero?  Is it not more appropriate to vilify him as someone who did a disgusting thing?

Are you referring to the mexicans in this country or just mexicans in their own country?  but either way we are very hardworking people that love to party and as a whole we don't complain about every little thing as americans who give a lawsuit for everthing.

I think you're taking it a little bit too close to heart to be honest, fair enough if you feel offended by it, I'd be offended if they said all scotsmen were animals but maybe it's the way he was brought up.  He's an african american so maybe he took a lot of predjudice from italian/americans.  Bear in mind also, it's just a movie.  Romper stomper made australians look like absolute animals but no one took that to heart.

Spike Lee detests all white folks, including Anglo Saxon protestants.  Furthermore, it financially benefits him to do so, just as it benefits him to create racial issues where there are none.  Unfortunately, melodrama, however baseless and invented the foundation, encourages drama hounds to fund exploitative puppetmasters.  Don't let such a hateful, race-obsessed, self-absorbed, and victim mentality individual get ya riled up.  He really isn't worth the time it took you to type your question.



Others here are right as well.  Spike Lee is not the only media man to stereotypically portray Italians on the big screen.  Spike Lee just happens to be as nasty off set as he is on.

Actually, I believe they are now the third largest group, following Hispanics...though Hispanics can be black or white.



I do not believe they are "that much" of a minority anymore, though they are still a minority.  However, even if they had the population of white folks in the U.S., I do not believe racially motivated "leaders" and those who have learned how to exploit the minority label would lay down the label, nor allow anyone else to.

When you actually go to India, it is a lot different than America. Because for most goods and services that they buy have no set price, they tend to barter with each other to get the price lower. It's pretty annoying but I don't think they're ever going to change. I think it's funny though that Indians that come stateside and open up their own business, jack up their prices sky high because they know us Americans will pay the price for it.

A lot of people do. Especially when all you had are flea-infested tunics and breeches made of nettles, horse-hair,or wool. (especially when cotton-gin (sp?) was not invented yet, the stuff that separates the cotton puffs from the hard and bristly seeds).



Some dress in night clothes, others, who could afford to do so when it's not too cold or drafty in the castle during summer, or could afford more than one blanket in winter, would go nude.



Check out the old paintings of kings and nights in their deathbeds. Quite a few were nekkid.

Goth/Punk/Alternative Fashions. Only for the rich?



It seems that plenty of stores that offer clothes and acessories of these fashions are really over-priced despite their popularity and likelihood of being bought. There are even cotton t-shirts over 50£ in quite a few stores that boast these styles. Should I, a total plebeian, just give up thinking that I can be what I want to be on the outside? Is every store like this? How is it on the other points of the world?

In the  70's Punk was about rebellion against the fascist rich.



Torn t-shirts and ripped jeans held together with safety pins and second hand clothing was a statement..... 'we can't afford your fashion so we will make up our own'.
Then the fashion industry cashed in and it became fashionable to have safety pins and rips in your clothing...punk fashion failed when it became trendy. Wearing expensive punk clothing really defeats the purpose of being punk.



If you really want to rebel buy all your clothing at second hand stores. I would love to see young people once again sticking it up the overpriced fashion industry and only buying pre-loved goods. Not only do you save money but if you buy from charity shops you are also supporting a good cause.

Scene kids tend to keep themselves to themselves because they're cool like that.

What do you think???



Malingsia is a nickname that is suitable for all Malaysian people. It was derived from the word "Maling" and the word "Malaysia". In Bahasa Indonesia, "Maling" means "Thief" in English.



As we know, Malaysia is a country that like to steals other country's cultural heritage. Many Indonesian heritage, such as Traditional Folk Songs, Dances, Traditional Clothes and Music Instruments (i.e = Rasa Sayange Songs, Batik Clothes, Gamelan etc). Not only Indonesian tradition they stole, but they claimed that some Chinese Food was their heritage also. They think that because Malaysia consists of different races (chinese, indian, malay etc), that will automatically made every culture from those races are theirs also.



Remember the slogan of Malaysia Tourism Campaign: "Malaysia, Truly Asia". Because they claim that in Malaysia all of the culture of Asia exist, and therefore made them Truly Asia.



Malaysia people think that this insinuation should made other people visit only Malaysia to taste the whole Asia cultures, so there is no need to visit other countries in Asia. This, is a very contemptuous perception against all other countries in Asia.



If Truly Asia still is their tourism campaign, it really shows that Malaysia is never proud of their own heritage, but they preffered to advertise other countries heritage as their own. This, truly shows that Malaysia is, malingsia after all.

goth is more of a style than a "lifestyle", goth people dress dark, listen to dark music, and sometimes can be obsessed with cults which is when it becomes more of a lifestyle, but emo's are a little more unique, however they could be described as "emotional", although I've known many emo's who hid their emotions and seemed to walk around under a dark cloud and push away anyone who tries to get close.

Goths typically don't go hunting for sympathy, or wear their sister's tight pants.  Goth is a much more laid back lifestyle then an emo's as emo's are always defending what they stand for where a goth just lives in the lifestyle and doesn't care how the world views them.  At some opportunites the Goth community might come to the surface and express that they aren't out to eat everyone's first born such as what happend a few years ago with Vampirefreaks.  Emo's are also typically only found in the younger generation where Goth's don't really ever grow out of their lifestyle.



If you want to explain it to your sister then tell her that a Goth doesn't cry or whine when someone's trying to pick on them.  They don't wear one large bang that covers their whole face, and though they celebrate death, they are not necessarily suicidal or even faking to be suicidal as is very commonly found in an emo.

Emo's say stupid things on their myspaces like "My hair is my life" and  caption pictures with things like "i'm so fat" when they weigh about 8 stones soaked through with a brick in each pockets. They like to cut themselves and tell the world about their problems via the internet to later contradict themselves with statements like "I don't care what anyone thinks"



Goths tend to just have a preference to gothic architecture,literature,clothing etc. and are slightly more dark (in personality.) I know less about Goths because they tend to keep to themselves a lot more.



Extremely pleasant people to be honest. I'm quite ashamed to have pre-judged them.

Why do Americans Insist that the USA is the Freest Nation in the World?



I am American and I continuously notice the naive and ignorant aura that the people here in my country insist that we're #1 and that everything here is still like 1955. We might not be the worst but we sure aren't the greatest either. There are nations where people can Smoke Marijuana and have many fewer restrictions on Freedom of the Press, Speech, Assembly and So on. When it comes to Freedom of the Press we are ranked 47 on a list of 160 Nations. When it comes to Freedom of Speech we are ranked 52. So tell me my fellow Americans; what makes you think we're so great? Also tell me why we must always force it down the throats of other nations that we're better then them when in reality we are just the *** hole of the Earth telling everybody we are so great and they're so bad. That is Hypocrisy and just plain conceited

I agree with you 100%. Propaganda is the reason i believe, we are told this when we are young and we think it is so. I have lived in other counties and I know you are right. We are not free and this county has to learn to mind it's own business. June 20th the 4th amendment was removed from the constitution so they can spy on citizens legally. That was wrong of this government to do.

In certain areas, such as freedom of speech and freedom of religion, the US is not a very free nation.  The US is the only first world nation where the government routinely spies on its own citizens, all in the name of "protecting" them; and being a Muslim praying in an airport is enough to be taken off of a flight.



In other areas, however, we are freer than all other first world nations.  We have by far the laxest gun ownership laws of any first world nation, as well as some of the lowest taxation.  As for taxation, the fact that we are taxed less makes us freer taxwise, but on the other side of the coin means that we have a lower standard of living than most first world countries.



However, you can't bash these proud Americans too much.  Even though they are wrong in believing we are the freest nation, so what, You have to admire the fact that despite the imperfections in our nation, very few US citizens would be willing to give up their US citizenship even for a million dollars.  That really says something about our nation-it may not be perfect, but hey, it's home, and we're staying.

Because America is a very deluded country, it is one of the most censored countries in the world. Just look at their news and education. A lot of its population know little of what goes on outside their own country.
The idea of freedom is al very well but when you put it into practise its a different story. I think Easy rider sums that up.

We cannot do anything in this country without the govt either regulating it or watching us do it.
The newspapers just spew the govt line, the right to free speech is gone, th govt has enacted laws against religion, property is taken away, and we cannot protect ourselves.

My uncle (who is black) & married to a Japanese woman has lived in Osaka for 15 years. He said that he's never experienced any kind of discrimination or racism since the day he arrived in the country.
I've been to Japan myself & find the people extremely nice.



However, it was a bit wierd because so many japanese girls wanted to take pictures with me & i'm sort of a shy and private person. Also, you won't be the only black people there. I met quite a number of black people when i was touring Tokyo. They were mostly Nigerians though.

I didn't know "The Klan" was still relevant today.



Most of them are dying old farts holed up in dirty shacks. They don't have the strength or the ability to do much more than mumble racist slurs & give dirty looks.



The rest of them are small groups of ignorant people who have little to no education & can't do much outside their own communities.



The world is much different now & once these people step out into it, they're in for a culture shock. They get laughed right back into their barnyards.

You could hang em from their necks in the trees (which by the way would make awsome Halloween decorations!) or you could start a black group called the nega ku klux klan and burn stakes in eachothers yards.....no i'm kidding.....but yeah they're friggin insane! They should all be dead by now but they're kinda like the jahovas witnesses or white supremisist groups that breed constantly and keep their children sheltered and inbred so they don't know any other way......I had a friend one time that was from a white supremisist (nazi) family and I didn't even know until one night I had my black friend with me and he tried to invite him out to "a party" at his familys house only to beat him......I found out and stopped it but i had no idea because he seemed so normal.....He is now in prison on a capital murder charge....for the rape and murder of a 70 year old woman.....I still can't believe it.....but I really think he deserved the needle...

They will die out.  The KKK was previlprevalente South into the 50's.  Those people are still around and so are their children, now adults.



But nationally, the Klan has about as much support as Hitler.  As blacks and whites homogenize and the folks living in the woods like Hill Billies come into the modern age, these things will stop.



I mentioned in an answer I gave earlier about feminism, that extremes tend to bring about a standard moderation.  PETA is crazy (recently asking Ben & Jerry's to substitute cow's milk for human breast milk) but they have brought about change in the way of reduced use of furs, reduced consumption of meat amoung the young and re-evaluation of slaughter practiced and dietary standards.



What I'm trying to say, as gently as possible, is that there needs to be change in the world, all people.  That includes doing away with the rediculousness of the KKK, but also maybe there could be some change in the way that black community handles themselves



(In general, don't jump on me, I'm not a racist!!  My Hubby is black!!  But I also live in a black neighborhood where I've seen young biys shooting guns... sideways, you know?  Like in the movies.)



But the violence inherent in rap music, the extremely high rate of blacks in prison most of their life and I just can't stand those pants around their a sses and shirts worn long, like a dam n dress!!  These stereotypes are frighteningly standard.



There are many hardships and injustices in the world.  We need to look to the future and the past will fall away!!!

Are women just as selfish and shallow about relationships as men are?



http://dating.personals.yahoo.com/single...



Here is a Yahoo article that generalizes men.
Considering I don't know even a single Asian male like the article describes I am a bit insulted. I'll let the reader conjecture exactly what population of men this article is talking about.



Further more after the first paragraph there is a link
"How to snag a rich guy"

Trust me on this... its not just western women. Asian women are by far the sluttyest and shallow I have met. Western women are angels in comparison.

Coming from a woman, yes, we are. Society always tries to make men out to be the bad ones, but women are often just as bad, if not worse. Women tend to be gold diggers, over sensitive, needy and often just as sex obsessed as men! I know guys who have been used for sex by women!
So, I think it's time for us girls to stop playing the whole damsel in distress act and realize that maybe men aren't really the problem..Maybe WE are...

I think that generalizing about cultural behaviors is pretty risky ... I once had an asian girl who had a total crush on me ... the girl I married (much to my regret) only told me about it after she had me reeled in hook line and sinker)  and she could be pretty d***d shallow herself .... she's probably got gradnchildren by now ...

Why's it ok for blacks to pin everything on the whites, talk 'bout 'em 'n have a problem wit their jokes when whites HAVE NO CHOICE but to leave it alone when a black does it. Everywhere u go, theres gonna be someone racist, or seems that way. They might be black, white, asia.. wutever.. but get over it. I don't run home 'n cry when my fiances families always crackin' white jokes on me even tho I know they're playin', but I didn't cry when his sister called me a white ***ch. GET OVER IT.

Sorry - have no idea what show you're talking about. ;)



But regardless, you have to be realistic.  Most television has to have some "shock and awe" to keep viewers discussing it and drawing in for more! ;)  It's no different than running a marketing or advertising campaign in theory.  They have a goal to have people watch and talk about it.  See, their theory worked! :)

Emo people are scum of the earth in my opinion. They dont even try to live their life to the fullest, but all they do is complain and mourn about how sad and pathetic their life is. Yea, sure, they might be going through some emotional stages, but cutting themselves and listening to screaming loud songs arent going to help them. They should have a more positive outlook on their lives. Try to solve problems, instead of building them day by day. I do not like negative people. I just dont understand why everyone can AT LEAST LOOK NORMAL if they cant be normal internally. It's a messed up world we have here today.

I think it means people are constantly reminded of their differences, because majority of the people in our society cannot accept differences. For example, just because you're supposedly considered an Asian American, African America, Hispanic American, Indian America, and wtvr American you are, no one cares. You're still Chinese, you're still from Africa, you still eat tacos and wear sombreros, and you are a terrorist in the other's eyes. By nature, I think people are very judgemental.

Depends on where in the US you live. I have lived in Illinois were the population is prodominantly black in alot of areas and I did encounter racism there in prodominantly white areas. The town I lived in was Millstadt, a town ran by Elders from Germany. They would not allow the bus to stop in town because they didnt want black people coming there. Reason being, they assumed all blacks that rid the bus were drug addicts. They were also prejudice against anyone who wasnt from there because me and everyone I knew there that was from a different area (or state in my case) were highly mistreated (rumors, name calling, ect.). However, other places I went there, people of all races got along fine. Just that one stupid, Old German people ran town. I had moved there from Montana where I had never ecountered a racism problem in my 9 yrs. So yes, unfortunately, racsim is still as big of a problem as it was 50 yrs in some areas.

Not necessarily. People who are popular have a lot of friends right? Well how does one make friends? By being nice and honest and friendly. You don't have to do what others want you to do, that's closer to slavery. Be your best self and people will appreciate it and love you for it.

Why don't the media like black girls?



like BET now has or should I say HAD loads of black girls singing or in music videos heck they even hosted the shows, but now I see white girls/mixed girls in alot of commercial/shows.



Now the media is surrounded by mixed chicks and white girls even in videos. It's a sad thing to see for dark skin women, I don't think I even see black girls in commercial(maybe sometimes)...



even my fave shows byblack girls got canceled fast and put some white chicks in, who else agrees with me



</question>



<additional details>

Because we're not white. It all goes back to 16-17+ centuries when explorers traveled around the world. The natives believed that they were gods, and the explores thought that the natives were worthless savages. Now in 2008 these roles still exist. We all have to be like Almighty Whitey

Black women aren't considered as attractive and appealing as other women by the mainstream, which is why black women are vanishing from the media.  If there is a call for a black woman in a movie, notice that she is usually very visibly mixed or very light-skinned, which I suppose makes her more appealing to the masses.



If a dark-skinned black girl is in a movie, she's usually the trash-talking, slutty, obnoxious character used to fit a token role.



Sad but true.



That being said, all groups endure their stereotypes by the media.

It's more so because it makes for more effective advertising than racism. Blacks despite being a minority are recognized for their consumer status thus being more attractive to target and more profitable (like slavery). Telling them that they need to buy products in order to get like a celebrity implied in such a way that it will never be possible for the majority to achieve makes big bucks.

I don't really know much about my African heritage because I don't know what country, tribe, etc. my family comes from. However I am proud of the accomplishments Black people of the African Diaspora have had.



I don't exaggerate my non-African percentage. If anything, I downplay it because I don't have much of a connection to it. My mom's biracial, but was adopted by a Black family, so we just say we're Black.



I'm not ashamed of my African roots. I just want to learn more about them.  I've made friends with some Igbo and Yuroba in college as well as a girl from Ghana. From what I've learned, the cultures are beautiful.

I am proud of being an African and being black. I can't really find a reason why but all I know is that I'm proud of who I am and what God made me. As you said some caucasians envy us they can't show it so they change it into hate. Some of them do their hair like ours (braids) and some others have surgeries to have some of our body features. So why won't we be proud of being who we are when you know some people admire who you are?

I've never had a problem getting along with Latinos, nor have I noticed that they have a problem getting along with me. I had 3 close friends who were Latinas when I was growing up. In fact, we were so close that I nearly became fluent in Spanish. I still don't understand why people think that blacks and Latinos don't get along as a rule. Maybe there's tension in some regions, but where I'm from (the southeast) it's pretty much a non-issue.

African-American over 21 million, Latinos over 55 million.



All that 21 million and 55 million do not get along?.. Come on, the gang related, hatred fueled turf wars you see in Los Angeles does not represent the greater relationship between Blacks and Hispanics.

inter-caste or inter-culutural marriages have thier own pros and cons.



the advantageous side is that it is intermingling of two cultures and both the couple get to learn something entirely different then what they did all thier lives. you get to enjoy different foods, music, languages, customs and goto to different places as well. All in all its an experience worth living.



The flip side is that in nuclear families it does not matter, but in joint families, there is a whole lot of adjustment the girl has to under go, as she has to learn more things compared to adjustment in a normal marriage within the same cultural background.



I wud still say that the pros outweigh the cons. Last but not the least, mutual understanding, respect & trust always remain the foundations of a good marriage, and if they are maintained then there is no reason a marriage wud not work out

Wifebeaters: like them/hate them? why?



Im just trying to get a survey of this so that I can tell whether its ok to wear them or lol. I know it sounds STUPID, but sometimes I am not too sure what to use for undershirts (i use both regular under shirts with sleeves when im at home and sometimes just the tanks). Just a survey, don't need to get too touchy about the subject. Oh and this applies mostly to guys i know girls will obviously wear them lol. Also, say whether you use Hanes or Fruit of the Loom brand cuz I am not sure which is a better brand.

I like wearing them in the summer time. And if I wear an undershirt it'll be a wife-beater.



As far as brands, Hanes is good cause the tag is painted on the back and Jockey is another good brand. Just make sure you get them with a hem or seamed at the bottom if you're going to wear them as is.

Do black women tend to be more traditional...?



than white women? I'm not talking about the thuggish, video-hoes that you can find on BET gyrating in music videos, I'm talking about the women that can be found on Soul Food, or even in Tyler Perry films, "Family that Preys". In my Sociology class, we were talking about African-American women & how they followed a more traditional household where they believe that the man is the provider versus many white women in the 21st century who follow feminism more closely...



Are black women adherents of white, western feminism? Are they more apt to follow a traditional role if given the opportunity?



I hope this question makes sense, no ignorant answers please, your thoughts are welcome.

I would consider them Latino- as Portuguese originated from Latin  as did Spanish. As Latin was the language of the Roman empire- and evolved into  on in Romanian Italian and French  as Spanish and Portugese so these folks would also be Latin.
Speaking as an individual with Italian ancestry- my ancestors didn't build the roman empire so the term Latin would be applied exclusively to people Living in the Americas who speak spansish- if it weren't for the Roman legions the Spanish and Portugese would speak some Iberian language instead of a languiage evloved from Latin.

I personally dont call anyone hispanic or latino. Its pointless when they all know where they came from.

Why is Kobe Bryant celebrated as a hero worldwide after he admitted to having sex with a non-consenting woman?



This statement was made by Kobe Bryant: " I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter."  I don't know if he can necessarily be called a "rapist", but why would such a man, rapist or not, be heralded as some sort of hero?  Is it not more appropriate to vilify him as someone who did a disgusting thing?

Because he is being praised for his skill, not what he does wrong.  Trust me, I agree that he's a sucky person if he raped someone.  But we have to focus on the good.  He's a great ball player and that makes him a hero.  Martin Luther King Jr. cheated on his wife but we praise him for the good he did for our country, not what he did to his wife.  I know it's hard to look passed the bad things people do, but sometimes we have to.

If we take into account where people went to school, who their parents are, where they lived, etc., we'd be helping those that need it, rather than those who don't need it but get help because of their skin color.  What do you think?  I found a couple good articles, but not many.  If you have any, please post the link.  Thanks!

How can you base on aptitude only when kids don't have the resources that others do because of the school they go to?  They don't have the amount of textbooks or computers, etc. that more affluent schools have.



You're not discriminating against the middle class with this policy because they're already getting in to college.  It'd be ridding the rich kids that get in with their money, not their skills and accepting more poor with better skills.

Why is Kobe Bryant celebrated as a hero worldwide after he admitted to having sex with a non-consenting woman?



This statement was made by Kobe Bryant: " I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter."  I don't know if he can necessarily be called a "rapist", but why would such a man, rapist or not, be heralded as some sort of hero?  Is it not more appropriate to vilify him as someone who did a disgusting thing?

I totally agree with you. If she did not consent, he should be had up for rape. I don't know why rapists get off so easy. He should be heralded as a loser.

Because he is being praised for his skill, not what he does wrong.  Trust me, I agree that he's a sucky person if he raped someone.  But we have to focus on the good.  He's a great ball player and that makes him a hero*.  Martin Luther King Jr. cheated on his wife but we praise him for the good he did for our country, not what he did to his wife.  I know it's hard to look passed the bad things people do, but sometimes we have to.

Humble might not be the word, but - a person who (to you and others would agree too) was DROP-DEAD gorgeous but dressed plainly, kept to themselves (maybe a bit shy?), and just overall seemed like a down-to-earth person.



Anyone ever known one of these rare people? :)

Pity is we don't see each other very often, as I'm Spanish and he's German and we both live on our home countries, but everytime we meet he's able to send me this feeling of inner peace that's unique of him... When I talk about him or think of him, the word that first pops up in my mind is "calm".

Racism will never "go away".  You can only change people's views if they WANT to change.



Some people who are really willing to be less ignorant try to diversify themselves (going to different countries to introduce themselves to different cultures, going to school in a very diverse city, etc.).

I think a lot of people fail to realize that there are two sides to the racism issue. There are the groups being oppressed/discriminated against (kind of depends on the situation and how you prefer to view it), and that's what most people focus on. This isn't a bad thing, of course -- we should do everything we can to educate people about discrimination and do everything we can to combat it. But what many people DON"T seem to realize -- or perhaps they realize it but don't know how to address it -- is the issue of privilege. If there's a group being discriminated against then there's another group in a position of privilege. I can't tell you the number of times I've had wonderfully open-minded, progressive, intelligent students of mine be absolutely shocked when that side of the racism issue is brought up. And of course, I think this is also the hardest side of the racism issue to fight because who wants to give up privileges, even ones they aren't consciously aware of? But I also think it's the most important because it has been neglected for so long.



If you haven't read it already, you should take a look at "Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack" by Peggy McIntosh (here: http://mmcisaac.faculty.asu.edu/emc598ge... )(there's also a version here if you want something with a neater list and also want to see how this article can be relevant for topics other than racism: http://www.lilithgallery.com/feminist/mo... ). Some parts of it are a little dated now -- she wrote it in the 1980s if I recall correctly -- but it's still very relevant and I have found it to be an excellent tool for pointing out and explaining this other side of the racism issue. I personally think that one of our strongest tools for fighting any kind of -ism, including racism, is a good education.

Primitive tribal territorially scepticism and fear of invasion by outside forces leads to distrust among primitive societies. I am afraid it has been with the homo sapians ever since they jumped out of the trees and started to walk.



Ethnic intolerance has more to do with religious values than joining together in trade and prosperity instead of poverty.



When the Assyrians held power in the Middle East 3,000 years ago the encompassed different ethnic and religious bodies under one King rule. During this period wealth and expansion of population gained strength for one of the greatest nations of that particular time.



Rome failed due to the fact that to be a Roman you had to be born a Roman but outsourced their responsibilities to foreigners.



So what has today's generations of humans around the world from history. The answer is absolutely nothing we still live in a divided world of religious and social indifference's towards each other and until then nothing will really change as far as I am concerned.



Spain once had multicultural society with Jews, Muslims and Christians with a bit of paganism mixed in. The Catholics wanted to change this with the help of a diminishing royalist of Spain persecution started against the Jews followed by the genocide of the Muslims either through the inquisitions of military aggression.



Russia with its Communist control had a similar existences alas for the if you are not of pure Russian decent and Orthodox Catholic then you were exterminated or disposed of wealth land and citizenship.



So I conclude such as life on this planet of homo sapians or should I say Planet of the Apes. re the movie of that title.

Wouldn't you guys be happy too if you could escape unreasonableness?



I lived in South Africa for the past 23 years. Blacks stole my lunch from me at school and still had the nerve to ask me for lunch during breaks. They'd talk about me in their language then laugh and I'd feel down. Just after the new South Africa formed, one guy tried terrorising me for being white and harming his people. I was 10 and how could I have harmed his people at that age? I started working recently and they'd always ask me very jumpy questions like why do you white people love bread so much as they preferred cooked food, and they'd ask me if I'd ever marry a black or date one. I resigned and I'm now leaving for South Korea on a venture out there. I resigned a few weeks ago and my director (who's a white guy said I can go with immediate effect) but my black manager said I must stay because I have work to do. I had nothing to do. I sat there like a doll just going out of my mind. She tried convincing me psychologically that I've got work and after sometime she made it known to me that she's jealous of me going after working for a few months and she can't after working for 10 years. I left last week (althought I still had to work this week out) and she was furious. I mean why are black people so unreasonable and why do they always want but are never willing to give? What did they or their forefathers ever give towards the international community since the dawn of time?



I'm not a racist but just brutally honest.



Thank you



P.S. I also think that they like using people and they're very abusive and love pretending in order to get stuff their way. People who give into them are people who don't have honour or heritage.

I use a pipe, or maybe a joint when others are sharing.  When I was a kid we loved bongs.  I have no idea what the majority of white people do though.  I agree that the majority of black folks I know smoke blunts.



I'm thoroughly confused as to how anyone is getting offended by this question.  What does white college kids stumbling out of bars have to do with the method people in general smoke their weed? There's nothing wrong with black folks smoking weed....so there's no reason to assume the questioner is attacking someone and you must go on the defensive.  Calm down folks.....



You don't really believe black folks don't stumble out of bars, chain smoke, get mugged (or killed for that matter), and sleep with whoever asks too, do you?  Really?  Sheesh...stupid people do stupid things, my friend.  And stupid comes in all sorts of pretty colors.

98% of the white kids enjoy chain smoking cigarettes, pot and other stuff and drinking until they're completely trashed. I would never stereotype, because many of them are my friends, but on the flipside, you never see the black kids stumbling out of bars and getting mugged and sleeping with whoever asks.

If we take into account where people went to school, who their parents are, where they lived, etc., we'd be helping those that need it, rather than those who don't need it but get help because of their skin color.  What do you think?  I found a couple good articles, but not many.  If you have any, please post the link.  Thanks!

How can you base on aptitude only when kids don't have the resources that others do because of the school they go to?  They don't have the amount of textbooks or computers, etc. that more affluent schools have.



You're not discriminating against the middle class with this policy because they're already getting in to college.  It'd be ridding the rich kids that get in with their money, not their skills and accepting more poor with better skills.

Ill play devil advocate..



My argument against this is that it shuts out minorites. Say a school only had 3 seats left and had a pool of 100 low income people..



95% of the people are white
5% of the people are black



A test is taken to see who is the most qualifed to get those seats. The average score of all white students is 80%. The average score for all the black students are 95% (in fact lets say 100% the black students scored 95%).



And lets only 20% of the white students achieved the score of 95%..Because of the sheer number of white students it would be virtually impossible for a black student to ever be admitted despite the fact that as a group the outperform the white students.



While the most qualifed people are chosen, minorities are put at an inherient disadvantage due to population size. Therefore we'd never be able to become law makers.

There is more poverty among any population than those few that have extreme wealth which in-turn contains power over the masses in general terms. Those who are held within the middle class of people generally follow the wealthy class of wanting to just like them to some degree.



The corporate ladder of achievement is riddled with class discrimination with the confines of the workplace and reflects into mainstream society trends within that catchment area of progress.



Albeit I am happy to be just poor and I will stay that way.

He was a leader that made decisions based on what was best for the majority of the people. His choices literally changed history, not just for the time period but for hundreds of years. Think what would have happened if the US had been divided into separate countries. What would have happened to slavery? What would have been the outcome of WWII without the help of the southern states?

Where do white and black Mexicans fit into the "Brown Pride" movement?



Brown Pride is supposedly an organization to promote "Mexicanness" or whatever, but there are white and black Mexicans too!  Not all Mexicans are brown, so where do the non-brown Mexicans fit in?  Does this mean the members of Brown Pride are racist and believe if you're not brown, then you're not Mexican?  (Before anyone tells me otherwise, yes, there are black Mexicans; the United States isn't the only country that once had slavery, and there are still black Mexican populations along the Costa Chica in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca).

take the funnier more down to earth one. blondes are often more superficial simply based on the fact that their alwys dying their hair, they obviously put a lot of effort and money into looks. however, natural blonds are often livelier so um, take who is funner, or better looking.

It does represent Broken Britain in that it is an artificial construct.  The programme's researchers look far and wide for the biggest losers and freaks and then present them to the audience as if they represented a social phenomenon.  It's a big lie, just like Cameron's "broken Britain".

Since when is a life expectancy 130+ years? Anyway, US law allows for people to get paroled after a certain % of their term is up, so the lawyer might try to get that % up above what they will live through.

Your question is weird because dogs have nothing to do with the people living in the ghetto.  You may think that they are ugly but they may think that they are just gorgeous.  Anyway, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder so it's very subjective and you can argue on and on forever.

I have asked the same question myself, maybe it's has something to do with the genes. Plus most male Asians don't have much body hair so that also may be a factor.

I'm a 30 year male Filipino, and I had this experience when I was in Bangkok. I went into a bar and I was carded. I showed them my ID and told me that it was a fake ID. The bouncer told me that I look 16... What the heck was that. I would be happy to accept from people telling me that I look young for my age but it also has its disadvantages. I understand if I were in the US because it get carded there no matter what but in Bangkok? Hmmmm I'm insulted in a good way I guess.

Do black guys prefer white women over black women?



I'm black and I want to know something on this subject. Personally, I prefer white women over black women cuz they dont act all ghetto and use the "in your face anger" stuff. Plus from my experiences, white women seem much more nicer. I'm seeing has anyone else had related issues to this? Not that I dont like black girls or anything I just would pick a white girl over a black one.

I don't know.. It's weird. My husband is black and he says he was never attracted to black girls. I always thought that was odd. But I'm extremely attracted to him.. so I'm not exactly complaining. I think everyone has a "type" that they're attracted to. I don't think it's necessarily a race thing, per se. Like, I never went for pretty white boys at all.. mainly because of a generalized conceitedness that intimidated me. Has nothing to do with their race, it's a way I want to be treated and loved. I went for the intellectual GI Joe with an amazing body :) I wouldn't count out an entire female or male race. Everyone is so different. But certain areas, upbringings, social groups, conform to certain personalities in a lot of cases. I have some female black friends that are really, really sweet.



I believe in one mate for life.. and out of so many people, having a specific type narrows down your search. The idea is to be happy and in love.. and it helps for them to have a personality that compliments your own, no matter the race or other factor.

i agree with you, most black men want white women.



I think one reason is it is a status symbol for a black guy to show off that he has a white women, secondly, in general terms, white women are more attractive then black women,



also men loves butts, and most black girls have these bubble butts which are not sexy at all.  Another reason is what you said, black girls have that gettho attitude, and who needs or wants that.

This is so not what you asked for so report me.  I am a white woman and for the most part, I love the way black women are in your face.  I would not respect my friends or men if they just kissed my butt, telling me everything I did was okay.  To the subject though, It's true, everybody has their own opinion.  White girls can be sooo ghetto too.  It's not a color thing.  I think you should try several styles before you finally settle down with a wife and find out for yourself.  Nooo hurry...

Its because of society



Mixed-race blacks tend to fit in better with blacks than with whites. Almost EVERY black american has some white ancestry in them, whereas most white people dont have much significant black ancestry. For black people, being mixed-race isnt that much of a big deal becaus, like you yourself said, we all know mixed race people. Whereas in the white community, people mixed black-white arent as common and arent usually taken for white because they are 90% of the time darker than the average white person.



Think about it......we have light skinned blacks, but theres no such thing as dark-skinned white people.

This is a really good question. It depends as some mixed race people lean towards their white side & some lean to their black side or some remain in the middle.



If you grew up in more urban environments like Hackney, Mossside, Bristol etc then you find that they & including some white people fall more into the black culture, where as someone who has grew up in a more white environment may lean towards being more White. (whatever that means).



look at Obama & Tiger Woods for an example. Obama leans more towards being more black with a black wife & kids where as Tiger has adopted the white culture with his white wife & kids & lifestyle.



But remember everyone is an individual so they choose their own culture or lifestyle.

Where do white and black Mexicans fit into the "Brown Pride" movement?



Brown Pride is supposedly an organization to promote "Mexicanness" or whatever, but there are white and black Mexicans too!  Not all Mexicans are brown, so where do the non-brown Mexicans fit in?  Does this mean the members of Brown Pride are racist and believe if you're not brown, then you're not Mexican?  (Before anyone tells me otherwise, yes, there are black Mexicans; the United States isn't the only country that once had slavery, and there are still black Mexican populations along the Costa Chica in the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca).



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



mexico is 1% black, so this hardly ever comes up as an issue. And black people are brown too.



As for everything else. The Brown Pride movement is more or less aimed at the mestizo & indio populations of mexican-americans, which make up about 90% of Mexico's people at home. White Mexican-Americans are even less prominent because the white population of mexico is overall much better off, so fewer whites have any reason to leave. White mexicans were never a large part of the mexican-american community, so the brown pride movement largely excluded them.



Also, White Mexicans have a history of discriminating against brown mexicans in the old country anyway.

take the funnier more down to earth one. blondes are often more superficial simply based on the fact that their alwys dying their hair, they obviously put a lot of effort and money into looks. however, natural blonds are often livelier so um, take who is funner, or better looking.

well hello there. first I'm a true blonde... NOTICE I wrote the correct spelling of the word blonde ... B-L-O-N-D-E.  Not to mention ''then'' should be, or I'm suspecting you mean ''than''.



Secondly, your questions sound though you were slightly inebriated. good for you.. wish i were there.



So in answer to your question, unless your blonde, than no.



For if you are not blonde, than i believe I just shot a huge whole in your logic by pointing out the very obvious mistakes in your question.

The dumb blonde stereotype emerged with the development of films, television and glossy magazines. Consider the age back then. A black and white mentality that never has been challenged and continues today.



Maybe in another century we'll grow up.
Don't hate her because she's beautiful

What is the deal with peoples strange ethnic preferences?



I was talking to a friend about this and he said "Dude. There is no such thing as an intelligent racist". "Apply the same reasoning to people like that."



For example, A guy i went to school with religiously only dates white women. Hes black as the ace of spades &gt;_&gt;. His mother had sex with a black man to create him. Why the sudden dislike of yourself?



Or white women who specify black men. I can apply the same logic.
Or people who specify south asians or hispanics.



Or most bizarrely (to me). White women who specify mixed-race men.



I personally will date anyone if i like them, be they black,white,asian,hispanic,polynesian,ch... or green with blue spots.



I'm just curious as to the thinking behind that?

Those are the stats, not sure if they are correct. Did you ever look at the stats for Caucasions? Here is the scoop 70% of what number is illegimate girls under 18? Over 59? What do these numbers mean?
I think the stats are close on the jail, but what is the total prison population in the US? What sort of crime 90% of the black population could be in for white collar crime?

How many of the other races, besides me, is illegitimate? How many of the other races are on welfare or in prison? How many of the illegal aliens fall into those categories?
Get off your soap box. Concentrate on being the best YOU can be. You can never be ignorant enough to help another person get smart.



So, go to school. Read a book every day. Talk to someone who is smarter and/or richer than you every day. You can't be poor enough to help someone else, but you can be rich enough to do that.
Pay attention to the positive aspects of our country and figure out how you can increase them in number.
What did you learn today that will improve our world?

No, you weren't misinformed - you were lied to. Your "rascally racist" is probably better described as an uneducated, ignorant being who, right now as we speak is wallowing in his own misery -  down in his  moms basement - making pipe bombs. You named  4 black Americans as if they should represent or be responsible for what the other couple million people of their race do or don't do.  You and your question are a tremendous drag on my brain cells right now

why would a child of any colour being illegitimate be a drain on the US economy?



being black or white or chinese or anything has nothing to do with it. it is a question of poverty. there are just as many, if not more white and hispanic poor people in america who face the same problems, yet if it is a black person, some racist will say it is because of the colour of his skin. so then how do we explain the masses of poor white americans living in trailers, with their illegitimate children on welfare?

all objects or people are attracted to each other by some mystical force? I've never heard of such law. If you are attracted, it is by choice.

What is wrong in emulating other cultures?



All around the world you will see certain indivuals or ethnic groups emulating or immitating other ethnic groups. An example would be
Caucasians acting African American
Vice Versa
South Asians acting Black
Asians Acting white
the list could go on.



My question is what is wrong with that? Why are people condemned as try hards or ridiculed? Is it such a sin to have an open mind and appreciation of other people's culture? I certainly am open to a wide array of different cultures in terms of food, music and customs even though I may not understand the language!

Ethnic groups are often underpinned by a strong sense of unity.  This extends to sub-cultures too..And when someone recreates the mannerisms on which that unity is built without actually being part of it, Some groups see this as offensive. Sort of like walking around wearing a "J-Dilla changed my life" T-shirt when you don't know who J-Dilla.



There is nothing wrong, People enjoy feeling accepted. Acceptance and being embraced by a large culture is a nice feeling. If this is done insincerely...



To quote Cleveland on family guy "Maybe your son is copying the mannerisms of another culture because he doesn't know enough about his own."



Its not a sin. You're a try hard if you overdo it to the point where by you are visibly making a spectacle of yourself.

<question>



What is the deal with peoples strange ethnic preferences?



I was talking to a friend about this and he said "Dude. There is no such thing as an intelligent racist". "Apply the same reasoning to people like that."



For example, A guy i went to school with religiously only dates white women. Hes black as the ace of spades &gt;_&gt;. His mother had sex with a black man to create him. Why the sudden dislike of yourself?



Or white women who specify black men. I can apply the same logic.
Or people who specify south asians or hispanics.



Or most bizarrely (to me). White women who specify mixed-race men.



I personally will date anyone if i like them, be they black,white,asian,hispanic,polynesian,ch... or green with blue spots.



I'm just curious as to the thinking behind that?

Some people only like CHUBBY partners, other are ABHORRED by anyone who is slightly overweight, others really loves blonds, and some of us has a preference for a specific race. The fact that I prefer asian men to caucasian men does not mean in any way that I DISLIKE myself. I just happen to like Asian men.

People date who they like and if they happen to have preferences so be it ! I tend not to date heavy set women but that's just my choice and it in no way means I would never date a heavy set woman but it means I prefer to date women who are not heavy set.

I think that some people do have deep rooted issues with their own ethnicity and deliberately seek out others who they see as different or sadly, even better themselves.  However, I believe they are in the minority.  I honestly believe that most times their reasons for dating interracially are pretty simple.  The other person probably just has the physical and personality traits they're attracted to.  We all like something different, that's all.  It's as basic as having a favorite food or color.  There's nothing wrong with pink, but I like orange more.  Asparagus is cool, but I'd rather have broccoli.  It's just a matter of personal preference. I think it's the same with dating.

If I'm completely honest, I'd be massively freaking out.  I would be trying to fight back tears and praying to myself that someone would come and rescue me.  I'm not very strong, so I wouldn't feel confident in trying to find a way out and I'd probably freeze out of terrifiedness. I would also be begging the man to please let me go.
