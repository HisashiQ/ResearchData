Burning any Carbon source would emit CO2 and H2O but both of these are not pollutants. The polutants that come are because of impurties in coal. the most common are



Gas polutannts
NO, N2O, NO2
SO2, S2O
Particulates (small particulates in the gas)



But most common is the FLY ASH. that is large particles. the Coal fired plants have Fly Ash removers from Gas but this is dumped in the land.

<answer>



The forces responsible for the attraction are the same, they are just further apart in liquids and gases and hence weaker.



Also the greater velocity of molecules means that if a molecule does approach another one, it is likely to get so close to it that replusive forces will become prominent and push the molecule apart again.

Why does syrup heat faster than water?



I had to a science lab test on what will heat and cool faster syrup or water.



I had to put 100ml of syrup and water in plastic bags and then put them into a beaker with 200ml of hot water (90 degrees C) .  As I recorded the tempature every 2 min. the beaker with the syrup stayed hoter for about 30 min.



Then I had to repeat it with cold water and this time the syrup cooled faster that the water.



Does this have anything to do with the Kinetic Energy of the particles in the syrup.  The lab test is to determine how the temperatures of two different material changes as the absorb and release heat.

Why do some American scientists fail to use the metric system?



Not just individual scientists, but entire scientific disciplines in the USA continue to practice their own, archaic and ideosynchratic measurement methods.



Makes communication with other scholars difficult.



Makes calculations unduly cumbersome.



Thanks in advance.



</question>



<additional details>



My field (archaeology) has this problem - probably largely because of its tangential relationship with the social (non)sciences, and, as some mention "tradition". The "English" system is also still used in pedology and some other environmental sciences.



However, the answerers are correct - this is NOT the norm.



So Zeep - several decades in biomedical sciences?  I am impressed.  I guess that makes you at least 80 years old and not retired!



I have worked over twenty years (not even a few decades) in the earth sciences and archaeology, and I can remember a time when geologists were forced to publish in both English and Metric.  In archaeology, some of state regulators require these conversions still!  Silly, really!



Some examples - Engineering, Archaeology, Soil Science, some fields within material science, some aspects of geography

Tradition I suppose



I work with mixed units every day and its a little annoying



Acutally most all manufacturing in the US is essentially gone "metric".  In that they are decimal based rather than fractions.



When you machine parts you do it to 0.001" or 0.0001" or millionths of an inch. This is essentailly a "metric'd" system based on tens



All units are arbitrary in one way or another, as long as they are all based on tens then its pretty much all the same



I agree though that the world woudl be a better place if we were all just one system.  But think of all the jobs lost in the conversion table businesses! ;)

I work in the biomedical sciences and have for several decades. I am not familiar with these disciplines to which you refer.  There's no choice but the metric system in biology, chemistry, and physics - no one is going to let me publish a paper that measures things in ounces or inches.



Do you have a link?  Because, as you say, it would seem that communication with other scholars, which is largely via peer-reviewed publications, would be difficult or impossible, at least in fields with which I'm familiar.

Now I'm no scientist, but I am peripherally interested in science, and read about new discoveries as much as possible.



Only in media do I find the old Imperial standards (feet, inches, pounds) used at all.  Findings published by scientists tend to always be recorded using the metric system, so I don't really see what you are talking about.  In school, I was taught that the entire scientific community uses the metric system, regardless, for the exact reasons you state.



Perhaps, by 'scientific disciplines,' you mean things other than chemistry and physics?  Because in those fields, I just can't see using the imperial system at all.



Writings published for public consumption seem to always use both.



Hey, even Brits measure distance in miles, in some instances, but certainly not in scientific study.



I could be wrong, or are not aware of the sources you are speaking about.  Like I say, I'm no scientist.  But I don't think anyone in any country is doing hard science using imperial measurements.

The last time I had a proper IQ test was in Jr H.S. It was 179. The last time I took the GRE, I scored in the 99th percentile in each section. Today, I would probably score about 50. IQ is supposed to be a relationship between chronological and mental age. If I still had the same IQ I would have the intelligence of someone who has been dead for half a century. That should give you an idea of the value of IQ scores.

I can't remember what mine is but I did the Mensa Test.  The real thing sitting in a lecture hall at Manchester University. I scored above 96% of the population according to their criteria.  It was not good enough as you need to be above 98%.  I was invited to re-sit and I did so, but could not improve my mark.



However my younger son did.  He achieved above 99% which I think is pretty cool.



Having said all that, I don't think for one minute that a high IQ makes a clever person. It is just one ingredient in a whole supper.



EDIT.
I am pleased that I put my specs on for this Q.  It wasn't deliberate, I promise!!!

You can't. Some people think you can exercise it to make it more efficient, such as Dr. Kawashima



However, you lose brain cells every day so your frontal lobe is always getting less 'advanced'.

I would say the Aircraft (Flight).



From the Box Kite of Edward Hargreaves in Australia to the Wright Bros of the USA, it has allowed cheap mass transit of people over long distances in a relatively short period of time.
Developments even allowed astronauts to travel to the moon in rockets and via the Space Shuttle to the Space Station orbiting the earth.
None of these would of been possible without the initial development of flight and the subsequent advancements in design and engine power.



It has also been instrumental in the subsequent Wars from and including WW1.

The Computer
For me it's been great just because of the communication aspect. My son was 4 when I was told he had a rare genetic disorder and would probably die in his teens. The doctors know very little about the syndrome. Not much is in print to be researched. The computer allowed me to create a community of doctors, parents, and caregivers who come together to share information and provide support. I went from being a basket case dealing with this uneducated and alone to having a "family" scattered across the globe who knew how I felt, what I would face in the future and how to help me get things done. The future for us is a lot brighter thanks to this one connection. BTW. My son is now 14 and I feel very confident that he'll be here 14 years from now thanks to this connection and information sharing device.....and many more beyond that

Why does syrup heat faster than water?



I had to a science lab test on what will heat and cool faster syrup or water.



I had to put 100ml of syrup and water in plastic bags and then put them into a beaker with 200ml of hot water (90 degrees C) .  As I recorded the tempature every 2 min. the beaker with the syrup stayed hoter for about 30 min.



Then I had to repeat it with cold water and this time the syrup cooled faster that the water.



Does this have anything to do with the Kinetic Energy of the particles in the syrup.  The lab test is to determine how the temperatures of two different material changes as the absorb and release heat.

<answer>



Water has one of the highest heat capacities (or specific heat) of any compound.  This means that it takes more energy to heat a given weight of water than almost any other material.  Similarly, when cooling down water, water releases more heat than almost any other material.  This means that other materials will heat up or cool down quicker than water, and they will transfer less heat in doing so.



This is one reason why water is an important coolant.



Temperature has to do with the kinetic energy of the liquid particles.  the forces between those particles determine how difficult it is to get them moving more or less (to heat or cool them), so the specific heat has a lot to do with the intermolecular forces between the particles in a substance.  Water has very strong hydrogen bonding for such small molecules, which give it its high heat capacity, high boiling point, high viscosity, and high surface tension for such a small molecule.  Hydrogen bonds are the forces between the plus and minus charges between separate molecules that hold some substances together--they are not "true" chemical bonds.



So basically, in syrup, the molecules aren't holding together quite as strongly, so its easier to raise their kinetic energy--to get them shaking more--than it is with water.  But then it's easier to slow them down as well compared to water.



P.S. it doesn't have anything to do with "releasing electrons".

wind is free and limitless.. there are only some start up costs...
we'll shift to all electric cars... and people will basically drive for free.. heat for free etc.. this will free up tremendous capitol that was once just peed away on oil companys keeping us in the stone age.



another great thing will be in medicine .. we will probably be able to target genetic and viral diseases .. conquoring both.. doubleing the human life span.. some dont see this as a good thing....



robots will begin to assume more and more of the crap jobs of humanity.. every 18 months or 3 years the computers double in capacity .. where it took humans millions of years to evolve.. computers have done it in less than a century.



nano technology will also enable making things out of essentially nothing.. imagine printers that can print out what u want..



nano tech will be used everywhere. medicine and construction.



these are a few things i wish i could be around to see.. but i'm pushing 50 now..  you youngsters are lucky.  50 years from now.. you'll probably be as far ahead as we are from the horse and buggy now.

<answer>



What do you mean by "electron density?"  Each atom has as many electrons as it has protons.  I think you just mean the highest density, as in weight per volume?



Most of the compounds near the bottom of the periodic table have high densities.  Lead, Gold, Iridium, tungsten, mercury, etc.  The next row down is even more dense, but most of those compounds are radioactive and illegal to purchase or own, so you may never get to see them: uranium, plutonium, etc.  There is a little bit of radioactive Americium in your ionic smoke detector, though, but not enough to do anything with.

<answer>



Resisters in parallel follow this equation
(1/Req) = (1/R1) + (1/R2) + (1/R3)



So 1/R = 1/10+1/20+1/20 = 4/20 = 1/5 -&gt; R = 5 ohms

Sure, it's both. Real scientists don't care about creating 'gadgets' to satisfy Hollywood.



Some care about the needs of society and most create and discover with the intent of things being utilized for good purposes. However it's when the concepts and ideas are explained to the sales and marketing people, and politicians and so on, they find the ways to line their pockets and deviate away from the usefulness originally intended.



So, the real hard sciences do impact society, but usually differently than intended. The needs of society, if they are great needs...like drugs for diseases, or ways to clean oil spills caused by drunk captains (e.g. Hazelwood).



For the most part it's a two-way street. It is definitely not one way.

Please, Information is not knowledge. Application of such knowledge - Science  is to up lift human life or to destroy it. The wisdom is required.

I'm a chemist and there are times where I know I'll be generating a lot of smoke, and so as to prevent having to evacuate the entire building, I snap a rubber glove over the smoke detector for the duration of the experiment.  So I imagine a condom would function in the same way.



Just make sure to remove whatever protection you use after you are done "cooking" since it definitely is a real safety hazard.  ;-)

Just take the sensor out of the ceiling. It should either just disconnect or have a battery inside that can be taken out. If there is no battery then there is a fuse that can be removed.
The condom could also work being as you seal it off really tight.



Just be sure when your done to fix things back the way they were. Be extremely careful because if a fire actually does happen to break out while you've fiddled with their system, your looking at a serious law suit. They put them their for a reason... to keep their investment from burning to the ground. So if you've disabled it... it pretty close to the same thing as arson.

B and C.



We assume that the balloon is then under tension, i.e. the rubbery texture of it presses in such a way to increase the pressure. Which is not the case with e.g. a hot air balloon.



The increase of pressure will create heat by adiabatic effect. Adiabatic means; by no other means of heating like a hot air balloon.



The adiabatic effect is also the cause of the cooling of the air as it rises in the atmosphere and the pressure sinks. As it does, humidity in the air condenses and form clouds. Likewise, sinking air and resulting increase of pressure creates heat and evaporates clouds as seen in a high pressure.



The adiabatic effect is also seen in your fridge: A gas is compressed, creating heat, then released through a nozzle, creating cold in your fridge's cold department. People often forget that a fridge creates as much heat as cold. That's why a fridge must always be at some distance from the wall.

Less so than burning coal !
Not only does coal contain sulfur, mercury, lead, etc, it also contains uranium.



Several years ago British Nuclear Fuels Ltd had a boo-boo and discharged 50 kg of uranium to the Irish Sea. Big fooferaw !



To put this into perspective, the government pointed out that
burning the coal in their coal fired power plants released 50 kg of uranium to the environment EACH WEEK !!!
There isn't a very high concentration of uranium in coal, but when you burn millions of tons of it that adds up !

Here is some information I found for you on answers.com. The website path is listed below. Hope this helps!



http://www.answers.com/topic/meltdown



In all of these cases, a reactor meltdown occurs when the fuel assemblies are heated beyond their melting point, which is 1132°C (2070 °F) for uranium. In some cases (such as the Chernobyl accident) this may be almost instantaneous and in others it could take hours or more (as at the Three Mile Island accident). A nuclear reactor does not have to remain critical for a nuclear meltdown to occur since decay heat or fires can continue to heat the reactor fuel assemblies long after the reactor has shut down.

If someone is kicked in the balls... ?



or just generally hurt in the testicles, why do they seem to be pained in part of their torso too?
It's just something I've noticed with people, how would the pain spread though?



</question>



<additional details>



Wikipedia doesn't help because it doesn't explain how the pain may spread.



It must be someting to do with nerves, but why would one place hurt as well as another?

Actually the answer has to do with the nerve supply of the testicles.



When you were growing in the womb, your testicles stated off life in your abdomen. They had a blood and nerve supply from there- very close to your kidneys in fact.  As you grew, they moved south through something called the 'inguinal tract' which is a small defect in the lower abdominal wall.  From there they 'drop' into your scrotum.



The brain does some odd things, and you tend to feel pain from bits of your body that have similar nerve origins, in the same place.  The classic is people who have had keyhole surgery in their abdomen often get pain in their shoulder.  The nerves supplying the top inside bit of the abdomen come from a similar place at the nerves supplying the shoulder.  This is called 'referred pain' and is a well documented phenomenon.



Testicle pain is classically felt in the central abdomen as referred pain.

An investigatory report in science is where you look at the current research of a particular area, and look at the pros's and con's of of differing solutions to particular problems. For example, look at the pros's and con's of different alternative fuels and the viability and the cost effectiveness and efficiencies and difficulties of each of the alternatives.

How might the number of fish and shellfish be different in the Grand Banks area if it had a very narrow continental shelf?



I was thinking that the number of fish would decrease, but shellfish would stay the same.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



A change in the physical environment such as a narrower continental shelf would affect the ecological make up of the area. Any answer would be speculative, but logic suggests that the number of fish and shellfish would decrease as increased wave action would exert more pressures and a harsher environment for the current species of both fish and shellfish currently there. Differing species of fish and shellfish would be possibly more prevalent but you can not say for certain that numbers of both species would decline or increase without study of the new  ecological regime that would be present.

For alternative energy that comes from something that moves like geothermal, hydro, wind, tidal, you say that the stuff flows through a turbine, which has blades like an airplane propeller, and that turns a generator, like the one on your bike that runs the light.  There are several kinds of solar, and some heat water to drive a turbine.  You don't have to explain how solar cells work - you can point to a solar calculator, and say that this patch produces electricity, and it can be done with really big patches.



Fourth graders know how to do math, like multiply and divide.  That's pretty sophisticated.

Iron, no matter how finely divided, will not dissolve in water.  You can stir it all day long, but unless you add something more, it will quickly settle to the bottom.



When combined with a thixotropic clay or if the water itself is made into a gel (gelatin), the finely divided iron powder can be suspended in the water.  The suspension might respond to magnets, but you are unlikely to have a high enough concentration of iron to get a noticeable response.

You have some great questions here.  I will not answer all of them, but I will hit some.



Which type of mirror is better at collecting and focussing light from distant objects and where might you see them used?



A parabolic mirror is best for collecting light from far away sources.  You would find them in reflective telescopes.



For the next three:



Is there a difference in near points for the right and left eyes and if so, why is there one?



Explain the effect of glasses/spectacles on near point.



Why do some people have a far point and others don't?



If you mean the focal point of the eye lense boing near or far, it is due to the shape of the eye and the cornea.  The cornea is a lense that focuses the light coming in at a particular point.  That point should be the back of the eye where the retina is.  If the eye is elongated, the focal point will be too short and if the eye is too squat, the focal point will be too long.  This creates near-sightedness or far-sightedness.  Glasses or contacts add another lense (prescribed exactly for your eyes) to correct the focal point to meet at the retina. With PRK, LASIK, or LASEK, the doctor reshapes your cornea to a new shape to refocus your  focal point.



For the next two:



With peripheral vision, what does the fact that seeing colour comes later after just seeing the object tell us? Why is this important that we see sth before it's colour as well?



Are rods responsible for night vision and why?
Why is it easier to see something in the dark with peripheral vision rather than staring at the object directly?



This has to do with the rods and cones in the eye (retina). The rods are more sensitive to light (night vision) but are not receptive to color. This accounts for the fact that at night, colors do not show well in your vision. The cones are for color vision and are densely packed around the center of vision.  Because of this, you have better color vision where you are looking, and not much color reception in your peripherial vision, and at night, the cones do not help your vision much, so it is not easy to see in your direct vision, but better around it.  When flying at night, aviatiors are taught to constantly scan, that way they can see oncoming lights easier by constantly using their peripherial vision.

the independent variable - the factor that can change; the variable that causes a change to occur in an experiment; item that is being tested; a factor in an experiment that is manipulated or changed by the investigator to observe how it effects a dependent variable.



the dependent variable - what you use to measure; the Variable that might be affected by the change caused by the independent variable; the factor that you measure of observe during an experiment.



the factors that remain the same are constants.

Independent Variable: baseball bat modification



Dependent variable: distance ball travels in the air after collision with bat



Constants: same brand and model of baseball bat, same baseball, same batting tee, same batting device.

independent variable is popcorn type. dependent variable is amount popcorn popped. constants are amount of time given to pop, atmospheric pressure, microwave/method used to pop. You might have a hard time during testing defining the "how much" popcorn is popped.

Nature of environmental science?



1. how would you discuss the nature of environmental science?



2. what's the relationship of ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE and ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Environmental science is the study of the interactions of the physical, chemical and biological aspects of the environment.  Environmental science also deals with the political and economic policies of governments in regards to any issue to concerning the environment, such as water rights, conservation, logging and protection of national parks and world heritage areas.  It also deals with ecology and how differing organisms live in different areas due to climate, water, land variability, and how all those inter-relate to create the natural environment. Environmental science also deals with the human made environment such as pollution, alternate fuels, toxicity of chemicals, how man-made products affect the biology, chemistry and physical environment for plants and animals that live in those areas and what further wide spread affects this has on other environmental areas.



Environmental sustainability is maintaining a relationship between consumerism/industry such as logging or recreation and the ongoing  biological, ecological, chemical and physical environment so that a balance is maintained between the two where human activity and the natural environment co-exist in a dynamic equilibrium or balance. Environmental science is the measuring of how, what, why, where, when, who and all other factors to influence policy and maintain that balance through checks of species, biology, chemical and physical properties by sampling and analysis and environmental impact reporting.

The constellations are made up of many stars, our sun is but one.

Further, it depends on what angle you're viewing from, since the stars are usually quite different distances away. By moving "just" a light year, the constellations would look quite different.

Our solar system has only one star - the Sun. If you move far enough, you will see it next to some other stars. Depending on your position and distance, you might see them forming some patterns. But truth is, constellations are a completely made-up thing. Stars in a constellation have really nothing to do with each other.

I'm not an expert of anything but think it's down to the fact that they assume that they would have colouring that would blend in with the background for the sake of camouflage. Both predators and prey need this. They can figure out what type of vegetation was around at the time from the fossil record. I don't think there's anyway to know for certain but on this basis you can make a pretty good guess.

They actually haven't got a clue.  They also make huge assumptions on the shape of creatures they only have (for instance) the lower left jawbone of too.

The common assumption is that they blended in with their natural surroundings. So any artist impressions of Dinos in a dessert are sandy colored and those in a forest are green and brown. If the dinosaurs behaved and mated differently to to-days species and wanted to be seen and not hide they could have been rainbow colored. Perhaps that is why they are extinct.

Just to warn you, it's different from the television shows that show this so often, so if you haven't you should look into it more. It's also quite popular because of that so there's a lot of competition so at least decent (Cs) grades are needed even at poor universities, better grades for better universities.

Since this is uk.answers.yahoo.com, this is geared towards UK people but some may apply elsewhere also.

It may differ between Unis but most will accept any A-Level subjects for forensic science, as long as you have the required amount of points, whether you need 3 C's for it or 4 A's depends on the Uni though. Related subjects such as Biology and Chemistry are preferred though. Another option is to do a BTEC in Applied Science along with another A-Level or two but some places may not accept that. You also need C in English and Maths GCSEs or equivilent to get into most Unis that I've heard of.

Other than English and Maths the GCSEs don't matter for University, but obviously you need decent GCSEs to get to do A-Levels whether in college or sixth form. What you need for that depends on the college but they'll usually want you to do at least okay in some subject related to the one you want to study, I actually did pretty bad for science GCSEs but got let in because I had an okay Electronics grade, then did really well in college science.

So yeah, in summary, GCSEs at C for English and Maths, A-Levels, preferably some science related but not always at whatever grade the Uni wants, which the lowest I know of is 3 C's.

It would have to be some form of logic based upon a system of operatons within the framework of quantum mechanics, not logic based upon our current realm of classical physics.  It would involve the knowledge and reason behind a theory of everything, a TOE.  We know that, unlike the laws governing Newton's classical physics, the quantum world, the very fabric of the universe, isn't restricted by the limitations of our classical understanding of reality.  Of course, such logic would change everything and permit "reason" on a far, far grander-scale. The difference in the mechanism of the two forms of logic would be similar to the difference between the power of digital computers verses that of a true quantum computer---an infinite difference.

Once born you need an injection if your baby's blood group is positive.  My son was same blood group as me so no further action taken.

They say that necessity is the mother of invention; but has anything ever been invented before it was needed?



I can think of a few examples, but i am looking for more:
Riemann geometry: invented in 1854 but not used until applied to Relativity by Minkowski in the early 20th century
Boolean logic: invented 1847, but not used until the computer age.
Stirling engine: invented 1817, but only now coming into its own as the prime mover in domestic combined heat and power schemes.

Two of these are mathematical tools, and so might not be classed as real "Inventions". The third hasn't really taken off yet. Has anyone got any better examples of a "Motherless invention"?

I recently read in a book that penicillin was discovered by accident about 30- 50 years before Fleming was credited with it, but no use was found at that stage, and the original inventor never patented it, and died in poverty.

Can't remember the details, but the book is soucred below, and is (funnily enough!) a "quite interesting" read.

All the best

"Motherless invention"; what a lovely expression!

How about holograms?

"Holography was invented in 1947 by Hungarian physicist Dennis Gabor (Hungarian name: Gábor Dénes) (1900–1979),[ work for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971."(Wikipedia), but it didn't become really useful until the development of the laser, and of refined multilayer printing techniques, one of which is necessary to make the method useful.

A.C. Clarke invented the concept of the communications satellite in  geostationary orbit decades before rocket technology developed to the point of launching them.

The rectifying vacuum tube, forerunner of all modern transistors and computer chips.

Edison invented and patented the tube, noting it's properties, but not recognizing its potential and then put it on the shelf.  Years later it was adapted in early electronics to amplify signals - enabling the radio to convert weak modulated radio waves into full, rich sound with a volume control.

Well, they can be stored without "paper", they are stored digitally these days. In advanced surgeries anyways...



And a normal digital camera takes a picture, it doesn't emit radiation. You need a pretty damn good hard wired safe piece of equipment with radiation inside that emits just the right amount to take an x ray and not make you infertile.

Digital cameras are not responsive to x-rays, only to the visible light spectrum.  You would need to invent some kind of chip that would be able to use x-rays.

BTW, after xray film is developed, the images are usually converted to digital format and stored electronically.

It's a matter of cost.

It's a system where the x-rays are taken in the normal way, and I assume you don't mean that the x-rays are taken WITH the digital camera.........no....the x-rays are only taken with a machine made for taking x-rays.

Anyway, once the image is taken, it is sent [digitally] to a display where it can be viewed, saved or whatever as any digital image would.

This set-up is much more costly than a standard x-ray machine because you have the added cost of the digital image capturing/manipulation hardware.

There are digital X-rays.  Just as film can be made sensitive to different EM wavelengths (infrared, visible light, ultra violet, and x-ray)  so too can digital imaging chips. My dentist takes digital xrays.  The image chip is placed in the mouth just like the film was and the X-ray is shot and captured instantly and stored digitally.  They can be printed for hard copy records

Film and Chemicals are expensive consumables, and can only get more expensive.  Digital imaging gets cheaper and cheaper.



And so film X-rays may become a thing of the past very soon.

They live in the Arctic (not the Antarctic) but they don't really have homes for most of the year: they simply wander around looking for food.  When they hibernate, they dig a hole in the snow in which to sleep: this is also where females give birth to their cubs, and where the cubs live for the first few weeks of life.

Biological weapons are weapons that act on the person causing great damage and even death. Most work on the nervous system while others work on the muscles causing the heart to stop or the muscles to spams so harshly that you break your own back. The first use of bio weapons was by the Romans who would toss dead horses into sedge cities spreading a hoard of disease. The first use of gas was in WW1 where both sides used a lot of nerve agents. These were shot from cannons and sometimes dropped from the air.

Biological weapons employ deadly virus, bacterial, or radioactive materials to kill large numbers of people. These materials can be distributed by explosion of even by simply exposure to a carrier person if the organism is contagious. I do not think thes weapons have ever been used by one government against another, but it is fairly certain that such weapons or materials have been developed and do indeed exist.

The answer is that you can't measure it. Because if two apples are always two apples, even if one is twice the size of the other, two inches are never exactly two inches. The more you zoom in with more precise measuring instruments, the more you can note a slight difference. And you can do that all the way to the molecule, the atom and the particle level; at which you meet the Quantum principle of uncertainty: An electron is not spinning around an atom nuclei like a moon around a planet, but is rather a cloud of possibilities.

What most people call 'tin foil' is actually aluminum and is of fairly high purity. Aluminum oxidizes quickly on exposure to air, so the surface is aluminum oxide, which doesn't conduct as well, so be sure to get a good electrical connection by soldering.

So called "tin foil" is actually aluminum. A closer representation to tin would be a soup can. Though I'm not positive that cans are actual tin anymore either.

At the time of the Big-Bang, all energy and matter occurred, is conserved, and is pretty much equally divided between mass and gravity. According to Einstein's General Relativity, time is a scalar field (having magnitude but no direction) which exists everywhere in the universe as one whole event.  What we humans think of as time is just what we have worked out for ourselves so that a dynamic universe makes sense to us.  Now one may ask, if time does not change, what accounts for aging, for system deterioration?  Energy and entropy does.  In nearly all living systems, they always start out as a tiny cell high in energy and very low in entropy (a measure of disorder) and then continue to grow. As the cell grows, its energy decreases and its entropy increases until a stage of equilibrium occurs where energy = entropy and their exists no heat difference; thus, death.



The laws of physics has built in natural cycling systems to take care of events like aging and system deterioration. We humans, over a very long period of time in our evolution have come up with the idea of "time" in order to better understand our world and universe.  Einstein himself said that time was just a persistent illusion.

For us believing physicists, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubborn illusion.")

<answer>



Time, in the essence of days, months, years, etc., is created by man based on the relation between the sun and the Earth. We measure years by the time it takes the Earth to orbit the sun, and days as being the time it takes for Earth to complete a full rotation. If we want to define "time" as simply that, then of course it has been created by man.



But in astrophysical terms, time has to be real. It always takes a certain amount of time for anything, even a particle, to move from one place to another.



If a particle stars out on (-1,-1) and then moves to (1,1) on a graph, it isn't going to move instantaneously. It cannot exceed the speed of light. It even takes light a certain amount of TIME to move from one place to another.



Time is utilized thousands of equations.



F = ma (force equals mass times acceleration). Acceleration is a unit of time and distance (m/s^2). So obviously time is needed for this equation to work.

No, or else we wouldn't age, the sun wouldn't rise and set - if time wasn't passing, we would also never be late for an appointment.



The "feeling" of time however is another thing. If you're bored it may feel like it is passing slower than it actually is, where as when you are having a good time, it feels really short, hence the expression "time flies when you're having fun"

and just "chemistry"



and just "biology"
and just "biochemistry"



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Just "chemistry" "biology" or "biochemistry" are likely liberal arts courses as opposed to engineering courses.  Liberal arts courses often lean toward research type jobs while engineering leans toward practical applications.  As such engineers study the basics of physics, chemistry and advanced math but also must study the basics of mechanical, electrical, aeronautical and other fields of engineering that may be involved in a major project such as building a chemical plant.  Liberal art chemists would likely study the chemical processes used within the plant (with much less regard for the required machinery).

when you first start pouring there is lot of air to vibrate with making a high sound but as more is being poured in there is less air to vibrate with and that is why the sounds goes from high to low because of the decrease of air to make noise.

After age 50 or so most people lose the ability to focus their eyes on close work.  The simple mitigation is reading glasses, or bifocals or lasik/contacts that correct one eye for close vision and the other for distance - sacrificing good stereo vision.



But I want to be able to read a menu in a dark restaurant, thread a needle, see the text message on my phone or peruse the paper without holding at arms length and without artificial lenses.  I want my eyes to work as they did when younger.



So a drug or therapy that would restore the natural flexibility of the eye-lens would be fantastic.

1) INCREASE (the higher temperature of the solution increases the movement of the molecules causing them to bump into each other more and more creating a faster reaction)



2) TRUE (the more concentrated a solution the more reactions are occuring because the molecules are packed closer together and are forced to bump into each other more oftern, cuasing the concentrated solution to react faster with the material)
3) FALSE (a catalyst continues to work even when it is used up because the reaction will continue to be affected and react at the increased rate)

How Would I Work Out This Average Speed?



My Science homework is based on pills. And which is the quickest to travel down your throat! Im so confused & iv'e lost my sheets. Its the holidays so its not like i can ask for help & its due for the day i go back! Someone please help! & answer it as easy as possible so i understand.v



Question:



So i have three numbers.



1.) 3.46 seconds
2.) 3.56 seconds
3.) 3.37 seconds



These 3 times are all for one shaped pill that i tested.



So how would i work out the average to these three?



I have 3 more of these but i want to work them out on my own!



Thanks Alot!

<answer>



If I understand your question, Its:
Three pills each travel at different speeds, what is the average of all three?



If so, then add all three times together:



3.46
+3.56
+3.37
--------
10.39



Then, divide by three.



10.39/3=  3.463333333.........

The effect one sees is mainly caused by interference between reflected rays. It's similar to the colors of soap bubbles or the light reflected on an oil layer.



Some colors are enhanced because the reflected rays for those wavelengths are in phase

Think what a forensic scientist is responsible for.  Your evidence may decide questions of guilt and innocence in a court of law.



If you are worried that it may be "too hard", are you sure that you are up to this level of responsibility?

Since scientific evidence includes anything that could be demonstrated to actually exist or happen, the evidence you have is not scientific - which means it's not real.  It doesn't count as evidence to anyone but you.  And no, there is no evidence for any god.

<answer>



I depends on what you mean by 'Scientific' and what you mean by 'existence'.



God absolutely exists in our language, our culture, our minds, and our very consciousness.  The evidence of such existence is pervasive and compelling.  We absolutely can scientifically measure how God exists in this way.  But we cannot measure God in the same way.



In science we infer the existence of the unseen and unobservable from what we can observe and measure (read anything current about quantum physics).  It is a leap of faith when we say with certainty sans proof that If 'a' and 'b' are true, so must be 'c'.  The counter-inuitive theory of relativity is a classic example of such a leap of faith.  Decades later, when we had the ability to measure 'c' - faith became proven fact long after it was accepted fact.



So in science, we don't ask the question:- "What is the evidence of the existence of God?"  We ask "Why is there a belief in God."



An answer to that question may not prove or disprove the existence of God.  But it would inform those that have trust and faith in things not directly observable and measureable.  That should be everyone - The devout scientist seeking a more informed truth and the devout believer seeking a more informed understanding of a higher power.

There ain't none.  That's why they call it faith.  If you have evidence, then there's no room for faith.
There are many responses to the question 'do you think god exists?'
The religious response is 'yes'.  The atheistic response is 'no'.  The scientific response is 'that's a silly question...'



jehen:
"God absolutely exists in our language, our culture, our minds, and our very consciousness. The evidence of such existence is pervasive and compelling. We absolutely can scientifically measure how God exists in this way."
Give me a break.  By this reasoning, unicorns and leprechauns exist too, because we have words for them and mental ideas of them.  A definition of existence that allows anything you can possibly think of is a pretty useless definition, don't you think?

Therefore, it follows that all gleeps are gracks.  No 'proof' and no faith needed, it's simple logic.



"The counter-inuitive theory of relativity is a classic example of such a leap of faith. Decades later, when we had the ability to measure 'c' - faith became proven fact long after it was accepted fact."
No it isn't.  The empirical work of Lorentz and Poincare came BEFORE the theoretical work of Einstein.  Which, by the way, has yet to be 'proven'.  Study the definition of scientific theory and scientific proof.  At any rate, you are trying to equate this with people 'believing' in relativity for no good reason at all, and then it was later 'proven'.  This is wrong no matter how you slice it.



"But it would inform those that have trust and faith in things not directly observable and measureable. That should be everyone - The devout scientist seeking a more informed truth"
No, in an ideal world, that should be *no one*.  Science, at least, REQUIRES that we do not have faith in things not observable.



"understanding of a higher power."
What higher power?  Science requires us to study whether or not a phenomenon exists before we attempt to understand it.  If you have already admitted that the source is unobservable, this removes god from science.



ernairnp:
"A belief in God is a must to have good mental health.



The code of conduct like ten commandments are traffic rules of social behaviour. One must follow such rules of any one well established relegeon to avoid social accidents.""



Total crap.  The rules of the bible advocate slavery, stoning of disobedient children, and most of the 10 commandments themselves are irrelevant.
Yes, it's necessary to follow a 'social contract' for us all to cooperate.
No, it's not necessary for that to be based on religion.  In fact, it appears counterproductive, belief in god seems to go along with social dysfunction.  It's a fact that the religious are more likely to go to prison in america than atheists.  It goes a lot further than that.



I'll let a quote say it for me:
"The level of atheism throughout the rest of the developed world refutes any argument that religion is somehow a moral necessity,



Countries like Norway, Iceland, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom are among the least religious societies on Earth.



According to the United Nations’ Human Development Report (2005) they are also the healthiest, as indicated by measures of life expectancy, adult literacy, per capita income, educational attainment, gender equality, homicide rate and infant mortality.



Conversely, the 50 nations now ranked lowest in terms of human development are unwaveringly religious.



Other analyses paint the same picture: The United States is unique among wealthy democracies in its level of religious literalism and opposition to evolutionary theory; it is also uniquely beleaguered by high rates of homicide, abortion, teen pregnancy, STD infection and infant mortality.



The same comparison holds true within the United States itself: Southern and Midwestern states, characterized by the highest levels of religious superstition and hostility to evolutionary theory, are especially plagued by the above indicators of societal dysfunction, while the comparatively secular states of the Northeast conform to European norms.



Of course, correlational data of this sort do not resolve questions of causality--belief in God may lead to societal dysfunction; societal dysfunction may foster a belief in God; each factor may enable the other; or both may spring from some deeper source of mischief.



Leaving aside the issue of cause and effect, these facts prove that atheism is perfectly compatible with the basic aspirations of a civil society; they also prove, conclusively, that religious faith does nothing to ensure a society’s health."

Every created thing around you is evidence for God--the plants, the animals, the stars...everything.



If you've ever studied a cell's intricate inner workings, including the way DNA replicates and codes for proteins, you'll see that it is fantastically designed and organized, and there's no way that it could have happened by chance.  It took a mighty and wise God to make it.



Check out verse 20 in the second link below (as well as the entire passage).  One example of God's invisible attributes that is evident in creation is his trinitarian nature--He is three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  All of creation consists of three parts:  time, space, and matter/energy.  Each of those parts has a trinity.  Time has past, present, and future.  Space is three-dimensional.  And so on.



We know that matter and energy can not be created nor destroyed, but can only change forms.  All available energy is decreasing, while entropy is increasing.  It took God, who is eternal, and has all power, to create the original universe with its matter and energy--where did the all the matter and energy come from?  God.  (I'm not referring to a so-called "big bang.)



Look up in the sky at night--the stars speak of God's glory.  So do the sun and the moon.



The bottom line is, everything He made speaks of Him.

you have to realize how the rocks are made.  Metamorphic is created from other rocks under pressure.  Sedimentary rock is made up of silt, organisms that have died, etc. (example is coal or shale).  Igneous rock is created from Magma.

it would surely be igneous rocks because magma is also called lava when it comes out from earth and when lava cools down it will form igneous rock and metamorphic rocks are modified igneous rocks

<answer>



Various people who have found themselves in isolated areas have reported seeing 'Little Green Men'.  Most often this is associated with the sight of UFO's, implying that the little green men were aliens.  As the men were animal like and had no fine discernable detail on their bodies, the greenness was probably not skin but simply clothing.  The men are also reported as having large heads and large eyes, but the lighting at the sightings is usually of poor quality, like it being night-time and too many bright lights.
You will note that history holds record of reports of little green men.  Folklore speaks of elves in the woods.  Also the Irish leprechaun is, I think, a small green man.  Though perhaps the man was preserved in alcohol, that is, the viewing Irishman was preserved, not the leprechaun.



Whatever these events mean as hallucinations or as sightings, the little green men do not stick around (parking fines?) but rapidly skedaddle away.  Their fast evacuation when confronted by a human is a prime indication that we may be dealing here with something that is intelligent.  Man has often hoped to meet a more softer, gentler and smarter creature than he, from the stars.  As the angels who fly and the gods who thunder have never stuck around for long either, we must expect that there might be something wrong with us.  It could not be violence, for we have only exterminated some thousands of species that differ to us, and some hundreds of millions of fellow humans that we did not like the look of either.



Anyway, looks are no guarantee of anything.  Just because little green men are green, doesn't mean that they are environmentalists.  Just because they are little, doesn't mean that they are not meaner than us.  Just because they have big heads doesn't mean that they have a more swollen head than us.  They could have just dropped down to get a few plants for cooking.  Leprechauns are always up to some mischief.

We are pink and our blood is red because of the iron content in it.  A green man (possible from the pages of a book) is a man whose blood uses another metal in the blood that might carry something other than oxygen as an oxidizer that is used to metabolize energy or has a totally different way of releasing energy from food.  On this Planet at lest, not likely.  Who knows what evolution has produced else where in the universe, non carbon based life?  Never say never!  Other than this i don't know, have not meet any.

yes my dear your house is haunted. children are very sentive to this so when you found your child in your bed its because he didnt want to share his room with a aberation.it may have scared him as well.



it wouldnt be a bad idea to have your preacher come over and bless your house and put a cross in every room. if your child was afraid of this ghost it may not be a nice one.



i am very sentive to ghosts and have seen my share. but i have never been afraid of them.
they have  always been good like angles watching over me so i am at ease with them around me.
my daughter had an experience when she was a young teenager when she saw our dogs toy rope floating down the hall way in our home. it landed on the heater vent near the dog and the dog got up and circled it keeping about 2 feet from it and when casper was done with it the dog picked it up... i explained to my daughter it was just casper wanting to play with the dog and as soon as casper moved away from the rope the dog picked it up and was ready to play tug of war...
my daughter was at ease then knowing it wasnt a mean ghost but rather an angel letting us know he was there and watching over us. playing with the dog was just a bit extra showing off... LOL...
silly ghost.



it would be wise to sit down with your child and read him a book . i recomend "casper the friendly ghost" show him pictures of different ghosts and maybe look up the history of the house your living in... get photos of the people that lived there and show them to your son as well and if any of them look familier to him he will point them out to you... then you will know for sure who it is and if they are nice..

Ghosts dont snore , they mostly moan and slam things if they are going to make noise at all. Supposedly, if you want to get rid of a ghost you put your shoes at the foot of your bed pointing in opposite directions for several nights in a row and this pisses them off and they leave, or so I was told. Also, sprinkle salt on the floor and they count all the grains during the night, but since they can't count that high they have to keep starting all over. Not sure if this really works, just what I've been told.

I do believe in ghosts (spirits). Not the Casper type but the human type. Ghosts gets classified in different groups. I believe ghosts can make any sound they want and move objects just as they want.



They say it works if you hit the ghost with a white cloth. Then they go away. When you are near a ghost, you will feel his presence.

Ghosts do return. But they dont talk or interact. You would find them looking at you and then they will disappear. Jins do exist and they have ability to overpower humans. Some are good and some are devilish.

Yes. They are capable of all of these functions but only with a person whose mental psyche is in tune with the appropriate spiritual realm.

Biological weapons are weapons that act on the person causing great damage and even death. Most work on the nervous system while others work on the muscles causing the heart to stop or the muscles to spams so harshly that you break your own back. The first use of bio weapons was by the Romans who would toss dead horses into sedge cities spreading a hoard of disease. The first use of gas was in WW1 where both sides used a lot of nerve agents. These were shot from cannons and sometimes dropped from the air.

<answer>



Biological weapons employ deadly virus, bacterial, or radioactive materials to kill large numbers of people. These materials can be distributed by explosion of even by simply exposure to a carrier person if the organism is contagious. I do not think thes weapons have ever been used by one government against another, but it is fairly certain that such weapons or materials have been developed and do indeed exist.
These weapons are classified as "Weapons of Mass Destruction" or WMD. Another WMD is the atomic(fission) bomb  and hydrogen (fusion) bomb. Atomic bombs were used by the United States to vaporize the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to force the surrender of Japan at the end of the world war 2. Although these bombs are WDM, they are not biological.

<answer>



Biological weapons are toxic materials produced from pathogenic organisms (usually microbes) or artificially manufactured toxic substances that are used to intentionally interfere with the biological processes of a host. These substances work to kill or incapacitate the host. Biological weapons may be used to target living organisms such as humans, animals or vegetation. They may also be used to contaminate nonliving substances such as air, water and soil.

There ain't none.  It's all anecdotal.



No, the universe is not infinite and even if it was, there's nothing about that which says they should exist somewhere out there.
We have no evidence that they do exist, and we know of no principle which would prevent them from existing.  So whether they exist out there, somewhere, is unknown.
Whether they exist here, visiting us on earth is all a bit silly to me.  Notice they always report aliens who look like us?  Bipedal, about the same height, two eyes, a mouth, finger and toes...  How incredibly unlikely is that?  Look how different you are from a lobster, or an orange.  And you and a lobster and an orange all share a family resemblance since you all developed on the same planet from a common ancestor.  Now imagine how different an alien who developed on a completely different planet would look?  And people report aliens who not only look like us, but are comfortable walking around in our gravity, our atmospheric pressure, our sunlight spectrum, our air, our temperature, etc?  Gimme a break...

Us.  The fact that life evolved here on Earth is the best evidence we have that it could have happened elsewhere.  But there is no evidence at all that aliens are visiting us.  The plural of 'anecdotes' is not 'data'.

Consider the fact that there are around 750,000,000,000,000,000 solar systems in the universe. Do you really think we are the only life?



Roswell is crap. For god's sake, they test airial prototypes at Area 51. Of course you're going to see some UFO's. Aliens have not been visiting Earth, trust me.

well...motivation, a good idea  intelligence and commitment, and most importantly...a good Patent Attorney, inventors will get nowhere without patents and you need an attorney to see if your idea has been patented already. Unfortunately the software costs about $40,000 a year so you can't do it yourself.

<answer>



An inventor should be familiar with patent laws to claim priority (who invented it first) and how to protect an invention (pen & ink sketch signed and dated by a witness, etc.) and should know that patents may be applied for in  one or more countries.  Knowing the law will help you consult with a patent attorney on a timely basis.  Also there are different requirements for novel 'designs' as opposed to novel inventions (perhaps a novel shape for a fishing knife handle).  Also many inventors go directly to market without a patent.  If they can get there first with an inexpensive attractive product it may not be worth the trouble for someone else to compete.  A patent allows you to sue in court but may not avoid suits.  One must be careful to not infringe other patents.

How and why does water put out a fire?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Fire needs three things in order to burn. It needs fuel, air, and heat. Water also needs heat in order to evaporate (that is turn to steam). So, when you throw water unto a fire, it takes heat from the fire as it turns to steam. If the water can take enough heat from the fire, then the fire will go out. Additionally, if you put enough water on the fire (i.e. you submerge the fire in water), then the water also cuts off the air supply thereby putting it out.
