I dont think we will have to worry about it. All this science behind global warming there is no science. The earth just goes through a 12,000 year cycle. So the polar bears are still going to be there unless some biblical pleague were to happen.

Its good that your sad, it sounds like you loved her alot and she deserves to be mourned for and remembered. Even though you couldnt bury her in your garden perhaps you could make a special plaque on a stone paver with mosaic or paint it on wood or have a picture set in acrylic to glue onto one (you can get the stuff form spotlight and craft stores) to put in her favorite spot or yours to remember her by and light a candle and write a poem so you can have a memorial with your family and anyone who knew her. Then have a good cry, you need to get it out. Remember everything that lives must die and it sounds like she had a lovely life with you and a good long one really too! You will know when you are ready to get a new pet, dont rush into it, when you are ready to look again and look forward to making a new friend and getting to know a new rabbit go look, you will never replace her but you can have a new wonderful relationship that will fill some of the emptiness you feel and take the edge off the loneliness.

My does my bunny attack other bunnys?



My neighbour just got a baby female bunny who's half mini lop. She is still very young and very small compared to mine. So i brought my rabbit over to my neighbours back yard and we put both of them on the grass then my rabbit went straight for my neighbours bunny and started attacking hers, scratching it,and biting it and tackling it accross the yard. Would you know why she does this?
i don't think it would be a territorial thing because my rabbit was in another rabbits territory, not her own.

She could be showing dominance over the young rabbit, or she might be competing for your attention if you are giving the younger one more attention in other words your rabbit might be getting jealous. But i would say its probably just showing her dominance.

Female rabbits(Does) are often as aggressive as bucks(male rabbits) to unknown rabbits,Introducing does together can be very difficult.



It doesn't really matter where she is(whether is your garden or someone Else's.) As your bunny is older she wants to stay "Top Dog" i bet you probably spoil her(nicely),so she doesn't want an intruder bunny taking her place. I couldn't introduce any Grown up rabbits back to their mum now,as she wouldn't recognize them.



Rabbits are very territorial animals,so unfortunately thats the way it is,in time & Patience you might be able to get them like best friends,though i may take up to 6 months to a year.



Some rabbits just never hit in off with one another.



Thanks,xxx



EDIT



To stop her being mean to your neighbors rabbits,spaying her should help & possibly cure it.
Though another way,is for both of you to sit somewhere with each of your rabbits on your own laps,& restrain your one,as normally they won't harm one another on your laps.



Do this every day,for 1-2 weeks then when they are slightly more knowing of each other,place them both of a table indoors,& put some feed out,or distract them with treats,Really this could take a while,though if your prepared go for it!



If you need any more info either Email me or post some more!

Horrible Flea Infestation In House,Yard,Dogs AHHHH!?



I have always had a few indoor pets my entire life, I have never had a flea problem like I do now. I have bombed and shampoo with zero results. One big problem is money, this economy is killing me right now. I know I probably need Frontline, advantix etc. but my dogs are 8lbs, 25lbs and 60lbs! What a weight range huh? They are miserable, my kids are miserable, I don't know what to do! When I flea bathe the dogs the next day I check and it looks like they have never received treatment, the foggers seemed to leave all soldiers alive, I am desperate! Any help out there would be appreciated!!!

You need to do a spring clean. This means bathing and flea combing all the dogs together at the same time. All bedlinen and towels need to be washed at a high temp and while that's happening you need to shampoo and hoover all carpets and mats in the house to as hot as you can get it and also immediately change and wash all clothes you, your kids ect have been wearing while cleaning. Steaming matresses is also a good idea. Any soft material headboards ect. Anything fleas can live in. Keeping the dogs in a room you've just de-fleed also stops them being recontaminated via flees living in carpets ect while you continue to clean. Do all clothes washing ect and do not place unwashed linen near newly washed overwise it'll just start over again.



Flee treatments are expensive but I'd say in this case it would be worth investing in the Frontline product as your situation is sever.



Hope things work out and you get the problem under control.

there are 2 ways that will work one that is guaranteed the last one i am yet to test. there is a product at most "ranch stores" if your familiar such as CAL Ranch or Tractor supply company. look for a product called "diatenatious earth" its a very fine red powder, keep your pets out of the area, for instance get them to a knock off pet store for a flea dip, and rub in the powder into the carpet, wash all clothes and sheets etc. the last and lest costly yet untested is borax bleach, its in wal mart called "eighteen mule team" again rub it into the carpet and flea dip the pets and wash clothes.vacuume up the first powder after 3 days and vacuume up the borax in 24 hrs so all and all the borax is faster and cheaper

Is there a difference in wild rabbits and domesticated rabbits as far as their coloring is concerned?



I have been finding this rabbit hiding in my front bushes. He doesn't seem to be like other rabbits when they run away. I'm wondering if he is lost or domesticated. Not sure if I want to get too close though (well he won't let me really) He's black and brown. People are telling me wild rabbits are only gray

Wild rabbit come in all shades of dark brown to light brown to grey. However one main thing about them is that they all have speckled, or agouti, fur.
Like in this picture: http://www.worldwidehealth.com/ecards/63...



Domesticanted rabbits are usually solid in colour, but some variations can be agouti, so it is really hard to say. Could you maybe get a picture of him? His body shape might indicate which species he is.

He could be a domestic pet who was either dumped/let go to fend for himself (believe me, it happens more than you know), or an escapee whose owner is most likely looking for it. Wild rabbits (cottontails) are either grey or brown; as they are prey animals, they have colors that mimic the landscape as a natural camouflage. You may want to place an ad in your local paper or on such a place as Craigslist describing him, and see if anyone will claim him. In the meantime, you can try to lure him with rabbit food or greens into a secure enclosure, such as a large dog crate. If he is a domestic bunny, he is in extreme danger of predation by a wild animal, and can also succumb to the elements. Unfortunately, domestic rabbits do not have the capability to fend for themselves for too long in the wild. If you catch him and nobody claims him, consider taking him to the nearest no-kill shelter; they will find him a good home.

Wild rabbits are rarely solid colours or fancy ones like pet rabbits but they all originate from the same wild rabbits so carry and can be the agouti colour you are describing which has chestnut, and blue varieties so it could be wild or a pet, even if it runs away, take a photo and put it up on a local noticeboard. See if you can coax it with some food and water, a wild rabbit will not risk it but a pet would, a pet rabbit willnot survive long alone, it will not have a burrow or family and something will eat it or hurt it.

Kittens are hot and cold.  Sometimes, depending on the kitten's personality, they can be extremely intimidated by the size of another animal, like a dog.  If the dog is on the large side, the kitten may love playing with it's tail, but that doesn't mean it has a perception of just what he's playing with or how large the animal he's playing with is.



He'll eventually adapt.

the kittens probably aren't as afraid when his back is turned and they see it as the perfect time to pester him. Its cute...but when your dog moves or faces them, they get scared becuz they have been spotted lol they may not be 100% sure of him yet so they are just being careful but if they are being playful, they will soon realize he wont hurt them

He's playing and practicing his hunting/attacking techniques.



It's perfectly normal, it's what he would have done with his litter mates.  If your dog tolerates the play, let them get on with it.  If your dog gets bored of the play, he will tell the kitten off, and the kitten will have learned another lesson its young life.

My dog´s name is TILK.It takes after Teal´c from Stargate.When he was a very little puppy he had a white mark on his forehead and we were just watching Stargate and said: look,the doggy looks like him! And he´s been TILK since then,spelt different though.
Just look at your pet,and I´m sure you´ll find the adecuate name for it.Don´t need inspiration,I´m sure about it.Look at its movements,behaviour and looks and you´ll find the perfect name.

We've now got two cats called Max and Benny.
In the past I've had mice called General Mogadishu, Barbara Cartland and Isadora Duncan, hamsters called Fluffy and Hammy, a duckling called Ducky, chickens called Maximilian and Georgina, dogs called Shep, Benny and Sally, and other cats called Bluey, Rosie and Melanie. Hope that helps!
Think best thing to do is look at your little beastlet and you will know the name, it just comes. LOL

I have a cat whose name is Thumper, like the rabbit from Bambi. Whenever she jumps down from something, she lands heavily on her feet and makes a loud "thump". We always know where she is though!At least, it's her offical name at the vet's. Usually she is called "mommy's baby" or "baby".

I'm glad I popped up on this question! My sister is a beagle breeder, both 13 and 15 inch pure breds, so I've been around them my whole life. My friend they are great family loving dogs who always want one thing, love. But let me tell the drawbacks you obviously want and need to know. They are one of the hardest dogs to train because of lack of wanting to pay attention. Its mainly because of their nose, they have one of the strongest senses in the dog kingdom, so strong when the get a scent they won't pay attetion to anything else. Get insurance because more beagles get hit by cars because they'll just walk in the middle of traffic without noticing. They have a howl that would out howl a rooster. Get use to that sound. This is all because they are hound dogs. I suggest looking up other hound dog traits. Don't get me wrong I love my beagles, and everydog has its drawbacks. I'm just letting you know this ones...Also their eyes will get you to say yes! everytime haha. They are really cute and pretty dogs. Of course all dogs can be different, just don't support bad habits, train it from the beginning. And I hope you have good luck with POTTY TRAINING. BE PREPARED! Best of luck!

Rats make excellent pets.  They are intelligent and can be taught to do tricks, and they are are friendly and really cute once you get to know them. They live 2-3 years, and get to be about 500 g (17 oz).  They do best in about the same conditions that people like: Not too hot or humid, and not too cold (i.e. no drafts.)  I would suggest you look for a nice large cage with lots of places to climb and hide, and take the rat out of the cage for as long as possible when you're around.

Rats are lovely pets as they tame well and are intelligent. However they do smell so be prepared for that! They need a large wire cage with lots of toys and you must be prepared to handle and play with them. You can buy food at normal pet shops for them If kept indoors they will be fine. hard to describe how big they get really, smaller than a guinea pig but bigger than a hamster normally.
They're not expensive to keep but remember they need food, toys, a good cage and possibly the odd trip to the vet.

Yes rats make a Great pet.



Rats eat veggies-raw or cooked, fruit, cereal -- not sugary or Chocolate, some meat (tiny bit), Especially made for rats products from the store (seeds)
They also need mineral and salt licks from the store to keep them healthy and active.



DONT feed them sugary things , Lolly's,sour stuff (lemon lime)



No they don't need any heating things but it really depends on where you live.
Rats get about the size of a adult hand ( not the width) LOL
The best thing to keep them in would be a cage made especially for rats.They cost about $100 for a good one.
But if you get one with bars in it you have to make sure the rats have a flat surface to walk on because if they are walking on bars all day they will suffer the risk of bumble foot. You cant get rid of it and the rat ends up dying.Would you like to walk on bars the whole day? without shoes? Don't put them in a glass cage because that Is VERY bad for there health too
Before you get a rat i suggest you do a bit of research on them first before you make any mistakes :)
If there's any smokers in the house then put the rat cage in a room where the smokers don't smoke because rats can get VERY sick from smoke.



No there not too expensive.



Hope this helps :) :) :)

You can try insecticides. Get the one where you press the botton then you put it on the ground and leave. When you walk in the morning they should be gone. Unfortunately the body picking up is your part. hehe

Get a gecko or two, they will eat the crickets. Might take them a while to clear a whole garage though. I got sick of crickets escaping from tubs or vivariums so I've employed a little team of house geckos that all they do is run around my house eating bugs n stuff. there were 4 of them but there's quite a few more now :-)

on most of them you will find some good books to read, as well as information. i used to own a rabbit and i bought  a book called 'RABBITS- practical pet care' which came in really handy, i bought it off ebay, but you can probably get it from amazon or any other bookstores (amazon is your best bet though)



there are lots more, i would just type in 'Rabbit Breeders'  on google ask yahoo and msn.



Hope i helped and enjoy !!

Whole body language is tense.  Maybe ears back, tail swishing hard, not necessarily to do with flies, often in a circular movement.  Nostrils flaring despite not being out of breath (but this could mean several things, ie he could be just excited, startled by something, greeting another horse, etc), swinging of legs, eyes rolling/widening, grinding of teeth or snapping and then an out and out deliberate, and usually well aimed kick.  That is the final straw if you have not heeded his previous warnings!



If you are doing something to him that he does not like, you could grab hold of the tail and pull it to one side, not hard but firmly.  It is a well known fact that horses cannot kick while the tail is to one side.

Contact the Denton Humane Society: http://www.angelfire.com/de2/dentonhuman...  Shelters are a great place to do this.  Not only will you get to play with and walk dogs, you will also be contributing to their well-being!  It's very rewarding.  I volunteered for half a day each week when I was in college at a local shelter, walking dogs and giving them basic obedience training, it was a great experience, even if I did want to take them all home!  Good luck!

What if you rigged up an air pump from a fish aquarium inside? I'm building a homemade ant farm and it has enough room to accomadate an air stone. Would that work?

it will work as long as the air can get out after!!

All different places,though primarily,Breeders/Exhibitors.



Our 2 cats were from a rescue center(The Cats Protection).



And some of my gerbils were rescued from a lady who brought them to use as breeding animals & then when they were pregnant she didn't want them,so i took them on & never used them as breeding pets after they gave birth to the first litter.



I would get my next pet probably from a Breeder.

I have gotten my 9 llamas almost all from reliable, knowledgable breeders. The few that I havn't have been quite a handful, but knowing that I'm helping such animals relate into an understanding and cooperative world is very rewarding. There was lots of training involved, time, and patience.



I would suggest that if you are looking to breed the animal further on you ask and research from a varriety of breeders, bloodlines, and offspring.



If you're looking for a pet - get a few vets opinions. Almost all vets that I work with would be happy to give you an honest opinion on behavior, health, and the long livety of the animal in question.



I know people who have dove into the shelter and rescue situation because they thought they were doing a good thing. Sometimes it worked and other times it did not.



Do what you think is right. Mistakes happen - it's the best way that we as humans learn.



I hope I was useful.

feed it hamster food make sure it has water. keeps its cage clean .Get the hamster a wheel if you don't already have one. You can give them an empty toilet paper tube to sleep in and chew it up. they like to make beds and I have always used white clean paper towels for them. get a book from the library to give you more information

You put it in a pet hamster cage, feed it, give it water, and scoop up its poop. You also have to give it new hamster bedding every so often.

I think it's probably the same reason a down coat smells after washing.  Wet feathers - wet fur.

You bathe your rabbit? They generally keep themselves clean, its only their rear end that needs attention really. Not sure I'd advise it! But if he/she doesn't mind, go for it. just dry them well so they dont get cold as it isnt a natural thing for them to do.

rabbits produce a scent, they do this to attract opposite sex, warn of predators, mark territory, etc, anyway when they are washed, all of their natural scent and oils are washed away, therefore their body works twice as fast to make new ones, hence the smell, my advice would be to just wipe your bunny over with baby wipes instead of bathing it, this way it is keeping its natural oils and not feeling the need to make new ones twice as fast, hence, twice as smelly!! lol

its not wise to bathe a rabbit..and definitly not reccomended..rabbits ar able to clean themselves other than the rear end area and that pretty much pertains to long ( angora) haired buns...a good solution would be to trim the area around the buttocks..so feces doesnt build up..
but to answer your question...ever smell a dog after its been out in the rain..its not pretty...buns dont smell that good after being wet either..

My guinea pig shivers when I pick her up? ?



I got a new baby guinea pig about 3-4 days ago. I left it alone for the first few days so it could get use to it's environment. I read on the internet it's important to pick them up and bond with them. When I try to do that my Guinea pig just runs away (and he/she is fast!). Then when I try to pick it up she/he makes little squeaking noises When I pick it up he/she shivers and I get scared b/c I know stress is bad for them.



So I need advice on how to be able to pick her up and should I just pick her up despite the fact that she shivers? Anything else?

I don't really have a guinea pig, but I have a lot of other pets.



For the shivering, maybe it's not yet used to having you around because you left it alone for a few days. Give it some time to adjust to the environment with you as well.



Also, maybe your hands are cold or something. Or maybe it's just scared of you for some animal reason. Maybe it's home sick since you just bought 3-4 days ago.



Just make sure that you give it some time to adjust and feel comfortable. Always bond with it, play games, use the wheel thing, always make sure it has food and water, and that it's place is tidy and safe.

That is a tough one, I mean dogs sometimes give their lives for their owners and maybe the dog saw the shark and intercepted to save his or her owner.



I mean I would do it only if there was a significant chance that both the dog and I would survive. How many people brake for dogs or cats on the road? I see too many of them as road kill. If it jeopardizes human lives then the animal has to go. I won't risk my life needlessly for an animal. Now if it was a human in the road then I would slam brakes but not just because an animal ran in the road. Of course I would yell at the human for not paying attention.



So if I knew I could save both me and the dog then yes. If the shark had begun to tear the dog apart then I'd make for the shore ASAP!!!

Squeaking among baby hamsters is very common. They have just come into the world and are excited about everything they smell around them. It is an equivalent to how a new born human baby cries all the time. Once they are two weeks old, they start maturing and the squeaking would reduce considerably or even stop completely.

yes i agree with hamsterxpert. Plus you have to think as well, if they have literally just been born for a few days/weeks then they will have no eye sight and therefore communicate to each other through squeaking.

That is their language. Just as human babies cry, so other animals have speech that their mother comes to understand. The cries are not only understood by the mother but probably by each of the other (siblings). All animals do this, the sounds are just different.

My 1st pet was a black and white bunny. We couldnt think of name and one day I was looking up at the sky and I saw what looked like a train in the clouds. We called her choo choo and she was so cuddly i would always put her in my "stroller" she would sit in my lap.

I work at a pet store and at an animal shelter. I have talked to a ton of people about this and I have heard a lot of people regret not going and staying with their pet. There aren't a lot of people who regret going. Although it is a sad experience, you want the last thing your animal to see is your familiar face, and feel your familiar touch. not a vet tech that they do not know. But it is totally up to you. the process is quick and painless for the animal so it won't suffer or anything if you're not there. I would recommend going. It will be sad, but you will be glad you did later on.
I'm so sorry about your rabbit.

I had a rabbit named sooty and she was cute but then we had to put her down, If you go, you should say goodbye to her/him and give it its fav food and a big cuddle,think that she will not feel any pain and that if she was alive she might,i know people say think of the happy time but that dose not work for me if your not like me think of the good times,If you are like me, think about when your rabbit was happy (dont think about when it was sad)And you dont have to watch it get put down



If you are not going do the same give her a big cuddle and some off her fav food (you could whisper a something in her ear my bunny loved that) then say your goodbyes and think of something to take your mind off (but u may end up crying at night about how u wish you went so i say you should go) But u choose

Do what feels right for you, your Rabbit will go peacefully whether you are there or not but it could very traumatic for you to go if you are really upset.

I just lost my kitten last week (she was hit by a car) and i am devastated it's like loosing one of the family so i know how you are feeling:(

My kids wanted to say goodbye but i didn't want to take them to the vets so we went to the card shop 'Birthdays' and bought a message to heaven balloon which they fill with helium and a wee poem is attached to the string on which you can write your own message on the back and we let it go in the garden, i feel it really helped them.

Hope you feel better soon, whatever you decide to do x

You know they never really leave the earth till they know your ok, he needs to know your OK..



I sat by your bed last night, I came to have a peep.
I could see that you were crying, you found it hard to sleep.
I squeaked  to you softly as you brushed away a tear,
"It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here."
I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea
You were thinking of the many times your hands reached down to me.
I was with you at my grave today, you tend it with such care.
I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.
I hopped with you towards the house as you fumbled for your key.
I gently put my paw on you, I smiled and said, "It's me."
You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair
I tried so hard to let you know that I was sitting  there.
It's possible for me to be so near you every day
To say to you with certainty, "I never went away."
You sat there very quietly, then smiled; I think you knew...
In the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.
The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning
And say "good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning."
And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,
I'll rush across to greet you and we'll sit, side by side.
I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.
Be patient, live your journey out... then come home to be with me.

Is sad to keep a sick pet because the owner wants to keep holding on. Do whats best for your rabbit, yes death is sad but your vet will do it humanely. Read the "Rainbow Bridge" Poem. I have 11 ferrets at my Rainbow Bridge. I did everything possible to keep my ferrets healthy, and even into their senior years I made sure they were comfortable. I knew when it was time for them to go, and I loved them so dearly I knew I was choosing the best decision for each one of them when I was faced with euthanasia. I keep a scrap book of my dearly departed ferrets but I have so much love for all ferrets, I continue to rescue them and share my life with them. and when their time comes, I will not put my feeling before theirs, because I love them too much.

Ask the vet to come and put Sooty down at home. They should agree to that. If it all happens quietly at home it's much less stressful for everyone.

That way you can say goodbye, but if you don't want to be there at the final moment then that's fine. It is much easier to deal with at home. I always get the vet out and it's much better.

Do you buy medication for your pet on line?



I would never do that, because it hardly ever explains what it contains ("a miracle cure", "cures in minutes", and all that nonsense) They seem terribly expensive. My dog shows signs of ringworm. Plenty of info on the net and it all leads to those "wonder doctors". Or have you had good experiences?

Ring worm is very frequently misdiagnosed because the typical "rings" are usually "epidermal collarettes" which is a sign of superficial bacterial infection (pyoderma) rather than ring worm.

The treatment of ring worm is long (several weeks), costly and may lead to liver toxicity. Therefore, regarding ring worm, I strongly recommend against:
- self diagnosis
- self medicating



My advice is to seek veterinary advice and get a fungal culture done. This, only, will justify any treatment against ring worm (which is a rare disease when diagnosed properly).



It is possible that the vet will spare you the cost of the fungal culture by recognising the superficial bacterial infection. A course of antibiotic may then sort out the situation.

Best wishes and good luck,

Julien

Last year my vet did a fungal culture which was followed by an antibiotics course.
This year symptoms (small patches of thinning hair) seem to reappear and I tried diluted tee tree oil, as recommended by a friend. But I better see the vet again.
Thank you very much for your response.

No, I never would.

The medication could be wrong.

If it it's meant to be prescription from the vet, you can easily overdose or underdose your animal.

Just don't do it, be a responsible owner and take them to a vet.

I have bought flea and tick stuff online with no problems, however, I am not a vet and I don't think I would try to self medicate my pet. It could actually cause more problems if you gave it medicine for something that it didn't have. I think that you should take the dog to the vet. If your worried about cost call the SPCA and see if they can either treat the dog or recommend a cheap vet. I hope this helps!

Is it normal for ferrets to fart ?



my ferret had recently ate some soap so he had some diahreah.. i think he also might have worms as i have caught him eating worms ( by the way what are the symtoms of worms in ferrets?) he has just farted .. and i dont think hes ever done it before.. is it alright ?
and i know its gross, but it was like a liquidy sort of fart, is this to do with his diahrea ? 
i might be worrying about nothing but im just keeping a close eye on him after he ate that soap.

completely fine, it just doesnt happen often, yea its from the diahreah, and just because he eats earthworms doesnt give him stomach worms lol theres a difference between a worm which is an animal and stomach worms which are parasites, if he did have worms he would eat a LOT more than usual and defecate less because worms eat the food their host eats

Are there often so many cold-hearted people in the pet section?



I guess all sections have there problems, but this one is pretty bad. Someone simply asked what they should do if there pet isnt eating, and half the people set put him to sleep (and nothing else, just simply put the pet down, no talk to a vet or anything) or people are just saying get a new pet. Is it always like this here?

More or less.

But then again, people will ask stupid questions like 'my pet isn't eating, what do I do?' Well, if your pet isn't eating anything, you take it to a vet. You shouldn't have to ask.

So really, they kinda bring on the cold answers they get. Anyway, they would have to take the animal to the vet to get them declared ill enough to be put to sleep, so that's a moot point.

Welcome to the internet.

Keep in mind that this is the PET section. Most people here prefer their pets to people any day and aren't going to bother being nice and coddling to everyone with a stupid/ignorant question.

That being said, Yahoo Answer is a free service that does NOT screen any of the people posting. Always get advice from a professional before you take something you read here seriously.

I know what ya mean.  I tire of seeing them "kick it in the mouth"  or"shoot it" as an option.  Dunno if people are being sarcastic or really mean it, but no reason to be so insensitive. That's because sometimes people just are not informed and ask questions that people make think are stupid.  Also, the "Go to a Vet", when typically the person is asking here because; a) they will take the animal to a vet/have an appointment but are curious b) are really unsure about what is going on c) can't afford and are looking for another option to a Vet.  The fact that they are asking means they know there's a problem, and know the animal may need medical attention.  Other reason for insulting messages is the people just want points and don't care how they get 'em.



Sadly, this place doesn't different much from typical message boards that have trolls and rude people.

hello im glad your concerned i hate it i dont understand how people can be so cold hearted if they are going to say stupid crap like that they may as well not say anything at all. 
i read on a post once i just bort a dog but cant look after it how do i 'dispose' of it?  also in the description the guy said should i just tie it on a pole or something? 
i dont understand how people could be so cruel it realy get's to me as i want to be a vet nurse one day soon. i'm still studying though i cant wait to get out there and help the animals out and one day im opening up my own rescue centre for all those animals that get treated badly!
animals dont deserve to be treated the way they do sometime's they dont have a say in it and they can't choose there owners i think its sad :'( 
anyway take care

those are only SOME people.please do not generalize.though it is not much of a help,we mostly suggest to go to the vet if an animal is sick.because you got to admit,what use will we be here?we're not veterinarians and we cannot treat a pet unless we actually see the animal.

we only suggest putting the pet down if ever the animal,from what we read,is in extreme pain and suffering.thus,we consider euthanasia to be given as to ease the animal's suffering.

and from what you have said,an animal that is not eating is in a serious sickness.there is an internal problem with the animal's body if it is not eating at all.

cheers!

Probably just a bunch of trolls at that particular time.. I would say easily most people here recommend bringing a pet to the vet when a question like that is asked and a few more people may elaborate a bit more as to what 'may' be wrong with it along with the admonishment to seek out professional advice. .
Most people accuse those in this section of being meanies because most of us tell people to take their pet to the vet. Then we get the owners that just want someone to wave a magic wand or something and cure their pet over the internet. There have been a lot more questions lately with people asking why everyone just answers 'take it to the vet'. So, I would suspect the question just happened to be posted when more trolls were online.. The Top Contributors here would never recommend that..



Edited to add: I found the question you were talking about, the question said "What to do my pet is dying?" they only added that the pet wasn't eating in the details. That would be why they got a lot of people saying euthanize it.. 
Though, I would think if you believed your pet to be sick and dying that it would be obvious that a vet were in order. I can't see how someone could fail to already know that their pet should see a vet. What other advice could people offer? They don't go into detail about what's wrong with the pet, only that it's dying and apparently they don't want to go to the vet or they would've already..

I want a pig but it has to be small?



OK so I want a little pig for my new house but i want to keep him or her inside but I will bring it outside because I know they like being outside. So the pig needs to like being inside and it has to be small not like huge I know that get small by under feeding them BUT that is unhealthy, so it has to be a breed that doesn't get that big. I know that piglets do not stay that size for ever and I don't want the pig getting so pig that it cant see (i read that somewhere) So basically do you know a pig breed that likes the indoors and does not get to big. Oh and don't tell me like you do not know what pigs are really like.. cause I do I used to work on a farm and I saw how much the pooed and peed and I still want one.

You can get a pot belly pig.  They are not that big.  If you teach him where to poo and pee he will learn fast.  They can be very obedient, sometimes more than a dog.



Another important thing will be to check on his diet.  Just feed him healthy so he will not get fat and ugly.
Best to you.

Yes. I am actually shocked and pretty disapointed that people think that they don't. It has been proven now that fish have feelings and have short term memories, so I think a highly suffisticated mammal such as a cow would have feelings. Feelings are a primitative part of our brain that most animals have (if they have brains, some don't). Feelings are part of instincts as they guide our behaviour. For instance a cow would have to feel scared to run away from a sheepdog or happy to run over enthusiastically when the fresh hay arrives. Cows also are related to wild cattle. Bison for instance must have feelings of love and compassion because they will gang together to protect another if it is being hunted by lions or another preditor. They also must feel anger as they will ram the preditor. They will also grieve for a moment if their calf is killed. Our feelings aren't that complicated, they are based on our instincts too.

Hello,

(ANS) I grew up spending a great deal of my early childhood in North Wales and used to have a lot of contact with our neighbors who were local hill farmers with a large herd of dairy cows.

**Cows should NOT be contrasted or compared to human beings. Cows only have "simple consciousness". Cows have no conception of time, hot or cold, etc.



**No! No! in my opinion cattle (cows) DON'T have feelings or emotions in the sense that humans mean feelings or emotions. Sadly it is human's that project their own emotions onto animals. Its called Anthropomorphism!! i.e. seeing human qualities in animals were non actually exist in reality.

Cows only have basic instinctual reactions, they live in the "now" there is no understanding of a future or a past.

For Example:- Cows only know "Wet" when it rains. NOT how long its been raining or when is it going to stop or blow over,etc.

even as cubs the foxes are instinctively  afraid of humans they are not house trainable and they bloody bite scratch and carry ticks and mights as well as fleas and other dangerous diseases to domestic dogs so you must call the r.s.p.c.a as soon as you find a lone fox cub and leave it be unless it's mother is dead in a ditch somewhere near then intervene otherwise leave well alone

Never knew there was so much lair's on yahoo.

1.Yes you can keep it as a pet if it was kept as a young age i am talking about just about able to eat solid foods.

2. Rabies very tricky going to a vet will not do the shot due to the following reasons you may not be a professional to handle a fox.
But you can but the vaccines for rabies which cost average £45-£65 that is for both shots.
Then all you will need is a needle and you can inject it yourself.

But on the other hand if the fox is at a older age don't touch it call the vets.

I'd argue this with anyone till I'm blue in the face, rats :)
Rats are great fun, you can teach them to do all sorts, and they're smart enough to learn their names. They're good pets for people who don't have enough time for a dog or a cat, I'm assuming that if you're 12, you'll still be in school, so you wouldn't be home all day. Rats like to sleep throughout the day and are most active during the evening. You don't even have to walk them :P
Rats are alot calmer than hamsters and are often better trusted to be sitting on a bed and not run away from you.
Alot of people will say that rats' tails are creepy looking, but they need their tails for their balance.
If you choose to go with these lovely furries, I recommend a same-sex pair, that way they have company while you're out.



With rats, if you want an active and playful pet, a female rat is often better, as they seem to be more energetic in my opinion, anyway.



Male rats are usually more docile and lazy, but they're still great fun :)
Plus, rats rarely bite, unless it's a little nibile if they mistake your finger for a treat! ;)
Good luck!

Its depends how committed you are.



As a dog is probably the best pet you can have,or a cat,they are very sweet,friendly pets!



Or other rodents,such as,gerbils these are intelligent,friendly pets & are easy to care for,or a hamster,though they are mainly nocturnal pets so can be less interesting than gerbils,mice or rats.



It also depends what you like,because lizards are great pets,though they need to be fed Crickets & Mealworms,which some people are put off by.



So,



Dog,
Cat,
Gerbil,
Hamster,
Mouse,
Rat,
Lizard(Bearded Dragon..)



Many pets i would say,if you can't have a dog or cat to get a rodent(like a gerbil/hamster).



Hope this helps & you find a pet that suits you!

<question>



Did you guys know that apparently PETA kills a whole lot of pets? I'm not trying to stir up anything here,?



it was just a big surprise to me that they are so crazy for the proper treatment of animals and they put down A LOT of animals themselves. It all seems hypocritical to me. I never really liked PETA all that much, but this really was the straw that broke the camel's back.



I ran across this link when I was reading a question a person asked about PETA wanting Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream to use breast milk rather than cow milk (which I don't think I would be too comfortable with, I know that it's not a whole lot different, but I just don't like the idea that a woman pumped her breast milk to make ice cream for adults and weaned children to eat, it seems wrong to me).



Anyway, here is the link. I'm sure there are other websites out there, but this is the one I read.



http://www.petakillspets.com/



</question>



<additional details>



I forgot to say this: What do you guys think?



I shouldn't of said proper (thanks abbyful), I should of used their own word: "ethical"



How do they call themselves ethical when they are lying about rehoming animals and killing animals that would make wonderful pets. Even if their goal is eliminate animals as pets, workers, etc, you think that they would do it in a more honest and "ethical" way.



prabhjot: That's why I added the "What do you guys think?" If you would have continued to read instead of just jumping to conclusions, you would have seen that. Get all the details and think before you act.

The PETA supporters will try to tell you that website is false. But those are numbers that PETA themselves turned in to the government.
- 2004 - http://www.virginia.gov/vdacs_ar/cgi-bin...
- 2005 - http://www.virginia.gov/vdacs_ar/cgi-bin...
- 2006 - http://www.virginia.gov/vdacs_ar/cgi-bin...



PETA isn't for *proper* treatment of animals. They are for ZERO human-animal interaction.



No pets.
No service dogs.
No police dogs.
No horseback riding.
No zoos.
No hunting.
No eating meat.
Etc.



Unfortunately, most PETA supports haven't ever researched PETA's true agenda. They just blindly follow them, basking in the warm-fuzzy "we're helping the animals!" feeling; when in fact they are doing the exact opposite that most of them would want.

that website had been spreading around these days.I have read that website numerous times.I,too,am not a personal fan of PETA since then.I see no point in what they are trying to do.If you love an animal,would you want it to be killed or even kill it yourself?That's the problem with PETA,they are too overly dramatic of their ways.But I do not mean to judge them just because of that website,I just hope they change for the better.Their goal is great but the method used for achieving that goal is not okay with me...

Every horse is different. If she stays at a healthy weight on one flake a day, keep her at that. If she requires two, sobeit. Many horses are fine on free-choice hay/grass and no grain, but sometimes mini's can overeat. So if she gets too fat, cut back. You don't want her to get overweight and founder.

Take it to the vet.  Only a vet can save it if it is that sick.  At least call a vet rather than waiting for answers on here.  If it is after hours try a 24 hour animal emergency clinic.  If you call the vet and they are closed they should have a recording to direct you to the correct place to go in an emergency.

Your love for the pet should make you not want to see him suffer. Take the pet to the vet and see what they can do.  If they aren't able to do anything, have him put to sleep. It will be hard but it is what is best for your pet. Good luck and I hope all works out for the best.

I dont know why people are saying put him down, you dont have enough information. Dont listen to all those idiots. Get your pet to the vet now, the vet can run tests to figure out anything for sure.

For now, think of anything that could have hurt your pet (such as a poison). Try to figure out anything that could have possibly happened, however dont deluge your vet with this information. Just have it on hand if the vet needs to ask you more questions.

First of all, I am so sorry about your pet! My Mother just put down our family cat (she was 19 years old) because she was suffering from multiple complications...mostly digestive.

Second, I would take your pet to your family vet. Most vets can help you decide what is in the best interest of the animal. If your pet is not eating and it is still fairly young, I would definately seek the advice from a vet.

Is your pet suffering? Put it to sleep. It may be hard, but put yourself in your pets' position. How would you want something really badly (To be out of any and all pain you may be in) and you can't tell your owner because he/she won't understand you?
Put him to sleep and think of it this way:

Don't think of him as gone away,
His journey's just begun;
Life holds so many facets
The earth is only one.

Think of him as resting
From the sorrows and the tears
In a place of warmth and comfort
Where there are no days and years

Think how he must be wishing
That we could know today,
How nothing but our sadness
Can really pass away.

And think of him as living
In the hearts of those he touched...
For nothing loved is ever lost
And he was loved so very much.

A major problem that need medical attention. Any other symptoms/problems?
To the person who said put the dog to sleep:  Uh why would you do that, you don't even know what's wrong with it? Unless you mean because the person may have a really old animal.  Though, I don't think that is what they meant by the question.
To the others:  Kill the pet? Replace it? Wow, that's bad advice when you don't know what is wrong!  An animal is not a TV or pair of shoes!

I have 13 pets! So it'd be a long list :) But my newest boy is my pit bull pup. We rescued him about 3 and a half weeks ago. He's a mix, but mostly pit, unmistakable head! We named him "Secret Agent Dexter Smith." For short, he is Dexie or Dex. We named him Dexter because we thought it was a funny and smart sounding name, and he is very smart! My boyfriend put his glasses on him one night, and he looked so inquisitive, like a little professor. Dexter. Then Secret Agent Smith came from us singing him that "Secret Agent Man!!" song, and he LOVED it! So we decided he was our secret agent :) Haha.

We also have Reuben, Lucy Taluella Belle, Bazooka, Mocha, Fritz, Margarita, Cody, Scruffy, Cinderella, Fiona, Mr. Bo, and Monty.

I have 3 cats.  One is called Sammy, she's a 21 years old long haired black & white.  My mum called her Sammy because she just like the name. (short for Samantha).



One is called Flower, who's a black Burmese.  HE's called Flower because he was the first cat of a little girl who loved the name.  He actually lives up to his name.  He seems to be a flower power cat, extremely laid back and looks at you as if to say "Hey man!" He's 20 years old.

The last one is the baby.  He's a short haired black and white called Roxy.  He's a very small cat (the runt of the litter) and is 8 years old but looks about 8 months old. We called him Roxy because we thought he was a she when we first had him. He feels he has to protect the whole house which is a lot for such a small cat, cos the others couldn't care less.

Hi, me and my partner have a gorgeous 6 month old male ginger kitten, called... get ready... it's the most original name ever... Thomas!!  No, he's not called Thomas because he's a tom cat, it's because my partner saw the disney film The Aristocats (I haven't seen it), and apparently there is a ginger tom cat called Thomas O Malley. So that's our kittens name, although I only call him by his full name when he has done something wrong.. I usually call him Tom Tom, Tommy Boy, or Sat Nav (because of Tom Tom). He answers to all of them if I have food for him!

Well I really love animals of all kinds and I'm a trainee zooligist. I have a pug dog named Ally, a duck named Ducky (my niece named him) but he can't fly after being attacked by a dog, I have two retired greyhounds, Bobby and Lightning. A snake called Kyla and two ball pythons called Rogue and Rocky. I have a leopard gecko named Frodo - my little brother loves Lord of The Rings and he named him. I also have three bearded dragons. Taii, Willow and Louie. I have 2 chinese dwarf hamsters, Onion and Cheese (after the crisps haha) I also have a fish named Googly and a tortoise called Speedy (ironic)

So yeah I have a lot of pets but they're all properly looked after and they have enough room. I named the all really because I liked the names.

Cat called Grumpy.  When she first moved in, she never purred and although likes sitting on my lap, doesn't want to be stroked unless it is on her terms (usually in the wee small hours of the morning when she climbs onto my chest for an ear scratch and chin rub).  She has been with me a year now and purrs occasionally.  As she answers to her name now, I don't feel the need to change it.

Parrot called Jake because my mom loved to watch the 'Tweenies' and she liked Jake lol

Cat called Maymi. It's my sisters cat and at the time she had her, my sister was always at our local nightclub which was called 'Maymies'

2 Ferrets called Hummer & Diesel because I'd love a 'H2 HUMMER' ( a big 4x4 for people who don't know what one is) Now I can say that I've got a 'Diesel Hummer' LOL

A tortoise called Ethel don't know why I called her Ethel just that it's an old name and tortoises grow really old.

A sprocker ( cocker spaniel x springer spaniel) called Oliver as in 'Oliver Twist'. He'd been abandoned at boarding kennels, rehomed for free to a lady that beat me to him, she then tried to resell him on 'Epupz' for £525. I saw the ad and I contacted the boarding kennels and they fetched him back and brought him to us on new years eve.



The boarding kennels had named him 'Minty' but that's what I used to nick name my dog that I had lost 6months earlier so I couldn't bring myself to call him that, so because of the life he had already lead it had to be 'Oliver'.



What a happy ending to a sad life.

Normally as long as any other Dwarf-Medium sized rabbit.



So, about 6-9 years,though i know a Gentleman who's Netherland Dwarf is 13 years old at present!



As a general rule large-Giant rabbits breeders don't live as long as their smaller companions,about 4-7 years is the norm for these.



As with some dog breeds the smaller it is the longer it lives,though this is not always the case.

They will need shelter,  a penned yard,  grain,  hay and water.  Their hooves need to be trimmed every few months.  A good book would be helpful.  Storey publishing has guides to raising meat goats and dairy goats.  For a pet goat I suspect the dairy goat guide would be better.  If you want to keep angora or cashmere goats I am sure there are guidebooks available.



Columbus day weekend there is a goat school at Stony Knoll Farm in St. Albans,  Maine.  For more info go to mainegoats.com and click on goat school.

Well.. you need to make sure they have a dry, clean, draft free shed. with plenty of room in the shed. and room outside with good fence to protect them from predators. next is good quality hay. depending on what breed and gender.



males/wethers: high quality grass hay. NO LEGUMES



does: highest quality hay you can find. preferably alfalfa, clover hay. etc



They need yearly shots of CD/T. against overeating disease and tetanus. both are a really harsh way for them to die, and very painful. few survive either diseases.
Dosage: 2cc's no matter what age/size.



also depending on wher eyou live. you may need to give a supplemental shot of BO-SE 1-2x a year.



I give all shots by myself. very easy to do. give all shots no matter what vet/directions say. do not give i.m (intramuscular) increases risk of anaphalactic shock.



always give all shots sub cutaneous. (under the skin)



routine hoof triming. (done by owner) if you need to know how.. please e-mail me and i will explain it)



and lots of fresh cool water in summer/ warm in winter.



also depending on severity of heat. may be a good idea to shave your goats in summer to keep them cool.



and lots of love and attention!!



feel free to contact me if you have any other questions

Fresh meat is a popular option with ferret owners. Ferrets will often prefer chicken to beef, though. Mutton is a possible choice, but it's high in fat, so take care. Naturally, any fresh meat has to be obtained from a quality source to ensure it's free of parasites, bacteria and toxins.



Commercial dry ferret food is another option and pets will do just fine with it. Again, it's important to check the label to ensure that it contains at least 35% protein from meat sources and 15% fat. They should also be relatively low in fiber, 3% or less. In a pinch, they can be fed cat food for short periods. However, the protein and fat levels, and other ingredients, are not ideally balanced for ferrets. Many ferrets are fond of sweets, enjoying raisins and bananas. Any treats like those should be given in very small quantities and only occasionally.



Ferrets, whose name is derived from the Latin for 'thief', earned the name from their habit of hoarding small objects. Ensure that any raisin or other small treat is eaten before giving any more. It's possible for them to store up enough to present dietary imbalance that can lead to stomach upset or health problems.



Apart from fresh meat and/or a commercial pet food designed for ferrets, it's a good idea to have some mineral and vitamin supplements on hand. Most pet foods will have these supplements built in, but ferrets are individuals and may need extra elements. They're prone to adrenal ailments and certain bone deformations so supplements can be helpful and even neccesary for some.

Please do not feed your ferret cat food.  Most cat foods do not have enough protein for a ferret's necessary diet - look for actual ferret foods with 40% or more protein.

Unless they're fixed, they shouldn't be kept together, because you don't even know what ferrets eat, let alone anything about breeding.



So either get two of the same gender, or a fixed female and male. A fixed female and male pairing should get on fine.

Provided that they are both fixed, there should be no problem, in fact ferrets need socialization with other ferrets - they need friends.  When you first introduce them there might be some play fighting or struggling as they decide who is more dominant, and they WILL play-fight almost constantly, but this is not bullying, this is what they do for fun.

Its not bullying you have to worry about- Its the humping. The ferrets will hump continously and have MILLIONS of babies a year. My hamster had 10 babies at a time and had like 10 litters a year!
If you get them neutered they will be fine- unless they are viscious!

What do u think of this cop's reaction to a rabbit?



My bf is the super in an apartment building & one of the guys who live in the building has schizophrenia & bipolar disorder. This guy ended up getting a rabbit & i told my bf i wasn't happy about it & very concerned. Today my bf ran into that guy & asked him how the rabbit was (this is 2 or more weeks later) the guy told him the rabbit was dropped and stepped on, has a broken jaw & hasn't eaten since last week, the guy said he tried to push the rabbits jaw back in place HIMSELF & the rabbits head is swollen really bad on the right side. Me & my bf called the aspca & they were closed so we called the cops (it says on the aspca answering machine to call them if it is an emergency) the cop came & seen the rabbit, told us that he pushed on the rabbits head & it didn't flinch. He also said people eat rabbits so hes not sure if its a problem. He said if it were a dog or cat then he would do something about it. I am really upset about how it was handled, i am calling the aspca first thing in the morning. What do you think about this cop? & do u think i should bring the cops poor reaction to someones attention?



</question>



<additional details>



I clean the building as a JOB, so it is my business for my OWN safety to know the people i am cleaning around. Once anyone heres of ABUSE to a LIFE, it becomes their business since it is ILLEGAL and sickening.



i never said it shouldnt be put down. Its sad but it might happen since no one knows how bad his injuries are. I am against it suffereing

i know this sounds mean, but becuase the rabbit is so hurt i think it should be put down



i mean seriously, it would have to be examined which would hurt
have an operation, which would hurt
stay in a small cage while healing
and probably have brain damage, loss of blood, loss of white and red blood cells
and die
so what would be more peaceful? going through that or just simply gettin a needle



or if it livesget sent back to the owner who has schitsophrenia who probably saw the rabbit talk to him n it freaked him out(no i dont think rabbits talk but i know that schitsophrenic people see and hear things its not a split personality like people used to think



the policmen should have taken it to the vet n get it put down

i think ur first answer didn't read ur Q because u r talking about a rabbit and he want to give u a website for cats, is there any laws that states that anyone with a mental handicap is forbidden to own any animals i know there is here, and i am wondering what was it u wanted the cop to do unfortunately rabbits and other small animals r not high priority for most law offices and thus they can do nothing unless they is the abuse happening, it's sad and unfair but that's the way it works the cop may have been right maybe the guy in ur building was planning on eating the poor rabbit u can buy rabbits,chickens,goats,and lambs for food it is up to u if u send them to a slaughter house or do it ur self. it's making  me sick just talking about it. ppl r sick and there is not a damn thing we can do about. try ur local aspca i'm sure they will do something i just hope it's not to late for that poor bunny i'll keep my fingers crossed that the aspca will help u good luck and god bless u for caring.

If that spider was in your house I think you need to contact your local police, explain what happened to them & see what they suggest.
Alternatively, get in contact with your local council's Environmental Health Department & ask them to send someone out. You may also like to inform your neighbours too, they have a right to know, as they probably have young children.

Good for you, I totally agree with you. I either leave them alone, as long as my wife doesn`t see them..lol.. or pick them up and put them outside.......
They are actually handy around the house to get rid of other insects. When I lived on a boat I used to encourage them..

Generally, we try not to (I always get a container for the hunting spiders and move them back outside).  I have let a few web-spinners stay where they are because they are awesome at catching moths/flies that get into the house.  But, I'll be honest, I do kill a few (though I feel horrible about it) and so do my cats (and even our dogs).

spiders are dangerour regardless if they are poisenous or not, killing it will not matter as they reproduce quickly and have not conciousness anyways. life or death doesnt matter to them, only survival... and if they fail to do so they wont know it anyways.

Do you get really upset when you witness or hear stories about Animal abuse?



I saw a youtube video yesterday, it was titled "very angry kitty" and I felt a bit traumatized by it because this poor kitty obviously didn't look comfortable being locked up in a cage while being laughed at by the idiots shooting the video. And I was disgusted by some of the comments like LMAO and Rofl!. Im too upset to provide a link here.

I work in the industry so I've learned how to be a little more distant but it still upset me.  I've seen some unbelievable things.  More than anything I have learned that in spite of all the publicly available information people don't do their research and still treat most animals like toys instead of living breathing beings.  That is what upsets me, the choice of so many humans to remain stupid.

You can call SPCA and animal control.  Mr neighbor's dog was abused and I get together with 2 or 3 people and we call anonymous.  The left the poor dog outside in the sun about 100 degree and in the winter they left him outside.  His food was full of ants and the poor dog was so depressed.  Finally the dog was given fo adoption and it really broke my heart but I had to do something.  If we don't those poor animal who is going to do it.  Thank you for helping and been such a good samaritan.  I can't stand animal abuse.  God bless you and let me know what happen.

if you want them to stop sniffing sprinkle a little Cayenne pepper down there it wont hurt them but it will make them not want to go near the area, then vacuum in the morning. your dog should be fine as long as the mouse was killed by something and not poison. just keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't act lethargic in the next hour, if he does take him to a vet and if not you are in the clear.

Some leases have you pay all of the horses expenses, plus a monthly fee. Some they just want you to pay all expenses, some half of expenses, some just a monthly fee. Depends on the value of the horse, usually, and the people who own them. Sometimes they will require that you board him at a certain stable too. Or/and ride a certain amount of times a week- like 3 min, 6 max. They also decide if you can show or not on the horse, and usually if you do show all expenses are yours. Same with clinics and camps.



Anyways, you get the idea. Pretty much the owner rules all. And they can charge whatever they want. I guess the most common is you pay for everything and don't pay a monthly fee. Atleast around here.

Anyone bought the Bissel Lift Off Revolution Pet Vacuum?



I have a large shedding dog. I'm looking for a really good, quality (not too pricy) vacuum. Her fur weaves and sticks into the carpet and upholstery. Right now I use a dirt devil canister vacuum that I bought a year ago - not quite satisfied with it. I've read some good reviews on the Bissel Pet Vacuum, is this a good vacuum?

Is this safe for a ferret?



now keep in mind that i am asking if this is safe before i go ahead and do it. so please dont say im inhumane or anything. i just wanna know if its safe to use food coloring on a ferret. my roommate has a white pet ferret and we want to dye him like a piece of candy corn for halloween. we were going to use food coloring because we figure its the safest way to go. after a few days well wash it off. i just want to make sure its safe for him and wont hurt him in anyway. i know its not intended for animals but will he be ok? please give serious answers only and if you think its not right then be civil. i dont need rude answers for something i might not even do. thanks in advance!

Here are some options, although I do not think it will be easy.



Food dye is NOT toxic you silly faces.  lol  ;)



Food dyes contain water, glycerin, and typically plant based colorants.  Occasionally some off the wall colors, like hot pink, will contain FDA regulated colors which are safe.

Food Coloring contains certain chemicals and things that are possibly harmful to animals. I don't recommend food coloring, If anything, Make a costume that is loose so they will not choke. Any Dye is not good on animal, Unless Permanent Dog fur dye, it's not very humane but it works, however it is permanent and may not work on ferrets.

I've heard, too, about chemicals in food coloring being toxic for animals.  However, if you really are interested in dying the fert, maybe call a ferret-savvy vet and ask.  That way you know for sure one way or the other.  Hope this helps.

Big deal if she eats it. Just give her another one. Unless you're one of those people that take ages to use up a toilet paper roll..
You could grab one from a friend or whatever if you notice it's out.
You could also get thick cardboard mailing tube things. They're harder to chew but she'll still chew it eventually.
Or you could give her a tissue box or something.



It's good for them to be able to chew on stuff like that. They use the bits for bedding and it helps keep their teeth down.
You could also buy a wooden small animal house and give them that. It'll be chewed on but will take ages for them to destroy it.



Hope I helped.

I like spiders!
But then im not a great example as I let posin snakes slither on my arm at a Zoo, that kind of thing doesn't bother me Im more concerned about some maniac getting drunk and crashing into my family, friends or myself on the roads.
My advice: If theyre small squash them with something like a stick or poke them out of the way, alternatly run and let someone like me deal with them, that way everyone wins ;)!!!

It weird,because i like Tarantulas & i don't mind the weeny spiders,BUT i am petrified of the "House Spiders"!!!!!!!!



Once i was sat reading a book on my bed & i felt this tickling feeling on my leg,i actually just though it was me,as it stopped,but then it started of again!



I looked down at my legs... I think i very nearly shattered the windows,as it was the largest,Hairiest House Spider,running up my leg!!



I was frantically shaking my leg to get it off,but i clung on for its dear life,fortunately i knocked it off with the book close at hand,though after that my parents came in & my dad could hardly fit in a beer glass!!

You can't unfortunately,as snails & slugs are bisexual creatures.



Meaning they have both breeding parts,as when they breed one of the snails will,send out a spear-like object,though either of them could do this.



So,there isn't a difference!



Hope this helps,xxx

10 years is pretty good. under 8 i would be suspicious, but 15 i would say is max.



I have friends that have had goats and they have had them live up to 16. but by then. they are about done. can't get around well. etc.



But i would say if you keep them up to date on shots, and deworming, and cocci prevention. they should live a good 10 years at least!!
