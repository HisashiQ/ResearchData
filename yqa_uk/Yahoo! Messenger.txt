Yahoo is in the process of adding more Yahoo! properties for you to share with your friends.



Although they  don't have a list to share, They will  include additional properties to share in the near future.

I do recommend you get the 8.1.0.421 version as it is the most stable a bug free version of messenger !!



When you download it just save it to your desktop and then run the installer from there.



If you have XP just double click on it to start the install.



If you are on Vista you will need to Right click on it(the installer you just downloaded) then click "Run as Administrator" to get it to install correctly.

With the recent integration of chat into Yahoo! Mail Beta you're now able to chat with other Yahoo! users in your mail window.



In the meantime, you can simultaneously chat in Yahoo! Mail and IM in Yahoo! Messenger if you've got two different IDs and are signed into each separately.



The Chat option in your Yahoo! Mail Beta cannot be removed. You can, however, set your status to "Offline.”



If you're automatically signed out of Yahoo! Messenger when you sign into your Yahoo! Mail account, and if you'd rather this not happen, please do the following:



1.	Click your chat status, next to your Yahoo! ID at the top of your Yahoo! Mail page.
2.	In the dialog box that opens, choose "Offline” by clicking in the circle next to your selection. Whatever you choose is now the default setting each time you open Yahoo! Mail.
Note: This change won't take effect until you sign out and then sign back into Yahoo! Mail.



If you set your default status to Available, Busy, or Invisible for chatting within Yahoo! Mail, you'll be logged out of Yahoo! Messenger whenever you sign into Yahoo! Mail.



Please make sure that your system is configured to read and write in multiple languages. We suggest checking your regional settings:



1.	Click "Start."
2.	Select "Settings."
3.	Click the "Control Panel" option, which will launch a new window.
4.	Locate the "Regional Options" icon and double click the icon.
5.	Make sure you have the languages configured correctly.

The ad in Yahoo! Messenger is only shown for users with high-screen resolutions.



Yahoo  wants to make sure that people with older computers and monitors can use Yahoo! Messenger without an ad taking up too much of the experience.

in my opionion your messenger doesn't "see" your webcam. i have had similar problems and i resolved the problem easily. Before i uninstalled the webcam and msn and then i reinstalled before the cam, and i tested it, so i'm sure that it has not problems and then i reinstalled msn and the webcam worked well..bye Marco..XD

The drivers that come with webcams quickly go out of date.  Have you been to the manufacturers website to update to the latest ones.  Does the web cam work when msn is not switched on?  Can you test to see if its working properly on your pc first?

There may be several reasons it could be an error while installing the program and also it could be a virus eating up the .exe file the best way to fix this error is to completely remove the software and try installing some old versions or check with an anti-virus software like avira anti vir . The same problem happened with me but after i checked with my anti virus it got corrected .

Do this,,,,



Click on Start Button/ Settings/ Control Panel/ Add or Remove Programs.



DUMP anything that says Yahoo Messenger (toolbar, address book etc etc etc) they will be listed at the bottom of that window), and go to this website,,,,, http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=... and install the 7.0 (my suggestion, one of which I HAVE NEVER HAD PROBLEMS WITH).



BE SAFE



Cheri



PS. Stay away from the 9.0 version it still has bugs being worked out, and like I suggested, the 7.0 is the most stable. And no you will NOT lose any Contacts from a previous version you ran, they are all saved on Yahoos Server and will transfer to whatever version you install.

I have a vista pc and run 8.1.0.421 on mine and I have it. Do the following&gt;&gt;



You need to uninstall messenger Completely so you can get rid of the corrupted file that is causing your problem and get a clean install.



When you uninstall not all of the yahoo messenger files are deleted from your Program Files, so if the problem you are having is caused by a corrupted file then the problem will still be there when you install it again.



So what you need to do is uninstall messenger then go to your Program files and delete the yahoo folder. This will get rid of all remaining files especially the corrupted ones.



To find and delete the Yahoo folder click on the START button in your task bar then on My Computer then C: drive then Program Files then right click on the Yahoo folder and Delete it. It's a good idea to reboot your PC now to make sure it's all gone out of your system.



Go here instead of trying to get it from the Yahoo messenger site &gt;&gt;  http://www.freecreed.com/ymsgr-archive.h...



I do recommend you get the 8.1.0.421 version as it is the most stable a bug free version of messenger !!



When you download it just save it to your desktop and then run the installer from there.



To install messenger on Vista you need to download messenger to your desktop. Then Right click on the installer and then click on "Run as Administrator" to get it to install correctly.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



this seems like the perfect answer to me. however, my computer will not let me recycle the yahoo folder. undoubtedly some sneaky setting on the folder preventing it from being deleted. have you any ways around this in your arsenal of tricks?

Do this,,,,



Click on Start Button/ Settings/ Control Panel/ Add or Remove Programs.



DUMP anything that says Yahoo Messenger (toolbar, address book etc etc etc) they will be listed at the bottom of that window), and go to this website,,,,, http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=... and install the 7.0 (my suggestion, one of which I HAVE NEVER HAD PROBLEMS WITH).



BE SAFE

PS. Stay away from the 9.0 version it still has bugs being worked out, and like I suggested, the 7.0 is the most stable. And no you will NOT lose any Contacts from a previous version you ran, they are all saved on Yahoos Server and will transfer to whatever version you install.

if firefox wants to restart they are trying to update it. Just tell it to wait until you next log into firefox. you dont HAVE to close down firefox just because there is an update; you can tell it to wait until you log in next.

Of course. I answered a question on Y/A on September 2nd last year, and I know not many people will believe this, but I knew he was something special just by his question. We were talking on MSN by the 4th September, by October 13th we were talking on the phone and we finally met in person on November 16th. We've been together ever since =)

People think it's weird, but it's the best thing that's ever happened to me.

Yes there is a way (unless they have changed it). It should be where you change your settings for your webcam. It should let you write the name of the user. I think he/she needs to be your friend.

Make sure your Yahoo Messenger is deleted from your Add/Remove Programs, and go to this website,,,,,http://www.oldversion.com/program.php?n=...



and download another version.
I suggest the 7.0 version, the newest version still has bugs being worked out and is unstable.

Ps. No you will not lose any of your contacts.

You need a microphone to be able to send any voice.

If you have one, it may be a problem with either your computers volume settings (Mic. mutted), your settings in options of messenger or a version error (update required).

Yes, if you don't have a microphone, she won't hear you.



If you do have a mic, and you're running Windows, then run your mixer program via: 
Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Entertainment &gt; Volume Control

Go to the Options menu and click Properties - click the "Recording" radio button, and when the mixer panel appears, check the Microphone setting - make sure the Select checkbox is checked and that the volume slider is all the way up.



If all of that is as described and she still can't hear you, click the Options menu again and select Advanced.  Then click the Advanced button (which should appear under "Microphone") and click the Mic Boost checkbox.



If it still doesn't work, check to make sure the mic is plugged into the correct jack on your sound card hardware.



If that doesn't work, make sure your mic is working - find someone who's mic does work and try your mic on their computer or vice versa.

Get rid of 9  it has way to many problems with it still !!!and go back to 8.1 here &gt;&gt;



http://www.freecreed.com/ymsgr-archive.h...



I do recommend you get the 8.1.0.421 version as it is the most stable a bug free version of messenger !!



When you download it just save it to your desktop and then run the installer from there.



If you have XP just double click on it to start the install.



If you are on Vista you will need to Right click on it(the installer you just downloaded) then click "Run as Administrator" to get it to install correctly.



be sure to uninstall 9 before you download and install 8.1 or it won't work.

yep you sure can, at the top of your friends list window click on Messenger then on Preferences then on Appearance.



Now click on the "Change Fonts & Colors" button. Choose your Font, Font Style and size. If you want a different color click on the Black Bar at the bottom left , pick your color click ok and ok again then on the Appearance page click on apply and ok to save changes.



Now your font and color will be saved and it will be used everytime you start an IM with someone.

When someone tries to add you to their friends list you will get a notification to either approve or reject . No one can add you without your approval. So common sense would tell you that however many people you have on your own friends list is also how many people there are that have you on their list ! If you have 10 people on your list then there are 10 people that have you on theirs.

This is a great way to share the friends you have in common with someone who's new to Messenger. Here's how:



1.	Click Actions.
2.	Click Send My Messenger List. A window opens and shows your Messenger list.
3.	Click the My Contacts tab to choose people from your Messenger List.
4.	Click the Other Contact tab to enter the Yahoo! ID, Windows Live ID, or email address of someone not on your contact list.
5.	Click Next. This displays your Messenger List with several options to choose from:
o	You can check the box on a group, if you want to send your list to an entire group.
o	You can check the boxes next to one or more people in your list.
o	You can check the Select All check box to send your list to every person and group.
o	If you don't want everybody on the list to see everybody else's name, uncheck the option Let the other person see my names for these contacts.
6.	Click Finish.

Here’s how:



Click inside the menu below your name, where it says “share a status message…”.



Type your message and press Enter on your keyboard.
You can also click the down-arrow to choose from other status messages you’ve written.



Your custom status message now appears next to your Yahoo! ID in other peoples’ Messenger lists.



Please note: Messenger remembers the last 5 custom status messages so you can quickly re-select them.



Older custom status messages will be deleted as you create new ones.

•	A red disc with a white bar through it means this person is busy.
•	A yellow clock means this person is online, but they haven’t used the computer in a while. Other people see this for you, too, if you don’t use your computer for awhile—and you can control what they see by clicking Messenger, then selecting Privacy Options, and in the “Idle Status” section, configuring the settings whichever way you’d like.
•	A phone icon means that the contact is using their mobile phone. You can still send them instant messages, which will appear on their phone as text (SMS) messages. Remember that according to individual mobile carrier policies, your pals might get charged for these. :o)
•	A sleeping gray face means that the contact is offline.

You decide whether you want friends to know if you're not using your computer. Here's how to reveal or conceal your Idle status:



1.	Click the Messenger menu in Yahoo! Messenger.
2.	Select Privacy Options.
3.	Locate the "Idle Status" section.
4.	Choose whether you want to be shown as "Idle" after a period of time, or never be shown as "Idle."
5.	Click OK.

threatening him to do something?

add his name and call him f ag and stuff, aim is like that, you can add anyone and talk to them until they block you



or even better, he pretends to be a girl and pretends to be really into him, all sending him fake pics of some girl, and then finally sends some nasty gay porn lmfao



and best, he pretends to be a girl and pretends to be really into him, all sending him fake pics of some girl, then nude pics, then asks him to send some naked pics. and after he sends a pic of himself naked the mean popular guy sends them to everybodys phone, and also prints like 100 copies and puts them all over the school LOL



number 3 would take some convincing like i would ask to see a normal pic of him first, or maybe on cam, and lie to him saying hes "hot" or "cute" to boost his confidence and then ask him to take all his clothes off all the while recording everything thats goin on on the screen with my cell phone lol

When you sign on to your instant messenger and he's online, does he say Hello right way? If he doesn't, it could still mean he likes you, but if he does, it's a pretty good sign that he's eager to talk to you whenever he can

I don't think he can.  It's an IM.  Pointless text appearing before your eyes.  Unless they're idiots..



I guess the one can send the other spam bombs, or sign his email up for porn.  But those are m'eh.

Be sure you uninstall the 9.0 before you try and download and install an older version or it won't work.



Go here instead of trying to get it from the Yahoo messenger site &gt;&gt;  http://www.freecreed.com/ymsgr-archive.h...



I do recommend you get the 8.1.0.421 version as it is the most stable a bug free version of messenger !!



When you download it just save it to your desktop and then run the installer from there.



If you have XP just double click on it to start the install.



If you are on Vista you will need to Right click on it(the installer you just downloaded) then click "Run as Administrator" to get it to install correctly.
