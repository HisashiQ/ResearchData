Pains in my head and 'blackening vision'?



I'm 13. Sometimes, (normally when I get up in the morning and walk in light) I see black spots. When I stay focused standing up it gets worse nearly making me blind, and giving me a slight headache. The only thing that will take it away is by sitting down, closing my eyes and taking a 'deep breath'. What do you think makes this happen?

One very real possibility is low blood pressure upon arising.  I used to get so faint, I had to sit back down immediately or pass out.

Another possibility is low blood sugar.  Especially first thing in the morning.

Other, more drastic causes exist, but let's not worry about them at your age.  See your doc and get a fasting blood sugar and blood pressure test.

Impetigoo is bacterial and highly contagious. There are antibiotics to take, but most importantly try to avoid contact with the lesions. Wash, wash, wash your hands.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Voters</evaluation>



Some teens are tempted to try alcohol, tobacco, or drugs. You already know that none of these substances are safe. You may not know that they pose even more danger to people with diabetes.
Alcohol

Of course, you know about the dangers of drinking too much and of drinking and driving. For people with diabetes, though, even a little alcohol can be dangerous. Alcohol on its own can lower your blood glucose. The sugary mixers in some drinks can raise your blood glucose. In addition, it's difficult to recognize the signs of hypoglycemia when you're drinking. You may think that you're feeling the effects of alcohol, when in fact your blood glucose is taking a nose-dive. Others may attribute any strange behavior to your being drunk, even if they know you have diabetes.

Don't forget that drinking is illegal until you're 21. Despite all of this, however, some teens do drink. If you decide to drink, keep it to a minimum. Stick to one or two drinks only, and avoid drinks with sugary mixers. Don't drink on an empty stomach -- the danger of hypoglycemia is too great. On the other hand, don't let yourself pig out when you drink. Then you'll face the opposite problem. Also, learn the alcohol and carbohydrate content of various drinks. Choose the ones with lower alcohol and sugar. And always wear your medical ID, especially if you drink -- just in case.
Tobacco

Smoking is a factor in thousands of lung-cancer and heart-disease deaths every year. It can also cause or worsen asthma, sinus infections, allergies, and other health problems. Smoking is double trouble for people with diabetes, because diabetes already increases the risk of heart disease and kidney problems. No matter how old you are. And that's before you start using tobacco.

Some people think that chewing tobacco is safer than smoking. In fact, the opposite is true: your body absorbs even more nicotine from chewing tobacco than it does from cigarettes. Chewing tobacco and snuff are also linked to mouth and nose cancer.

If you already smoke or chew, quitting can protect you from further damage from tobacco. It can be very difficult to quit, however. Talk to your doctor about ways to make quitting easier.
Illegal Drugs

The dangers of illegal drugs are similar to those of alcohol. Some drugs lower blood glucose, and others raise it. The symptoms of hypoglycemia can be masked by the effect of the drug. Illegal drugs are also highly addictive, dangerous, bad for your health in other ways, and, of course, illegal. We can't say strongly enough that you should steer clear of all illegal drugs. Always. That said, we know that despite what you read here, and what you know in your head and heart, some teens are going to try drugs. If you do decide to use drugs, take some precautions ahead of time. Set a limit in advance. Ask a friend who's not on drugs to watch you for signs of hypoglycemia. Check your blood glucose often. And always wear your medical ID.

I wish you had mentioned the side.
An examination and investigations like xray, scan etc will ascertain the cause.
If bilateral, it could be prominent ribs due to Vit D deficiency (Rachitic rosary).

Once a week isn't such a huge problem, so it's great that you want to stop before it bocomes daily. The easiest way is to remove yourself from the company of your coke mates, if you need a little extre help try going to a CA meeting, it can be really inspirational. You do NOT have to stand up and say Hi, My Name Is ... and I'm An Addict, you can simply introduce yourself, say your using a bit too much and want to stop before it gets out of control. The people I've met at meeting have been a great help, they are the same kind of people you would hang out with when you're using except cups of tea and biscuits replace the drugs. CHeck out the CA website for your country and you'll find a list of local meetings. If you need a little help getting your foot through the door for the first time you can take a friend. Good luck - life without charlie is great - I'm working on the smokes now.

Any idea what could cause random sharp pain followed by numbness, weakness, coldness in random areas?



I get random sharp pain that feels like stabbing with a knife & twisting sometimes accompanied by a throbbing or spasming sensation with no apparent triggers in arms, legs, hands, feet, chest, neck, temples, head, etc. The area then becomes weak, numb and cold to the touch. Pain lasts about 5-15 min., other symptoms about 15-60 min. Usually after symptoms subside I feel very tired, confused, like I'm in a fog. Doctors are baffled.

I was nauseous for 4 hours. Then vomiting for 2 hours. Then TERRIBLE PAIN in my stomach. I had a food bourn illness from DENNY'S!!! How sad. I love that place. So I was sick for 26 hours. Then I was fine. SO it could be anything. EVEN heartburn. They have pills to give you for nausea and it helps. So don't worry if its trivial. Hopefully you have health care so co-pay is low.  Good Luck.

You should get your blood tested for Jaundice or Hepatitis please as urgently as possible. Nausea is usually a sign of indigestion, which has a long list of reasons. Try to exclude this one first and than tell me some thing about your life style and eating habits. may be i can be a help.

I would like to know the answer to this questions as well. Though for me, I have been told it is because of anxiety and fear, which makes me feel sick, even though nothing happens. It is really worse when you're out and about. I have a really sensitive stomach, so I'm sensitive to smells which could be what you're suffering from. I have been to the  doctor's, and other specialist, but they give me the same diagnosis, that it's from fear and anxiety. Any way thanks for asking this question, hope this has been helpful.

My son is three he is very hyperactive and unable to speak but he can say only alphabetical and spell for words i.e. monkey, orange, flower, umbrella and many more if I count, it may be more then hundred words. According to Dr he might be autistic, because of a long queue system I am still waiting for test and worried about him.
Please help me and tell me is that a really a kind of autism.

Did he receive a lot of attention the first time he spelled a word for you after learning to read it? I did this a lot as a very young child, and it was accidentally encouraged by my proud parents who thought it meant I was very smart when it really meant I was just reading (in my mind) some words I was trying to learn what they meant, and saying these things out loud coz it felt good, took away some stress, kept me amused, and also got me a little bit of good attention. The same way "normal" children will repeat or try to use the same new word over and over again, I suppose. It's a visual learner, for sure, that does that. Not necessarily an autistic one.

You'll prolly hear the word Asperger's thrown around though.

Edit: I didn't say anyone taught me either, hon. :D I did say I noticed sometimes my parents paid attention when I spelled stuff aloud all the time though.

Social interaction problems are a symptom of high level autism. The high level autistic may appear serious and uncommunicative, although being uncommunicative may only take the form of a lack of participation in small talk conversations. High level autistics may also have difficulty maintaining eye contact with others.

Individuals with high level autism prefer routine and order. These symptoms may present themselves in early childhood. Personal relationships are often a problem for people with high level autism. Affected individuals can sometimes be perceived by others as too geeky or intelligent. Rejection can lead to low self esteem.

Other symptoms of high level autism may include irregularities with coordination and motor skills. These problems may be very low level and may only take the form of clumsiness in situations such as sports activities. Although the high level autistic may not express certain emotions, such as empathy, he or she is certainly capable of feeling them.

High level autistics may have advanced learning abilities. They are also talented at problem solving, and many go on to careers in science and engineering. People with high level autism are often gifted academically and will do well if they have encouraging teachers. They are often extremely talented wordsmiths and have a great love of language. A passion for obscure subjects and an in-depth knowledge of these subjects are also symptoms of high level autism.

That's not acne...I used to get that when I was on swim team in elementary school, and my doctor said it was a combination of moisture and my legs rubbing together. Might not be the same for you but I suspect it is a rash rather than acne

P.S. I recommend Bag Balm, which is something that farmers put on cow's chapped udders, for the problem. Sounds goofy but definitely works! (Can find it online, I'm not sure what stores it is sold in as my mother always bought it.)

It all really depends on the cause of your attacks.

If physical such as the pressure problem another poster has mentioned or the broken nose I gained years ago then X-Ray or other soft tissue scans may show an obstruction that may be moved or helped with physiotherapy or surgery.

If like my allergy to certain paints then avoidance seems the only solution.



In my case avoiding the paint has kept incidences down.  Early intervention with a steroidal spray can help [something like Beconase].  For me I prefer a very basic spray Rhynochrom just to relieve some of the early 
congestion.  Sometimes there is no stopping the attack though as it can be effected by so many external stimulatory events.



The trick seems to be in keeping the smallest symptoms from getting bigger.  Wait too long and it is usually too late.

Sounds like you need another Doctor or maybe you haven't let him know just how badly this is impacting on you?



A tired and busy Doctor sometimes fails to pick up on the importance.

Its only just been approved for use so its unlikely anyone will have completed a course yet. The results are good - but not that much better than for the existing methods ie patches etc or zyban.

Personally i'm currently using patches and am surprised at how well i'm currently doing. I'd recommend you try them, even if you supplement it with chewing gum initially if you have any cravings. My boyfriend is also on patches - he smoked 30 plus a day till 2 weeks ago and is doing great - he says has not really had many cravings either!!

GO on if we can do it so can you!! Good luck x

Albinism is due to faulty production of the pigment melanin.

Increased rates of melanin production in melanocyte cells in the skin will produce changes in skin colour. Albinism means there is no pigment in the skin or hair, & the eyes appear red from the blood flowing though the irises.

Albinos cannot tan because this requires the melanin pigment to be 'packaged' & dispersed within the skin.

It's a genetic condition where the body lacks the capacity to produce melanin. this is the substance which makes the skin darker in response to the sun.



As their bodies have so little (or indeed none) melanin, they would suffer sunburn very easily. No, they would not be able to have sun tans.

Albino people have hair that is white, this is hair anywhere on their bodies.
They also have pale blue eyes and have to stay out of the sun. This is because they have no pigmentation in their skin and it will just burn like bacon in a pan.
My mothers cousins in America are Albino, I think thats where I get my blonde hair from as my sister and brother are dark haired.

What is blood in the urine?



I know you arent doctors on here and i know that i will have to wait to hear back from a dr but i mostly want to prepare myself. 
my gran is 72 years old, has very high blood pressure and is on medication to control this, blood thinners etc. she had ovarian and cervical cancer 15 years ago and has undergone treatment and has been cancer free for almost 14 years. 
but she went to the doctors recently and they found she has blood in her urine. i dont know what this is but when i googled this it said that it could be cancer. 
i just wanted to know if anyone out there knows anything about blood in the urine and whether or not it it a common symptom of cancer. i'm just scared and need a bit of reassurance to be honest. 
also i should mention that she had a kidney infection about 2 weeks ago. 
thank you all so much.

Statistically the likeliest cause is in fact her urine infection. Haematuria is common in UTIs. Another possibility is that it may be related to her blood thinners, especially if this is warfarin. This might be a problem as it could indicate bleeding due to excess anticoagulant. She is under care of a doctor and with the minimal information you have been able to supply it is not really possible to safely suggest a diagnosis. However it would be correct to include bladder, kidney or even cervical or uterine cancer in the differential, though they would be lower down than my first 2 suggestions.

It is most likely from the kidney inf.  This is one of the first signs of bladder or kidney infection.  After antibiotics and repeat urinalysis with culture, if the urine is clear of infection, but still positive for blood, she may have something more serious like cancer.  I would try not to get too worried at this point.  It is very common for people to need two rounds of antibiotics to get rid of infections of this sort.

Blood in the uring measn that the doctro saw red blood cells in her urine.  This might have been easily visible (her urine was pink), or it might have needed a microscope to see it.

Usually, this means a problem in the urinary system -- Kidneys, bladder, ueters, and urethra.



Blood in the urine is in this case a symptom of the kidney infection.  It is not quite healed yet.

If she is still taking the blood thinner pills, then...I think that is your answer. Taking too much of for too long will make the blood too thin and will make it leak out easier. She probably needs to mention that to the doctors. This is kind of an obvious idea since she's taking blood thinner pills.

My God there are a myriad of problems for which blood could show up in urine.  If there is a lot of blood not just that which can be detected on a urinalysis stick it could be a symptom of cancer, a urine infection which would of course give her cystitis and then the kidney's could be malfunctioning or damaged.  Tests will have to be carried out at the hosptial to find out the origin of the blood from the start and then you'll have to take it from there.  Sorry but haematuria (blood in the urine) could be caused by anything.

All of the above answers are valid. Nonetheless, you should follow up with her doctor to see what's going on, and not waste any valuable time.  Blood in the urine, might be a signal of something going on...it could be a Urinary track problem (crystals in the urine) or a signal of colon cancer.  Perhaps the doctor needs to be reminded to follow up on her case and keep the family or responsible person informed as to what needs to be done. Hope it is nothing bad.

I suggest you quit smoking all together - it's extremely unhealthy and leads to a lot of health problems (mouth and lung cancer, stroke, heart disease, yellowing teeth - just to name a few).  Cigarette smoke is very strong and permeates everything - so changing clothes won't help. They will be able to smell it on your clothes if they do your laundry or go in your room.  The smells stays in your hair, skin, and breath and in the air for a short time.  Your parents will find out eventually.

Yes, your hair, hands, and breath will smell.  Even if you change your clothes.  And if you put your smoky clothes in the laundry pile with other clothes, they will stink too.  That's a lot of trouble to go through, for 2-3 cigarettes a day, that will cause you health problems in the long run.  Yes, even smoking only a couple cigarettes a day, and even if they are ultra light, will cause health problems.

Well smoking will also literally kill you. Why did you start in the first place? Did you just pick one up and say Oh, I want to start smoking because everyone else is doing it? Well you are stupid and shouldn't have. There are many things you won't be able to do anymore because of this. You will possibly develope asthma if you don't already have it, and if you do shame on you! You won't be able to exercise as efficiently and you will definitely wheeze and cough while trying to job.

DEFINITELY awful! Also, you will probably eventually develop lung cancer.

And if you smoke, you will smell like it, your hair, teeth (will show), fingers and clothes no matter if you change, will smell like it.

Theirs a reason your parents want to kill you if they found out.

Cigarette smoke sticks to everything, including clothes, hair, and skin. Smoking outside definitely helps, but you will still smell like smoke, regardless of the precautions that you take.. Even after changing your clothes, your hair and skin will still hold the smell. Just be sure to put the "smoky" clothes somewhere your parents won't find them or be able to smell them.

The best thing to do, in addition to smoking outside, is to give yourself extra time between smoking and interacting with your parents. No matter what you do, your hair and skin will smell like cigarettes. Your breath and fingers will be the areas that smell strongest. That smell is extremely hard to get rid of. Time is the only thing that works.

Also, when you smoke, you get used to the smell. Even though you aren't able to smell anything, your parents may be able to detect it on you. Just be careful.

Best of luck!

Have a peek at this link buddy, it may be usefull 4 u.

~ http://www.restlesslegsyndromecure.com/c...

Basically, it revolves around magnesium and the vitamin B3 (which is part of the B complex of vitamins) being in short supply in your body.

foods rich in magnesium are ~ leafy and green vegies, fresh cold water fishes such as tuna, sardines, salmon and whiting and wholegrain breads and cereals and organic nuts and seeds ~ organic to avoid the nasty sulfites and chemicals they use to "preserve" the commercial varieties of nuts and seeds that may upset sensitive bodies.

magnesium is needed in our bodies for healthy nerve and muscle functioning and of course for heart health ....... when our bodies become deficient in it then it simply gets leached from our bones, which hold the greatest stores of magnesium ... hence twitching, pinching sensations may also occur along with the restless legs .. foods rich in magnesium will also help resolve any issues with constipation you may have.......... magnesium is known as the antistress mineral and foods rich in magnesium will help you deal with the everyday stressy bits of life a bit better.... if you choose to supplement with magnesium go for an amino acid chelated magnesium powder which is the easiest for the human body to assimilate ..... you can get it from your local Health Food Store for around $40.00AUD per bottle .... Sandra Cabot (Author of The healthy Liver & Bowel Book and many others) endorses one that's pretty good.

As far as vitamin B3 goes ....... get a B complex including all the B's as they all work best as a group ie ~ B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12 and folic acid etc...... don't buy any of the B complex of vitamins individually but rather as a whole group unless a nutritionally oriented physician or naturopath tells you to do so .............. a liquid B complex supplement would be the easiest for your body to assimilate.

Try to cut back on the B vitamin thieves such as coffee and tea and ditch the alcohol, sodas and soft drinks too (if you drink any of them) as not only will they rob you of your B vitamins but they will also dehydrate you terribly.

Oher things that will rob you of your precious B complex of vitamins are :- stress, eating too much protein, eating too much tinned food, laxatives and diuretics, antiobiotics, antidepressants, penicillin, prednisone and aspirin, otc cold and flu medicines.

When you take your daily B complex please be aware that vitamin B12 needs vitamin B6 (included in a multi supplement B complex), calcium and vitamin D to be effectively absorbed.......... vitamin D is known as the sunshine vitamin, so simply get 10 - 15 minutes per day of safe sun exposure and calcium rich foods are ~ leafy and green vegies, tofu, sardines, kale, broccoli, collard greens, salmon and tuna ...... salmon and tuna are cold water fishes which are also a rich source of magnesium & vitamin D(known as the antistress mineral) .



Sorry that was so loong but you need to know all this buddy.

peace & luv 2 ya

You could try foods that are rich in Potassium, bananas etc. Although, this tends to help cramping rather that restless leg per sa. Are you having circulatory issues? Restless leg syndrome is generally a symptom rather than a disease of an underling problem, have you seen the Dr regarding this?

Doxycycline isn't the best drug around for acne, it has been known to produce a lot of gastrointestinal disturbances, and a common side effect is Angioedema .. if your having different symptoms, ask your GP for Minocycline..this is far better with less side effects.

If your lips are tingling and itching you could be having an allergic reaction to the medication, are your lips swelling and are you having breathing difficulties? If so you need medical attention..stop taking the medication and see seek help, NHS direct is 08454647

It is still there. Technically speaking, all influenza is "bird flu". Just some strains cross over to humans easier than others. The strain commonly referred to "bird flu" is H5N1, and it is still ever present in the world health discussion.

Being the "low time" of year for influenza however, it isn't being discussed on the news as much.

Some BP tabs *cause* leg swelling (Amlodipine and Felodipine being the commonest). If your GP is not keen on stopping them, at least make sure you are on the lowest dose possible (there is not much difference in effect between the different doses). At your age there are several different types of BP tabs that could be used, so I would ask your GP about that too.

Sarah-
In most patients with high blood pressure (BP) the approach to treatment is twofold.  If you're overweight then you need to exercise more and lose weight.  At the same time, as your ankles and calves swell, the first medicine for treatment is so-called water pills or diuretics (like Diuril or Lasix) to remove water from the blood circulation; BP tablets never cause water retention.  How much diuretic you need may be more than you are now taking and may well have to be increased.  Of course, there are other high BP medicines which help reduce the swelling ("edema") in your lower legs.  It sounds like you may need another physician who is more understanding and better at treating hypertension.  Meanwhile, whenever you can, try to sleep with a pillow under your ankles or sit with your legs raised to the level of your heart (in private) to reduce swelling.  Be sure to greatly cut back on the use of any sodium salt; put the salt shakers away.

The cause for pimples are many and not only adolescence as
popularly believed. Chronic constipation is one major cause,
the food we eat plays a very important role. You will have
to cut down the fried food, chocolates, cheese and aerated
drinks. Eat a lot of fresh fruits and green vegetables with
a lot of water. Instead of washing the face with soap, use
orange peel powder. Dry Orange peels in the shade for 4-5
days. Powder finely and store. Wash your face with this 2-3
times a day. It clears the face and feels very refreshing.

Put toothpaste or coffee on it and leave it on as long as possible (all day if you can).  This dries it out and it should disappear quicker that it would otherwise.  However, this is not as effective as the medicine (such as Zoviraz) that is applied before the cold sore appears.

If left untreated it can spread over a very large area and become very sore and ugly. Be smart and use a propriety cream formulated specifically for the treatment of cold sores. Try "Zovorax".

try aloe vera, vaseline, lip balm, tannic acid in tea or any other method that will help. try asking around or online for advice. go to your GP or pharmasict for help and advice. you can buy med online from Ebay or Amazon Prime or any good medicine retailers. try lip gel that workde for me. ask your parents for the best advice and the best prodcuts to use for the cold sore. do some research on the net and learm about old fashioned healing and remedial methods and try the best one or the most popularest one even. but dont try sara freders one as it can harm you really. drink hearbl tea or try hearbal remedies. herbal remedies can help. look online and choose your fav one. or you can use minty toothpaste, ladies perfume, alchol based scents, variety cream, antiseptic cream, herbal tea, ice cubes and others.

If you don't use anything on your coldsore it will probably hang around for ages.  I get really bad coldsores and if I didn't treat them straight away they spread and are so uncomfortable.  They would hang around for 2 weeks +.  I use Aciclovir, which I get prescribed from the GP (but I think it's an ingredient in Zovirax - think my cream is a little stronger though) and it clears them up for me in about 5 days.  I don't think there is anything that can get rid of them any quicker - not for me anyway.

I regularly get cold sores and I regularly get rid of them by dabbing tea tree oil on the ticklish spot as soon as you feel the tickle. Get a cotton bud, pour tree oil on to it and spend about 20 to 30 seconds holding the cotton bud to the cold sore/ticklish spot.



Do this twice a day, one of which should be just before going to bed. I find that the cold sore rarely develops into a full blown running around the lips sore and is often completely clear in two or three days.

Good luck

Hey i get cold sores i never take medicine .. i use a special cream called Zoverax and Compeed coldsore patches are a god send ... its like a wee clear plaster you place over the infected area and it helps the healing process... they are amazing because it speeds up heeling time and also i feel makes it feel a little less obvious!!!



Go to your local chemist and they will be able to sort you out!!! If this is what u mean by medicine then im sorry ... you could just let it take its natural course but they highly infectious and i would advise trying to get rid of it asap. Good luck xxx

Tea Tree Oil is the best thing for cold sores.  Just dab it on a few times a day.  It will help dry it out, keep it clean and also helps stop it spreading.

Unfortunately there is no magic trick with cold sores, they will go away quicker if you avoid touching them, bursting them and unfortunately kissing is no good either.

Patience and it should go away within 5 days.

Yes, it's said to have good healing properties, I do part time Nursing agency work in the community and I looked after this elderly lady who had cellulitus, the antibiotics she had been taking had made no difference, we put Manuka honey on and it seemed to disappear. I have read many times this honey has been used in the successful treatments of skin conditions. Not sure what scientific study, if any, there is to back this up, but I guess it's on of those things, one shouldn't knock till they have tried.

Liver cancer.  Doctors / nurses ?



Hi,  My dear lovely friend has liver cancer (secondary) and has just had 10 litres of fluid drained from her abdomen.  She is still in hospital and we are waiting for her to come home.  She is now only going to receive palliative tx regarding her cancer

She is very weak and tired, and has very little appetite.  Her family are hoping that when she comes home she will have chance to get a bit stronger and be able to see as many people as possible.  She hadn't been out or seen people for weeks as her appearance has changed drastically as she has lost so much weight and is so tired.

i know the prognosis, but how long do you think she has? is this amount of fluid unusually high? , and do patients of this kind manage to recover a bit and get to feel a bit better before the fluid builds up again?

i live in Sweden and she is in UK.  I would like to fly to see her, but don't know how much time i have to organise child care etc. and I know that she would see me, but if she had chance to feel better in herself  then I would honour her wish to have that time to get stronger and stronger/more confident to see me.



Is it imminent?  I was hoping to go next weekend if possible - or am i being pessimistic and she should commonly have weeks or months?  if that is the case i could leave booking the flight and allow her the time to get a bit better.

Thank you for your help - i suppose that's alot of questions, but I need to know if i am jumping the gun by hopping on a plane so soon.  maybe that would scare her into thinking that i think she is going to die really soon.



</question>



<additional details>



I can't pretend i am visiting UK for another reason as i was there last month.  I couldn't see her then as I had a very bad cold and her immunitly as low.

Hi.  I'm sorry about your friend.

As you might have guessed, it's impossible to say how long she  has.  For example, it sounds like this is metastatic cancer that has spread to the liver, so a lot depends on what the primary cancer is/was.

Palliative care, in a very general sense, is usually prescribed when the prognosis is for less than 6 months, but there are exceptions to this and, also, it might be different in Sweden.

I personally think the best course is to let her call the shots.  Write her and tell her you want to see her, but you'll let her decide when this is.

They probably have her on strong diuretics to combat the fluids.  She's starting in the beginning of the end stage of the disease.  The amount of fluid they pull out is amazing...  It affects breathing, eating, etc.

When she STOPS having fluid develop in her stomach she probably has 3-6 months to live.

I am so sorry.  My father passed away with the same thing.  It's terrible, and there's nothing they can do for it.

I would go now, while she is still healthy (??) enough to enjoy your company.  I think it would mean alot to her.

I am so sorry.

Can you just 'develop' lactose intolerance?



I went on a toxic cleansing diet to get rid of toxins in my body so I can eat healthy foods rather than junk foods.

Earlier I had a cup of coffee with a fair bit of milk, I also had a small carton of ice cream - could I develop lactose intolerance?
I think lactose intolerance because after I had drank the coffee and ate the ice cream, 2 hours after I felt bloated, 'gassy' and I now have diarrhea (urgh!).



I never used to get diarrhea before I started eating better, I'm 17 now and the last time I had diarrhea I must of been around 4/5 years old.

Any ideas what it could be?

Thanks.

It is possible to develop lactose intolerance, but not in the sense you are thinking of.

Your small intestines can stop producing lactase enzyme - which is the enzyme needed to break lactose (found in dairy products) into simpler sugars called glucose.



So if you are lactose intolerant, it means your small intestine isn't making enough lactase enzymes so your body cannot digest any food with lactose in it - dairy products and some other foods that have small amounts of dairy. (Such as some chocolates.)

The best thing to do is go to your doctors. I was diagnosed with lactose intolerance - despite drinking/eating dairy products most of my life. When I started eating healthily, then drank a cup of tea, I had similar symptoms to you.

Your symptoms, particularly the gas and diarrhea are linked to lactose intolerance.



Go to your doctors and explain your symptoms to him/her, it is likely they will have you drink or eat something with lactose in, then test your breath for hydrogen - the gas that sits in the small intestine when the lactose food cannot be digested. If you have large amounts of hydrogen gas showing in your breath sample, you will be diagnosed as being lactose intolerant. It isn't bad, but you do need to make sure you get your calcium from other food sources, as it is vital to prevent future bone related problems.

No, you'll not just have developed lactose intolerance. It's possible that your new, improved diet (presumably rich in fibre, fruit and veg) is giving you diarrhoea. This will stop after a few days, and you'll feel better when you've been eating well for a few days.

However, a 'cleansing diet' that includes coffee and ice cream doesn't sound healthy to me. If I were you, I'd just eat lots of fruit and veg, cut back on high-fat foods, drink more water and exercise. This will be better for you; your liver's there to get rid of toxins, you just need to feed your body good things!

Firstly Detox has no medical benefits, it was invented by constipated upper class Edwardians, who refused to eat vegetables as they considered them purely for the lower classes.

Secondly you won't develop lactose intolerance. Please see your GP and have a sensible, rational discussion about your totally irrational fears, before things go too far!

I have had tonsillitus before and it normally last about a week.
Has he been to the doctors? Cos i got these tablets especially for tonsillitus. 
Just make sure he drinks alot and eats soft foods like soup and yoghurt or icecream. :P 
He could also get some anti bacterial throat spray which kills the bacteria in the throat. This may speed up the process a bit.



Good luck :P

I'm 13, and about 5 years ago i had it. it was HORRIBLE, it lasted for me about 4-5 days, but since your boyfriend would probably be older id think about a week or so. just make sure he gets alot of rest and don't try giving him medicines or anything. and make sure that he only eats liquidy foods, like Porridge/Oatmeal or stuff. and NO ICE-CREAM, trust me it doesn't work :P

Oral sex can present a STD risk. Oral herpes (cold sores) can be transmitted to your partner's genitals during sexual contact, resulting in genital herpes for your partner. Herpes is spread by skin-to-skin contact, no fluids are necessary.

Syphilis can be transmitted during oral sex as well as manual sex depending on where the bacteria are being shed. Syphilis is also spread by skin-to-skin contact.

And hands are dirty as it is (because people don't wash them enough), and that can contribute to some vaginal infections following manual sex.

So yes, you can give and get STDs if you are engaging in foreplay.

How do you protect yourself? Wear a condom when receiving oral sex. If you are performing oral sex on a woman, use a dental dam or plastic cling film to cover her genitals. When using your hands, cover them with a latex glove or finger cots (they're like condoms for your fingers).

And lastly, get tested for STDs every 6 months.

Hi Squirrel,perhaps I can help you :



Itchy hands are most often associated with a skin condition or rash. The most common of these being eczema.



This itching could be due to an allergy to something you have come into contact with. Common allergy causing agents are household detergents or factors linked to your occupation.



There are many other causes of skin inflammation and irritation.  Are you iron deficient and this may have a bearing on the itch. It would be worthwhile getting a full blood count done by your GP to ensure that you haven't become anaemic recently.

It is very unlikely that the itching is related to your circulation. There are other conditions that give rise to itching but the itch tends to be more generalised all over the body. You will need to visit your GP so he or she can assess your hands and advise you on the likely cause and treatment.



Good luck and hope it clears up soon.

I think I might be getting ill... or maybe I'm just tired?



On Monday I sat next to someone in school who had a cold-y virus thing but at that time wasn't coughing or sneezing or anything.
Anyway now it's Thursday morning and I just feel really tired and sort of like I don't want to move my arms or talk or anything... quite sort of hot and tired...

How can I tell if I'm actually getting ill or just really tired?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



In some people, they can tell if they are coming down with a cold or the flu by early signs as you mentioned.  But most likely you are just tired and need a little more rest.  The incubation period for a cold or flu is usually around 5 days.  It is possible you were around someone else that was contagious and caught something from them.  Drink lots of fluids and don't come into contact with people unless you have to until you find out if you are sick.  Wash your hands after touching things that others have touched, use soap and hot water.  If you can't wash your hands, carry some waterless antibacterial cleaner or antibacterial wipes.  Only use them when you can't get to a sink....

YES it is.  It is highly addictive and there is more than enough medical evidence to prove that it causes permanent damage to your lungs.  If you want any proof about this then read any article about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and most (if not all) of these articles will tell you that the biggest cause of COPD is SMOKING.

In the last week I have had to deal with a family member who was diagnosed with COPD and is now on permanent oxygen because of permanently damaged lungs from smoking.  This is despite having stopped smoking 14 years ago!

So, yes smoking IS really dangerous.

first congratulations on the weightloss - that's an amazing achievement!  unfortunately, stretch mark treatment is a cosmetic one and therefore your medical insurance won't cover the procedure.  unless, of course, there is a medical reason behind the removal?  i don't know if stretch marks can cause stricture, but regular scars can sometimes limit the persons ability to twist and move.  unless there is an actual need for the surgery, though, don't count on any help from insurance... sorry.

Hep A.B and C are the most common viral Hepatitis's. Hepatitis A (the most common)  is found in the feaces of people who are infected with Hep A. (transmission can be by sex or just being in the same household can theoretically put you at risk, washing hands frequently reduces the risk) Infection with the hepatitis A virus leads to inflammation of the liver, but complications are rarely serious. Hep A is a  common infection in many parts of the world where sanitation and sewage infrastructure is poor.Hep A is more easily transmitted than Hep B and C.



Hep B and C is found in the blood and bodily fluids of infected people and is transmitted by unprotected sex, sharing of needles etc (transmission of bodily fluids) Although many cases of hepatitis are not a serious threat to health, the disease can sometimes become chronic and may lead to liver failure and death.

Most adults infected with the hepatitis B/C virus fully recover and develop life-long immunity. Between 2% and 10% of individuals infected as adults will become chronic carriers, which means they will be infectious to others and can develop chronic liver damage.



Treatment combines the antiviral drugs interferon and ribavirin

The disease hepatitis has been known since ancient times. The first virus isolated which was proven to cause hepatitis was named hepatitis B (HBV), it was the cause of serum hepatitis ( Blood transfusions, needle stick and needle sharing.) It was isolated in 1963. In 1973 hepatitis A virus was isolated, it tends to be spread from contaminated water (HAV). In 1989 hepatitis C was isolated. It is spread sexually and from blood exchange.(HCV) Hepatitis Delta virus was found in 1978, ( HDV),but it was discovered in 1990 that it only occurs in conjunction with hepatitis B. In 1990 hepatitis E virus (HEV) and in 1995, Hepatitis G virus (HGV), were identified. Hepatitis F is though to exist, but has not been isolated.

If head lice are left untreated they will reproduce...and spread to everyone around the infected person. Plus, you will not be allowed back in school until you are treated and checked by the school nurse. It will just get worse the longer you put off treating it.

Head lice are parasites which suck your blood and if left untreated can actually cause illness. There is evidence to suggest that children who are infested are lethargic and struggle to concentrate as they tire more easily. In the worst cases they can cause infections which can get into the blood stream. All this apart from sharing them around with everyone you have head contact with as that is how they spread. Despite the myth that they can jump it is only by close contact that they pass from one person to another.

They continue to breed reaching very high numbers so much so that they can be seen visibly crawling and dropping off of the hair and scalp. The skin damage together with the itching and scratching that they cause results in secondary bacterial  infections. These scalps become a mass of blood, scabs and pus, occasionally resulting in systemic spread of infection.

If not treated you will become infested 1 female bug can and does lay 300 eggs in a life time (hers) this means hundreds of lice on the head  scalp  in the hair and every where else.They all must feed from the head, sucking blood to live not to mention the waste its gotta come out too. The home will never be rid of the lice as long as no treatment is being done.This can be transmitted from person to person and any one who comes into the home or contact with a person who has or uses items in the home.These tiny bugs do travel by crawling and do this fairly fast.They will be present where ever the person or persons have been or going.The number of lice in the home would be in the thousand's. This could even travel to pets bugs looking for a meal.A person would scratch there head raw and lice would have easy feeding then.These bugs carry bacteria this can get into open sores and cause Impetio of the scalp The lice can also carry to other people when get on them this is attached to their bodies.This can be very Contagious. If not treated for several months these tiny bugs can cause a person/persons to be feeling low and tired this is from immune system being worn down. If this is a heavy dose then they will leave blood spots on a pillow.

I take it you're trying to ask "What are the organs that make up the immune system?"

Not all the components of the immune system are organs.



Leukocytes (white blood cells).  The lymphatic system which includes lymph nodes, lymph vessels and lymph fluid.  The thymus, the spleen, all the tonsils in our body (all six in the head - palatine, pharyngeal, sublingual -  and those in the intestinal tract - Peyer's patches)

A number of morphologically and functionally diverse organs and tissues have various functions in the development of immune responses. These can be distinguished by function as the primary and secondary lymphoid organs. The thymus and bone marrow are the primary (or central) lymphoid organs where maturation of lymphocytes takes place. The lymph nodes, spleen and various mucosa's associated lymphoid (MALT) such as gut- associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are the secondary (or peripheral) lymphocytes to interact with that antigen. In addition tertiary lymphoid tissues which normally contain fewer tymphoid cells than secondary lymphoids organs, can import lumphoid cells duringan inflammatory response. Most prominent of these are cutaneous- associated lymphoid tissue.
Once mature lymphocytes have been generated in the primary lymphoid organs they circulate in the blood and lymphatic system, a network of vessels that collect fluidthat has escaped into the tissues from capillaries of the circulatory system and ultimately return it to blood primary.
Lymphoid Organs::::
Immature lymphocytes generated in hematopoiesis mature and become committed to a particular antigenic specificity within the primary lymohoid organs. Only after a lymphocyte has matured within a primary lymphoid organ  is the cell immunocompetent (capable of mounting an immune response) T-cells arise in the thymus and in many mammals- humans and mice for example B cells originate in bone marrow.
Thymus::::: 
The thymus is the site of T-cell development and maturation It is a flat, bilobed organ situated above the heart. Eaach lobe is surrounded by a capsule and is divided into lobules which are  separated from each other by strands of connective tissue called Trabeculae. Each lobule is organized into two compartment: 
The outer compartment or cortex is densley packed with immature T cells called Thymoctes.

If you go into hospital with symptoms of heart failure and your sent home with no test is this right?



My mother went to hospital yesturday for a routine tests on her heart, anyway she went to hospital with wheezing, difficult to wake up, low blood pressure, the doctors couldnt wake her but she was sent to the car in a wheelchair plus she was dribbling blood.  Now i would of thought she should of been admitted and put on a ECG machine which would of found her enlarged heart resulting in savin her life. As my mother died yesturday from enlarged heart.  But she does have something wrong with her left ventricle plus she has TTP (blood disorder) i apologise but i am mad they should of done some tests on my mum instead of sending her home then she died the same day in bed she was having heart failure while she was at hospital why couldnt the doctors pick it up.

Yes, they should have done something. However, there isn't much they could have done that would have changed the outcome.  If caught very early, then it's possible to go on medication to slow down the progression of the disease....  but by the time heart failure is occurring, there's not a lot that can be done.  At most, she would have finished out her days miserable and in a hospital for a few weeks.



Did your mother go to regular yearly doctor's appointments?  An enlarged heart is something that a regular general practitioner should pick up on, but not always.  Look, if she had had an anuerism, she might survive it for a few days, but it would kill her regardless of what doctors tried to do.  Same goes for heart disease.

I'm very sorry for your loss.  The Lord takes us on his time, not ours.  If we were ever ready for the loss of a parent (or a child, or anybody) we would all live to be 300 years old.

I am really sorry about your mother. I think you should sue the hospital and demand some answers, why your mother was not given proper medical attention. May be, if they would have done what was required, she would still be alive. Don't let this issue go, sue the hospital for sure so that next time someone else would not have to go through, what you are going through right now. Take care, my prayers are with you and your family, May God give you strength to go through this ordeal and may your mother rest in peace.

It depends; If you have latent TB, there are no symptoms and  you cannot spread the disease to others. If you have active TB, you do have symptoms and  the disease can  be spread to others.The symptoms you have will depend on whether your TB infection is in your lungs or elsewhere in your body. Symptoms of lung TB are;
A persistent cough that has lasted for more than 1-2 months with a thick and sometimes bloody mucus, fever/chills/fatigue and weakness/ loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss.



If the symptoms are outside the lungs, symptoms are sometimes non specific and can include back pain (can be a symptom of TB in the spine), swollen lymph nodes if the lymph nodes in the neck are infected etc.

Treatment is antibiotic therapy which will kill the TB bacteria

Wherever you have it, bones, kidneys, lungs, digestive system and sometimes everywhere (miliary tb) You feel unwell, lose weight, often have a cough and night sweats.
Bones ache, kidney trouble leads to urinary andd reproductive problems, sometimes blood in urine and there is an ache in the loins, stomach, gives rise to nausea and gastric pain, lungs productive cough that never goes away, often accompanied by swollen glands.
It can infect the covering of the brain giving rise tb meningitis which presents as headaches, nausea, again weight loss.

Mono is not airborne.  It is transferred by saliva.



Do not come into contact with anything that may have contacted saliva.....Wash your hands often as most illnesses are transferred by contact.  Studies suggest that washing often is just as effective as disinfectants.

I had a dermatologist remove my moles with a laser. I felt a slight sting but it was quick and easy. But I would recommend having it cut off since it is on your face and they can stitch it after (smaller scar). The only pain you feel is the shot of the local anesthetic.

Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is a very common infection and many women get this infection as some point in their life. BV occurs when the bacteria becomes unbalanced in the vagina. Although BV is treatable and curable, the symptoms are usually unpleasant. If you have bacterial vaginosis at least 4 times a year, then this is called recurring bacterial vaginosis infections. It is important to see your doctor if you are having recurring BV infections. Luckily, there are a few things that you can do to stop recurring bacterial vaginosis infections.

Things You’ll Need:
Health evaluation 
Physical examination 
Pelvic exam 
Lab tests 
Appropriate treatment method (antibiotics, hormonal therapy, etc.) 
RepHresh vaginal gel



Step1



Schedule an appointment with your doctor. In order to stop recurring bacterial vaginosis infections, it is important to visit your doctor in order to find out the specific reason for the infections. There are different reasons why a woman may get bacterial vaginosis, such as hormonal imbalances due to pregnancy, menopause and menstruation, using feminine hygiene products, having multiple sexual partners (or a new sex partner), stress, a weakened immune system from an illness such as diabetes or HIV, douching too often and using scented panty liners, pads or tampons.



Step2



Discuss the test results and treatment options with your doctor. Your doctor informs you of your test results and lets you know how you can best treat the recurring bacterial vaginosis infections. Your doctor may first prescribe you an oral antibiotic (metronidazole or clindamycin) or a vaginal cream or gel to cure the BV infection. He then proceeds to treat the underlying cause for the recurring bacterial vaginosis infections which may involve additional medications, hormonal therapy, or suggesting certain changes to your diet or lifestyle behavior.



Step3



Use RepHresh vaginal gel to help prevent recurring BV infections. RepHresh is an over-the-counter product that helps to keep the pH level balanced in the vagina, which reduces your chances of getting recurring bacterial vaginosis infections. You can use this product once every 3 days at anytime of the day (especially after having your menstrual cycle or having sexual intercourse). Visit rephresh.com for more information about this product.



Step4



Follow a well-balanced diet plan. Be sure to eat healthy food and nutritional meals everyday. Try to avoid eating sugary food, soy sauce, cheese and chocolate and refrain from drinking soda, coffee or alcohol, because these types of food products puts you at a higher risk of developing recurring bacterial vaginosis infections.



Step5



Clean your vaginal area each day. Try taking showers instead of baths and be sure to properly clean the vaginal area with soap and water everyday, to help stop bacterial vaginosis infections.

I had a terrible time with BV in my mid-twenties.  My doc told me lots of women get these infections around this age due to hormonal and pH changes in the vaginal area.  BV is actually an overgrowth of your own bacteria, not anything you contracted from anyone, so that's why it is possible you still get them and aren't having sex.

One thing my doc suggested was to eat lots of yogurt to replenish the supply of "good" bacteria in the vaginal area.

Also she told me I could buy PLAIN yogurt and insert it into my vaginal area as well, which I was always a little too grossed out to try, but she told me it would be okay, so long as the yogurt is plain.

I stuck to eating it and had luck. I'm in my mid 30's now and I haven't had problems in years.



Good luck, it should gradually get better for you.

For anyone who has ever had Pelvic Inflammatory Disease?



Please onyl answer if you have had PID as I want first hand experience...thanks.

Ok I got pelvic inflammatory disease because my ex cheated on me and gave me chlamydia, because I didnt know and it went untreated it developed into pretty bad PID very quickly. So much so I was in hospital being treated for 2 weeks, I could barely get out of bed to go to the toilet and was continually sick, I lost a stone in 2 weeks.
This was 4 years ago.
2 years ago I was getting really bad pains again, especially period pains but x100000 worse than I had ever had before so I got referred to a specialist who did an operation to remove scar tissue left from the PID, he said it was the worst he had seen, my womb and fallopiean tubes had become stuck together and stuck to my bowel.
After he said I was normal now but never really answered the question would I still be able to have children, he sort of just said who knows in a round about way.

My question is has anyone who has suffered from this had children/struggled to have children/unable to have children.
Do you still get bad pains because I do 2 weeks before my Period and throughout (so most of the time!)

I'm 21 now and have a lovely boyfriend who I want to have children with but now I am getting so worried, I havent been taking my pill for 3 months and nothing has happend?

dark urine is usually a sign of dehydration, (concentrated urine) or an infection, or kidney problems....dribbling is just a symptom of old age......sometimes well before 80....just make sure he keeps clean, or the will smell.

I think I got mono from my friend?



Mono has been going around my school now for about a week and so has pink eye. My friend was complaining of a sore throat and fatigue on Friday and me (being extremely stupid) shared food with her that day at lunch. Well... Saturday my throat started getting a little sore but I didn't think much of it until my friend today (Tuesday) told me that she has mono. I'm thinking "Oh crap, what now?" My throat is raw right now and even just going up or down stairs gets me winded and there's a white-ish film around my tonsils. Do I have mono, and if I do, any advice on how to get rid of this?

Does warfarin make your heart beat faster?



I know warfarin thins your blood to reduce blood clots, but does it make a weak heart pump faster?  As my mother was given warfarin last week yesterday as she has a slow/weak heart low blood pressure anyway yesterday she died from an enlarged heart. Now i am pretty sure the warfarin made her weak heart pump harder which created an enlarged heart (overworked) if i am right then this would be negligent on the consultants behalf? Please correct if i am wrong



</question>



<additional details>



if warfarin did not create an enalrged heart why wasnt she prescribed beta blockers or pacemaker, as she had vht i think one of her chambers wasnt working properly plus she had TTP (bloody disorder)

I am so sorry for your loss.
I agree with Rhianna, Warfarin would not cause cadiomegaly (an enlarged heart) this occurs over time. Without knowing your Mums history Warfarin is given for several cardiac conditions but as previously mentioned it does thin the blood and makes it easier for the heart to pump around the body so it may have been given to ease the strain on Mum's already weak heart.
Nothing can ease your pain right now but I'll think of you.

I wouldn't have though so, warfarin would have thinned her blood so it passed through easier.. I don't believe the consult was being negligent.. I would think its just a coincidence that she was put on Warfarin before her heart enlarged.
Obviously I'm not a medical person so its just my opinion.

Sorry about your mum. But I genuinely think it  is a coincidence she was put on the drug before hand.

Edit: Perhaps you need to take this up with someone in the medical field, who can give you precise answers. Right now you are grieving therefore not thinking straight.. Talk it through with someone who knows what they are talking about. All we know, is what we have looked on Google for.

Warfarin was prescribed not to make her heart beat faster (which it doesn't do), but to lower the possibility of clots which is increased when the heart beats slowly. 
The enlarged heart, although predisposing to death, was NOT the cause of death. I suspect heart failure was. Heart enlargement does not occur overnight, but rather over months/years.
Rather than trying to "blame" anyone for her death, you would probably do better health wise for yourself if you found a bereavement support group.
I hurt with you. I lost both parents, both parents-in-law, my only sibling and my husband within 6 years.  I survived with the help of bereavement support and counseling.

Take care; be well.

I am sorry for your loss.

Warfarin does not actually reduce the thickness or thinness of your blood.  As you correctly stated it does inhibit the blood from forming clots (inhibit blood changing from a liquid state to a solid state).  This is done by inhibiting clotting factors within the blood.  Inhibiting clotting factors does not in any way create or effect a weak heart.  Warfarin is typically used to reduce the risk of having a stroke.



A weak heart (or congestive heart failure) is usually from one or a combination of several things.



A bad valve or valves
Uncontrolled high blood pressure over time
Prior heart attacks or chronic blockages in the arteries.
Irregular heart rhythms
Occasionally it is has no known cause

All of these conditions develop over many years but may not have symptoms until the condition is hard or impossible to fix.

Again, I am sorry for the loss of your mother.  The warfarin, however, was not the source of your mother's worsening heart failure.

Monday morning quarterbacking through Yahoo! answers without appropriate medical records will not be productive.  If you need, have a conversation with your mother's doctor who can authoritatively answer your questions and explain her therapies.  Unfortunately there are many medical conditions that do not have cures and sometimes even very good treatments.

Good luck.

Sore Throat? Why is this?



Two days ago, I started to get a sore throat, it got really bad, and yesterday my tonsels were swollen, it looked so bad, i went the doctors, i had a blood test for glandular fever, they said it might be tonsilitus but it was just to rule it out. I got some peniclin. I had a fever aswel, me arms and legs were aching, and my skin hurt when i was cold. Today, I feel ok, :S my throats still a little sore, not swollen, i can eat, and only talk a little differently, cause it feels like theres something in my throat. Has it gone? Or will it be back?

It is good that you had shown the condition to a doctor and followed his / her advice. 
There is a home remedy that seems to be working for me. In hot water, I dissolve some table salt and then add turmeric powder. I use this solution to gargle every day in the morning. It appears to be solving the condition.
There are times when one suffers Sinusitis and the fluids from the sinuses descend into the throat causing irritation. Over a long period of time, I clean-up my sinuses by fomentation with hot water (inhaling steam wthout medicines) to prevent sore throat.

To me it sounds like you caught some kind of cold virus if it's not tonsillitis,sometimes comes with fever sometimes just sore throat.
it normally take 3-7 days go away by itself.
if you've got swollen lymph node too, you better take some antibiotics,it won't come back until you got the virus again.

Your body withdrawing while you sleep will cause the twitching. As for the rest could be cotton fever, should get of the dope. Cotton Fever is a blood infection from using IV drugs it is very common and has the same symptoms as you described. Google cotton fever,  serious business can tough it out but I would go see doctor, good luck

The symptoms of cotton fever resemble those of sepsis and patients are initially misdiagnosed upon admission to a hospital. However sepsis is a serious medical condition which can lead to death, whereas cotton fever, if left alone, will usually resolve itself spontaneously within 12-24 hours. Symptoms usually appear with 10-20 minutes after injection and in addition to fever may include headaches, malaise, chills, nausea and tachycardia. The fever itself usually reaches 38.5 - 40.3°C (101 - 105°F) within the first hour.

Ironically, Cotton Fever can produce nearly the exact same symptoms of drug withdrawal that an Intravenous Drug user is trying to get rid of when he/she is experiencing drug (particularly heroin) withdrawal. In many instances, (but not all) Cotton Fever can be avoided by an Intravenous user being extremely careful in their approach.

It sounds like it could be a few things. 
It could be cotton fever/the bends. Scientists don't really know the cause but most users report it is from injecting a dirty hit which could be from fibres in the filter, dirt in the water, or the stuff the hit may be cut with-- of which signs and symptoms could be:
-nausea, diarrhea, shivers, convulsive shaking, headache, hot/cold sweating, and twitches

It may also be a small blood clot/embolism. A small embolism can travel to the brain causing a decrease in the amount of blood flow to the brain. This can cause numbness/weakness in any part of the body, fainting, blurred vision, speech problems, unconsciousness, or death --- but symptoms may resolve if it was a small embolism that resolved on its own.

Or it could have something to do with dosing of the heroin and methadone. Or it could have nothing to do with his drug use at all. But Bottom line: your friend needs to see a doctor immediately. Symptoms like the ones you described can ultimately lead to death.



I would go over his injecting habits and learn about harm reduction techniques to reduce the likelihood of these conditions from occurring

you can get it through any kind of contact with almost any kind of body fluid, so if you have an opened wound for example, and a body fluid from another person who is infected get on that wound you are likely to be infected as well, also if you share a needle with somebody who is infected, you can get it, that is for hiv and aids, some STDS can be transmitted by like for example, if somebody had crabs, and they used a public restroom, and you used that same toilet before it has been sanitized, you can get crabs and things like that.

Your question, the way it is written frankly worries me, no in fact it does more than that. I feel that you seem frightened about your situation. I do not know how old you are but you need to speak to someone like your doctor about all the above because, with no offence intended, your question is written in such a way as to be from someone who is either quite young, typing this out covertly, or not very articulate.



In any of the above you do need help, now.



If the doctor will not help then go to the local hospital, ask to see a female nurse.

Horrendous spelling/grammar

You don't have to have sexual intercourse to transmit HIV and Hepatitis, being in contact with infected bodily fluids if you have an open wound etc can put you at risk. Again, with regards to other STI's, if you have had any kind of unprotected sexual contact at all, you are at risk. UTI's are not STD's if you have a UTI, then your Dr can determine this and provide you with antibiotics. If you have a vaginal infection, again your GP can take a swab and then treat accordingly. To be honest. I stopped reading your question half way through because of the graphic vulgar content..and I'm finding it hard to take you seriously.

Your sinus gets congested as far as i know. Just above your nose... between your eyebrows is where all the gross stuff is when you have a cold.

That all contributes to you getting drowsy, sore eyes and nose gets all... you know!!

To talk normally always blow your nose and clear your throat.. take strepsils... thats what they have where i live!

Sinus will swell up and it alters how you sound. They sell things to help but I believe in letting a cold work its own way out. These things you buy just ease it for a few hours then the cold is just as bad. I suppose if you are doing a speech in public or something like that then it would be useful to use them.

They check your cells, to make sure they are normal.  I believe they also check for Gonorehha and clyamidia by routine.  You have to ask for other testing to be done, otherwise they wont look for it.  Every test is dont differently so they need to know what to test for.  Example:  Doing a pap smear wont show if you have herpes.  They have to check for herpes.  It also depends on the doctor, some do the bare minimum.

the smear test will involve putting a metal specular into your vagina to open it up a bit, then they will swab your uterus with what looks like a giant Qtip, collecting cells which they will send away for analyse... this process should not hurt.

sadly no it will not detect any STD as this is a test for cancer / pre cancerous cells... so they wouldn't be looking for an |STD. this would have to be a separate test.. ask while your having your smear and they will tell you where to go to get tested.

mainly getting your tonsils out is dangerouse because its very easy for bacteria to grow in your mouth. under normal conditions the bacteria has to work very hard to get into our bloodstream which is why the bacteria usually doesnt get too far. When you have a heling open would in your mouth it makes it very easy for that bacteria to get into your blood stream.  Take the opportunity to quit smoking. I smoke and i think getting my tonsils out is the only thing that would help me quit. 
but really dont play games with your mouth. you can really die. fortunatley your mouth is one of the fastest healing things on your body. 
stay away from smoking and drinking alcohal of coarse but even such things as sugars and drinks from restraunts can **** you up. stick to bottled drinks tht have a safety seal. dont have any drinks with ice cuz ice is notoriousley dirty. restraunts never do a great job cleaning their utensils or ice machines so i would stay away from eating out. ask your doctor how long you need to avoid these things. your only 21. your not too incredibly old. just be glad your not 31.

Adults generally stay in hospital a little longer than children when they have their Tonsils out. I had mine out when I was 9. I remember being in hospital about 3 days? The operation itself in fairly minor, your throat will be a little sore for awhile after, but really it isn't that bad.

Expect to have a sore throat when you come round. I would avoid both cigarettes and alcohol for at least twenty four hours following a general anaesthetic. You may stay overnight, a couple of days or be allowed home the same night it depends on the hospital.

I've had mine removed and it wasn't too bad. It depends how they operate, I had a general anaesthetic but sometimes they do it with a local, which I think would be quite horrible. They simply cut the tonsils away from the throat, and leave it (no stitches) so you have two wound on your throat which heal quite quickly. I was out of hospital the next day. Afterwards it felt like I had a really, really sore throat and I had to be careful what I ate and drank. To be honest you'll probably find that you don't fancy trying to drink and smoke, but your doctor should be able to give you guidance. I say stock up on the nicotine patches.

I have provided you with a couple of links below that tell you more about the procedure and aftercare. The first is from WebMD and the next is a link from www.ent.org a website for the specialists that would do the surgery. I noticed there are new procedures for limiting post op problems. Best bet is call the doctor's office and ask about cigarettes and alcohol. Personally, I would take the opportunity to attempt to quit smoking as it is an expensive and very addictive habit and cancer is not pleasant. Especially of the throat or worse yet the esophagus. I have heard some horror stories too about having that procedure done as an adult but with the new techniques you should be fine. Contact your state's Medical Association and read about the surgeon doing the procedure. Ensure your surgeon has a good reputation and success rate with the procedure. If I can be of any other help feel free to contact me. Hope this helps and if you have already gotten a second opinion and the doctors agree that surgery is the best option it should not be that big a deal if you are relatively healthy 21 year old.

Constant tonsillitis an be a real pain.  I had mine out when I was 18.  I was not in hospital for long.  If they are swollen and infected the surgeon will not take them out so you should see your GP about managing the tonsils until the operation.  Gargle with boiled hot but slightly cooled salted hot water before and after the operation to fight infection naturally.
I discovered afterwards that it was my thyroid that was actually the problem so I strongly suggest you get a full thyroid panel from your doctor to see if you have the condition.  TSH, T3 and antibodies to Hashimotos which is the most common thyroid condition at a young age.  Don't let your doctor pooh pooh the idea, just ask again quietly for the blood test.
Also, before you have the operation stock up on jelly, ice cream and frozen lollies.  They are a godsend after the operation.
Try to switch to nicotine patches a couple of days before to help you get over the withdrawal.  You won't want to smoke afterwards a cigarette will really hurt!
The FACTS:
What is it?
The tonsils are made of special tissues which fight infection. There are lots of other areas in the head and neck and throughout the body made of this tissue, so even without the tonsils the body can still fight infection. If the tonsils are becoming infected very often (tonsillitis), making you ill and having to take time off work, it is best to remove them.

The Operation
You will have a general anaesthetic and be completely asleep. The surgeon removes the tonsils through the mouth and stops any bleeding. A special instrument called diathermia (a Greek word which means by applying heat) is usually used which can free the tonsils and at the same time can stop the bleeding by applying a wave of heat on the small blood vessels. Because you are completely asleep you will not feel any pain during your operation. Provided that you are eating and drinking normally, and there is no sign of any infection, you will be fit to go home one or two days after your operation.

Any Alternatives
There are no tablets or medicines that will stop you from getting tonsillitis. Antibiotics can help to make the tonsillitis get better. If the tonsils are becoming infected frequently, antibiotics may not work very well. The only way to stop you getting tonsillitis is to remove the tonsils.

Before the operation
Stop smoking and get your weight down if you are overweight. (See Healthy Living). If you know that you have problems with your blood pressure, your heart, or your lungs, ask your family doctor to check that these are under control. Check the hospital's advice about taking the Pill or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Check you have a relative or friend who can come with you to the hospital, take you home, and look after you for the first week after the operation. Sort out any tablets, medicines, inhalers that you are using. Keep them in their original boxes and packets. Bring them to the hospital with you. On the ward, you may be checked for past illnesses and may have special tests to make sure that you are well prepared and that you can have the operation as safely as possible.

Please tell the doctors and nurses of any allergies to tablets, medicines or dressings. You will have the operation explained to you and will be asked to fill in an operation consent form. Many hospitals now run special preadmission clinics, where you visit for an hour or two, a few weeks or so before the operation for these checks. If you have a cold or tonsillitis in the week before your admission to hospital, please telephone the ward and let the ward sister know. The operation will usually be put off, and you will be given time to get better before being sent for again. You will need to get over the cold or the tonsillitis before you have the operation because by having an anaesthetic, the cold or the tonsillitis could turn into a serious chest infection.

After - In Hospital
You may be given oxygen from a face mask for a few hours if you have had any chest problems in the past. To start with you will have a sore throat and some stiffness of your jaws. You may also find that you have a mild earache. The nurses will give you medicine or an injection to help with the soreness. Ask for more if the pain is not well controlled or if it gets worse. A general anaesthetic may make you slow, clumsy and forgetful for about 24 hours. The nurses will help you with everything you need until you are able to do things for yourself. Do not make important decisions during this time. It is very important for you to eat and chew solid, soft food (normal meals not just drinks), as soon as possible after your operation. Some ice cream is an ideal first meal after this operation because it's soft and offers comfort for the sore throat. It will be a bit difficult initially to have solid food but actually makes your sore throat go away more quickly. Solid, chewed food going down your throat will keep it clean and help it to

Having your tonsils out these days is nowhere near as bad as it used to be.  They don't give you stitches as they used to...they do something called cauterization.  They use special instruments that burn the tissue, causing it to scab over and form scar tissue.  I've heard that it's a little more painful afterwards the older you are, but I have 2 daughters who had their tonsils out...one was 5, and the other was 9.  The 5 yr old went back to school the next day.  The 9 yr old ended up having 7 follow up surgeries to stop some intense bleeding.  They tend to send you home the same day now...on a restricted diet.  Drink plenty of fluids...not milk...to keep it moist back there and you'll probably be fine as far as the scabbing/scarring goes.  Eat popsicles, or sherbet...no ice cream, nothing crunchy, and don't drink from a straw for a week or so.  They will give you pain meds and probably an antibiotic.  You'll be in and out of surgery in less than an hour, maybe 2 at the very most, usually. And unless you're vomitting, or running a high fever afterwards, you usually go home the same day too.



Last bit of advice...get a second opinion.  Less adults get their tonsils out nowadays because they believe that the tonsils are the first point of contact with infection...keeping it from heading down to your chest.  If you've had frequent infections...4 or more a year, then you most likely will get the same recommendation from the second doc...but if this is just something you go through once or twice a year, well you might want to opt out.



Oh, and if you sing, and you're good at it, don't be surprised if you can't sing as well afterwards.  You shouldn't smoke for a week at the very least...same thing as with using a straw...the sucking motion from using a straw or from inhaling can loosen the scabs.  Alcohol thins your blood and lowers your immunity, so hold off on that until you go back for a check up to make sure you're healing properly.

And after the surgery, when the doc tells you that you had the largest tonsils he/she has ever seen...well I think that's just their way of justifying the need because every doc I've ever met who does a tonsillectomy says the same thing to their patient afterwards.

Questions About MRSA?



My friend's child has MRSA. It's in his ear and it's draining. He's on a second round of antibiotics (same one they used the first time?) They keep tissue in his ear to keep it from leaking. 
I knew they were going to be at a gathering so I told my children,who are all under 7, that they did not need to be getting in his face or touching his ear. If they did, then they needed to go wash their hands. Also, if they saw him touching his ear then touching a toy, they should not touch that toy. 
His mom got mad and left when she found out I told them that. Her husband later called mine and chewed him out. He said that their boy was not contagious because he's been on antibiotics for a couple days and that we were over reacting. Among other not so nice things.

They haven't been back to the doctor to be sure that the antibiotics are working yet and 
his ear is still leaking.



How contagious is MRSA? Isn't it fatal if it gets in the blood?
Is it over reacting to tell your children to wash their hands after being in close contact with another child that has MRSA even though he's being treated?
What would you have done?

It was very smart of you to tell your children to wash their hands, avoid toys, etc.  And MRSA is contagious through contact.  I would have done the same or perhaps not even let my kids play with him.



Patients with MRSA in the hospital are put on contact precautions.  That means that all staff to gown and glove before entering the room.  Visitors are encouraged to do the same but typically refuse as it is impersonal to the patient.  For the visitors who do refuse, I encourage thourough hand washing before leaving the room.

While it is good that he is on antibiotics, until the MRSA has cleared up he still is contagious.

What you have to do is get used to inhaling. The way to do this is to take a small puff, and inhale very slowly. When you start to feel the urge to cough, hold your breath and try really hard to not cough. When the feeling passes, exhale the smoke, and do it again. If you do this for just 4 or 5 puffs, trying hard to not cough, you should be able to easily inhale without coughing. After that, you have to work on building up a tolerance to the nicotine so that you can smoke a whole cigarette without getting dizzy. When you are ready for this, write me and I will help.
Congratulations on starting!

Ummmmmm what? You have decided to smoke thus you have decided to have a constant cough. The two go hand in hand, there is no possible way to stop coughing while you smoke.

You are coughing because you lungs are trying to rid itself of nasty build up. If you didn't cough then this build up will get to a point where you can longer breathe.



"Please don't write you shouldn't smoke or something like that"



Are you kidding? I can't figure out if this is a serious question or some kind of joke.

Learn to stay away from others when they are sick and WASH your hands often with soap and hot water.  The CDC says that this is the most effective way of slowing down the transmission of colds, flu and other easily transmitted diseases.  Carry antibiotic wipes with you or keep little bottles of a waterless, antibiotic hand cleaner with you.  We keep it in the car and use it as soon as we come out of the stores from shopping.  However, only use these things when you don't have a sink close by to wash your hands.  Using antibacterial soaps and washes all the time can cause many germs to mutate and become hard to kill.  Make sure to eat a healthy diet, and get the required amount of sleep each night.  Take a multiple vitiamin each day.  If you don't eat enough foods that contain vitamin C, you may want to take a little extra each day, but taking it in great amounts does not actually do anything.  It is all flushed from the body every day anyhow.  All you need is the daily required amount....

Like the guy said dress in warm layers, would you rather be cute or sick? Another thing is to keep your hands clean, wash with soap, not just rinsing with water. Also keep antibacterial wipes or liquid in your purse that can help keep germs from spreading on your body and getting you sick.
I am not saying you do not keep your hands clean, but people that lack clean hygiene with their hands tend to get sick easier/faster...and once again make sure you dress warmly. I am a Christina and I know that colds can be a spiritual thing as well so you might want to look up what could be going on in your life to be causing you to hava a cold all of the times.

This has happened to me before, twice actually. The first time I got super sick and it turned into an ear infection and I couldn't hear for like two weeks. I had to go to the doctor, I don't remember what he prescribed though. The second time happened to one of my ears like a few weeks ago, I had too much wax in there so I had to go to the doctor to get it cleaned out. Either way, you need to go to the doctor.

Sounds like you had a head cold or sinus infection.

Anyways, if you still can't hear out of your ear in the morning, you probably have an ear infection. No big deal, just see a doctor before t gets too painful, he'll give you some antibiotics and maybe some pain killers if you have pain, cause ear infections can be really painful.'

Get yourself to the doctor before it gets worse and I speak from experience.  One ear infection turned into two infections and a sinus infection.  I couldn't hear at all at first and it didn't get better for over a month.  People had to almost yell to talk to me.  Telephone conversations just didn't happen.

Yes its normal, I've had this happen to me when I never even heard of it before I was freaking out. Coughing and blowing your nose causes your ears to pop (when their already stuffed up and congested) It will eventually unpop just try moving your jaw chewing gum and I found even blowing your nose again will unpop it

Im from South Georgia so i deal with this situation Alot. First things first, stop with all those bullshit meds you got and go out and buy you some IVY-DRY it stops itching, and oozing, and basically dries the rash up within a couple of days. Another thing this liquid coming out is what spreads the rash, keep that stuff off your body of your going to get it everywhere. wrap it up in some gauze of something. dont clean it so much. Touching the raze to much is what causes the oozing in the first place. Hope this helps. let me know if you need any other info.

Genital herpes or a cut on the perineal skin that is between the vagina and anus?



my boyfriend and i had rough sex yesterday. and after when i pee, i noticed on the skin part (between the vagina and the anus) has some ONE red dried blood abrasion (its super super tiny that i dont know if its a cut or blister) ITS SO TINY... we both been tested and is NEGATIVE for everything. this was our 1st time again since a rape happened to me about a year ago (WHICH IVE BEEN TESTED AND IS NEGATIVE FOR EVERYTHING).. ive been tested over 10 times..

also to mention, i am positive for herpes type 1 on my lips since a kid.. if this is genital herpes, its 1 little tiny tear that happened after 10 min of sex bc i did not feel it before sex nor when i peed. but after sex, when i peed i felt it burn.. if this is hsv-2 .. its certainly a walk in the park for me..

is this genital herpes u think or a rough sex tear bc he was goin to fast and to hard...

Sounds like a tear, hon.  I get them, too and I'm free and clear.  They tend to be a little tender, so be careful when you wipe!  Dab, don't smear the paper.  Keep some baby wipes handy and take showers instead of baths.  Best of luck!

It sure sounds like genital herpes.  I have it and it's not as bad as people make it out to be.  The name "Herpes" just sound disgusting.  I haven't had an outbreak every since I was diagnosed with it about 5 years ago and I'm not on any medication.  My husband nor child (vaginally delivered) has it either.



BTW, I was just like you.  I felt it that very next day.  So to all the people who's saying it couldn't show up the next day that is so not true.

It is a good idea to urinate after sex and take cranberry juice...to avoid UTI.

Use lubricants.

I got anal cancer...which you can get from these type of abrasions...
You might consider Gardasil shots.



When you get anal cancer they radiate you until your skin FALLS OFF. OVER AND OVER...THEN YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR BLADDER OR BOWELS.

Now That is not a walk in the park.

You might consider condoms...it's your body.

For anyone who has ever had Pelvic Inflammatory Disease?



Please only answer if you have had PID as I want first hand experience...Thanks

Ok I got pelvic inflammatory disease because my ex cheated on me and gave me chlamydia, because I didnt know and it went untreated it developed into pretty bad PID very quickly. So much so I was in hospital being treated for 2 weeks, I could barely get out of bed to go to the toilet and was continually sick, I lost a stone in 2 weeks.
This was 4 years ago.
2 years ago I was getting really bad pains again, especially period pains but x100000 worse than I had ever had before so I got referred to a specialist who did an operation to remove scar tissue left from the PID, he said it was the worst he had seen, my womb and fallopiean tubes had become stuck together and stuck to my bowel.
After he said I was normal now but never really answered the question would I still be able to have children, he sort of just said who knows in a round about way.

My question is has anyone who has suffered from this had children/struggled to have children/unable to have children.
Do you still get bad pains because I do 2 weeks before my Period and throughout (so most of the time!)

I'm 21 now and have a lovely boyfriend who I want to have children with but now I am getting so worried, I havent been taking my pill for 3 months and nothing has happend?

nope.. PID is very bad on your reproduction system. It is highly unlikely you can  become pregnant. that is why it is important to get tested always.. unfortunately you failed to do that, contracted a STD from ur partner and now u have to pay the unfortunate price. I  am extremely sorry sweetie.. but u should consider of adoption..

when my daughter had chicken pox they looked like little burns on her back, does sound like it but there are a lot of bugs going around at the moment, cover the spots with some camomile lotion just in case(will reduce the itching) wait to see if he gets more but do get him in at the doctors, also keep him off school and let his friends and your friends know that it is likely he has got chicken pox, if he has they will all come out today and tomorrow. Hope this helps.

The chickenpox rash occurs in three stages. First, there are raised pink or red bumps (papules). These bumps will turn into fluid-filled blisters (vesicles). And, finally, the vesicles will crust over and scab. It's possible that all three of these stages may occur at once.

The rash may be preceded by or accompanied by:



* Fever



* Abdominal pain or loss of appetite



* Mild headache



* General feeling of unease and discomfort (malaise) or irritability



* A dry cough



* Headache

Common sites for the rash include the face, scalp, chest and back. The rash can also spread across your entire body, even into your throat, eyes and vagina. New spots continue to appear for several days. In healthy children, the disease is generally mild.

Antibiotics for children?



Why would my Pediatrician insist on a Chest X-ray and bloodwork first b4 antibiotics for my child. His breath sounds are clear and he has just a small amount of post-nasal drip, no cough. Bloodwork? What would that should relating to an infection besides the WBC's. I didn't think you could tell if an intection was bacterial or virus by bloodwork. Maybe a blood culture but again- you would have to wait three days. Why the run around? my son had been sick for 18 days. For many days he has been temping 103 constantly- I have to give Tylenol and Motrin constantly. Only the Motrin really works... please what gives!



</question>



<additional details>



OK, I'm not too upset about the bloodwork but what would a ch x-ray show? He lungs are CTA. Atelectisis?



ok, I understand society as a whole will benefit from less antibiotic use but itsn't this a clear case of a prolonged fever and illness- why not antibiotics for the truly sick. I mean virus usally goes away after 14 days right? I just see my little one so very sick and really think it is bacterial. I thought MRSA was a rarity and mostly nosicomial  (yes, I know it's on the rise). Can not prescribing Amoxicllin to my child really impede this in any way! My kid id quite feverish and sick.

it is protocol at any ER or docs office usually, to order a CXR and bloodwork on children especially. Especially if he had a fever..that is a given to do all these tests..and plus..in today's wonderful society doctors have to cover their butts, for fear of lawsuits. and..anti-biotics arent always the best way to treat an illness..especially in kids...antibiotics are being overused, and are causing strains of illness causing bacteria to mutate and become 'stronger' and harder to treat.

Also, if I have to get a Ch x-ray and bloodwork every time my little one is in need of antibiotics (he doesn't need it too often) totally ridiculous. unnecessary radiation is not harmless.... Again people... only thing I can think of is a raised WBC. Can you tell if an infection is viral ve. bacteri

viral vs. bacterial via the blood testing (aside from 3 day cultures). I believe looking at the bands you can see if the infection is getting better or worse but that's it...

There are many different kinds of antibiotics just as there are many different kinds of disease.It sounds like this doctor simply wants to find out what is wrong with your child before arbitrarily writing a prescription.
Many a virus does not just clear up after 14 days; eg. EBV, influenza, HIV, sars, etc, etc.
A chest x-ray can show if the lungs are involved or not, narrowing down the potential illness.

Your doctor is doing everything he can to find out what is wrong with your child.  X rays will show if there is problems with the lungs , heart, and other things.  Blood work will tell a lot of stories, especially if there are increased amounts of white cells.  It all depends on what tests he is running.  If you are so upset with what your doctor is doing, find another one.  Personally, I think he is following procedure very well.  Too many doctors give antibiotics just because their patients expect to get a prescription for them when they see a doctor or they feel the visit was worthless.  Many doctors just give in to the patients.  Apparently your doctor does not think antibiotics are warranted at this time.  I would trust his judgment.  He has a lot more knowledge than you in this area.....

Vitam B6 side effects?



I have recently started taking 100mg of B6 to help with my irregular cycles,

But I have come out with big red itchy swelling under my eyes. Would it be related? My lips are also cracked and sore.

Problem is is that I have googled it and found:

'Signs of vitamin B6 deficiency include dermatitis (skin inflammation),
glossitis (a sore tongue),
Prolonged deprivation leads to pellagra, a disease characterized by skin
lesions, eczema..'

******BUT******

'There have been extremely rare reports of allergic skin reactions to high doses of vitamin B6 supplements.'

So, I am confused.

the only other thing i have changed is stopped drinking soy and got back onto small amounts of dairy... but we are talking 4-5 cups tea/ day and a few spoons of yoghurt.

Well after an abortion you will bleed pretty steadily for about 2+ weeks and have discharge for about that long afterward. When you go for your check up (your abortion follow up) you can ask them. Call your doctor or go to Planned Parenthood. Also, get on something so you don't have to keep having abortions done. It's for your own psychological and emotional well being, and infection risk. Also it can create complications for when you do want children and you may not have the easiest pregnancy. When you get checked out they can tell you if you're in the clear. Remember to take care of yourself.

Now, Another lump has "appeared" under my arms.

Any advice on what to do and what it is?

Well I dont know is it like white tip? It might just be an infection under the skin. This is gonna sound weird but, pinch it. If white pus comes out then keep pinching and then when clear liquid comes that means the infection is cleared out. It will swell for a little but then go down.

From your lip, it just means that you bit that spot and it's the body natural way to heal itself through inflammatory healing. If you do feel pain get those OTC Oral anesthestics like Oragel and apply there. Lump under your arms.. Hmmm mystery diagnosis for me. Could be many reasons. If it stays under there after 2 weeks have it checked with your doctor. You may have staph.

We have had a very scary brush w/Mersa around where I live and it always starts with knots or whitehead looking pimples that will eventually burst and all kinds of pus will come out..it is a form of staff infection that can kill you.  There is a little girl that lives right down the street from me that went to an amusement park, and after she rode a few rides her hip was getting so sore that she could barely walk.  Well her parents took her to the ER, thinking she might have popped her hip out of place on one of those rides.  Well, they tested her and she had lumps with Mersa on the inside rather than coming out like a pimple on the outside.  They actually flew her to Children's Hospital in Columbus  [OHIO], because if it spread into her blood system it could have killed her.  Also one man has died from it around here.  It certainly is nothing to mess with, like I said, if it gets in your blood, you're in some serious need of medical attention. Which you sound like you need to do anyway,,,Good Luck and don't put it off

Your lump is most likely to be a small sebaceous cyst. These are usually situated just under the skin, and can easily become infected via a hair follicle. When infection occurs they tend to become tender. In most cases the infection will clear spontaneously, but sometimes antibiotics will be required, and occasionally the infected cyst will need to be drained surgically.

Another possible cause of a lump in the armpit is an enlarged lymph gland. This might be due to a minor skin infection, (If you are a woman)perhaps picked up while shaving under the arms. Lymph glands are a normal part of the immune system's defence against infection. When glands have become enlarged it usually takes several weeks for them to return to their usual imperceptible size.

It is very unlikely that the lump you have found has a more serious cause, but since it has been there for several months it would be wise to see your GP. He or she will be able to ask further questions and examine the lump. If it is thought to be a lymph gland your GP will also want to examine your breasts and possibly to organise a blood test.

Meningitis question,who is at risk?



Hi,I was wondering why patients with meningitis were quarantined in the hospital,meningitis can be caused by many types of bacteria including some common everyday bacteria such as strep etc but the problem starts with the patient provides a route of entry to the CNS system due to a medical condition.So basically to the hospital worker why would he or she not develop a sore throat or something similar when in contact to this bacteria and not meningitis because they are not presenting a route of entry like the real patient was?Or maybe the quarantine wasnt to protect the outsiders but thge patient?

Simply when is a relatively common strain of bacteria is the risk for meningitis,I did not think everyone was at risk because how is the bacteria going to enter our CNS?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



You do have a lot of questions, and I would like to try answer most of them...

First off, meningitis is a CNS infection, bacteria going into the meninges infecting the surrounding fluids,etc. Bacteria can enter through the circulatory system (blood), a direct opening through the cranium (like an open skull fracture), or nasal fracture or nasal injury [we harbor many types of organisms in our nasopharynx (nose and throat area), like the infamous Neisseria meningitidis causing meningococcemia]. These organisms travel through the cavernous sinuses which are in direct contact with the brain and meninges.
Also, infections of the ear, can get to the brain...

You're asking why hospital workers like nurses do not develop meningitis when they are in contact with meningitis patients, and what is the purpose of the quarantine?

They do have the risk of contracting the bacteria, but they take special precautions to avoid it, like gloves, masks, even gowns, and strict handwashing... most of these bacteria do not only cause meningitis, but also some respiratory infections, or even just be asymptomatic (making the people "carriers")

the quarantine is also to protect the patient from other infections, since  the illness itself brings down the immune system...



In general, common bacteria like streptococci or meningococci would not cause meningitis in everyone, since they are usually "harmless", but are deadly in some groups, like immunocompromised patients, infants, and the elderly...

Gosh, I hope that helped! Good luck!



</answer>

I realize all the precautions staff take etc but many people feel if you walk into a patients room of someone with meningitis that you are also going to get meningitis and how is this so if your healthy,unless I have a condition ie cracked cranium or infection of some sort.

Ow.. good luck with the surgery and recovery, girl! ): Anyway, well, the best way to avoid catching a cold (in my opinion) is to take lots of vitamin C, get plenty of rest, and don't forget to drink a lot of fluids. Also try not to become too stressed, as well...

The best prevention is to wash your hands frequently.

Also, if you can find a bacterial spay to use on door knobs, computer mouse and keyboard it may help.



Lastly, take Vitamin C daily until the day of your surgery.

Most likely no, they will not continue with the surgery if you are seriously sick with a cold. You need to be healthy as can be before they administer Intravenous meds and you will be knocked out during surgery, so you need to be able to breathe in the anesthesia. Even a dentist won't perform oral surgery if you have a simple cold. It risks you getting an infection. Advice: Lots of Vitamin C, wash hands, rest, and stay home if you can! When you get a cold, the virus most likely entered your body 3-4 days earlier, not the day before or the same day you get sick.

My sister breaths really loud at night, i can hear her cause we hav a bunk bed, and im on the bottom. i usually doesn't bother me, unless i go to bed after her, where she is already asleep. Its just the noise keeps me awake. 
Anyway, how do i stop her from breathing so loud at night. I think she breaths through her nose not her mouth, which could be the problem.

OK so i was in gym class one day and i got kicked so hard that it turned black and blue and swelled up. It was like this for a week or so. Then i went out in the woods and the next day i woke up and my leg was inchy in that same spot. It was also warm. I have read that when bruises itch it means there healing. But the swelling doesnt seem to go down. Maybe im being paranoid but should i see a doctor?

Don't worry for now because you probably will be clean and you are just getting yourself worked up.
You partner could be unaware of any disease he might have it is best that you both go get a check in the next week. Dont be ashamed to do this.
If I was you I would return for another test in a few months because it can take a few months for HIV to show up, also get checked for chlamydia as this is a very common STD.

If your really unsure about having unsafe/bareback sex then next time your simple answer is wear a condom, atleast until you both have had your STD checks

Good luck sure you will be fine, next time just think with your brain not your penis...

woah woah, calm down! first of all, go to a doctor. if you can't go to a doctor, talk to your partner, and ask him whether he's clean or not. why are you so worried? you shouldn't be so worried the first time. unless you're a girl, girls have more things to worry about, including the big thing: pregnancy.

go to the doctor and get tested. HIV is a dormant virus. Hiv turns into AIDS.... Seems to be clean means nothing. You could also be exposed to any other virus or STD that is known to man thus far. Good luck, next time use protection. \

Don't listen to the 2% chance of HIV response, if they have it and you don't use protection... that means that you have it.

As "embarrassing" as it may seem, talk to your doctor about these things. They can give your REAL medical answers. I know you don’t want to hear this, but you chose to have sex, therefore your chose the consequences. The ONLY way to be 100% sure and safe is to practices abstinence. At the very least, be smart and use protection. You could be exposed to STD’s or other infections, yes. The only way to tell is to speak with your doctor and get yourselves both tested. I hope this helps.

Anytime you have unprotected sex, be it vaginally or through butthole, you run the risk of coming into contact with STD's.  Even if he seems clean he might not be.  Lots of people who have herpes don't show signs all the time.  They have breakouts every once in awhile and go through periods where they don't have a breakout for awhile.  You have to either ask him if he's been tested.  Even then he could lie to you.  You have to take precautions yourself and tell him to put a condom on.  To deal with the paranoia, go get yourself tested.  If you're clean then it will ease the worrying.  Some STD's are curable but things like aids and herpes aren't.  There are medications out there though to help with the symptoms and slow down the process of the disease however.

UTI's require antibiotic therapy, which your GP will prescribe. in the UK you cannot buy antibiotics over the counter.

Push fluid intake in the meantime and see your Dr asap. Drinking cranberry juice to help UTI's is now considered an urban myth, recent study has provided no proof that drinking cranberry juice aids in the treatment or prevention of UTI's

As the answerer above stated, Cranberry Juice is great for a UTI...but there are some over the counter products that can help.  I think the most popular one is something called AZO.  Drinking lots of water helps to.



Just remember that a UTI is an actual bacteria infection in your urinary tract and it can spread to your bladder and/or kidneys if left untreated.  It's not a bad thing to try allowing your body to fight off the infection on it's own...and a low grade fever is the first sign that you're body is doing just that...but if you experience lower back pain, a fever over 100, vomitting, etc...well then it's probably time for an antibiotic.

An MD I saw one time for a UTI said it was possible to get rid of the infection if I drank lots of water, took lots of cranberry - but that it would take a very long time.



But for most of us, who don't have the patience or if there's too much bacteria in our system and the pain is interfering with quality of life --  if we have a UTI, we need antibiotics. The sooner you start, the better off you'll be.



UTIs can be serious - my uncle died from letting a UTI go too long, by which time the hospital couldn't do anything for him - there were too many bacteria in his system to fight off. The creator of the Muppets also died from not getting an infection treated soon enough.

Don't mean to scare you - this is for people who are reading this and thinking they can easily cure UTIs with home remedies. If you're using a home remedy and not seeing results, please see a doc and start antibiotics.

About AZO - it's cranberry. Cranberry is terrific for just-starting UTIs and to prevent them in the first place. The way cranberry works is by  coating in the urinary tract so the bacteria can't get a foothold. Result: no infection.

I used to get a bunch of UTIs. Finally, I started taking cranberry capsules daily. Worked beautifully.

AZO does NOT cure a UTI.  It can help some of the symptoms, but it takes antibiotics to cure a UTI. There is nothing over the counter that will cure your UTI.  According to new studies, cranberry juice does not help.  It used to be recommended for a kidney infection, but now doctors say it does nothing.  It was not recommended for UTI or bladder infection.  You need to see a doctor and let him do a few tests on you to make sure you have a UTI.  If you do , he will prescribe antibiotics.....

If you have Norwalk virus (stomach flu) DON'T take anything to prevent it unless it is serious.Your body needs to do what it needs to do.

Lay down and rest...keep hydrated so you don't end up in the emergency room.If you can drink then take little sips.

You can prevent getting it from being sanitary.Wash your hands for at least 15-20 minutes before touching your mouth/nose/eyes or preparing/eating food and brushing your teeth.

The virus is transfered through infected vomit and feces particles from infected people who have no correctly washed their hands/kept clean.

Wash your hands after EVERY bathroom use, sick or not, as well as vomiting.

Clean all infected areas with bleach including door knobs/bedding and light switches, bathroom floors,toilets,faucets and any puke buckets.

Horrendous spelling/grammar

You don't have to have sexual intercourse to transmit HIV and Hepatitis, being in contact with infected bodily fluids if you have an open wound etc can put you at risk. Again, with regards to other STI's, if you have had any kind of unprotected sexual contact at all, you are at risk. UTI's are not STD's if you have a UTI, then your Dr can determine this and provide you with antibiotics. If you have a vaginal infection, again your GP can take a swab and then treat accordingly. To be honest. I stopped reading your question half way through because of the graphic vulgar content..and I'm finding it hard to take you seriously.

it should have worked by 48 hours.. most doctors say it may not kill all the eggs, so he may need a second treatment , the following week or whenever the doctor advises. It is suspected that if one family member has them ,it's very likely all of them have the worms, so all members should be treated at the same time.

When in kennels dogs who have had kennel cough are isolated for 7 more days after they are showing signs of the disease. It can be contagious for weeks after the initial cough started.
Check with your vet.

It's not a normal pimple, is it?



there is a huge "pimple" on my leg, but i don't think it's a pimple
i kept picking at a spot on my leg (i wanted to pull a hair out) for about a month now. about 3 days ago it (the thing connnecting hair with skin) suddenly grew buge - the inside is like a piece of hard meat ball stuck in there, and when i squeezed the "meat ball" really hard, light yellowish-bloody fluids come out, and i can even feel, with my finger, the fluid pouring out - and it's a little red. it doesn't hurt very much even when i push directly on it. it doesn't have pimpleish yellow tops at the surface of the skin. The thing is that it doesn't hurt at all on the skin, and only hurts a bit when i squeeze the inside "meat ball"- and even then it only hurts like when you squeeze any of your normal muscle.
also, it doesn't look bad at all from the surface, just like a poped mosquito bite. (the "meat ball" is only about the size of two thumbs, but i'm sure it's not a mosquito bite)

I posted this question before, but i think some people got confused

Ive had a pimple on my leg for almost a year now and it wont go away. But your situation seems different cause that sounds pretty nasty. You have to see a dermatologist for these kind of things. Especially being that you dont know what it is. And, if its something fixable they can give you medicine to make it go away.

ps: It sounds like a pimple to me though :)
Yellowish? Sounds pretty much like one.

I'm sorry but that last answer is just plain wrong.  Meningitis is infectious and bacterial meningitis which is the most serious and life threatning is also infectious.  That said, there are many different forms of meningitis and it's hard to answer your question without knowning the specific strain.

The general signs of meningitis are headache, fever, sore neck and sometimes confusion.

If you are worried take your daughter to see a doctor.

Signs & symptoms of Meningitis are ;
Fever and /or vomiting
Severe headache
Rash (anywhere on the body)
Stiff neck
Dislike of bright lights
Very sleepy / vacant / difficult to wake
Confused / delirious
Seizures (fits)

I would most certainly monitor her as signs & symptoms can occur about  week after exposure, if any of the these symptoms occur, take your daughter to the hospital immediately and don't be put off, make sure they know that she has two friends who have been hospitalized to meningitis.



Good luck and hope she does not come down with it

If you had some post nasal drip during your cold then you just coughing up the phlegm that is left over from your cold. Drink plenty of fluids and take something like mucinex will help the process along. As far as phlegm is concerned when it's clear it's okay, when it's green or yellow than you might have some kind of infection. Good Luck!

Here is a simple Odour Solutions: This is Tip, not a Question.?
Three odour -conqering strategies,

A quick fix for cutting cooking odours is to boil 1/2 cup of vinegar per 1 litre of water.The rising heat will carry the odour-neutralising vinegar particles to the same surfaces on which the smoke and grease landed.To reduce an onion small on your hands ,rub them before and after you cut onions with the sliced end of a celery stalk.Vinegar rubbed on your hands before or after cutting onions has the same neutralising effect.A short-term solution to a smelly below ground-level room is to cut an onion in half and leave it on a plate in the room.The onion absorbs musty odours.This also works for a freshly painted room.

Now though I am getting a burning feeling when I pee and itch down there. Anyone have similar experience and what might it be? I am going to the Dr. friday

It can be normal to have that occasionally.

Can also be a a symptom of chlaymida, gonorrhea, or syphilis.

Get yourself tested for all these, anything your doctor recommends, and HIV.

Sounds like an std to me.

You need to get tested for everything when you go (Trich, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Herpes, Syphilis, Hepatitis and HIV). Get the whole shebang to be sure and have a clear mind.

Good luck!

Spat out blood? What should I do? Not from my mouth. ?



Last night whilst brushing my teeth I spat out blood. I  then checked my mouth and it wasn't from there and came from my throat. I'm not sure if it's a cut on my throat or if it came from my stomach. It was about a thumbnail about. Should I do anything? I felt fine, just worried.

As its happened just once, i wouldn't be overly concerned, if it happens again try your General Practitioner for investigation.
Though possibly......
as you were brushing your teeth, it may be possible it came from the gum line, impossible to view without special light and instruments.
As for the possibility it came from your throat, this may happen, there are many blood vessels in the throat, which can bleed if scratched or burst following pressure from retching etc. again, not worrying as these are common.
for the stomach possibility, usually blood from the stomach is released in great amount and a darker colour due to acidity of the stomach.

Keep an eye on it and if it happens again consider going to the doctors, it could be your gums bleeding from plaque (usually happens after not brushing properly for a few days)

Sometimes your gums bleed, it usually means that you are brushing too hard, and usually it doesn't show if you look for it since you are rinsing your mouth and things. Otherwise you could have been getting a nose bleed, since your nose and mouth are connected the blood that bleeds from your nose will also go down your throat and out your mouth, you may be been getting one and then spat out the extra that had been stuck in your throat - if that makes sense. But this happens to me all the time, If more blood is being spat out or coughed up when you are not brushing your teeth, then i would be worried but since it is just when brushing your teeth, No i wouldn't worry at all. Just watch for more signs

Blood that comes from your stomach is not red it is brownish or black. It was most likely from brushing and your gums started bleeding. Try to use some antiseptic mouth rinse to prevent gum disease.

If you have a cold lately, and you have been coughing, then it will be blood from a raw patch at the back of your throat. Nothing to worry about at all, and it will clear itself up in a short amount if time.

It depends; If you have latent TB, there are no symptoms and  you cannot spread the disease to others. If you have active TB, you do have symptoms and  the disease can  be spread to others.The symptoms you have will depend on whether your TB infection is in your lungs or elsewhere in your body. Symptoms of lung TB are;
A persistent cough that has lasted for more than 1-2 months with a thick and sometimes bloody mucus, chest pain/ fever/chills/fatigue and weakness/ loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss.



If the symptoms are outside the lungs, symptoms are sometimes non specific and can include back pain (can be a symptom of TB in the spine), swollen lymph nodes if the lymph nodes in the neck are infected etc.

Treatment is antibiotic therapy which will kill the TB bacteria

Hi - Do any of you know about whooping cough and vaccine.?



What I would like to know is can the pre-school booster which amongst other things is to vaccinate against whooping cough,  cause whooping cough or cause you to have symptoms of it without actually having the virus.

My daughter is nearly 8 and for various reasons has only just had the pre-school booster.  A week later she started with a cough then onto  show symptoms of whooping cough (undiagnosed by doctor).  Could the vaccination have caused this?



If the answer is yes to either, then if possible,could you point me in the right direction of a website that says so.

Many thanks

P.S its the pre school booster given in the UK.



</question>



<additional details>



She has shown all the symptoms of whooping cough i.e not being able to catch her breath, going purple, etc but the rest of the time fit and active.  So far 2 hospitals and a GP havent even mentioned whooping cough, its only that I saw the symptoms on a website and thought I'd check.  She is ok now but still has a very slight cough but symptoms were there for around 4 weeks.  Sorry but not much faith in Dr's at mo.

Only a doctor will be able to correctly diagnose any medical condition, so you should take her back to the GP.  I have never heard of this particular vaccine causing whooping cough, so she may just have a very bad cough, but you should take her to see the doctor in any case.

There is a distinctive 'whoop' when it's whooping cough.  Once heard never forgotten
There's anasty bug going round, lots of children have coughs and colds.

No the booster cannot give her whooping cough (pertussis) - it isn't a live vaccine.

She could have a virus, asthma or a host of other things.  Pertussis is fairly high on the list of differentials for children with coughs (the internal list a doctor makes of options that the illness can be) so if no one has mentioned it it most likely isn't.



If she had pertussis then she wouldn't have periods of being fit and active - she would be acting sick even if not in the midst of a coughing fit.



Bronchitis is much more likely - the cough in bronchitis can last for weeks even after the illness is over.

I'm sure you will hear this a lot, but it DOES work if you follow the direction religiously. I had back surgery and have a similar scar to yours. I applied Mederma 3 times a day, on clean skin for a few months. I think people aren't diligent enough to see if it works--it does work. You just have to follow the directions thoroughly. And the liquid works better than the cream, though the cream is easier applied.

well the first thing that would spring to mind is an allergy- i know you said that you haven't changed anything but it is still a possibilty so might be worth trying piriton as according to the packet but i'd still say see the doctor or local a and e- if your hands have areas of open sores or raw skin then you will need proper dressings and advice so to avoid infection.

I really need help on where I can go to determine if I can apply for disability.

I have Dermographism. In a nut shell, I cant have any pressure on my skin... anywhere or my skin rises up and burns for a half hr and your hands have skin! Honestly think about your job and how often you use your hands or lift things? or getting scratched... well I can’t find a job because I always get yelled at for doing things to slow because I’m being super careful not to get scratched or get pinched... you get the idea. I need a job so bad. I’m just about ready to cry because I just can’t seem to keep a job or find one that’s easy and then if its easy, I hardly make any money. Help! Can I apply for disability?

You will need statement from your doctor for social security. And you will also be eligible for food stamps. And perhaps Medicare. But the only way to know for sure is to ask. And i would start by asking your doctor what he thinks you would be qualified for. And if he dowse not know ask him if he knows some one who dose know.
The hardest part is filling out all that paper work. You might also want to get some help with that.

A question about hyper-pigmentation?



i think i'm developing this on my cheeks. i have a skin condition that if i use a razor to shave my skin feels raw, and bleeds. now will me using a skin lightener called "ANEW clinical laser" help with the hyper-pigmentation? and will it also affect my skin condition in a negative way? and has anyone used or heard of "ANEW"?

Brother, eh... I suggest you go to a dermatologist instead  :)
From the reviews I've seen, this product only has minor results. I have Vitiligo, which is the opposite. Corticosteroid creams, laser treatments, and others can be done to help with it, but there is no real cure and actual laser treatment puts you at a higher risk for skin cancer. Go to a dermatologist and find out why you have this first and let him/her treat it properly.

Washing the area gently with soap and water then pat it dry.  You can apply bacitracin to the wound with will help reduce the scar.  Keep doing this even after the scab falls off for best results.  Just remember to wash the old bacitracin off each day when you shower before applying a new layer.

Any changes in moles, pains, bleeding, discomfort, or pussing, should be checked out. This could be nothing, or it could be a form of Malignant melanoma, you may have even caught it on something. Don't be worried, the sooner its caught, you have it cured.

Have you used Differin for acne or acne scars?



My dermatologist just prescribed for me Differin to help lighten my acne scars a bit. I know Differin is supposed to mainly unblock pores and treat acne that way, but I would like to hear if you've had any experiences with Differin. Whether you used it for acne or acne scaring, what did you think of it? Was it effective?

probably scratch rash from dirty fingernail causing rash or pustules
and rash pimples its a mucus membrane the nut sack okay
you scratch and cut the Skin cause your own problem and make it worse
use a topical anti fungal tenatin spray three times a day and right after showering and don't bath only shower for showers  wash off thus cleaner body no germs to make you suffer itch
spray on tenactin spray and don't scratch this invites more infection
and more problems reinfecting area with dirty hands
wash spray and if it itches clean with alcohol or witch hazel a astringent
then wash with a shower gain and spray with tenactin

Pin Size Dots Under Skin?



I am 23 years old. It started with one dot on my collar bone about 5 years ago. The second one showed up about 2 years ago on my cheek, and within the last year or two I found one on my finger and one on my nose. They are not raised, do not itch, and they do no go away when I squeeze it...except for the one on my finger because the skin wasnt so sensitive, I was able to squeeze it more vigorously....but it did come back after the first time I tried to eliminate it. I am tired all the time but I also have low blood sugar...any ideas on what it could be?? Seems like more are showing up over the years but very slowly.
