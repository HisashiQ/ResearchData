Spawn is really cool, so is Batman (but he's not technically a superhero).

Would Major Kusanagi from the Ghost in the Shell series be classified as a superhero? if so, she'd be my number one ^_^

no one really got into the show, so the company airing it probably didn't want to spend money on it anymore.

thus, it was canceled.  it actually plays sometimes, but not until like, 3 am or something.

I would suggest Hitman Reborn! the first few episodes are boring, but it gets interesting later on. It has some pretty cool characters in it too!



Or, you can try both Code Geass or Eureka 7. Bith are mech animes, and personally code geass s my favorite ^^. A lot of suprising moments in the anime. It will constantly give you suspence.

Is Dattebayo being delayed with the release of this week's episodes because of the new OP and EP, or is it something else?.

Double episode is not likely causing the delay, last week's was a double episode as well it was still out in the 24hr time frame they take to encode their episodes.

Well its a possibility,it also could be because its a two part episode that it could take longer to sub and it will be out a little bit later. If not out later then it would be delayed until next week,until it comes out then.

I need help!Another doujinshi title suggestions,please?



Here's the story:



Hijitaka Sora is a 16-year old boy who lives with his cousin,Hijitaka Tsubasa,as they are both orphaned.Sora prepares to meet Tsubasa after her vacation in an island(or so she says).What Sora didn't expect is that she'd bring along 4 mysterious( not to mention cute and sexy ) girls with her,namely Masazumi Hanaka,twin sisters Michelle and Marielle Cunningham ,and Ohana Oriko.Hanaka and Michelle have a thing for hating him while Marielle and Oriko simply loves playing with him(uh,no,not that 'play' you have in mind,ya pervert).Sora soon discovers that the four are actually witches...and they have recently recruited Tsubasa in their group!Sora freaks out,while Hanaka and Michelle tried to kill him,for the sole reason that no male must ever find out about the secret about the Female Magical Society.Thanks to Tsubasa,though,he was spared from his death.However,he must train to be a magician in the quickest time possible,because when the other



members of the FMS  finds out that he found out their secret,he'll be executed...unless he has some impressive traits of a magician.Unfortunately,Sora is a total flop at everything,and his constant nosebleed from Hanaka and company ain't helping either.
Talk about a zero!
Genre:Romance,Comedy,Occasional Ecchi,Fantasy,School Life
Hijitaka Sora:16
Masazumi Hanaka:16
Hijitaka Tsubasa:15
Michelle and Marielle Cunningham:17
Ohana Oriko:16
P.S.
Should I include the Magical Girl genre?(This series is a straight-forward magical.No corny transformations.)And I need a good title,A.S.A.P.!

For those who love Anime Mangas and Games?



Just one curiosity I have in mind by quite some time... I noticed that there are some characters in various games mangas and anime that have the same name. I will mention only two and I believe you've all heard of them. These are Hattori Hanzou and Nobunaga Oda.
You can find Hattori Hanzou in for example Basilisk (manga and anime) and in the game Samurai Warriors. Also you can find Nobunaga Oda in both Tenchu (game), Samurai Warriors (game) and Onimusha (game). Do you think they refer to the same person for bothe Hattori and Nobunaga?



Can someone use the same character that's already been used in another manga/ anime / game?



Thanks in advance!

What are some really good anmies that can amuse me between naruto and bleach episodes.?



Allright I am really picky and I've seen a lot. I can show you the types of anime I've watched and which I've liked and not liked. Liked: Death Note, DBZ, Fruits basket, chibi vampire, obviously bleach, naruto before shippuuden, Code Geass, Love Hina, trigun, Cowboy bebop, Big-O, Samurai Champloo, rosario vampire, Kenichi world's strongest disciple, Case Closed, full metal panic, and obviously a few more I can't remember right now.. some mechas like gundam wing are also included. Disliked: inuyasha, Full metal alchemist, and one piece. I like extremely funny animes that turn into love stories and action movies that get you hooked. old fashioned swords and samurai are my favorites, but obviously I've explored others and found them good. I hate animes that are really long or really confusing, especially if they aren't almost joke after joke or epic battle after epic battle. Gintama seems to be ok but not funny enough and not enough action. So conclusion: Likes: love stories that the girl and guy hate each other but really don't and it makes it really funny, a joke anime like ranma 1/2, action like bleach, or something with all of the above. Dislikes: serious, too lovey dovy, too long, but long enough. preferably multiple seasons. Good luck.

haha You are a picky one!



Um try Ruroni Kenshin. It has some pretty good action, some comedy in the mix to. And a tiny bit of a love story but not much.



~Desert Punk
~FLCL
~Lupin III Series- Kinda long but a good watch
~Eureka Seven
~Yu Yu Hakusho-I don't believe you can find this online anymore. They come out with a box-set so yeah...No more on-liners XD
~Vampire Knight



~Ghost in a Shell Series-a MUST see
~Outlaw Star
~Berserk



And if you like, you could watch Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. It's pretty good. I don't really know too many animes that aren't too too serious...&gt;.&gt; Sorry

<question>



Naruto Ninjas vs. One Piece Pirates?



Well, me and my friend were talking about this in school and I kept saying that the Pirates would win, and she kept saying that the Ninjas would win.



I really think One Piece Pirates beats the Naruto Ninjas since I know about Naruto and I've watched it too so I know what I'm talking about.



My friend, she know about One Piece, but has never really watched it.



I keep saying that she should admit that One Piece Pirates beats Naruto Ninja A.ss, but she won't.
_________________________
SOOOOO all you have to say is who do you believe would win in a fight? Please also say which Anime you like better. And Please don't answer unless you know well about both Anime. Thnks!!!

"Let's see here:



Zoro can summon a few extra arms and heads
Sanji can outkick Lee, and burning kick.
Nami is smarter than Sakura, and surprisingly more useful.
Ussop is a sharpshooter, most likely could snipe Shikamaru from a long distance.
Chopper could take out Kiba and Akamaru, and managed to save Zoro countless times with his medical knowledge.
Robin can kill anyone with her powers and smarts.
Franky's a robot
Brooke is a skeleton
And Luffy is better than all of them combined.



Naruto verse falls flat on their faces."
From Shockwave



AND I STRONGLY AGREE WITH SHOCWAVE!



ONE PIECE WOULD DEFINITELY WIN, although the Ninjas would put up an great fight, it's just that in the end, the Straw Hat Crew would be the Victors.

Those of you who say you've watched One  Piece, I guess you haven't paid attention to the strength of the Straw Hat Crew, who are Extremely Strong. Just Compare all the fights, attacks, powers, will-power, strength, recoveries, etc. Then You'll see what I mean.

One Piece would win hands down, I mean Luffy, Zoro and Sanji can stop cannonballs for heaven's sake.



Naruto ninjas aren't even real ninjas, ninjas are sneaky assassins but in Naruto they teach chivalry and crap. They're like magicians with kunai.



Plus Luffy in Gear Second could destroy any ninja. Not to mention his invincibility to Chidori becuase of lightning and his immunity to most physical attacks.



I've watched both anime extensively, I've seen all of Naruto and up to episode 327 of One Piece. Working on One Piece right now and it's my favorite of the two.

Err... ninjas from Naruto would obviously have the upper hand, as the One Piece pirates have like the gum gum fruit and a good swordsman whereas the ninjas have ninjutsu, shadow clones, super stealth, genjutsu, shurikenjutsu, kendo, and like a lot of other stuff. Hope this answers it~

I've watched both shows and love them both. i think it would be a great fight, but the Naruto Ninjas would win. sure Luffy and Zollo would put up a great fight, but with all the Jutsu that the Ninjas can do Naruto would win. i'd like to see that fight.

It's a clip from an old Simpsons episode. In the episode where the new Gabbo kid's show becomes popular and starts stealing Krusty's audience, they managed to steal the Itchy and Scratchy Show as well. So, the producers of the Krusty the Clown Show had to quickly buy an older Russian cartoon to fill the time slot. The entire thing is a quick joke on how different old European cartoons are from our cartoons.



Here's a longer clip with Krusty introducing the new show.

Is the show Elfen Lied scary?



My younger cousin, Kyoko (Not Keiko, she's the younger one) said she was bored and wanted to watch something. She said she had heard of something called Elfen Lied but I had heard from my friends that it was extremely violent with alot of blood and gore as well as scenes of nudity. They also told me of killing animals!!!! :'(
Is Elfen Lied scary? I hear alot of people love this show and that it has a great storyline.
Do you think this is suitable for non-adults? Kyoko really wants to watch it and if it really is for mature audiences, I'll have to wait till she's a bit older.



</question>



<additional details>



I've just discovered my 12 year old sister watches Elfen Lied and she says it's one of the darkest but greatest animes ever. Especially the opening where they have this lovely song with beautiful artwork.
Now I'm confused 0.o

It does have violence and bloody scenes. But, its story is so intriguing it's perfect! i would say it's not an anime to be watched by small children. Anything upwards from 13 should be fine though!

Its one of the more violent animes that I have seen, its got a lot of adult themes, so i personally wouldn't recommend it for younger people. Although, some children are more mature than others, like i know a ten year old who LOVES it (apart from the nudity, he finds that gross lol)

I'd say Naruto is because it deals with every emotion on different characters and it makes you wonder about some characters. The friendship between Sasuke and Naruto is very touching, and so was Sakura's love for Sasuke. Bleach is more of a gung ho kinda anime, which doesn't mean it's bad, but doesn't deal with love a lot. Althought Rukia and Ichigo are clearly in love, it never goes into detail and they hardly ever have moments of high emotions. I'm going with Naruto.

I find bleach to be exciting in it's first 100 episodes and the succeeding episodes sucks.  I'll go for naruto, it was very interesting at first then the story goes slow at the middle but the story is getting interesting again.  I read it's manga(naruto), and it was SOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOOL.

Bleach because unlike naruto they DO change their clothes and also since it takes place in a city and a town that looks like out of old japan(spirit world) so they can't reuse the same background over and over.I know naruto deals abit more about feelings but I still say Bleach is better.

My vote goes to Bleach as the better between the two. Deep story Arcs that lead you in deeper into Soul Society. Intense battles that don't last eight episodes long. Character development is done nicely. Inner struggle with the main character. Supporting characters are exciting and fresh. Antagonist Characters keep the conflict going. Filler material is kept to a minimum. Each character has some surprising background or something to overcome.



Naruto, the pacing in early episodes tends to drag, as plot points are repeated over and over or Naruto repeatedly makes the same boneheaded moves. The series goes to some trouble to establish its vocabulary.It takes place in a richly detailed world with plenty of room for exploration and character development—but the story grinds to a halt whenever anyone starts explaining, say, the ranks of ninja, or how a particular jutsu works. Naruto is a fun and exciting series, but it may actually be better in large doses, so the slow pacing doesn't seem to hold things up—as it particularly  when the disc ends on a cliffhanger.  filler episodes abounds.

A doe gives birth to a fawn in the thicket whom she names Bambi. After he learns to walk, Bambi befriends Thumper, a young rabbit, and while learning to talk he meets Flower, a young skunk. One day his mother takes him to the meadow, a place that is both wonderful and frightening. There he meets Faline, a doe-fawn, and his father, the Great Prince of the Forest. It is also during this visit that Bambi has his first encounter with man, who causes all the animals to flee the meadow. During a harsh winter, Bambi and his mother go to the meadow and discover a patch of new grass, hearalding the arrival of spring. As they eat, his mother senses a hunter and orders Bambi to flee. As they run, gun shots ring out. When Bambi arrives at their thicket, he discovers his mother is no longer with him. He wanders the forest calling for her, but she doesn't answer. His father appears in front of him and tells Bambi "your mother can't be with you anymore," then leads him away.



In the spring, an adult Bambi is reunited with Thumper and Flower as the animals around them begin pairing up with mates. Though they resolve not to be "twitterpated" like the other animals in love, Thumper and Flower each leave with newly found mates. Bambi is disgusted, until he runs into Faline and become a couple. As they happily dance and flirt through the woods, another buck appears who tries to force Faline to go with him. Though he initially struggles, Bambi's rage gives him the strength to defeat the older buck and push him off a cliff and into a river below.



That night, Bambi is awoken by the smell of smoke. His Father explains that Man is in the forest and they must flee. Bambi goes back to search for Faline, but she is being chased by hunting dogs. Bambi finds her in time and fights off the dogs, allowing Faline to escape. With Faline safe, Bambi runs but is shot as he leaps over a ravine. The Great Prince finds him there and urges him back to his feet. Together, they escape the forest fire and go to a small island in a lake where the other animals, including Faline, have taken refuge.



At the end of the film, Faline gives birth to twin fawns, Bambi stands watch on the large hill, and the Great Prince silently turns and walks away.

Michael Keaton. The True Batman in my eyes.



But I must admit though, Christian Bale was soo badass with his deep synthesised voice in the Dark Knight...

None of the above. My best guy friend Adam is the REAL Batman! :) It's really just a nickname, but all of our professors call him Batman instead of Adam.



But, seriously, if I had to choose, I would still choose none of them. I'd just take stills of all of them in costume and paste Heath Ledger's [regular, non-Joker] face over their faces.

Anime question about shows?



Ok i have watched a heck of alot of anime these past few months it is obviously getting harder and harder to find good anime and I know I cant list all of what I watched so give suggestions that aren't as obvious as I would normally getexamples
1.nothing from Cartoon Network ever I have watched or tried all of these
2.I seem to like shonen alot but ploease if you do suggest a shonen make it somthing unique
3.I hate anime about teenager relationships in fact relationships ingeneral AKA nothing overly cutsie, romantic
4. I really hate NGE with a passion why (the guy is like 40 now and he is a freakin emo moron and he writes dialouge like an idiot thats why I hate Gureen Laagan)
5. Preferably a comedy i don't mind dramatic aspects however if the entire show revolves around charactors Bitching about the event and not just dealing with it like a semi-normal person don't suggest it)
6. Not that I hate ridiculous charactors or plots
7. I like scifi alot but dear lord if I ever see another mecha I will kill myself
I realize that this is rather demanding and what not I have asked this question over and over again if I get a proper ansewer that is somthing that I have not seen and I enjoy it I will give you best ansewer

You won't find it subbed until about a year from it's release date in Japan. The subbers have to get hold of a DVD of the movie and sub it, and as everyone knows it takes a while to come out on DVD after it's release in theaters. So I would say about July-August 2009, it took about that long for the first Shippuuden movie to get subbed,

It seems the 5th episode is scheduled for the 21st of November (this year) in Japan... so however long it takes for a fansub to be released after that... or if you wait for the US DVD, likely longer.

Which Death Note character are you most like?



I think I am like Matsuda since I can be a bit immature at times and want to play bigger roles in things like Matsuda did. I also went on quite like Matsuda, when I first watched the anime, I thought that he reminded me of myself.



So who are you and give a reason why?

I'm more related to L than most characters.



We both love sweets, sometimes sit in weird positions, don't really care abut life styles much, solve things very easily, and we both have unusual ways to be very intellectual. I tend to draw while I think as L thinks while eatting sweets. We both have black patches under our eyes from staying up at night or being insomniac. Although we're different genders, we're almost similar in some ways.

Song from 80s - Help?



Hi,
I watched a video of a song from 80s on MTV. Even though it's an old song I heard and watched it for the first time. I want to find out its name.



It was a band with one man and one woman. It's name was a very long one. (Probably it contained words like 'love', 'hold' etc.)



It was an uptempo song. The video showed the duo sometimes by the sea, on rocks and on shore and sometimes by the piano.



Does anyone remember the band and the title?

Sukishyo is shonen ai, it doesnt have anything more than suggestive or a kiss, like gravitation and others from that video



If you like shonen Ai try Princess Princess Princess



Wild Adapter (from the video) isnt shonen ai or yaoi.



Boku no sexual harassment was good, it has the corn scene..  :P
That video also had Boku no Pico, but its shouta and ep 1 isnt so great.



I would suggest Sensitive Pornograph, Ai no Ki... something..., Blue Wolf wasnt so bad.  Level C wasnt so great...  The rest are just blah!



Okay, now I can't give you a direct link because you need to sign up for the site, but you can find practically ALL of these and more http://www.aarinfantasy.com/  there.

That's a good question. I think cartoon network has changed alot over the years. Theyre getting sort of more complex shows for younger children. My little brother used to watch it when he was six....Like Total Drama Island its rated PG but theres alot more sexual humor. An unusual theme might be used for Chowder too. It's a great show but your sorta right in saying its not for kids...

Where to find 3 legendary birds in pokemon ruby?



Is it possible to catch multras, zapdos, and articuno in pokemon ruby? and if so where do you find them and do you need to beat the elite four?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



you can have them but not in ruby... first you need to play FireRed or LeafGreen version of pokemon then you have to catch them there. Then that's the time you trade it in your ruby version... I'll update this answer... you can also have the legendary pokemon using gameshark codes if your using a gameboy advance... but if you're using a plain gameboy, then better do the longer one's (play and trade)

i reckon that would be quite good...i guess you could say they kinda did i mean in teh movie light loses and L wins, but L does have to write his own name into the death note in order to do it. but yeah that would be a great thing to do  in the anime, and maybe stay to the actualy plot in the movie

I'm attracted to Brad Delson from Linkin Park.



Most people think that's odd as they can't even see him he's THAT skinny with such MASSIVE hair!



But I don't care - it's not harming anyone and it's my life.



If you fancy Ricky Gervais, have fun with it.
You can't choose who you're attracted to.

As my "borderline boilers" are just as embarrassing, I can't criticise you, but he doesn't float my boat, in fact, I find him terminally annoying.



So I can't understand you fancying Ricky Gervais, I can understand that we sometimes just can't help who we fancy.



He's in Night at the Museum too, should you want to drool....

I mean whenever I try I go to Toykopop.com, from some reason it doesn't let me. I don't read manga online. Well, I did once, but I only read a couple pages and then stopped because it wasn't the same as reading the actual book - plus it wasn't on Tokyopop that I read it at.
But thanks all the same -^^-

To be honest, when I first try to go to http://tokyopop.com , it doesn't work. I just refresh the page once and then it starts working...
&gt;:O



...If you always get the same result...
I think it's just your computer... Either your computer has too weak connection, running too much program (or using too much CPU memory), or your computer is too slow. Location of where you are can also be the case, but doesn't happen often.

Actually, some of the anime do have Japanese opening/ending songs.
For example, the English dub of Death Note does.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEYM_pkdM...



It also includes subs!



But...for others, the Japanese version has been 'translated' into the English version.
For example, the Fruits Basket opening.

Well I'm not sure about what your asking but, there is opening and ending japanese songs. You just have to find it in the right channel like ANIMAX. I watch that channel and they always have japanese songs even though it's in english.

Naruto fillers finish?



I've watched up to ep 100 and heard a mass of fillers start soon and, seeing as i'm not the greatest fan, I wanna skip them. so when do they start and finish? and are there any particularly good filler eps I should watch?

Trust me watch them all because when they are doing flash backs and stuff you will know what they are talking about, not only that but pretty much all the fillers are good! In a way fillers are what makes up the anime

The fillers are just kinda... Meh...
But if you're looking to watch all the episodes of the Sasuke retrieval arc it goes to 135 I'm pretty sure. And then there's a few more episodes that follow Naruto, Sakura, and Jiraiya going to scout out  the Hidden Sound for Sasuke. Then the rest just revolve around Naruto looking for ways to train (because Jiraiya leaves him so he can investigate the Akatsuki); Tsunade sending him on missions with other team members that "might lead to info on Sasuke whereabouts" while keeping Naruto from running off on his own to find him... Blah blah blah... Most of the filler arcs last 3 to 5 eps. But since nothing really happens in them, I'd just stop after 146 or 147. (Whichever the mission to the sound village ends on.) And then I'd just start on Shippuden.
As for fillers to watch... Curry of Life "arc" is a classic for the true otaku. lol
Hope I didn't spoil anything for you.

They start at 136, and continue for the rest of the original Naruto series (ep 220). The last episode has something fairly important in it, so it's probably a good idea to watch the 216-220 storyarc. The others depend on your perspective. Personally I loved the Laughing Shino episode, but that might just be me.

I'm going to guess a lightsaber would cut through adamantium claws.
I think both Logan and Jedi have great reflexes and can predict their oponents moves.



Hand to hand combat, Wolverine is much stronger, but Jedi can use the force. Wolverine's healing factor won't help very much(unless he is grazed or slightly cut by the lightsaber), because you can't heal a missing limb!



I think the weapons decide who wins the battle. If Wolverine can cut the hilt of the lightlaber, he wins, if the jedi cuts Wolverine's claws, he wins.



But's there too many factors to predict correctly :)

Naruto doesn't know who his parents are.... It's never mentioned through out the anime... But Jiraiya did say that Naruto and The Fourth were alike because they never gave up.... (episode 83)



I believe Kakashi knows because he was the fourth's student and also Jiraiya and Tsunade... Maybe the elders as well.... And Naruto also looks up to the Fourth simply because he was known as the strongest shinobi Konoha ever had... also we all know that he was the one who sealed away the Kyuubi...

I've been working on a graphic novel originally entitled, "Angel Wars; the Celestial Battlefield" until I recently discovered that both titles are taken. I need something original.

I doubt that Kakashi would die, he's one of the characters that ties Sasuke and Naruto together, and Sasuke hasn't come back or anything yet.  On top of that Kishi said that he still has a lot to do with Kakashi still, so he's not dieing anytime soon. Yhea!!

I've read the producers comments and he really doesn't know if he should make another one.  He says the first one wasn't as good as the second on and how many movies do you know that came out with a third one and was as good as the others. he also said that making the second one was really existing and what type of story line would he use and who would be the villain.There still thinking about it.  But there is going to be a spider-man 4-5 definitely

Well, it's not an easy call, but I think the Hulk could win.  Remember, the madder Hulk gets, the stronger he becomes.  Grundy, however, I don't really know his power limits.

I don't want him dead either! He is one of my favorite characters! I don't think he dies at all! Kakashi has been in many difficult battles and I don't think the writers of Naruto will have him go out on such a weak death(if they do, shame on them). I think Kakashi has a plan.I think it's a clone that was stuck under the rubble and Kakashi just was wasting time until he figured out fully what Pain's abilities are and his weaknesses. I am going to give Kakashi more credit than just depending on coming out the ground to defeat Pain. Between you and I, I think Kakashi might use the chains as a conductor to intensify his lightning ability to battle Pain. Read the info in the links. In the link about Pain, it says, he SEEMINGLY kills Kakashi.

I don't think that he's going to die.



According to Kishi, he still has to do to that character.  He also said that something big is going to happen to Kakashi, and unless you count him facing pein, which really isn't that big when you think about it, nothing crazy out there has happened to Kakashi yet, I think that he's going to lose his Sharyngan.



Also, it would really really suck if he did die, I really hope he doesn't!!!

Ah, I read Chapter 423 earlier today.



It was devastating!



I really hope Kakashi does not die. I hope all of a sudden Naruto, or someone else will appear and deflect it from hitting Kakashi. Or Kakashi if possible can space/time jutsu himself out of there, or use a substitution jutsu if he could move ;___;



I don't want him dead either!!



We still have to wait for next week though, because they didn't actually SHOW his death, so we can't be positive.



If he really does die, Then you know what this means right? The beginning of the "End Arc" of Naruto. So many more people will die to D:



But still, Kakashi was a good guy, he can't die....[denial-mode]



But just in case, RIP Kakashi! We love chuu!

By the way, not trying to be an asshole. But this question proves how educated Republicans are...so many unoriginal, and uneducated answers. Just the type that falls into McCain's fear tactics. Whatever, I voted for the man who is winning, (the papers make it look close) but check the polls Pennsylvania and Virgina are about 10% in Obama's favor. thats 31. And if you read the articles its if Florida (worth 20 some) and other states go McCain he wins by 8 e.v.s meaning 3 states of Obama aren't counted and I believe its 6 states in a split right not need to go McCain. So don't count on it.

Inuyasha...Dog...Inuyasha.....…



okay, i need to get some ANSWERS!!!



okay, i've been thinking a lot lately 'bout chocolate and dogs. u know how chocolate is poisonous to dogs right? yes, it is poisonous.....so i've been wondering.



u know inuyasha is a half-demon (DOG) okay and half human. so, if kagome gives him chocolate, will it be poisonous or non-poisonous? or wat other affects and symptons will occur? because he is half dog, will it be poisonous to him? but also, he's half human so will he be fine?



also, i garauntee on the night of the lunar moon, since inuyasha is human on that day, i am sure he can eat as much chocolate as he like cuz he's human.



and also, when he's a demon and a purify demon, how bad is chocolate to him? will it be strongly poisonous? because he's also no ordinary dogs, he's a demon dog....is chocolate even gonna take affect? however, a dog is a dog so chocolate is bad for dogs....but to inuyasha.....how bad is bad? how poisonous is chocolate to inuyasha?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Poisoning from chocolate is caused by theobromine, which many animals cannot properly metabolize. For a lethal dose of theobromine a human would have to eat about 22 lbs. of chocolate, and a dog of average size (44 lbs.) would have to eat 1.1 lbs. of chocolate for a lethal dose. If we assume dog demons are equally vulnerable to theobromine it would only take 1.1 lbs. of chocolate for a lethal dose.



So if InuYasha is half human and half dog demon (again assuming dog demons are equally vulnerable to theobromine), he would only die if he ate 11.6 lbs. of chocolate though he would experience syptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) at a lower dose.

The movie revolves around a brother and sister, Darry and Trish, returning home from college. Their journey is uneventful, and they spend the time bickering, until suddenly they are terrorized by someone in a Chevy Celebrity and later see the driver unloading what looks like a body wrapped in a blood-stained sheet into a hole as they drive past.



After escaping, Darry insists they go back and investigate. Darry orders Trish to hold his feet while he looks in the hole (a long metal tube angled deep into the ground). Rats appear in front of him and he freaks out. His thrashing causes Trish, who is also startled by the rats pouring out of the hole. She inadvertently releases Darry's legs, and he falls into the hole. Once at the bottom, he finds hundreds of bodies sewn together, covering the walls of a massive cavern. After Darry gets back out, he and Trish flee the scene, then stop at a gas station where they contact the police. While waiting for the cops to arrive, they are phoned by a local psychic, Gezelle Gay Hartman, who warns them what they are up against. She plays them the song "Jeepers Creepers" through the phone, and tells them that when they hear that song, they will be in extreme danger. Badly frightened, they take no notice of her. The police follow them as escort to protect them from the potentially vengeful killer.



As they travel, the police are attacked by the truck driver, and one of them is decapitated. Darry and Trish watch as the man picks up the head and eats the tongue out of it. As they escape, he loads the bodies into his truck (while whistling the tune of "Jeepers Creepers" played by Cody Sharp) and resumes the chase. Darry and Trish try to get help from a local eccentric, but the killer catches up to them and kills her. They manage to hit the killer with their car, and run him over several times. After crushing the body they realize its inhuman nature when its wings, heretofore unseen, begin flapping around. They drive to a police station to wait for their parents, but Gezelle shows up and warns them they are still not safe.



Gezelle tells them the true nature of the mysterious creature: it is an ancient demon known as "The Creeper", which rises every twenty-third spring for twenty-three days to feast on human body parts which form part of its own body upon consumption. She also tells them that it seeks out human body parts by scaring humans and smelling them through fear, and that by smelling the fear from Trish and Darry, it has found something it likes, but she does not know what.



The Creeper attacks the police station and gains entrance to the jail cells. After it feasts on prisoners it is swarmed by police, but it easily kills a number of them. Gezelle guides Trish and Darry upstairs, telling them one of them will die, screaming in the dark while the song Jeepers Creepers plays in the background. The Creeper heads towards Gezelle and sniffs her for a fear it likes, but lets her go when he realizes that she is not scared of him, and heads off to find the siblings.



The Creeper catches up and captures Darry. Trish tries to reason with it, and tries to give her life for her brother's as the police burst in and take aim, but the Creeper refuses and escapes out the window with Darry. The next day, Trish, contemplating Darry's fate, is picked up by her parents, and Gezelle returns home in regret.



The final scene shows the Creeper in its new hideout, an abandoned boiler factory, where the audience finally learns what the Creeper wanted: by ripping out the back of Darry's head, it has consumed his eyes, leaving him as nothing but an eyeless, motionless corpse (this was forshadowed in an earlier scene when there is a closeup of the Creeper's eyes while Trish tries to reason with it).

My favorite is IronMan, because I like his attitude.(Or Wolverine when he was  a member for a short time)



I'm not sure who the "best" is. Thor seems to be the strongest(Hulk is stronger, but kinda dumb). However Captain America is smart, strong, and a good leader.

I've noticed Misa is a really popular choice this year. =)



I'm personally not going because of the fact that our anime convention was so close to Halloween that it feels like Halloween has already passed. Still, I'm considering it... I might go in my Orochimaru costume.

Yes.



Yes, recently Vic Mignogna, the voice of Ed Elric, confessed they are doing another FMA anime series. Also Hiromu Arakawa, creator of the Manga, in volume 20 said the same thing.



As for what the series will be based on, there seems to be no word on that.



It may very well be a continuation of the original anime, if so, I hope they don't go from the movie, though that could leave things open to allot of plot lines.



It is also quite possible that it will be more closely based on the Manga. If they do that, there could be 2 or 3 more Anime series made, as each one would be a closer take on the Manga.



That said, it isn't very uncommon for a series, such as Fullmetal Alchemist, to have several Anime, and Manga series, with none of them taking place in the same universe.

Well there were some roumors after a leaked document. But from what i can see theres nothing confirmed yet.



When asked about the possibility of a sequel to Fullmetal Alchemist or Darker than BLACK (another BONES anime), Minami told ANN, "It hasn't been decided yet. We are interested in doing them. As original science-fiction works, they were extremely fascinating. With these kinds of dramatic story lines, I feel that there's a lot we could do potentially."



I fail to see how that makes a new series Confirmed.



However the title on that article is New Fullmetal Alchemist TV Anime Series Confirmed so i guess there will be a new one.



apparently it comes out 2009-04 like you heard

These questions have been asking for like so many times. But I will still say:



Bleach
Naruto
Inuyasha
Case Closed
One Piece
Death Note
Ah! My Goddess
Midori no Hibi
Basilisk
Onegai Sensei
Ichigo 100%
Kekkaishi
Seto no Hanayome
Lovely Complex
School Rumble
Kenichi
Prince of Tennis
Tenshi na Konamaiki
GTO



P/S: Instead of cartoon, why don't you say anime? In my humble opinion, I think cartoon should be something from Disney and animation will be something like FMA, BLEACH, Naruto and etc. etc.

Anime question about shows?



Ok i have watched a heck of alot of anime these past few months it is obviously getting harder and harder to find good anime and I know I cant list all of what I watched so give suggestions that aren't as obvious as I would normally getexamples
1.nothing from Cartoon Network ever I have watched or tried all of these
2.I seem to like shonen alot but ploease if you do suggest a shonen make it somthing unique
3.I hate anime about teenager relationships in fact relationships ingeneral AKA nothing overly cutsie, romantic
4. I really hate NGE with a passion why (the guy is like 40 now and he is a freakin emo moron and he writes dialouge like an idiot thats why I hate Gureen Laagan)
5. Preferably a comedy i don't mind dramatic aspects however if the entire show revolves around charactors Bitching about the event and not just dealing with it like a semi-normal person don't suggest it)
6. Not that I hate ridiculous charactors or plots
7. I like scifi alot but dear lord if I ever see another mecha I will kill myself
I realize that this is rather demanding and what not I have asked this question over and over again if I get a proper ansewer that is somthing that I have not seen and I enjoy it I will give you best ansewer

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Then stay away from Ikkitousen it has sex, a rape scene, and alot of nudity.



Any anime which are catergorized as ecchi I would try to avoid or be careful of.



The ecchi art style is loosely comparable to pin-up girl artwork, as well as to provocative fantasy and comic book art in the United States and other countries. Typical features include:



Clothing that outlines the shape of the breasts, nipples, and labia, suggesting tightness of clothing and arousal.



Uniforms, costumes, or outfits (all tightly worn) that may be provocative, but are worn as everyday clothing by the character.



Bouncing of over-size breasts.



The common gag that is usually pulled off in anime, the "head in breasts gag" that is commonly used when a male meets a busty female and falls into her cleavage.



Characters who are unaware of their sexuality, appear innocent and cheerful, or sly and mischievous.



The groping of breasts (whether intentional or not.)



Clothing that is falling off or being pulled off, notably swimsuits and "sailor"-style schoolgirl uniforms.



Upskirt panty shots and cleavage.



Suggestive or phallic imagery.



Exaggerated sexual attributes, often on normal or petite figures to give a sense of contrast. Especially used in dōjinshi and fanart, where a character may appear more sexual than normal.



The occasional bare breast(s) or bottom, but the genital area is never shown.



Skimpy bathing suits with crotch lines showing and sides of breasts showing.



E.N.F (Embarrassed Nude Female): A female character fully/almost nude in public showing signs of embarrassment, humiliation or acting completely normally.

That would be hentai, which is anime porn, so stay away from that.



There is a lot of anime that has lot's of girls wearing skimpy outfits though and huge breasts and has lots of sexual innuendo. A lot of anime is targeted for males...you just have to look the anime you want to watch up to know more about it.

Oni=Demon/Devil in Japanese.



I don't watch Jackie Chan Adventures, but I hope this helps give you an understanding.



The oni is the demon of japanese folklore. It takes on many other names, sometimes referred to as a devil. Unlike most western cultures, the oni is not necessarily seen as an evil being. It is said to be of a dual nature, meaning it's powers can be good or evil, depending on if it likes the subject it attaches itself too. Oni are credited with with bringing good health, safety, peace and avoiding disaster. A typical oni mask has horns, bulging eyes, a sinister looking smile and sharp teeth. Sometimes, it is shown in a form that looks more like a skull. This represents a very black and white image of transition. A representation that good is leaning toward evil, or that evil is trying to become good. Often, oni masks will have hair. If one could break away from the traditional impression that the demon is an instrument of evil, it would make the oni a more widely accepted good luck symbol.

how radioactive is your radioactive spider? from what I've seen the spider has to be so radioactive to almost nuclear so its color will change to blue and red (it can also be a good reference for your soon to be costume)



but I heard it is easier to get powers from a radioactive doggie, its only rumors though

Any good manga recommendations ?



I'm just looking for a really interesting manga to read. I usually puffer a good romantic/drama but I've been hooked on Berserk, Gantz, and Claymore lately.



All three of them have pretty awesome stories with great action. So I guess I'm looking for something similar.



Also, I'm not really looking for anything like bleach or naruto...

You need to read Vinland Saga.  Now.
The epicness which is Vinland Saga is hard to explain- but it has often been compared to Berserk.



Vinland Saga is my all time favorite manga, and I am current with Berserk, Gantz, and Claymore.

Edit: Oh and Vagabond is another manga you may want to check out.  It has a similar feel to those you have mentioned, but its a bit more complicated and realistic.

To who Masturbate to anime...?



I guess I can sort of see how and why (you get into anime to much)
But really why I am asking this because I have a friend who loves two things Megaman and Porn and well you see where this is going not to mention pokemon (charmander what are YOU DOING TO MISTY!!!!!)
i've seen alot in one night I knew this was real but really how can there be so much are the Japanese really this focused into their televisions as to make Idols of children do these things just so when they get older they can still "entertian themselves" to their former child hood idols



P.S. hentai is funny as hell



</question>



<additional details>



Well yeah I agree with you thats why I asked he is weird as hell in fact I have a good handful of friends who watch this stuff I think its funny they do as well however thats not really an ansewer

uhhhh....ok......i guess your right
however the reason why the F*** you ask that is ????? to me.
why does your friend want to see pokemon screwing around phisicallyand mentally its disturbing....its reminds me of what a friend said



this is what he said "i heard you like mudkips"



that was more disturbing.......
