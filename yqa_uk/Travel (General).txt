There are clinics here in Larnaca, Cyprus who are supposed to offer cheaper cosmetic treatment than in the U.K., but I can't say that I've heard of any Asian clinics.

If you are flying, I buy those travel size of toothpaste, lotion,sun cream, etc. I put these in my carry on's in a baggie so security can see it. For the checked luggage, take less then what you think you need. I wear shorts or pants at least 2 times if not more and just change the shirts. Even kids over 3 years old can learn to not spill stuff and make messes. I pack outfits together if possible and roll t shirts  instead of laying them flat. If you have any of those space bags that you roll up to get the air out, they are great space savers. Do not get the ones that require a vacuum to use. The sooner you get the bags packed, the more relieved you will be.

The idea of packing is simple:  Get the very minimum you think you need, split it into two piles and leave one pile behind!

Take a couple of T-shirts and some shorts.  No-one will know (or care) if you wear the same thing twice
Underwear - one to wear and one to wash 
Sun cream - yes
Tooth Brush - yes
Toothpaste - yes
Everything else - forget it

You still have to check in at the airport so they will put tags on your luggage.  You do still need to have a tag with your name and address on it on the outside of the suitcase and on the inside.

What is the weather like in Thailand in august and september?



I am thinking of going on holiday to Thailand around late August and early September 2009. But i have heard that around these months it is monsoon season. I was hoping to have a hot holiday with no rain! As it always rains in Britain! I was wondering, if i could get first hand knowledge of the weather there e.g. someone who lives in Thailand or someone who has been holiday there around August or September. So could someone tell me if these dates are a bad time for weather in Thailand? Thank You!

Does travel always broaden the mind, or narrow it about more things?



I live in London. Born in England worked or lived in London most of my adult life. Tourists and visitors every bloody where. 
I have met people from most of the world. 
Really after 40 years you do.
I have noticed though that some seem to react to new surroundings not by expanding their knowledge but trying to fit all the new stuff in boxes they already have in their mind. 
Whats the point of that? 
I would rather not understand than understand wrong.
Is that it is the unfamiliar so scary its better reign it in.
What do you think?

Are you asking this as a local who has not travelled yourself because the world has come to your door step, or from a person who has travelled a great deal yourself?

Travel does broaden the mind, its good to see different customs, ways of belief and different lifestyles. It wakes you up, makes you realise your way is not always the best way.  However, as the first person has said people the world over are the same, just dressed up differently.  We all ultimately want the same thing in life.

Some people find travelling a challenge, some relish it, others seek out and stick to the familiar (ie McDonald's,fish and chip dinners, or British pubs abroad sort of thing) to help them cope with the different surroundings, rather than adapt to the way of life in the place they are visiting.  Its difficult to adapt to change quickly. its human nature to try find a link to what you already know.

If you travel the World and meet ordinary people, you then think we are all the same. The same aspirations and dreams for our kids to better themselves, but  the politicians and the religous leaders want the World to follow their beliefs. One on one from Mongolia to England to America we could be friendly, but bring in politics and religion and it all goes pear shaped. If we shot all politicians and religous leaders the World would be a better place.

People are different and they react to change different. A lot of people figure they are just visiting..so they might as well keep to themselves. In London however, local people are really friendly for the most part so I guess that it kinda surprises me that people are still on the one track mind. Ever been to Spain? That's a place you might want to stay to yourself in.
I have to admit, I love London. I am an annoying tourist though...I ask the locals where to eat and shop, they always give better advice than the hotel!

Traveling- not just the other countries but our home countries too- does broaden the mind. You meet new people and experience life from other peoples' perspectives. It does you a lot of a good and can make you a more open-minded person.



At the same time, there are some people who 'travel' and go the whole backpacking experience almost as if they're trying to be cool. They go home and act like those who haven't traveled have no idea about life. I really hate people like that.

Definitely broadens the mind, I am from N.I., and firmly believe  by broadening your horizons with different cultures in different country, it puts a new outlook on how to deal with problems in your own country.



Although in saying that when, i visit foreign shores i expect to live by their laws,  but the trend seems to be different in our own country

Why dont you consider Australia ?
If you just choose between US and Canada. I suggest you going to Canada. The living standard not very different, goods cheaper . culture is just the same to US. another point. you gonna migrate, so if you wanna get a new nationality, Canada seem more easier than U.S.

The earth spins from west to east. So if you're flying fast towards the east the speed of the airplane will be added to spin speed of the earth. If you fly to the west, the earth speed will be deducted from the the planes speed. In the consequence you fly much faster to the east than to the west and you can pass more time zones within the same time. The bigger the differnce between your inner clock and the local time the stronger your time-lag probs.

Flying east the way the time-zones are changing you are losing time. Your going to bed later, waking up later.

If your flying west, though, the time-zone is back tracking. Your going to bed earlier, waking up earlier.

Usually flying east to Europe you will lose a whole night's sleep.  So obviously it is tougher.  Also you will have to train yourself to go to sleep earlier.
Going west you just force yourself to stay up late for a couple of nights and then it is easy to fall asleep because that makes you tired.

Ah yet another opportunity to discuss entering voids. In addition to goggles, my mate just said that chequebook that will ever balance, and rubbers are indeed equipment for the beginning of marriage. 
As to the last he remarked that wedding cake certainly nearly extinguished his wife's desire for anything, so the rubbers are grand distractions if blown up like balloons (he's a randy sort at 26).
Other safety precautions for marriage:
Gas masks for changing certain sorts of nappies (especially males)
Rubber gloves for the above and doing dishes (male and females)
Good crash helmet and trainers--helmet to protect man's head when dishes fly and trainers to outrun the teapot.

If you have booked the tickets over the net you may have E tickets. Usually the print out reference number is your ticket which you present at the booking in desk at airport and they issue you with your boarding passes.
If your in doubt then email or ring them, but i am sure that is your ticket.

I won't be a part of your evil cover-up!
Just kidding.  Usually government inspectors are very under-funded.  So do you think a corporation is going to spend money policing itself, or cut corners for profit?  Um yeah, it'll always be option #2.
In Toronto a bunch of people just died from eating tainted meat.  Funny how that happened right after the government decided to let the industry police itself to save money on health inspectors... hmm coincidence huh?

Very easily.  When you are talking about double time Sundays (more then $60 an hour)  The employees aren't going to say a thing.  They are just happy to be making the money.  Of course the Employer isn't going to report himself.  It's very easy to get away with it.  Let's just say it's a normal work week. They are still making about $30 an hour.  Yeah, it's unsafe and your life is on the line, but you still do it.  In today's economy, you can't mess up a job that pays that much.  They get away with it because there are people willing to do it and put up with it.

It is because the employees let the company get away with it and the people are scared to say anything.If they do they think they will lose there job.Just phone osha and let them know.They will come out and do a surprise inspection.It is better to let osha know before someone gets hurt or dies because of the conditions.

Thru-Hike Planning DISASTER!?



I'm planning to start a thru-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail next June, 2009... But I am totally lost! I have no clue about what to pack and how to budget resupply or anything. I'm going with a guy friend who is equally clueless. I was wondering if anyone has a simplified complete list of thru-hiking gear, for ULTRALIGHT packing. I have gotten good ideas from people but still don't know how to organize it all. It is as if I need a point-by-point checklist, if I could be so lucky. Help?

There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called "city" and other places are called "town".

Some things that make a city are:



* A long history.



* A big population. In modern Europe a town of over 10,000 people is a city.



* A centre where business and local government takes place.



* Special powers called town privileges which have been given by the government of the country, or its ruler. This was done especially during the Middle Ages. In Europe there are cities with less than 10.000 people that have town privileges, for example Valence-sur-Baïse in France. In 1999, 1.100 people lived there.



* Having a cathedral or a university. This rule is found in the United Kingdom. The smallest "cathedral cities" are St. David's and St Asaph's which are both in Wales, and Ripon, Southwell and Wells which are in England.

In American English, people often call all places cities.

<answer>



A city is an urban area with a large population and a particular administrative, legal, or historical status.

Large industrialized cities generally have advanced systems for sanitation, utilities, land usage, housing, and transportation and more. This close proximity greatly facilitates interaction between people and firms, benefiting both parties in the process. However, there is debate now whether the age of technology and instantaneous communication with the use of the Internet are making cities obsolete.

A big city, or metropolis, may have suburbs. Such cities are usually associated with metropolitan areas and urban sprawl, creating large amounts of business commuters. Once a city sprawls far enough to reach another city, this region can be deemed a conurbation or megalopolis.

Towns and cities have a long history, although opinions vary on whether any particular ancient settlement can be considered to be a city. A city formed as central places of trade for the benefit of the members living in close proximity to others facilitates interaction of all kinds. These interactions generate both positive and negative externalities between other’s actions. Benefits include reduced transport costs, exchange of ideas, sharing of natural resources, large local markets, and later in their development, amenities such as running water and sewage disposal. Possible costs would include higher rate of crime, higher mortality rates, higher cost of living, worse pollution, traffic and high commuting times. Cities will grow when the benefits of proximity between people and firms are higher than the cost. The first true towns are sometimes considered to be large settlements where the inhabitants were no longer simply farmers of the surrounding area, but began to take on specialized occupations, and where trade, food storage and power was centralized.

Why does it seem like loners travel to other countries?



I've met a guy in college who was crazy about Japan. He failed out of college came back later finished it. Always had the ugliest of Japanese girlfriends and was extremely emotional about things. He saved up some money and after graduating, his major was not Japanese, went to Japan to work there as an English Teacher.

As far as I know he had very few good friendships with his fellow countrymen and seemed infatuated by Japan. He was considered by most to be a bit on the "fringe", a loner, social invert, not your regular Joe.



Is this true that some people who don't form good interpersonal relationships so go to another country to have that country "put them back on their feet"? Is there a common theme that can connect the traveling to overseas to not being very social with your own countrymen? Do they think it sucks here because of their attitude and want the "easy" life in another country?

Simply, whats the connection between these "fringe" people and traveling overseas?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



People who travel to other countries have a very strong sense of independence and are usually very self confident people who have a sense of adventure.
Many famous explorers have this kind of free spirit.They are uncumbered by crutches such as friends , family, possessions, jobs etc.
The world is a better place for these people who take risks, if people like Marco Polo, Francis Drake, Captain Cook or the people on the Mayflower didn't take chances, then the Native Americans would not be conquered by the Europeans and there would be no white people in the USA,no white people in Australia or New Zealand.
Thank God for 'fringe ' people, they have a great attitude and I'm  sure the first settlers to these countries did not have an easy life

I have suffered from motion sickness all of my life. I have found that as I get older it has gotten worse. (I am 31)

I have tried Dramamine and Bonine. Both have made me drowsy (Dramamine is worse with that) and I found that fighting the side effects were almost as difficult as dealing with the motion sickness itself.



On my vacation last year, my trip was terribly hampered by getting extremely ill not only during a scuba dive, but also on the plane. (I do not recommend being sick during a plane landing...the plane lavatories are WAY too small)

I just returned from a trip to Mexico which included a 3 hour flight as well as a trip out on extremly choppy ocean waters. Prior to my trip I saw my doctor and he wrote me a prescription for Transderm patches. These patches are placed behind your ear and are "skin" color. They are about the size of a dime. Not once did I get sick or even feel as if I was going to get sick during my entire trip. These patches last for appoximately 3 days each and are prescribed 4 to a box. I did not feel any ill effects from these patches and I will NEVER travel again without them.



See your doctor. Get him or her to write you a prescription for Transderm. You will not be disappointed.

dramamine helps for motion sickness but it makes you drowsy. i prefer bonine, same thing but without the drowsiness (it is also over the counter). there are also patches you can buy to stick behind your ear and they release medication. when i was on my cruise many people had them on for the duration and finally i tried a braclet that puts pressure on yoru wrists - found it total rubbish but some people really swore by them

I find Dramamine taken an hour or so in advance is helpful for flights.



In a car, I find the front seat is better than the back.  It also helps to recline the seat and turn the air conditioner on and let it blow lightly on you.



I had no luck at all with the pressure wrist bands.  I've also had no luck with anything on small boats.

If u r going on a Holiday, make sure u have the money. If u r short of it, dont reduce the budget, cahnge the destination instead. But enjoy like a King !!
For a 3 week Holiday, I would suggest that you start with Bangkok (stay at State Towers, there are all suites, no rooms) stay there for around 5 days. where you can see the statue of reclining Buddha (around 57 meters long), Visit the Pratunam market, etc.. Visit the Safari Park and enjoy the dolphin, seal and walrus shows, have some foot massages, and then move to Pattya for exotic beaches.
Then Move over to Singapore for another 5-7 days - where you can do shopping, visit Sentosa (have 2 days for it), Night safari (late night), Jurong's Bird Park (early morning), try the Mono-rail ride,etc.. . 
Finally go to Bali for another 5 days. Where you can stay at Nusa-Dua Hotel and Spa and see the Chak- chak dances, the Barong dance, Do some white water river rafting, paragliding, water skiing, see some making of Batking paintings. Visit the extinct volcano. Visit the Tanha Temple, (and there is one more temple on the cliff...I forgot the name, but u get to see good sun-set from there). Get some nice Full body massage, and also learn the tap dancing (which is free), and enjoy one of the best beaches of the world.
I have been to more than 10 countires, but trust me , there may not be a better Holiday than this.
If you are a lil hard on money, then visit India, you can start with Ooty (dont forget the narrow guage train ride), then go to Mysore to see the palace, garden, Tibetian Monastry, the bird centuary - where you can row a boat in a big ponds which has crocodiles in them. See the Khajuraho temples then  Visit the Ajant  and Ellora caves.Then go to Delhi for the Ashoka pillar - which has not caught rust even in thousands of years, Kutubh minnar, Red Fort, Taj Mahal, Agra fort. Dont mis out the temple of Mathura - where Hindu temple and Muslim Masjid share the same boundry wall. Then Jaipur, Ranthambore jungle (to see the tigres in natural habitat). 
.....If you need to see the world, see India....

Depending on where you are coming from, budget, interests and the kind of thing that you want to do.

The Philippines is hot. You can go to the beach and do a lot of shopping.

Hi. Have you booked to go to one of the 3 danger areas? If so contact your travel company and express your concerns... they may offer a refund or alternative destination. However if you are not booked to go to one of the danger areas then no they will not give a refund. I have 2 friends who have just come back from Cuba this week and they had a great time.

This happened to us a few years ago with the SATS scare in China.

If we had cancelled ourselves we would not get a refund.



The day before we were due to travel the FCO said "don't go" and the holiday firm paid up within 3 days as they are covered by insurance if the FCO bans travel.

So all things being equal you will get your money back pronto.

You won't get your money back unless you are booked to go to one of the 'danger' areas. The rest of Cuba is fine!

What is the best (cheapest/quickest) way to travel from Princeton University to Worcester, MA?



My boyfriend just began his PhD program down in Princeton, New Jersey but we are having trouble finding the best way for him to come home.  We live in the Worcester, Central Mass area. Greyhound doesn't seem to go direct to anywhere near Princeton, and Amtrak is very expensive. Please help!  Thank you in advance.
