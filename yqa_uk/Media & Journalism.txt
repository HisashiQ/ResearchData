Why are the BBC spending outrageous amounts of money on the Olympics; even Hugh 'bloody' Edwards is there?



They manage to cover every story for four years at a time from the U.K., what on earth is the boring little Welsh git doing there?!?

don't know, but our effing licence fee is paying for it. There was Sue Barker going on about where they will all be, and how many, and with the technicians, presenters, and every bloody hanger on you can bet your bottom dollar that its costing millions.



The BBC



does not advertise, though i wish they did and then cutting the bloody licence fee  off. Mine  is due soon all £135.50 of it, unless its gone up again.

I suppose that it's now impossible for Rex to make up lost ground.

Nicole brings out the worst in him

She's a whining, spoilt, immature, thick so-called "princess" - but more fool him for pandering to her.

So she has ruined him, as well as looking so bad herself.

The money is not important to me, the child is and I would try to gather support from others to surround the suspects.  If I was wrong then although it may be a terrible moment for the suspected suspects I am sure they would understand especially if it were there child who had been taken.  If Madeleine is still alive then she needs to be freed from the monsters who have taken her.

If I saw Madeleine (or i thought i saw her!!) i would get the people all around me to look ...safety in numbers?? ...if we all agreed we thought it was Madeleine then we could 'explain' this to who ever she was with and ask them if they would mind waiting until the police had got here to eliminate them.. I am sure they would not mind if they where innocent and if they have a child themselves well i imagine they would be only to glad to help.. if they where none to co-operative, well then it would be mighty suspicious, and i would be convinced it was Madeleine, ...and take her off them, by force if necesary.. (if there was a band of helpers!!)

if i was on my own and i thought i spotted her, ...and there was no-one around, well i would follow them discretly and stake them out, until there was a way to alert the police...



but no, i would not finish my holiday and wait until i came back to the UK... (durrrrrr) ;)

But then all these sightings are meaningless, we have been through it all before ,it is all instigated by the McCanns and Maddy sadly is dead.

It's easy to offer money that you know no one will ever receive. If in this type of situation, I would go with chloe, as there is safety in numbers, providing it's not Team McConn numbers. I have no belief that this will ever happen though, as I believe the child is dead and the secrets with her in the 'unturned stones'...

all these sightings have only made the trash press because the truth is coming out and the mccanns need a diversion from the truth that the child is dead. the world is speaking the truth but not this country because intimidating forces are at large. read Goncalo Amaral's book and find out the truth about the lies

The Reporter said : "It was an Iceberg that sank the Titanic!"

Well, the reply was absolutely appalling, but when I think of John Prescott, I am not surprised ... he is a fat retard, a scrounger, a lout, with no education, and countless double values.
The only person Prescott is concerned about is Prescott.  He doesn't give tuppence about anybody else.

He didn't say that at all as well you know because you have presumably read your own link.
For a start it was on his blog, he wasn't talking to a reporter, and he was trying to defend Gordon Brown by saying that even if he was compared to the captain of the Titanic, it was the iceberg that sank it and not the captain.
You may think it's a good joke but a lot of people are going to take it seriously if they don't follow the link.

Looking at his comments this is laughable.

'But it wasn't the Captain that sank the Titanic – a ship they claimed was unsinkable – it was the iceberg,'
When informed of probable icebergs in the immediate neighbourhood, Captain Edward John Smith of the RMS Titanic said "maintain course and speed".

'And speaking as someone who's served on a ship and in a leadership, the best person to steer us through is a captain with the experience to navigate through these stormy financial global seas.
By ‘heck it must have been tough (he was a steward) balancing them coffees on a tray along those corridors when there were them stormy seas!



I  also notice from his comment as that the captain is actually steering the ship then!



'For me, it's all about setting the right course. That's why I've always favoured policy over personality and why I believe Gordon's the right captain.'
Prescott knows all about the ‘right course’ – after all wasn’t it him that had to have a little ‘snack’ after all those banquets?

It unknown, there is a big conspiresy



it is know that marilyns family was in the mafia thats how she got so big (just like frank sinatra did)

the story goes that, Prisident Kennedy killed her. The mafia didnt like there preciouse girl getting killed so, to get back at him, the mafia asasinated him.

this is only a theory, no one really know

one thing is for sure, she died of a drug over dose, we dont know if it was her that did it, or someone else

There have been books by people over the years that have pointed to the Kennedy's but no concrete proof. I have read three of them myself and they do have some forms of evidence are they seem to on first glance but when I look further into it they just don't prove to be enough to prove the case either way.

Well she died of an accidental overdose. However depending on the conspiracy theories, she was either killed by someone in the Kennedy Family sphere, as both the late President and RFK apparently had had affairs with her. Or she deliberately killed herself in her depressive state. Since nobody will ever really know , I'll vote for she accidently mixed too many pills with too much alcohol and unintentionally did herself in.

Moral of the story never mix medications with alcohol.

I have always believed she was killed by the Kennedy's because the last person she talked to was Peter Lawler who was married to Kennedy's sister and think she had imformation about the family involment with the mafia in her diary and that America was going to listen after all she was as famous as them and there is nothing like a woman scorned.
People seem to forget these people controled the law enforcement of the day and had plently of people to do their dirty work for them I also believe she died by being given a suppositary of drugs.
Why else would Joe di Maggio ban the family  from her funeral.

I was a keen fan of marilyn's and the cause of her death left a lot to be desired. The fact that JFK was involved and his associates, made it more involved than meets the eye.
Araham Lincoln 1861 to 1865 was the first to be assassinated then it was James A Garfield 1877 to 1881 then it was William MckInley 1897 to1901 and finally it was John F Kennedy 1961 to 1963.
Well if the Kennedy had nothing to do with marilyn,s death, they must have done something wrong - why did two of them get shot ?

Do you mean ITV catchup on the PC or your TV?
 If it's your PC maybe you haven't got the required flash player or the video link is broken. But if it's you TV maybe you should try and turn it off at the wall, Should do the trick =]

Lost package in the mail...Can someone please explain?



This is the very first time this has happened to me. I ordered a book (paperback) for school and It was delivered today, but there was no book inside, it was just a damaged envelope(had clearly been opened) addressed to me. What do I need to do? call the seller? How do I get in touch with the post office. I'm very pissed off, the book cost me $150 and it's been three weeks since school started, I really  need it. If u've been in a similar situation, please help me out.

Go to any Post Office with the package and show it to them and explain the situation.  Maybe they will even find it, if it was lost rather than stolen.  Sure there is the occasional thief in the Post Office, but how many of them want to steal a textbook?  But the Postal Inspectors are quite a good police-type agency investigating crime involving the Post Office, and they will want to investigate any thefts.



Also call the seller and see if they will do anything for you.
If the package was insured, of course, you can be reimbursed and reorder it.



I hope you get satisfaction, and soon; that's quite a loss for a student.

Cricklewood – bingo hall fire
Around 50 firefighters and ten fire engines were called to a blaze at a bingo hall on Cricklewood Broadway in the early hours of this morning.

Part of the ground and first floor of the two floor building were damaged in the fire. There was heavy smoke damage throughout the building.

Station Manager Steve Leader said: "Firefighters worked hard in the early stages to stop the fire spreading. Good support with other agencies meant that we were able to open Cricklewood Broadway by around 6.30am."

The Brigade was called at 0240 and the fire was under control by 0602. Fire crews from West Hampstead and the surrounding area attended the incident. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

Perhaps. Bush & friends chummed it up with the bin Laden family right around 9/11, and they just let them fly home. Apparently they have some close ties, and maybe Clinton was being respectful of those relationships so as not to cause a rift. Osama is dead now, though.

High school subjects that are good for Journalism are things like English Language (it will give you all the necessary skills), English Literature (will broaden your vocabulary) and a good strong academic style subject such as History or Geography (which will show your ability to apply yourself).

Also, get some work experience with a local newspaper. I did, and while I was there they gave me some solid advice about University too - whatever you do, DON'T DO A JOURNALISM DEGREE!! Do a degree in something like the subjects mentioned above - Geography, History and English. The necessary skills can be learned through high school level English, and then by taking a postgraduate course after finishing your degree.

I wish you the best of luck, just keep on writing and you shouldn't go wrong!

I was given the opposite advice to an larmhi.
Providing the degree is NUJ accredited, that is the way to go. Otherwise employers will not look twice at you (I found that out through experience).

Different Unis have different reps - for example, in Scotland there are 3 unis with journalism degrees but only one worth applying to if you want to be taken seriously in the industry.

bad, but then look at the middle class, well educated man who got off for the same offence of downloading child porn, and his defence team said that his high sex drive was caused by taking medication for Parkinson's, however someone failed to mention in court that he had material on the PC before he took medication, but the woman judge let him off scot free, despicable

20 weeks is pathetic but given the state of the injustice system it's about what I expected for this guy.  I actually thought they would let him off but if they did it would have been a bit of a landmark ruling as his defence were saying there's no way they could attribute the download and storage of the data to this guy, but that would mean that Pedos everywhere would have a chance at using a get out of jail free card in the future for the same reasons... So, it could have been worse.

Let's just hope that considering they all have TVs in prisons these days they'll know who Shannon mathews is, they'll know this guy is a nonce and after 20 weeks his face looks considerably worse than it does now, although saying that I don't think it's possible...

No, it's not... So we'll have to go with him sharing a cell with "Mr. Big" and his ringpiece being the size of a watermelon... Which is actually something I would rather not have thought about.

i suppose his main punishment is having his face and crimes plastered all over the papers and in the news. He will be an outcast now, with a society that never forgives and is hyper about this issue. Already his life is ruined
I believe 2 years (which actually means 2 years) would be adequate for this case if it was in a prison where no luxuries were allowed and hard physical work was done. Most of the photos were at a low level of severity. 
I'm all for decades long sentences for actual child abuse with tagging when they come out and if they do it twice then life (meaning life) with no luxuries and hard physical work

So 15 years for dodgy images being on a computer .......... so once youve established that baseline, what sentence would you give for actual abusers of children, since the bottom line is that Craig Meehan himself didnt abuse  the children so you cant go giving ridiculously long sentences otherwise, Craig and his ilk will say bugger it, why bother with just viewing images, I will actually go out and abuse a child myself since the sentence is the same.

Most rape perpretrators get less than 15 years. are you seriously telling me craigs crime of looking at images on a computer is worse than someone stalking someone and raping them?



You have to have reasonable sentences for these things. As much as you might not like it there are scales of severity when it comes to child abuse. You cant just say that viewing images is the same level of crime as someone who actually abuses the child. Thats ridiculous, but I know in this type of debate, people are just irrational, so you cant talk common sense to them .......
