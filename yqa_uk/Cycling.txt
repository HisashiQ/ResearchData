Where is the flatest terrain local to leicestershire?



I want to cycle  for most of one day and prefer the flat for that.  I know the fens are the best but I don't want to travel to far so could you tell me the nearest part of the fens to melton mowbray please.  Thankyou and regards.

I have cycled a lot around Leicestershire & Lincolnshire (I live near Ashby de la Zouch.) If you head North West, once you get beyond Grantham it is very flat (and totally boring - doesn't appeal to me). The Vale of Belvoir is pretty flat as well.

I absolutely loved my silver Chopper. I only had it for a couple of weeks and some nasty wee buggers stole it!!! My mum and dad couldn't afford to replace it, so I had to make do with a second hand racer with the bendy handlebars!! Oh what I would give for another wee shot on my Chopper!!!!!

I had my first bike in 1961.  I used to ride it to school and back every day, and we had those bike riding tests etc (I think they still do them).  Cannot remember its name, but it was black, it had a male crossbar, three speed, and I always carried a puncture repair kit.  Oh for those days again ....

My favorite was my first bike, which allowed me to experience freedom and the speed of riding along on two wheels. It also made me feel a little bigger than I really was. The bike was nothing special beyond all these pleasures it gave me.

A Charming Woman by the name of Frieda. 
Dwelled in a Village near Somerset, had a reputation for being a bit of a "Bike".
Well, she took me for many a ride on her back as a youngster.
But it wasn't till I dropped me sacks did I REALLY know what it meant. And er. . . well. erm. . . piss off.

My father bought me a very nice Nishiki Olympic 10-speed in the late 1970's.  (Just about the first "imported" bike in my neighborhood.)  I own an all-carbon race bike now, but I sometimes wonder if it rides as nice as that old Nishiki.
