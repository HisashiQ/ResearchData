As we were driving, I noticed that a fly had hit the windscreen and I watched as the resulting liquid spread across the windscreen. I commented to my husband, that it was strange just seeing liquid and no skeleton. He said, flies don't have skeletons. I thought they did.

Can anyone tell me if flies do have skeletons?

They have exoskeletons (aka outer skeletons).

A skeleton doesn't have to be made of bones, it can be any structure rigid enough to support various tissues and organs. The flies' skeleton is the outer shell you see.

Insects, like all arthropods, have an exoskeleton.  Simply put, this is like having your bones on the outside, surrounding your organs and muscles.  Arachnids, Insects, Crustaceans, and the rest of the arthropods are this way.

"Invertebrates have an exoskeleton" - Not true.  Gastropods (slugs and snails), bivalves (clams and oysters), cephalopods (squid and octopuses), and echinoderms (starfish, sea cucumbers, and urchins) are invertebrates and do not have exoskeletons.

Would humans have been able to survive during the age of the dinosaurs?



Both in terms of the environment itself (air content, temperature, food supply etc) and the dinosaurs who might have seen humans as prey?

What would the USA or UK have looked like back then? And how common were dinosaurs on the landscape- would you have seen a dozen T-Rex in a day or one a year? Would the larger dinosaurs have been like pigeons now, with hundreds everywhere you look?

What might a hundred-mile hike across dinosaur country have been like? Would a modern-day hunting rifle or shotgun have been adequate protection for a small party of campers?

Serious answers only please- thanks!



</question>



<additional details>



No, humans and dinosaurs lived millions of years apart! And I don't mean would we be able to survive as a race, but rather if a small party just travelled back in time with modern outdoor equipment.

Suitti gavea good answer, so a few more points.
Dinosaurs were about for a -long- time.  From sometime in the Triassic, all the way through the Jurassic and all through the Cretaceous. Of course the actual species present changes as species evolved and became extinct.During this vast swathe of geological history there have been considerable environmental changes, during much of the Cretaceous for example golbal CO2 levels were high, global temperatures were high, and global sea levels were high, - large parts of europe were shallow seas and ther was an extensive sea in the middle of what is now the USA. Where I live ( Eastern UK) in the middle jurassic the environment was subtropical with low lying coastal deltas subject to periodic flooding. Dinosaurs walked ther, I have collected their footprints (for a museum) 
As Suitti says, humans are **VERY** versatile and could have survived in lots of places.
Would you have seen lots of the large predator dinos? Probably not as this is basic ecology, you do not get lots of -any- large predator but there were smaller predatory dinos that would be a nuisance to human sized prey too. Remember that our distant ancestors, smallish mammals would be about too, not a great threat there though :-)
There is certainly some evidence that some types of dino, e.g. some sauropods moved in herds, which would be an impressive sight ( from a safe distance). Dinos sat at the top of a large, complex ecosystem, so ther would be everything from beetles (and some pretty big dragonflies) to big, dangerous non-dino predators such as crocodiles. Rivers would teem with fish, the air would buzz with insects, and, in the later part of 'dinotime' the dinosaurs feathery cousins, birds would be flitting about. 
Remember that flowering plants (in the strict biological sense) did not come on the scene till late on in the long stretch of time Dino's were about, and definitely no grasses so lots of ferns, conifers, cycads, ginkoes and, certainly in the mid-jurassic environment I am familiar with, lots of horsetails. This might make finding edible plant food a little difficult.
How a T Rex or a hungry Allosaur would react to a bunch of apes with sticks that got *BANG* is pretty hard to predict.
The BBC series "Walking with Dinosaurs" and some background reading on paleoenvironments would be a good start.

No - nobody would have been able to survive because when an asteroid hit the earth, it released tons of energy and particles of dust which made it very cold and is what led the dinosaurs to extinction. Nobody could have survived it.

Have you seen prehistoric park?

First off, you need to specify a time and a place. The dinosaurs lived for a VERY long time and hence, the climate and environment changed greatly over that time. The place is also important casue at some points, there was volcanic activity where toxic gases choked some areas. Also it would be very hot in some places and very cold in others. generally it ws hotter though cause dinosaurs were everywhere and they were reptiles.



I don't think humans would be able to survive.They have lost all basic survival insticts, predators were everywhere, and it was very hostile terrain. In short, if you invent a ime machine, don't go back to the age of the dinosaurs.Go to the reinasaunce instead. ( I know I can't spell.)

Modern humans are kick-butt animals compared to anything. They invent technology and strategy very rapidly, and can colonize anywhere on Earth.  Antarctica, the Amazon rain forest, the Sahara, you name it, we're there.  A properly equipped small group would have good chances. By properly equipped, i mean that they knew where they were going, what they were going to do there, and brought stuff accordingly.

Let's say your party goes to Northern Alaska prepared.  A polar bear takes interest - slow food.  One of the guys fires his shot gun in the air.  The polar bear instantly understands that this isn't your usual slow food.  But should the bear make another attempt, it is no match for a high powered rifle.  Humans are so overwhelmingly powerful that they can show mercy, and use a tranquilizer gun.

A breeding population - say 10,000, would almost certainly survive as a race.  They'd find or build structures for protection, probably farm and hunt.  As hunters, they'd be totally unstoppable.  They wouldn't have to wait for evolution to make them survivable.

They wouldn't even have custom parasites, unless they brought their own.  You know, lice and such.  Lots of diseases would be missing too.  These things have to evolve to use a new species as a host.

Humans would be able to eat - once they figured out what isn't poisonous.  If anything, there was more oxygen 65+ million years ago.  That'd be fine.

The idea that humans couldn't cope with sabertooth tigers or other megafauna 10,000 to 20,000 years ago is laughable.  These were modern humans.  Just about the instant it warmed up a little, they built pyramids.

I think we'd have a good chance of surviving. Who knows, we could even domesticate some dinosaurs and use them for labour or defence, like people used horses and dogs.

Not all dinosaurs were carnivirous, and not all of them were big. There were plenty of herbivores ranging from camel-sized to chicken-sized.

You wouldn't want to go for a swim though, chances are you'd probably get eaten :)

Clerck, 1757 
Enoplognatha ovata is a species of spider belonging to the family Theridiidae. It is native to Europe and has also been introduced to North America.

This spider, reaching a length of 6 mm (excluding legs), has translucent legs and the globular abdomen is extremely variable in colour and pattern: the background colour is white, cream or green and can be marked with a row of dark spots, a broad red stripe or with two red stripes in a v-shape. Despite its small size, this is a formidable predator which can prey on insects many times its size. The female deposits its eggs in a grey sac. This is secreted within a rolled-up leaf fastened with silk and the female guards it until the eggs hatch.

Like most members of the stick insect family these beautiful insects will eat bramble or privet. I've never tried bramble but mine used to live happily on privet (when I was a lad) Fortunately privet is an evergreen so leaves are available year round.

Nice to see The Genius of Charles Darwin...



on television presented by the awesome Richard Dawkins.

Why do you think the series has been taken up by Channel 4 rather than on the BBC?



and how do you think that will affect the amount/kind of audience who views it and the way it is received?



</question>



<additional details>



For miyuki & kyojin:

I wouldn't say the BBC has stuff generally on a higher intellectual level than channel four exaclty (It has been behind some great documentaries, science programmes and investigative journalism) but it is known for courting controversy and playing shows that might be too controversial.



The main thought I had is that has it been Sir David Attenborough presenting instead of (should be Sir) Richard Dawkins it would have been on BBC.

For Robin Runesinger: LOL Ben Stein, Yes what a great scientist he is. LOL. dragging back America 200 years. I know he's not stupid so all I can say is,  what an evil man.

Ben Stein destroyed nothing but his own reputation for such outrageous lies as are told in "Expelled".  Richard Dawkins and Charles Darwin are far above Ben Stein in intelligence and morality. This question involves knowledge of British TV. I have some BBC DVD's, so I gather it is on a higher intellectual level than Channel 4. This does not seem to be such a good idea.

It amazes me that people who have seen one or two television programs on a subject think they are experts in the field. I have no television. I have read Darwin and Dawkins, and their critics. The whole issue has become obfuscated by the personal agendas of those in the debate.

Before you give Charles too much credit check out his grandfather, Erastmus.  I may have misspelled the name.  What is important is that he was part of the Lunar Society of scientics at the Royal Academy. They met on the full moon for dinner and planned ways to separate science from religion.  Darwin the elder came up with the theory that his grandson went looking to prove and thought he had when he found an island of finches adapted to various methods of feeding.  They were all still birds.  Since the theory was published (and plagarized from his grandfather) there have been no links found in over a 100 years of serious searching to show one genus turned into another.  No dogs into cats, etc.  The adaptations among the dog family, cows, horses, cats, and many others are mostly from human breeding programs.  Just remember, most interspecies mixes are not fertile, so do not continue - like the mule (horse/donkey mix).  That would have been a help to humans as mules are fairly smart and hard workers, but even Darwin can't change genetics.

Yes, Orcas do (I refuse to refer to them as Killer Whales because: a) 'killer' is unnecessary, all predators kill, and b) they're not whales). They attack in packs and target the old/young/weak. Here's footage of an attack on a Grey Whale, even though it isn't a Blue Whale attacks on them have been witnessed and similar tactics are used by the Orcas.

Its just our luck unfortunately. Although I have friends who hillwalk and to prevent mosquitoes/ midgie bites they use Avon Skin so Soft as do the British Army so it must be good.
I'm also told that eating garlic before hand will help.
Avoid wearing bright colours as they will be attracted to them first and then want a wee feast. Wear unsented products such as perfume, deodorants etc. as again these will tempt them first.

try eating lots of garlic, lol seriously though they are attracted to perfumes and deioderants and also the breath that you breath out, so although you cant stop breathing you can try not to use perfumes another thing is use avon skin so soft, for some reason they dont like the smell of this and it keeps them at bay.  Another good trick is to put some dried coffee in some foil and set fire to it, I saw this done in greece and it worked they kept clear from the smoke it produced so I do this in the garden now

Mosquitos are attracted to CO2.  They fly along the floor sniffing you out so it is very common to get bitten on the feet and legs.  Cover them up, or wear a repellant or stand near someone who they can smell out even easier.

it depends on your geographic location. Different species of spiders live in different areas and depending on such environmental factors determines the size of the spider.



You may want to do some research on the kind of spider you saw, color, shape etc and then use some online resources to determine what breed of spider you have and how large it could get.

Are good zoology careers too competitive?



I know I would love to study zoology. My ideal job would be travelling around the world researching animals-- I don't mind if I'm not earning a high salary as long as I love my job. However everyone tells me that the good jobs out there which involve working with animals are far too competitive so don't even bother.



Would it make much of a difference if I got all As in A levels and As and A*s in GCSEs? Or if  I got into Cambridge?



So do I follow my dream and try to get the ideal job, probably not earning much at all...  or do I go for something I'm not as interested in but come out of uni with a job and competitive salary?

I think it is a little unfair of people to tell you to forget it, especially since most of them would have no clue about the job market in that field and how competitive it actually is, or the different job variations in that field.

I have just graduated and the jobs I want to get into are extremely competitive. However, I have done a lot of research into it and have decided where I want to be headed. I think that you should do the same. Go to www.ucas.ac.uk - they will have a listing of every undergraduate course there is available in the UK. Why not contact some of the departments and see what they think about the job market? Get some advice. Are there any websites you could look at or those that specifically advertise jobs in zoology? Why not spend your summers (money permitting) volunteering with different animal groups as there are plenty that do research. There are a number of different options. My advice, on top of this, is to get experience under your belt. When you graduate, you will be in the same boat as other graduates - a degree but no experience. By volunteering or working locally or abroad, you will have experience which would give you the edge over other graduates.

Good luck with your career and future - and do your best to follow your dreams! If you try and do not succeed for whatever reason, at least you know you tried and you can rest easily without thoughts of 'what if'. All the best in your future :-)

I have a degree in zoology and yes, the jobs can be very competitive.  Your degree will only be the start of what will get you a job.  Experience is key to get a good full time permanent job.  If you want to do seasonal work, traveling from place to place...these are a lot easier to get, but they pay almost nothing.  Most do supply housing though, so you will never be homeless!  I would not tell you to give up..if this is your dream..go for it.  Any career has it's struggles..why settle for something you are not even interested in. If you want it bad enough, you can earn it.  While in school earning your degree, make sure and take a few quarters/semesters off to get some hands-on experience doing short term/seasonal work.  Check out volunteer and internships working with wildlife that you may be able do while in school as well. You can definitely make a decent living studying animals...but don't count on getting rich doing it.

Do you think it's right that whale's and dolphin's are being held captive in the ENTERTAINMENT industry?



Do you think that whale's such as Keiko who was the whale used in the movie (free willy) was held in captivity from the age of 2 until 15 months before he died. he was taken in 1998 to a biger open space in the ocean where he was still being handeld by a trainer untill 2002. (15 months before he died) befroe the movie free willy he was living in a park in Mexico city whenre he would perform several shows a day. As maney belive Kaiko died because he could not catch his own fish, but it was because he never found his pod (family.) Another fine example of orca whale's is Lolita. Lolita has benn held captive since the age of 6. She was first taken into captivity in August 1970. Lolita is the oldest whale to ever make it in captivity. A standerd size tank for an orca is 48tf by 48ft. Lolita's tank is 35ft by 35ft or 35ft by 32ft (not quite sure) She has no room to swim, because her tank is just a little biger then a hotel pool. Lolita is so large that to her it is like having to swim in a bath tub. Hundreds upon thousands of other whale's are also being held in tanks just like the kind Lolita and kaiko where in. Lolita is 22ft long and 7,500 lbs macking it hard for her to live in her tank. Marine life of any kind needs open space. An oca travels 75 to 100 miles per day. Kaiko proved that orcas can make it in there natural habatat, therefore Lolita needs to be put back in her natural habatat. Do you agree that orcas should not be used for ENTERTAINMENT like they have been used for maney years?

Zoo captivity is not right as well. once those animals get out of there holding place they become even more of a danger then animals in the wield.

I agree with you completely. I seriously don't think animals should be used for entertainment because most of they time people don't give them proper living space and care.

That is why I am never ever going to Sea World again. Once I found out how they treat their animals, I was shocked. They cram them into tight living conditions, and when an animal dies and they don't have anymore animals, they go out and catch those animals from their natural habitat.

Sometimes these animals (dolphins, seals etc.) are so unhappy they commit suicide by banging themselves against their cages!

I saw Shamu at Sea World Texas and his fins were all droopy and grey because he was unhappy.

Thank you, for not giving A kiling industry another dime. They call them selves an education and intertainment industry, but if they were eather one of those they wouldn't hold an animal in a tank! And these animals would not be kiling themselves if they were cared for in the right way.

Most of the "Marine population" you speak of, is born into captivity. They would not know how to survive in the wild. They are dependent on their caregivers. Long story short... If born into captivity it is right, if not, it is wrong and no different than slavery. I agree with you on one point. They should have proper accommodations.

Well, you have added too many "Added Details" before I finished my answer. It seems you will not rest until you hear what you want to hear. So why bother to ask for opinions from others?



By the way, I have a cat who is held captive in my house now for 8 years, because she has only one eye due to living in the alley. I am so cruel not to put back in the alley from which she was born. I had a dog once too. And, cows and horses when we lived on the farm.

Do you own any animals...you can say this about any pet...

I am sure a cat or a dog would like to roam free rather confined to smell the master's poots all day, but they are caged in a sense: leashed, commanded to stay, etc.

So, while you have an awesome point and concern, I would say that as long as no abuse is going on they may be happier than if out wandering around aimlessly.

I don't think any animal should be held in captivity, specially not for entertainment purposes. That includes water shows and circuses. Sometimes I wonder if zoo captivity is even justified. All animals that are not naturally domestic should be allowed to live freely in their natural habitats.

I think people should put themselves in the animal's place; I'm sure no person would like to be in a cage or enclosed by a fence.

The only thing I do agree with is keeping the farm animals we eat or produce our food captive because it would be a pain to have to hunt them down (sorry, I'm not a veggie eater).

I thought about this for years, ever since I saw animals at a zoo and marine life at an aquarium. Here is my thoughts on this. I have come to believe as the planet evolves there is going to be a loss of species, this has been going on for centuries. So if the younger generations are going to see them and maybe inspire some of them to help the animals of the world it then makes some kind of sense to do this.I have also thought that if these animals were not in an enclosed environment, they may have been lost along the way due to natural causes, natural predators and man himself. I travel to parts of my country where I see many animals in their habitat, from bears,moose, deer, and many birds. It is some what painful to see them in zoos and such, but it hurts even more to know that in my lifetime they may disappear for ever.

I'm pro-captivity.



I have to say that Lolita is in a bad condition but she should stay right where she is at. Think about it, if she is sad and dying from the tank she is in, wouldn't she have passed away by now?! Her trainers lover her and take as much care as they can for her. She can't get a new tank or be released back into the whale and thats final! Do you want to see her end up like how Keiko did? He was hardley around his family when he was out in the wild, so what did he do, he went back and stayed with humans. Lolita would do the exact same thing because all orcas, dolphins, etc in captivity are adapted to their trainers, zoo keepers, etc. They wouldn't have a clue of whats going on if they were realesed into the wild which brings me to another point.

If they released all the orcas and dolphins into the wild, they would most likely all die because they wouldn't know how to feed themselves, take care of themselves, and so on. And think about the orcas that were born into captivity. Would they have the chance? In captivity they are so well taken care of, given daily exams (like at SeaWorld for example).

Shamu died years ago, why? She died because us people didn't have much knowledge on how to care for orcas yet. If it wasn't for Shamu and Namu, we wouldn't have the knowledge we have of these amazing animals today.



Corky 2, my favorite orca who lives at SeaWorld California, is 43 years old. She has been in captivity since the age of about three or four. She is still very active and very healthy in today times. I went to see her this Summer and got a chance to interact not only with her but with the two orca calves (who were born right there at SeaWorld California). It was just amazing to look them in the eye, and them look right back at you. Don't you think it would be so amazing to do that? I was able to do that this summer thanks to SeaWorld for providing orcas. If it wasn't for SeaWorld and other marine parks, we wouldn't be able to get super close encounters like how I did just this Summer. I even get to interact with dolphins up close too, and its just truly amazing.

Keiko actually died of pneumonia, not from starvation. When they were examining his body he was in healty condition and he was eating well, but pneumonia is the main cause of his death. He was best off in captivity. He loved people and people loved him. He was given such great care. If only he wasn't put back into the wild.

Try to get Lolita put back into the wild if you want, but you got to think of this, do you want her to end up like Keiko? Not really be around her family, and be more around the people? She's fine where she's at. People come from all over to see her as well as people come from all over to see orcas anywhere where they are housed in captivity, maybe just maybe to get a chance to interact with these incredible animals like how I did.

Go ahead and put me down but this is my beliefs for captivity. And you know what, in a few years I'll be at Shamu stadium at SeaWorld working with these incredible animals. Oh and I saw orcas out in the wild just last week. It was incredible and I knew they belong in the wild. But they aren't captured anymore so you got to think about how great that is.

I completely agree with you. I'm an animal lover, so I feel really sorry for not only whales and dolphins, but also seals, turtles, sting rays, etc. They shouldn't be held in captivity for ANY reason, unless they were rescued from an oil spill or something of that nature. I can understand rescuing them and taking care of them until they recover... after that though... they need to be released back into the ocean where they came from.



I know if I was a whale/dolphin/etc I would want to be swimming around in the large ocean, not held in a huge glass tank with limited space!

There is no such thing as an average fly.  There is a lot of variability in fly life span.  I pick one people are familiar with, the house fly.  An adult lives maybe 2 months.  It takes about 10 days for the eggs to hatch and become adults.  So the whole life cycle is 2 to 3 months.

Garden spiders in my room (UK)?



There are 3 if them that have been living in my bedroom for about 3 days now; all male. Now, I love spiders (as close to the peak of evolution as any other order of animal that I can think of IMHO) and I've been happily snapping away at them and I've noticed a couple of things.

While one has chosen a corner of my room and just stayed there (I don't think it's moved more than a metre since it moved in), another is at this desk settling down while the third is a proper little explorer to the point that it doesn't even seem to be acting on instinct alone. Even as I type it's exploring the region of the ceiling just above my bed for no apparent reason (which is one reason why I'm asking on here) and has created a series of 'safety' lines across the length of my room which it seems more than happy to zip along at its leisure.

Also, while most spiders I encounter in the house tend to be quite shy and move only when you're not looking, and then very quickly to the nearest dark spot (even if it happens to be a person, which can be hilarious), this little Columbus isn't concerned in the slightest. As I closed in for a photo a few moments ago, I exhaled getting ready to take the shot and in a flash it dropped straight down toward me. Wondering if my freshly brushed minty flavoured breath was the reason, I stood a little further away and blew on it again and again in a flash it yanked itself back up to the ceiling and headed straight toward me on one of its little zip lines.

What interests me is that right now the room is full of little nocturnal bugs that love light and an open window, but neither spider seems to be in the slightest bit interested.

I know I've waffled on and that's just because it's Sunday and I genuinely am fascinated by these little guys. The question is, if spiders are meant to act on instinct then why are these 3 showing different behavioural patterns, and why is one so active for no apparent reason (or is there a reason that I'm unaware of)?

Cheers

The big ones can, yes - but the venom won't really bother you. It's just like two very small pin-pricks.

The small ones may try, but their chompers are not sufficiently developed to pierce human skin.

Apparently there are biters native to our climes.  Then you also need to consider the beasties that survive on imports.  I had to kill a horrific looking spider in a bunch of bananas I bought from the local Tesco.  Guess it was born after the bananas thawed out!

[Updated]
BTW only three are implicated in puncturing skin and the house spider [Tegenaria species] very rarely bite and if they do it is painless according to the FAQ on the site below.

Not all social wasps have castes that are physically different in size and structure. In many polistine paper wasps and stenogastrines, for example, the castes of females are determined behaviorally, through dominance interactions, rather than having caste predetermined. All female wasps are potentially capable of becoming a colony's queen and this process is often determined by which female successfully lays eggs first and begins construction of the nest. Evidence suggests that females compete amongst each other by eating the eggs of other rival females. The queen may, in some cases, simply be the female that can eat the largest volume of eggs while ensuring that her own eggs survive (often achieved by laying the most). This process theoretically determines the strongest and most reproductively capable female and selects her as the queen. Once the first eggs have hatched, the subordinate females stop laying eggs and instead forage for the new queen and feed the young; that is, the competition largely ends, with the losers becoming workers, though if the dominant female dies, a new hierarchy may be established with a former "worker" acting as the replacement queen. Polistine nests are considerably smaller than many other social wasp nests, typically housing only around 250 wasps, compared to the several thousand common with yellowjackets, and stenogastrines have the smallest colonies of all, rarely with more than a dozen wasps in a mature colony.

As you can see by the variety of answers not all wasp overwinter in the same way.  In warmer areas there may be little or no interruption in their activities.  Some species react more to their prey than to the weather.  In colder areas most species stay in the nest and with many only the queen survives all winter.  Some species lay eggs in the fall and the new generation emerges in the spring.  Look up the wasp you are interested in and see how it handles cold winters.  You may find it does one thing in your area and quite another in a different area.

You're still young. You still have time to choose, explore, and get experience. Some things you can do now:
*volunteer at a Aquarium/Marine Center, vet clinic, zoo, or anywhere else related to Marine Bio (or veterinary) that you can at your age
*see about shadowing a job
*Attend marine (or vet) camp, classes, or clinics
*see about swim and scuba classes
*Read books, websites, magazines, watch related television programs or educational films, hang out at aquariums,

No. They don't. Giraffes have high blood pressure so that the blood can get all the way up that long neck from heart to head. Small animals don't need such high blood pressure. Some small mammals are less able to regulate their temperatures and this is why they must hibernate in the winter or aestivate in the summer.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



That is an excellent question although it is easy to answer. The answer sadly is no because you need to look at what shivering is. When you shiver you are increasing muscle movement which stimulates blood flow to the area. This increased blood flow results in more heat since we are warm-blooded and heat is produced in our core. Cold-blooded animals on the other hand would gain nothing from shivering except to waste energy pumping extra blood to an unneeded area.

No. Shivering occurs in warm-blooded animals in order to maintain their body temperature when their environment is cold. Cold-blooded animals cannot maintain their body temperature internally the way warm-blooded ones can - they are the same temperature as their environment (hence the term 'ectothermic'). They regulate their body temperature by basking in the sun if cold, and moving to the shade or into a burrow, etc. if hot.

If moths love lights so much, why are they nocturnal?



Shouldn't someone tell them that if they bothered to get up during the day, there would be loads of light and they wouldn't have to all share one light bulb?

It's not that they love light, it screws up their navigation. Besides if they were out in the daytime they'd wear themselves out trying to fly to the sun.

Bill is on the right track but going the wrong way. Moths navigate by the moon and try to keep it on the same side as they fly. With a smaller light source, they have to keep changing their angle of flight to maintain the same angle to the light. The result is that they spiral in to the light.

Oikos is partly right.  The other reason for nocturnal movement is to survive longer from the birds during the day and to feed the bats.

When daddy worm and mummy worm love each other very much...

Of all the soil organisms, the earthworm has by far one of the most unique modes of reproduction. Earthworms are hermaphrodites, which means they have both male and female reproductive organs. This brings us to one of the oldest myths about worms: that earthworms can fertilise themselves. Though some earthworms can fertilise themselves (parthenogenesis), this is not the norm. Most earthworms require a mate of the same species to reproduce.

You can tell when an earthworm is ready to mate because its’ clitellum will change colour from pinkish to red-orange. The two earthworms line up in a head to tail fashion and exchange spermatozoa (sperm). The sperm is stored in the spermathecae. Both worms do this at the same time. A slime tube then forms around the clitellum, which dries and fills with a fluid called albumin. The earthworm then wiggles out of the tube head first. While the tube passes from the clitellum to the prostomium, it passes over the female pore which deposits ovum (eggs) into the capsule, followed by the spermatheca pore (male pore) which releases the stored spermatozoa. Some earthworms mate on the soil surface and some earthworms mate in the soil. Given the dark soil environment, we think that earthworms produce a pheromone (chemical) that signals other earthworms in the area that it is ready to reproduce.



And here's a very dramatic diagram for you!

they're all correct with around 70mph but do you know how they go so fast?

when they speed up they actually only put only one paw on the ground at a time. they alternate paws and have a large stride. the reduced friction with with the ground allows them to achieve their speed.

In humans there are two sets of teeth. The first set is called milk teeth. These start to grow at the age of about five to six months. By the age of about one and a half years, the milk teeth are complete. 
There are about TWENTY in all. That is, 10 pairs of teeth.

The milk teeth start to fall off at the age of about seven years and are replaced by the second set called the permanent teeth. These are THIRTY-TWO in number (16 pairs) and the set is usually complete at about seventeen years. There are four incisors, two canines, four premolars and six molars in each jaw.

rite.. 1st prob chimps have 48 chromosomes, humans only 46. Crossbreed if it survived wud have 47 chroms and b infertile.
So soln is to fuse chrom 2 in chimps oocyte/sperm and split equiv chrom in human oocyte/sperm making 47 chroms each...then fuse!
Yeah i know when u split a chrom u lose a  centromere section..but surely there's a centromerase enzyme 2 take care of that.
Predict offspring..1/4 australopethecus,1/2 'human' and 1/4 chimp.

Serious Answer:  An attempt to create a hybrid by pairing a Human and a Chimpanzee would very likely succeed. The level of chromosomal similarity between humans and chimpanzees is equivalent to or even closer than other species which have been interbreeded successfully.



The offspring would be termed either a "Humanzee" of a "Chuman" since geneticists name hybrids according to the convention : first part of sire's name + second part of dam's name.  "Chuman" therefore refers to a hybrid of male chimpanzee and female human, while "Humanzee" refers to a hybrid of male human and female chimpanzee.

There is a strong chance that the resulting Humanzee would be infertile. Like the mule (a cross between a male donkey and a female horse), many hybrids are unable to reproduce, limiting the ability to spawn a new species.



In an recent interview, Dr Calum MacKellar, director of research at the Scottish Council on Human Bioethics, and Professor Bob Millar, director of the Medical Research Human Reproductive Sciences Unit in Edinburgh, agreed viable offspring would be possible. Dr. MacKellar warned that scientists might try to develop the new species to fill the demand for organ donors.



Scientists have already begun blurring the line between human and animal by producing chimeras— hybrid creatures that are part human and part animal by fusing human cells with animal eggs to create hybrid embryos.



Here's an interesting list of some of the creatures with DNA equally or less similar than Humans and Chimpanzees which have been crossed successfully:



A LIGER is a cross between a male lion and a female tiger, while a TIGON is a cross between a male tiger and a female lion.

A ZORSE is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a horse mare.

A ZONKEY or ZEBRASS is a cross between a zebra and a donkey.



A WHOLPHIN is born from a mating of bottlenose dolphin and a false killer whale.



A BEEFALO is a cross of an American Bison and a domestic cow.

scientists have been testing and it seems as if zebras ARE white with black stripes, but as a scientist named Dr. Linkopen, says "no zebra is the same, as most people know, but it is mere point of view than anything else". But in MY opinion... they're white with black.

They are dark skinned animals with white stripes that came from the Quagga bloodlines.

The stripes are also there for several reasons.

1: The pattern acts like a fingerprint and allows the little ones to tell which one is mama.
2: The black and white acts as a temp regulator.  Goes back to the entire black absorbs white reflects.
3: It allows the herd to blend into more of a solid mass making it harder for predators to pick out individuals.
4: They have yet to figure out why but for some reason flying pests that carry disease seem to be turned off by the pattern.

Erm...does it make any difference? If the proportion black/white is approximately 50:50 then it isn't either way round. If there is more black, then it's white on black, and vice versa, I suppose. But the only way to tell for sure would be to travel back in time and see whether their ancestors were all black or all white.

animals hair still actually serves as protection for them. it doesn't for us anymore. the other hairs on our body do serve a purpose, such as sensory, and keeping our skin from drying out. the hair on our heads is loosing its original purposes for warmth and protection though.

I just killed this spider on my bed



I'm 230 lbs. and built pretty good, but I cannot stand to have things crawling on me.  So, when I thought I was going to bed tonight, I opened the covers to find this guy.  He was immediately smashed.  But, I've been killing lots of these guys lately on the walls, so I thought I would put it out there to see if anyone can identify it.  I would estimate the legspan to be close to 1.5 inches.  Live in the US Pacific Northwest.  No webs in the house, so I'm assuming it came from the attic.

The hobo spider is now the leading cause of serious envenomation in the northwestern United States

Edit:  It could be the ghost spider mentioned below, it's markings don't really resemble the brown recluse to me.  Still, it most looks like the Hobo to me.  Also brown recluse range is south east US, Hobo is Pacific northwest.

ooh.. that spider is called the The brown recluse spider, Loxosceles reclusa, is a well-known member of the family Sicariidae (formerly placed in a family "Loxoscelidae"). It is usually between 6–20 mm (¼ in and ¾ in), but may grow larger. It is brown and sometimes an almost deep yellow color and usually has markings on the dorsal side of its cephalothorax, with a black line coming from it that looks like a violin with the neck of the violin pointing to the rear of the spider, resulting in the nicknames fiddleback spider, brown fiddler or violin spider. Coloring varies from light tan to brown and the violin marking may not be visible. Though it rarely bites humans, this spider is known primarily for its venom, which occasionally produces necrosis at the site of the bite (see below).

Who ever said animals loved him?
I wouldn't wish death on anyone, BUT, the guy was an idiot.  The chances he took, just for money and notoriety, was ridiculous and stupid.  Wild animals CANNOT be trusted.  They are WILD animals, and wild animals are unpredictable.  Case in point:  Look at Sigfried & Roy.  Look at the so-called Grizzly Man.  Look at the zookeepers that have been attacked or killed by caged animals.  Etc, etc, etc...
I "knew" Irwin was going to get it, sooner or later, it was just a matter of time.



Again, I'm sorry he died.  But, since he was such an expert, he should have known better.
Wild animals belong in the wild, left unmolested and not hunted by humans.

The fertilisation occurs inside the chicken before the egg is fully formed.  Before an egg is laid it gets a membrane covering it which only hardens off when exposed to the air.  All eggs are soft when they are freshly laid!

They are fertalized in the hen's uteris before the shell forms, though the shell forms regardless of whether the eggs have been fertalized or not.  They get wrapped for exit like clockwork, thus ensuring the survival of future offspring or possibly breakfast for the rest of us!

First thing, a cockerel (note correct spelling) is a young male chicken, usually immature.  So an immature chicken is not gonna fertilize anything.

The female chicken is fertilized by a male way before any egg making can take place.  A hen has to be pregnant before laying a fertilized egg.  Otherwise all eggs produced wont be able to become new chickens.  The shell of an egg is a protective covering.  It protects the yolk and young chick while developing during incubation.



I would suggest you take an introductory biology course.

when the egg is fertilised it is only one cell.
The chick will develop in its sack just as a fetus develops in its sack in the womb
.
The chick sack is laid before the chick is developed and when it is out of the hen and exposed to the air, the sack hardens into a shell to protect the developing chick.

Cause the man chicken has nookie with the ladie chicken. This is why we can eat eggs as the hen are kept seperate from the males, so we can eat unfertilzed eggs. Otherwise iit would be gross!

The cockerel mates with the hen who already has the eggs inside her in different stages.  It is only when the egg is about to be laid the shell is hard.  It is like a conveyor belt of eggs.  the eggs about to be laid have shells in different stages of development like this....small yellow egg yolk....larger egg yolk...a little larger egg yolk...a little larger one than the last..then one with a very thin transparent soft shell then another slightly harder then another slightly harder than that until finally to get to the last egg in the line which is the one to be hatched and has a hard shell.  The tiny egg yolks can be fertilized by the cockerel before they shell starts developing.

I thought everbody knew!!
First, the farmer has to determine which chicken has eggs.Then, when the chicken lays the egg ( which must be the correct way up), the farmer drills a tiny hole in the sharp end  and places a drop of fertiliser inside (must be at least 60% nitrate) with a hypodermic needle (maximum 10ml).  The cockerel actually just hangs around to take the credit. Then, if the female chicken has'nt attacked, the farmer places the egg/s into a bucket of warm cow crap and leaves it for thirty one days and twelve hours. If everything is ok , a female chicken is born. If its all gone wrong, then a male chicken ( cockerel) is born and the process starts all over again.

They only eat a tiny amount of food so you shouldn't worry about them, you be more worried about JELLYFISH! There have been many sightings of them around the devon and cornwall sea's (where i live) because of global warming there may be more and maybe different species of sharks in u.k as the sea is hotter and they can now survive. But if only deep in the water, they can't come to the beach (jellyfish can though). Did you gather i hate jellyfish ;) :L

I'm not sure about how long they live, but moths aparently eat clothes, and if they're in your house they can get into things such as flour.

They're really annoying

Most of the lepidoptera have one generation a year, usually overwintering as a larva or pupa; a few species have two or more generations a year, and a few require two or three years to complete a generation. Many species overwinter in the egg stage but relatively few overwinter as adults.
Most moth larvae feed on plants. Most butterflies and moths have mouth parts fitted for sucking of flower nectar.

Hello Pussicus911

Many moths will use their proboscis (long tongue-like apparatus) to feed on nectar - this is why techniques such as sugaring and wine-roping are good for observing them.  Some moths have no mouth-parts at all and do not feed in their adult stage.

It's a common misconception that moths eat clothes - they do not; although the larvae (caterpillars) of the family Tineidae will eat some natural fibres.  Most moth larvae feed on the leaves of specific plants - for instance the Poplar Hawk Moth larvae favour sallow, aspen and poplar trees, whereas the common (in the UK) Large Yellow Underwing is less fussy and feeds on a large variety of grasses and plants.

Some species can over-winter if they're in a sheltered position and may live for several months, whereas other species will live only a few days in their adult form - but this can be after several months spent first as an egg, then as a larva (caterpillar) and then as a pupa where the caterpillars body liquifies and the adult parts are developed.



If you'd like to know more about moths in the UK, visit http://ukmoths.org.uk - it's always my first point of call to identify moths that I'm not familiar with (and that's a lot of them - there's over 2000 species in the UK alone!).

Here's a handy PDF document from Butterfly Conservation - the UK body that deals with all things to do with Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) http://www.mothcount.brc.ac.uk/downloads...

I hope this has helped you!

Theirs always confusion towards this course. It entitles you to careers in the biology/genetic make-up of animals... It doesn't teach you how to have a career in a zoo!

Even if you did get a place at a zoo, theirs sadly very poorly paid.

To gain a place for Zoology at Uni, you need foundation degrees in science. I read it in the prospectus, and it actually looks really interesting!

Face your fear.  Use the internet to research dragon flies.  My Dad calls them Darning Needles and my 3 yr old calls them helicopter bugs.

They really do come in such beautiful colors and it means you have a healthy garden and they eat icky beatles that can do damage to your plants.

I think you should learn more about them. Every creature on earth has a good purpose. Once you've read about them and have learned what good things they do for earth, you may not see them in the way you currently do.I was terribly afraid of spiders. To be honest, I still don't like seeing them. To me, they are really creepy looking but I've made my peace with them by appreciating what good things they do.

The easiest way to break any phobia is with Conditioning.  Start off by looking at photos, and once you're comfortable with looking at those, get yourself a model of one.  Just look at it at first, then touch it.  If seeing a dragonfly in flight "bugs" you, watch videos of them.  You should eventually be comfortable seeing them in the wild.
It's unlikely you'll ever have to touch a dragonfly, as they're very good at keeping away from people, but if it's any help, I survived a bite from an Antlion (which looks like a dragonfly when it's flying, but is totally unrelated) which I managed to catch in a toilet in Zambia.  Didn't even cry!

Dragonflies are among the most harmless to humans and most beneficial insects on the planet.  They will NOT bite you, even if you handle one, which I have done many, many times.



They are the fastest flying insect and can reach speeds of 35 MPH.
As they fly, they cup their hairy legs into a net and capture flying insects that they feed upon.  They catch Flies, Gnats, Mosquitoes, and many others on the wing.
The protrusions on the tips of their abdomens are not stingers, they are "claspers" used in mating.
As tough as they seem, they are actually very delicate insects, and can easily be harmed just by handling. 
There is no need to fear them.  You are bigger, stronger, and smarter than they are.  The more you learn about Dragonflies, the less you'll fear them. They are fascinating and beautiful animals.  Did you know that there are actually clubs of Dragonfly lovers.

There is no such thing like that in reality.  That does sound like something the ancient Egyptians might have thought about scarab beetles.  They were associated with bringing people back to life.

"During and following the New Kingdom, scarab amulets were often placed over the heart of the mummified deceased. These "heart scarabs" (such as the one pictured above) were meant to be weighed against the feather of truth during the final judgement. The amulets were often inscribed with a spell from the Book of the Dead which entreated the heart to, "do not stand as a witness against me.""

It's true that while senses do crossover in human beings (hearing/smelling visual stimuli, it's called synaesthesia) This arises from a difference in brain function and can be inherent in the individual or induced by narcotics. So whilst it's possible that there are dogs that can smell colour I don't think any studies of dogs brains have uncovered this phenomena, or if they have it's not the norm, just like us.

this is an interesting thought - there are people who smell in colour.



and it is true - we cannot discount anything for any one animal until we have experienced it our selves. So until we learn to mutate into dogs, then I doubt we'll ever know the truth.

No, they can't smell colour, because colour is a unique property of light, and light is uniquely perceived by the eyes.  What you mean is does a dog's sense of smell have layers of complexity that we are completely unable to imagine, that might be analogous to our sense of colour.  The answer to that question is far trickier, and you'd have to ask a dog.  Since olfactory reception requires the absorption of molecules of the substance being smelled, and the ways that they can interact with the nose are many and varied (contrast light, which has just frequency and intensity), it seems very likely that they can.

<question>



I found the largest house spider I have ever seen, and placed it in a perspex box. ?



I would like to show it to my family, as it is huge!  But will it be able to survive in this box for a couple of days?
I do not know what to fead it, or for it to drink, and I don't want to inadvertantly kill it.
So how do I ensure it lives as it will be another two days before my parents can see it?



</question>



<additional details>



Thank you for the answers given so far.  I cannot take a picture, as my only camera is on my mobile phone, and I don't think it has an option to upload pics.
My main query was how to feed it to keep it alive.  The only other insect I could find was a wood louse, and the spider seems no tinterested.  Also some bread crumbs which also, it is not interested in.
To give an indication as to it's size, the body (not inc legs) is the size of a large, man's palm.  Huge for a house spider in the UK!

I would certainly like to see a photo of this giant spider, to help identify it.



How you keep it and what you feed it depends on the kind of spider it is.  If it is a species of giant crab spider, which gets up to 11" in diameter in some parts of the world, you will need a large cage, turned on it's side since it's arboreal (tree climbing), with something that will let the spider climb up on.  If it is a wolf spider you would just need a clean jar about 3 times as wide as the diameter of the spider with about 2" of organic potting soil, and a hide for it.  If it is a funnel web (like the Giant house spider, /Tegenaria duellica/), something with corners would be best, with some sticks or random decor for the spider to build a web on.

Food would be mostly crickets, which you can buy at most pet stores for about a dollar a dozen.  You can even get some at a bait shop.  I don't recommend using wild caught food, because those could have parasites or pesticides.  Also, try not to feed it anything larger than it's abdomen and feed it 2-3 crickets once a week.

For water, give it something that is about as wide as the spider and shallow.  For my pet wolf spider I am using a soda bottle cap.

Good luck!

Added - Can you give me a body / leg size in inches or cm?  That sounds like the body is about 10cm long, which would be about the size of the largest tarantulas (T. blondi or L. parahybana).

Poke a couple of holes in the top of the box (not big enough for it to get out) so it can get air.  Spiders can live for a couple of days without food.  I don't know if they ever drink.

Put some pin holes in the top of the box if you can.  The spider can certainly live for a few days without food.  In fact they can live quit a long time without food.  They derive their water mainly from the insects they feed upon.
If you can take a photo of it, I can ID it for you.



I appreciate the fact that you do not want to harm it.  All most people want to do is kill spiders.  That kind of thinking is not good because 99.9% of all spiders are harmless to humans, and they do a great deal of good in helping to control the insect populations.  They feed on Flies, Gnats, Mosquitoes, Cockroaches, Termites, Moths, and countless other insects.

There are no "organisms" that can survive without 'life".



By definition, an organism is alive -- it has life.  Take away the "life" and the organism dies.

Many organisim, especially bacteria, can go into stasis (like suspended animation) for very long periods of time, but they are still alive.

Perhaps you are thinking of situations where a dead organism exhibits lifelike tendencies. This is known to occur in snakes that are killed, but still have certain reflexes, such as the reflex to strike. This is why you should never get too close to a snake that has been killed on the road, especially if it is poisonous. This also happens in chickens that have their heads cut off, but for all intents and purposes, they are dead.

A virus.



There is a great argument right now whether viruses are truly alive, or if they exist 'on the edge of life' as organic structures that interact with living organisms. Viruses are basically a packet of DNA or RNA - they infect a living cell, injecting its genetic code into the host cell, forcing it to replicate many copies of the virus. The argument against viruses being life forms is that they don't have a cell structure - which is considered the basic building block for all life.

Some viruses (and bacteria) can exist for hundreds of years without interacting with other life forms, but the conditions have to be right - and eventually, they have to interact with other life forms to replicate and survive.

The answer might also be 'prions' - a protein complex that can cause diseases such as Mad Cow Disease. But prions aren't considered organisms and aren't considered to be living.

Argiope aurantia, the Black and Yellow Argiope, matches your description pretty well.



http://bugguide.net/node/view/2025

Any spider that makes huge flat webs like that is harmless to humans.  Getting them to bite you would be difficult even if they had strong venom.



The only harm they could do is scare the crap out of you if you forgot it was there and ran into it.  Then again, a wall or tree could do more than that.

There are several advantages to living in a group.  The females generally get a larger choice of mates or the males have to compete more vigorously.  There are more animals to keep an eye open for danger.  More animals, usually males, are available to defend against predators.  There is relative safety in numbers.  A predator cannot usually kill more than one prey at a time.  They are able to use the combined knowledge of the group to remember where the most like place is to find food.  Usually the most experienced would probably know the most.  In a large group, more than one animal would have experience.  There would be more individuals that can train and care for young ones.

Social animals need to establish dominance.  Play allows them to see who is the strongest.  It also allows them to train for when they grow up.  In adults, it is probably more to do with maintaining alliances.

Sociality would be important with animals because it provides education and protection. Young animals in a group would be able to observe and learn from their parents or other adults around. And in many prey animals, being social means that others will be able to alert an animal to danger it hasn't spotted yet. A good example is vervet monkeys, who make calling noises to the rest of the group to warn them of the type of predator they have spotted nearby. 
Play behaviour is usually practice for when the animal reaches maturity. For example, lion cubs. They fight with each other and with adults for fun in order to hone their skills and aim. Everything they learn from this play can be put into real life hunting when they get older.
I hope this is helpful to your assignment.
