a normal respray is going to cost £1000 to £1500,a colour change is loads more work because the door shuts and inside of the doors etc have to painted as well .the last colour change i done the bill was nearly £4000 as i done the engine bay as well as all of the above.to be honest you are better of buying a black car to begin with it will save you alot of money.Hope this helps

I own my own bodyshop business. Its difficult to give a precise figure without seeing the vehicle but you would be looking at a minimum of £1200 for a quality respray. Obviously if there is rust or dents/scratches etc then it could be quite a bit more.
If you are thinking of a colour change then you really need to have the inside of the doors / under the bonnet / in the boot done as it will look odd if its a different colour. 
For a colour change inside the vehicle it really needs the engine removing, doors and boot stripping etc and this would take the cost well over £2000

Funny noise on LG washing machine when rinsing ?



I've got a LG direct drive washing machine and it makes a loudish noise when rinsing. On a spin cycle it's fine and when you spin it manually with your hand. Any ideas ?



</question>



<additional details>



Hard to explain . . .  it sounds like it's moaning if that makes sense. It's intermittent when rinsing.



Pressed the drain button and it didn't make a noise. Pulled the filter out and alot of water came out. Nothing in the filter.



Model no - WM1225FD



When you start the machine there is no noise when it's filling.

It would help if you could tell us what kind of noise.

Is at like a grating of metal against metal?

Is it a grinding sound?

Is it like a whine or a rumble.

The info. in your question is confusing.  I've never heard of an LG brand of washing machine, nor have I ever heard of a direct drive one.  All I've ever dealt with have been belt driven, upright tub & agitator machines.  If your machine only makes the loudish noise when it is in the 'Rinse' cycle, all I can think of is that you might have unusually high water pressure that is blasting into the tub while the load of clothes is spinning around to rinse them.  But if that is what is making the noise, it should be very noticeable also while the tub is filling to START the wash.  Puzzling, this is!  I'd have to see exactly what kind of machine you have to come up with a good answer.

How old is your washer.  Anything over a year or two have two pumps on them.  One to drain the water and one that recirculates the water back into the tub periodically  during the wash.  Both pumps are exactly the same and they both fit on the tube where your filter is, one on the left and one on the right.  Watch your washer if it makes the noise when no new water is being added but then most likely it is the recirc pump.

your wind screen is goosed - your insurance should cough up minus excess.

This is actually very dangerous to drive the car like this, the windsceen is a major structural part of the car and will stop / slow the roof from caving in in the event of an accident.

Dont wait - get it fixed.

Auto glass can only fix chips in the glass (ie the small hole) the crack is not repairable.

If your insurance wont cough up then it should only cost about £100 - 150 fitted even if its a bonded screen and not sat in rubber seals.

Good luck and get i changed quick as i think its also an endorsable offence to drive with a cracked screen.

If the crack does NOT reach the edge of the windscreen it can be fixed by Autoglass (?) for nothing by sucking adhesive in etc.
If it DOES reach the edge hard luck! You will have to pay for a new screen or at least an excess which does NOT affect you no claims bonus.

Could be any number of things, it will come on if you have not changed the fuel filter in ages or if you have dodgy diesel or water in the tank, I have mine come on now and again but thats because I run on cooking oil etc. I run the older 1.9 Synergie, I would try giving it a service and be careful where you buy your diesel.

Classic signs of a failed head gasket are: -
1) Overheating
2) Oil in the coolant
3) Frequent loss of coolant
4) Steam (white smoke) in the exhaust
5) Difficult starting
6) Irregular spin speed of the starter motor
Get your garage to do a compression test - or buy a compression gauge and test it yourself

If the head gasket is gone, you should be loosing water and pressurising the water system. Classic signs are emulsions in the water and/or oil, which you have - but this could be condensation. The best way is to get a pressure test carried out on the cooling system.

Cb 250rs indicator and headlamp problem?



right, i have a 1980 cb250rs, which is perfect in every way, except for the headlight and indicators being on the piss. 
the headlamp sometimes cuts out and i have to switch to full beam, it could just be the bulb but im open to suggestions.

the indicators seem buggered, when i signal left, the rear indicator flashes as it should, and when i signal right, the rear left still bloody flashes and the right does nothing. the front ones dont do anything. at all. is this all down to the flash unit?

When a bulb blows, sometimes it will affect other circuits. Other lights come on or come on dim. Replace all bad bulbs and then see what you have. The indicator bulb could be bad too, but go with the headlight first.



You can check the bulb with an ohm meter. Put one lead on the metal shell of the bulb and check each pin. It should not be open or short, but may have a reading in the 10's or 100's of ohms.



If not, maybe the connection in the headlight housing needs to be reseated.

Unless you have actualy broken the springs, the round things, see blue in the link, then it's more likely it's your shocks that have gone, not really expensive, but dangerous not to fix them.

I wouldn't advise it.  If you get springs specifically for your Sonata, you know you're getting the correct ones.  Otherwise they may not be the right diametre.  They could also be either too soft or too hard, or too long or too short.  Any of which would give you a terrible ride and could cause many other problems as well.

No because they may be a different diameter, length and spring rate which will make your car at least ride and handle like total garbage if not be completely unsafe.



Do it right and get springs designed for your car.

Follow the long fat positive lead (usually red) from the battery marked + to where it joins on.  This will be a small cylinder on top of a bigger one.  The small one is the starter-solenoid (a solenoid is an electrically-operated switch - operated by the key in this case) and the bigger cylinder is the starter-motor.

If its part of a self plumbing fitting off of your sink unit it will be the cutter rusted where it goes onto the plumbing, these were sold as a kit but the cutter is made of a cheap iron and only lasts a couple of years before blocking up. If you  are handy you can strip the fitting that connects to the main supply and clean it then just re fit. Make sure you turn the supply off first as once you disturb it you will have on hell of a leak until its fixed.

I got called out to an outside tap that had stopped working the other day. The 'check' valve (non-return valve) inside the tap had completely seized and wasn't allowing any water through whatsoever. This could be your problem, as a temporary fix you can remove the check valve assembly from inside the tap and this will get it working again. But you should replace the tap asap; as to meet water regulations your outside tap should incorporate and check valve or you should have one in the pipework upstream of the tap.

Parts stores, auto care centers garages most all of them have 
containers for used oil for the most part there is little or no charge to
drop off your used oil.  There are companies which collect this oil
and re-refine it.  It would make the EPA unhappy if they find out you 
don't get rid of the oil properly.

My local garage told me it will take them 2 days to fix it as he needs to strip the whole engine down. He also said he will change the timing belt for free if needed and also will change my fanbelt as i need a new one.

i think with the parts n labour including engine oil change it is worth £200. it is about 4 hours job. where the timing belt is concered, while changing the head gasket he will have to remove the old belt so he can just replace it with a new one.
it's just around five min job to change a fanbelt.

I've been following your posts about your Golf; You don't want a cheap job on the head gasket, you want a proper one.
The important things to ask are;
1) will the head been pressure tested whilst removed, and
2) will the head been 'skimmed' if necessary - effectively re - machined to ensure it's 100% flat.
Ask. They won't be offended if they're kosher.
As for the free cambelt, I'd say nothing's free, and it would be foolish to swap a head without fitting a new belt, so  that's to be expected.
At £250 labour, you'll be looking at £400 all in, possibly plus VAT, and that's a price for a good job - just make sure you're getting one.
If your garage is trustworthy, then that's your best guarantee.

From what I can remember you need to look at the bottom of the window, you will see that there is a metal slide with two plastic rollers. These rollers are attached to the window mechagnism by ball joints, you need to put a long flat head screw driver between the roller and the metal mechagnism. Twist the screw driver and the ball joint should pop out, they can be a little tight so you may need to use a lot of force to get them out.
Once you have the ball joint split you will need to lift th window up as high as you can and then try to remove the window mechagnism with the motor out on of the holes in the inside of the door.
Ja.

How much it would cost approcimately to add extra gas pipe in the kitchen ? ?



Recently I bought a a house, which has Gas boiler installed in the kitchen. But there is no gas cooker point. All the gas pipes are outside on the wall. The previous owner told me that it is easier to add extra gas pipe if the pipes are outside on the wall(instead of under the floor). She has also told that, she had gas cooker in the past, but there was some gas leak once, so she has got all the pipes re-installed. At the time of re-installation the pipe to the cooker point was removed, as she went for electric cooker. Now, we want to add extra pipe to the cooker point. How much it would cost approximately? Thank you for your help.

If British Gas do it then it will be around £300-£350. Get a CORGII registered plumber/heating eng and it will be a days work at around £175.

No one can tell you, without looking at the job you need to see what is involved ??  Get someone who is a registered gas fitter to come and give you a price this is normally free. 
When the work is completed make shore you get a certificate from the company or person for insurance purposes.

OK UK Guy, You don't say where in the world you live, or what sort of floor the house has, in the UK its usual to have wooden floors and have the gas pipe enter by a meter, unless you are in a remote location and have Calor gas when it will be a regulator. The charge in the UK will depend on how much pipe is needed and how long the work takes. Taking up floor boards and getting access under kitchen units all adds to the time needed to complete a job. However some houses have an access point to get under the floor , this is more usual when the house is older, has a cellar or is on a hill, where there is plenty of space under the floor. Usualy there are steps up to the front or back door if there is underfloor space.



In the UK A gas fitter has to be  be CORGI. registered to work legally. they will have studied and worked for  three years minimum to gain their qualification, equivalent to a degree course, and they have to take an exam periodically to ensure they are up to date with all developments, something that the government are only now considering that doctors should do.
A gas fitter charges around £25 per hour. A good one will give you an estimate of how long the job will take when they have had a look at the situation, they should also give you a good estimate of the price, and the disruption to the house that will be necessary to fit the pipe. if the gas pipe is all fitted on the outside of the house it should be sheathed to protect it from accidental damage.

As to your alloys, if they are new, I'd check with the mfg. about possible causes, perhaps the paint wasn't applied properly. Another possible cause is age and amount of use, or even the type of cleaner you use on your wheels. Again, consult the wheel maker or even a pro detailer for ideas. Rust on the brake rotors is, unfortunately, a part of life. If the vehicle is driven on a regular basis, the rust shouldn't be there long after pulling away from the curb. If, however the rust is the ugly, evil scaled type, you might consider having them resurfaced or replacing them. Too much of that type of rust could compromise the safety of your brakes if it eats away too much of the rotor.

What about thinking of getting a New one? If the battery is over 5 years old its recommended. If the battery isnt holding the charge it could be your alternator is wearing out.

Undiluted antifreeze will freeze. The "Neat" antifreeze I am guessing you are referring to is the "pet and children safe" (I don't remember who makes it) but all cars can use it, if you can still find it.

Mix ratios of water/anti-freeze over 50% actually have less cooling capacity than straight water, so are never used in practice. 
The two type of anti-freeze commonly in use are Ethylene Glycol and Methanol based, methanol should never be used in engines with a high aluminium content as it reacts and corrodes.
Carburol used to make a coolant called 'For-life' which as the name implies was use for the life of the engine and added undiluted.

None that I know of, the water is a better liquid for the transfer of heat and the antifreeze is only there to prevent it from freezing. No doubt salt would also do the job but it would also destroy the engine through corrosion another thing the antifreeze does, prevent corrosion.

Wash it at dusk or dawn - your biggest problem with a black car is the sun heating it & drying it out. Or wash it in the garage if you have one.

ps I accept no responsibility if, after following my advice, the neighbours have you committed - at least the car will be clean.

Let it sit under a shade if possible. I usually wash mine early morning while it is still rather cool out. Dawn dishwashing soap. Wash and rinse each section at a time, @ l fender, left door, left 1/4 panel, etc. When I am through washing all the car in sections, I throw a bucket of clean wash onto the car and rinse it immediately. Work from top down in all stages. Rinse, Rinse, Rinse.Good luck

Black cars are a lot of fun to keep clean, I had 2 of them at one time a few years ago and about pulled my hair out trying to keep them clean, never wash a black car in the sun to begin with and when done washing I use a shammy that i bought at walmart called the absorber and it works great on black to get all the watermarks off but you still get a haze on the car because it's black so then you need to get a bottle of MeGuires detailing spray polish and some microfiber towels and polish the car when done drying it, it will only take a few minutes to go over the car with the spray polish and it will look great.

Whats wrong with my car?



My Volkswagen Golf rev counter keeps Jumping up & down...

I've got a Volkswagen Golf 2001 (mk 4) 
Milleage 78,000

Everytime the car is stationary the rev counter keeps jumping up & down but It does not go over 1000rpm. Is that normal?

My mate use to have a Audi a3 and he use to have the same problem. he says that the common fault with VW.

Anyone else experiencing the same problem?

Or anyone knows what the problem may be. I took it to a garage but they said thats normal.

They use a cheap tachometer gauge, it won't hurt anything other than being an annoyance. If you replace the tachometer head the new one will start acting erratic at some point as well.
I would just ignore it.
Good Luck!

Well, assuming it's jumping and not just moving a bit, it's not normal. At all. Probably a vacuum leak, or the gauge is bad. You need to find out if the gauge is acting up or if the engine is indeed changing RPMs. It's not that common.

The rev counter is connected to the inlet manifold, maybe leaking air at that point.

Its not an unusual problem for VW cars to have rev counter problems, there are two possible reasons for its. First the wiring connector block on the back of the clocks has come slightly of the connectors. You will need to remove the clocks from the dash and push it back in.
The second reason could be that the rev counter itself has packed up. Again you will need to remove the rev counter and replace it with another on. Get the replacement from a scrap yard, you should pay no more than £20 for it.
Ja.

I think a 2000 model golf has an electric speedo signal and not a cable, you need to check the sender unit fitted to the top of the gear box. Its either the connections or the sender that has failed.
Its also possible that you have a connection problem on the rear od the instrument cluster, this could be a simple problem like the connector block has fallen off.
Ja.

Hi there.

First off. Please ignore the other answers as they are all WRONG!

A 2000 VW Golf does not have a cable to operate the speedometer. they stopped using cables on golfs in 1990.

It also can not be the speed sensor as many other things in the car would be affected.



The clusters in these vehicles go bad all the time. I replace up to three a month! Just last week i replaced one in a Jetta for the same reason!

Check with your dealership. They should be well aware of this problem and offer an exchange cluster for a reasonable price.

DO NOT get a used cluster. the used cluster will need to be programmed to the car (obd2) and then have the mileage set. If you pay for all that and then the cluster fails: you will be screwed!

i hope this helps. Good Luck!

You most likely have it connected backwords.  Double check the battery for a + and a - the + should connect to red on your battery pack or jump leads and the - goes to black.  Do not trust the colors on thte battery leads, look at the battery markings.

Either you have it backwards or your battery has a dead cell. When the cell is dead, it creates a short circuit.  I hooked up a jumper cable to a car with a dead cell and my cables actually got too hot to touch within 5-10 seconds.  Thats a clue too.  Under normal circumstances, the cables should still fee. cool through the cable when hooked up.

If the battery has a dead cell, then its history and time for a new one.
However, I didn't have sparks or smoke with the dead cell issue.  Now hooking it up backwards will give you a nice light show.

Check out the return.  Most cars use the bodywork for the return from the lamp clusters to the battery.  If the connection between the lamp cluster and the bodywork is corroded, the lamps will be dim or you may find the wrong ones come on.

For all the clever clogs telling this poor chap its a simple job, remember it most likely is an electric mirror. In which case on the focus you need to remove the door card to access the connector.



About an 45 minutes labour and the cost of the part  is what I'd be charging.

So say £30 labour and £50? new for the mirror.

OK  depends if just the glass or if the frame is OK or not.  I replaced a glass myself for £20,  as frame was undamaged,  apart from a couple of scratches.



If a new frame is required, which involves colour matching the paint,  and the glass as well, then the labour charge. it would be about £100 .  Also depends a bit if it is  manual or electric adjusted

If you were a new customer coming in off the street it would be $100 labor and about 60.00 parts. If you were one of my regular customers I would give you a break and say like $50 labor 60 parts. If I install the mirror and for some reason it falls off either through my fault or faulty components you would expect me to replace it free of charge. Also while the actual job takes like 10 minutes I first have to talk to you and find out what you want done lets call that 5min, then the actual work (pull car into shop, remove old mirror, install new mirror, check for good fit and make sure I didn't leave greasy fingerprints all over cause your not the only customer,) lets call that 15 minutes, after that's done I have to fill out the invoice and collect payment 5-8 minutes. Sure its not a big deal but its time I'm not working on another car that you might consider to be a "hard job". Also I pay taxes too, don't think I get every bit of that money. And anyone who does this for a living knows the easy jobs are always the biggest pains.

There are several options here - If it's just the glass, then around £25.
If the whole unit has to be replaced, then I'd say that an electric mirror unit would be between £40 for an aftermarket unit such as these;
http://www.wingmirrorman.co.uk/focus.htm...
or nearer £100 for the part from Ford.
If the shell is colour coded to your bodywork, that would add around £30 to be colour matched, and with any complete mirror replacement, I would expect a garage to charge around £50 - the door trim has to come off to access the connector plug on a Focus.
So a maximum quote could easily be £200.

Hi,
There may not be a separate fuse for the seat. It could all be wired on the same circuit with all the other local electrics.

The only options are to take the vehilce to a mechanic/garage, or for another user to have had the same problem themselves, who knows where it is.

It may not be the fuse, there are other faults that could prevent the seat from working correctly.

I've never seen a car or van come fitted with a bullbar as standard.

It was most likely an option ordered at the dealers.



The reason no cars come with a bullbar is that no manufacturer makes a bullbar. Plenty of cars have 'factory approved' bullbars fitted, but they are sourced from other companies.

Anyway, you would need to consult local laws in your area to see the rules and regulations on bullbars.

From 25th May 2007, it is illegal to continue to manufacture, market non approved metal bull bars (no sale is necessary to be breaking the law) and sell metal bull bars that do not comply with the new EU legislation (Directive 2005/66/EC) for pedestrian protection. The maximum penalty to be imposed within the UK is 12 months in prison and a substantial £20,000 fine.



The only exceptions are EU approved energy-absorbing systems, normally made of plastic and known as front protection systems.

Yours, however, are fine..

Your 1994 Suzuki may well have come with a bull bar as standard - I bought three Bedford / Vauxhall Rascals new in the late '80s & '90s, and I know they were an option.
As per the last answer, it's now illegal to supply or fit bull bars, but this is not retrospective, so yours is fine.

Sounds a lot like a head gasket.
Don't drive it any more because if it blows through INTO the engine, that's the end of the engine. It sounds like you're lucky that it has only blown on the outside so far.

It could be a stuck Thermostat but when you say brown is it oily like engine oil? if so it is the head gasket but if it's just the tye of antifreeze it uses it may be that color. Change the antifreeze replace the thermostat and gasket then try if it still bubbles then it's a head gasket but that's cheaper.

It sounds like it. There's a LONG list of symptoms and those are among the big ones. It could also be simply rust in the water, and low level of antifreeze in the mix. Did the shop you asked to a cylinder compression test?



That's where they disconnect the ignition, and cylinder by cylinder remove the spark plug, and attach a compression gauge. The ideal number will vary from make to make, but what you'll want to look for is the difference between readings in the cylinders. A major difference from one to the other pretty much seals the question. Just make sure a reputable shop does the test. A novice, or dishonest mechanic may report a valve train problem if/when it's ONLY the head gasket.



Another quickie test you can do yourself is to run the engine, and put your hand over the exhaust pipe. (make sure it's not HOT first!) In many cases, head gasket trouble can manifest as vaccume THEN positive pressure in the exhaust. there should ONLY be positive pressure. A sucking effect sucks, cause it means big trouble with your rig.

Brown scum in the coolant is a very strong indication of tiny amounts of oil getting into the coolant - this is very often the first indication of a head gasket failure. add to that the bubbling in the coolant it is about a 98% certainty that the head gasket has failed - the other 2% possibility is a cracked cylinder head and we do not want to go there!  Unless you have a mechanic in whom you have absolute confidence ... get three or more estimates for repair (by phone - say the following: I believe my 02 VW golf has a blown head gasket how much will the replacement cost? ) based on the following assumptions: Replacement of head gasket, Replacement of timing belt (just do it!) Flushing coolant system and installing all new coolant.  Replacing engine oil and filter. Replacing the spark plugs using factory original spark plugs - accept no substitutes! If the mechanic objects to using factory plugs on your request go elsewhere!

Could this be a symptom of too much oil ?? ?



The garage claims on the invoice I got from them, that the techniciain added 0.35 litres of oil to my engine (1.8 ZETEC E).  The level was about half way between minimum and maximum on the dipstick before the addition was made.

Now when I check the oil level on the dipstick on as level surface as I have access to, I find that the level is either exactly on the maximum mark or if above only by about 3mm or so. (The distance between MIN and MAX is about 14mm on the dipstick and this is 1000ml of oil).



Whilst accelerating up an incline I just feel that the car drives/feels different (a bit sluggish) than before it was topped up by the technician. The engine revs freely when I press the accelerator while in neutral, so perhaps it is not the engine at fault). Also wouldn't it take more than 0.35 litre of oil to cause the crankshaft to whip through the oil in the sump and cause sluggishness ?  Maybe if feels different simply becuase previously there was less oil in the engine ?

What would the oil on the dipstick look like if this was happening to the engine e.g. small bubbles when cold or hot ?

You could be right. You can drain some of the oil out when you are on a level surface. Have some new oil handy in case you drain too much. Little engines like that don't have the power to fight having too much oil. Check cold & on level surface in the morning or after it sits for a few hours. G'luck.

i have seen cars come into the shop with 4 or 5 quarts more than they should have. but they still drove in. if the shop only added that little, i would look somewhere else or at least check the dipstick. typically if an engine is that far over full ( the two quarts plus that i referred to), the engine will end up blowing a seal.

A bit more info is needed really.Does the truck turn over at all when you try to start it,or is there just nothing at all? Does the truck have an alarm or/and immobiliser.If truck turns over but will not start or starts and cuts out almost immediately and you have an alarm/immobiliser i would say that your problem is to do with that.Disconnecting the battery has possibly messed up the coding and they will need to be reprogrammed to each other.You will need a dealer or if you know the type of alarm/immobiliser,maybe you could find instructions on the net.I know with an old one of mine i had to hold down fob button as i reconnected the battery for about 20 seconds to marry them back up again

"Overcharged" Air Conditioner/ Too Much Freon?



A mechanic told me the air conditioner in my Honda Civic is "overcharged" but Im having my doubts. In the 3 years I've had the car, I've never done anything with the freon nor have I had any problems with the AC. How do I know if my air conditioner is "over charged?" Are there any signs that there is too much freon? For example, if its "over charged" will the air still blow cold? Will it make any sounds, etc?  Can freon levels increase on their own (haha- I really know nothing about cars!)? What's the process to get the levels down and what should it cost me if it really does need to be done? 
Thanks!



</question>



<additional details>



The mechanic wants to charge me $200 for some sort of process (I dont quite understand because Im not a mechanic) that would drain the freon... & basically start over. I really dont want to pay so much for something I dont need...

If the AC works, then the pressures have to be fairly close.  There are pressure switches for high pressure and low pressure that will disconnect the compressor if the pressures are too far off, either way.

Your mechanic would have to place a set of gauges on the lines to determine the pressures, and if he did this, then why didn't he go ahead and correct the problem?

Take it somewhere else and get a second opinion on it, if you are still worried.

good luck to you

If there is no doubt your ac system has ever been recharged, I would have serious doubts that it is over charged.



You may have never had an A/C service performed, but that doesn't necessarily mean the system hasn't been recharged. For instance, you may have had engine work performed where an A/C line had to be removed to get to a component. In this case the mechanic would have removed your freon and then recharged the system when he/she was done. In that case it could have been over charged.

But if you are absolutely certain the system has never been recharged, then I am going to assume the mechanic made his/her diagnosis based on the manifold gauge readings. Perhaps both the low and high side gauges were reading much higher than normal. In some cases this would be correct.

There are other reasons he/she was seeing unusually high manifold readings. It is possible the cooling fan was not drawing enough air through the condenser when he/she was testing the system.



Whether or not the system is over charged I would certainly like to know why the system pressure is too high. Yes, the system may still be cool. But it could lead to an expensive failure

if the system is over charged, it would not work as well. the potential high and low pressure sides, would not have that great of a difference. with too much in there, both low and high side pressures would be higher, and the flow through the low side would be slower actually defeating the whole purpose of the ac. if he did not hook up a set of  gages to see what the pressure were.



the levels can not increase on there own. in fact they will drop with normal use.

ANy idea how to stop the rain from getting into our SEAT Toledo



every time it rains we end up with an in door swimming pool we need to place news papers under the foot mats to dry up the water but now the car is really starting to smell of dampness we can not affrod to replace the seal as it will cost a couple of hundred pounds and we're not sure if it's the door seals or something else letting in the water is there anything else that will dry out the car quickly.

Most likely the rubber door seals need renewing, (common fault on all VAG models!) these can be bought quite cheap off ebay or from a local scrap yard, which would be even cheaper if you remove them yourself.(Much cheaper than £100 anyway!) You may only need the front door rubbers renewing..
Also sometimes the rain comes in through the bonnet pull! This is harder to stop, but is down to the rubbers under the bonnet!

You can try rubbing silicone grease (from a hardware or plumbing shop) over all your rubber seals. This MAY help.
In addition to lubricating and softening the rubber,  allowing it to form a tighter seal, it will stop any water that is seeping through a tiny crack by capillary action (because silicone is hydrophobic and repels water). Don't forget the seals on your sun-roof.

Sometimes water can seep in around your front or rear windscreen. There is a sealant that you can apply to these seals, it creeps around the perimeter seal and fixes any leaks. this is available from marine suppliers and is called "Captain Tolley's creeping crack cure".

Make sure that any drain holes in the bottoms of your doors and frames are clear, otherwise the doors can fill up with water.

You can help to dry the car out by putting a couple of chemical dehumidifiers in it. These cost around three pounds each from Halfords or woolworths and work by absorbing water from the air. They do work but to dry your car completely will probably take over a week. Newspaper under the foot mats is very effective, change it frequently though.

Keep your heater on and your windows open when driving to help a bit, too.

If you get the de-humidifiers, it's better to take them out when you are using the car, you don't want the contents spilling into the car because it will NEVER dry out and it will corrode metal.

You need to find out were the water is coming from. The best way to do this is to remove the carpets (Also a good time to clean them to remove the smell).
Then take the car to your local car wash, use a jet wash and spray the car with somebody on the inside of the car looking to see were the water is coming from.
There are several places were the water typically comes from:-
First there are rubber plugs fitted into the floor under the carpet, some times they split or pop out.
Secondly the seal around the door could be damaged.
Thirdly where the cables and wires come through the fire wall of the car, rubber grommets are used to seal the holes up. Again some times these can leak.
Ja.

Does it have a sunroof? If so check the drain channels for it. You should see a couple of holes on either side inside the sunroof area when it's open. Pour some water down them and see if it comes out at the bottom of the car, if it doesn't, use a stiff cable or similar to poke down the holes to clear the blockage.
Every car I've ever had with a sunroof has leaked because of this.

also depending on where your ariel is.

My previous fiat used to leak through the ariel gasket (bottom of ariel)

this then in turn leaks on to the headlining in the car and runs down the windscreen/doors.

I fixed this by unbolting the ariel from inside (maybe inside your centre light) putting some rubber sealant around the base of the ariel and then bolting back down.

My girlfriend had this once and used clear nail varnish to seal it up

If it has been sealed up tight and it's not contaminated with anything I would say so. It is usually running through your car for a year or so with contamination and it still performs ok! So sitting on the shelf I would assume it's OK. I would use it in my car if it were mine. If your going to toss it out, mail it to me and I will use it and save myself $10.00.....lol.just kidding.

In a nutshell, no. They dont need permission to build anything in their garden as long as it does not traverse the boundaries or break building regulations (such as if they were building another house without granted planning permission.)
You sound a lot like my neighbour...he's always snooping over the fence but never says hello or good morning to us!

Not unless it is so high that it changes the view from your garden. If the fence is yours then in the event that it needed replacing or repairing the decking must not interfere with the fence. If it does and the decking needed removing to deal with the fence you could not be held accountable for the work they would have to do after your repair work.

There may be an issue if they will be able to overlook your garden more from the deck than they can now.  Unlikelyy if it is 4-6 inches from the ground, but if it is 5 feet in the air, then possibly.  You coudl ask the council planning office, but I woudl suggest you talk to your neighbours and maybe they can screen the side near you.

Go back to a paper filter. You want a filter that FILTERS! not one that flows better. Your engine can get more air than it will ever need thru a stock filter, Way to many people listen to the hype! Paper filters are the choice of top engine builders and every team in NASCAR runs paper. Here is a link to a independent test comparing them:

None.

If you want to see oil getting in an engine take off your intake manifold. I promise if that car has half as many miles on it as mine it will be covered in nasty gunk you wouldn't want in your cylinders. Just look up what PCV valves, EGRs, etc. do and you'll see that nothing you spray on a K&N is going to mess up your car any worse than stock emission related components.

i run a K&N as i have on my last 4 cars.  i haven't had any issues from them.

sometimes the oil in the will gum up the Mass Air Flow sensor, but for the rest of the engine they won't hurt it.  they can cause them to run a little hotter, but often they are temed with an aftermarket exhaust which runs cooler so, as on my car, the engine runs slightly cooler than stock.

but, if i were getting another one today, i'd buy something else.  The K&N is one of the originals and has not been kept up to date.  an AirAid or Green filter will actually filter down to a much smaller size, even smaller than a traditional filter will hit while still allowing as much or more air flow.

You have a valid concern. If the filter has been washed with K&N soap solution and water, dried out and re-oiled PROPERLY on a regular basis, I don't think you have anything to worry about.

I have a car with 142,000 miles on the odometer that has had the same K&N filter since 31,000 miles. I wash, dry and re-oil it every summer. To date the motor (24 valve V6 Ford) uses not a drop of oil between 3,000 -3,500 mile oil and filter changes.



The secret is: How well did the other person maintain the filter? You really need to know if the filter was EVER washed before oiling. You might play a little dumb and inquire exactly how he seviced the filter.

Hyundai Atoz, Major problem???



Having major problems now, the car wont even start!
when reving the car the engine sounded like it kept clogging/popping so i thought it might have something to do with the exaust, i looked under the car and i think between section 1 to 2 from the engine there was exaust smoke escaping from the joint.
my neighbour who knows more about cars than me jumped in and also had a look under the bonnet but could not help, maybe made things worse because the car wont start now. sounds daft - i have no idea about cars but i think there may be a blockage in the exaust?
anyway, car wont move forward in gear, has a leak in the front sections of the exaust and now wont start, there was also a real acrid smell coming from the car that left a nasty taste....

any ideas???



</question>



<additional details>



just tried it again to see if i could hear hissing but the car would barely start, certainly not enough to get a response from the exaust...

Sounds like a blocked catalytic converter I think that is why you have it blowing gasses out of the pipe, dont keep trying to start it or it could blow the head gasket due to the pressure. You could try getting someone to unbolt the cat off of the exhaust then try to start it, but you might find that you have already blown the head gasket and thats why it fails to start. If you are not sure what you are doing get a mechanic to have a look.

You need to start with the obvious things, check to make sure that you have fuel to the engine, spark at the spark plugs and compression in the engine. Check to make sure that there is life in the battery, check all the electrical connections from the battery to the starter, they should be good clean and tight.
The exhaust probably has nothing to do with the non starting, if its leaking on the joint you and remove the clamp, slide the exhaust backwards to split the pipe, apply exhaust sealer and then reassemble with a new clamp.
Ja.

Did the car start to lose power before this happened? I would agree it sounds like it could be a blocked cat or something up the exhaust, especially if if the smell is like rotten eggs. Get the cat disconnected from the front pipe and see if it starts, if not then move on to checking the spark and fuel etc.

If your exhaust is blocked it will build up pressure while the engines running. Listen at the tail pipe for a hissing, it sometime continues for a few seconds after the engine is switched off.

EDIT

Undo the first exhaust joint where the exhaust meets he manifold and try for a start.

Bought new cooker. Last time gas hose and securing chain were included, not this time. Is that normal?



Is it normal that you get neither the gas hose nor the securing chain (for free-standing cookers) when you buy a new cooker?  The hose I can kind of understand, but seems a bit of a backwards step to the seventies, when you had to go out and buy a plug every time you bought anything electrical.

Thanks for the responses.

Some people seem to be confused about when you need a CORGI registered installer and when you don't.  The most important thing is that the installer MUST be competent to do the job.  The second thing is that if the installer is rewarded for the job he MUST be CORGI registered.  If you have equivalent qualifications but are not registered with CORGI, you can fit a gas cooker PROVDED you DO NOT accept any payment or reward for the job.  I hope that makes it a bit clearer for people.  There are a lot of misconceptions.  ALWAYS check an installer's CORGI registration.  There are different types of registration, someone registered for plumbing and fitting a cooker may not be registered to service a boiler.  Don't let yourself be conned by shady or sharp practices.

yes it is now, they are not usually supplied some makers do most dont. It usually states in the instruction manual if it requires  chain and/or stability bracket (if you have an eye level grill usually it requires both). Dont forget to level the cooker with the adjustable feet when its in position, most fitters dont do it but it's good practice to do so. Hope this helps.

There are two reasons why the store doesn't include hoses or chains in the package. First is cost.  There is fierce competition to win your business by offering products at the lowest cost - so only the basic cooker is supplied.  You want anything else, you pay extra.  Then there is safety.  Only Corgi registered gas fitters are allowed to connect gas appliances, so the trade is restricting supply of gas spares to qualified people to prevent customers from DIYing.

When was the last time the car was serviced? The most likely reason for failing on emissions is that either the air filter needs replacing or the spark plugs are gaped wrong.
Another common problem with Astra cars is that over time oily gunge builds up in the crank case ventilation system. This is easy to fix, all you need to do is remove the thick black rubber pipe from the top of the engine that runs to the injector manifold and clean it out with carb cleaner.
At the same time give the outside of the fuel injector "Carb" a good clean with the cleaner. At the front of the "Carb" you will find the engine idle controller. Again over time it gets covered in dirt and does not work correctly.
Ja.

OK, first things first, it seems you may have a dud sparkplug or plug lead, try changing the plugs and leads to see if this stops the misfiring.
Another possibility could be a valve problem, with the plugs out, try a compression tester, each cylinder should give similar readings, if one is a lot lower than the other three, it's time to get the spanners out.
Also, before you retest the car, try changing the air filter, this can sometimes help the emissions readings.
Hope this helps!

Ok, the engine is misfiring, so you need to take it to a mechanic who can service it.  You could probably change the spark plugs yourself and check all the HT leads, but if you don't know what you are doing, then just pay an expert.  The car will run a lot better for it.

with the engine OFF and COLD, remove spark plugs one at a time and check for gap, if gap is ok, then check for deposits, a ligth dark gray deposit is fine, black wet deposit is oil leaking past rings or valve stem seals, thick grey deposits is caused by weak ignitions, usually caused by bad spark plug wire. gasoline smell on plugs indicates leaking injectors.

might be a faulty sensor or broken gauge.

FACT: All fuel tank readers are set up to be not 100% accurate. you can use 1-3 gallons and the reader still reads Full and the reader can read Low when there's 1-3 gallons left. The manufacture designed them like this b/c customers perfer them like this. They used to have exact readers but it became a problem to people who can't read right.

There could be a few reasons for this, first the power steering fluid level is low, second the power steering system has air in the fluid. Thirdly its possible that if the noise is coming from the steering column that one of the bearings in the steering column has dried up.

Bad burning smell and white smoke coming from the engine.?



I have 98 Dodge Neon 4 cylinder duel overhead cam. In the past year, I have had the head gasket replaced the valve gasket, the radiator, several hoses and plugs. Not to mention a long list of non-under the hood work done.  All in all I have dumped more then $2,000 worth of repairs into this hunk of junk, and now a new problem has arisen.  Yesterday, I noticed a bad burning smell somewhat like rubber but not quite coming from the engine,  also small amounts of white smoke.  I checked the fluid levels and my oil was dangerously low, the coolant was a little low, nothing to bad.  I filled the oil and topped off the coolant.  There has been a slow leak of oil for sometime, no one can seem to figure out where it’s coming from.  But what concerns me is the smoke and burning smell.  I checked the belts and they look fine,  however there is a generous amount of oil all around them.  Also there is an abnormal whirring sound coming from the area, I thought it was coming from the timing belt, but I’m leaning more towards the serpentine. Could this just be oil buildup burning off the exhaust or belts?  I asked my step dad, and he said I should clean up the engine first to get the oil out of there.

I agree with your dad that you should clean the engine first. Now on to the questions from me. When they head gasket was changed, was it because of the notorius neon bad headgasket leaking oil thing, or something else? Also while they had the head off did they do a valvejob and use new valve stem seals?  How about the timing belt and the cam and crank seals? The smell you are describing sounds like oil leaking and getting hot and smoking scent that a lot of us are all too familiar with. If the oil is near your drive belts, then it's time to check your repair order and see if the shop replaced your timing belt, and if they did, look for camshaft and crankshaft seals. Those are known to go bad after 70-90,000 miles and will leak lots of oil that migrates to hot spots and make the smell you are describing. If they were not replaced, and if you were not spoken to about them, I'd be fussy right about now. It's been a year though so you'll liely have to pony up the coin to fix it if this is the case. Same if it was recommended and you refused, but I don't know why anyone would as the belt comes partially off to do the head anyway. figure 1 more hour of labor charged to do the belt replacement and seals. I hope you get this locked down soon, as you are already in the area where you won't get your money back on the repair even if you sell the car right afterward. My money is on the tbelt/seals.
Good luck

My handbrake warning light (the ! symbol to show its on) comes on when i go round sharp corners, even though my handbrake is fully down/off. It started doing this about a month ago, its a 2 year old car.
Ive been told this could be because its sensitive, how do i de-sensitise it, can i do it myself or does it have to go into a garage and if so would it be covered unde the warrenty?

check your brake fluid level. Some vehicles also use that light for fluid level. so when you go around a corner the fluid shifts and the sensor sees a low fluid signal. It should also come on if you accelerate fast.

The "Handbrake" light covers all sorts of things to do with the brakes. Might be a badly fitted switch on the lever, low brake fluid level, or quite possibly the brake pad wear warning. 
As it's brakes I would have a garage look at it

My car will not start. It's got spark, turns over, fuel pump sounds to work. maybe it's the fuel filter?



I have a 2002 Chevrolet Malibu V6 with 82000 miles, bought it 6 months ago at 79000 miles. In the past month(I live in Alaska) when temperatures dipped to the low 30's at night time, it seemed to need to crank over more times until it actually started than usual. 
Now when I try starting it, you can hear it turn it over, it has gas, it has spark, all the belts work, when you put the key in, you can hear something turning on(I think is the fuel pump) but it does not start. I think it may be the fuel filter. Any other good ideas of what it may be? Any idea where exactly the fuel filter is on this car and how easy it is to change it? I assume the fuel filter is by the engine somewhere.



</question>



<additional details>



The problem I have, which is why I hoped to get a second opinion it is the fuel filter, I have it in my University's parking lot and if it's not the fuel filter or if the fuel filter cannot be changed on site, I need to tow it.

Just take off the air filter and spray in to the manifold (about 2 secons of spray only) LOOK OUT FOR EXPLOSIONS!!!

you can test for fuel pressure on the fuel rail. Get a pressure tester and see what you have. You should have 50-60 psi. A filter is cheap enough ($14.00 for that car) and easy enough to change. Its close to the fuel tank in back on the drivers side. I believe you have to have the coupling removal tool but they are cheap as well.  The problem is that you can easily start throwing money and parts at it hoping to hit it and save yourself some money but end up spending more than if you took it to a mechanic to have it fixed. The shotgun approach to auto repair is always expensive.

Turn the key to "on" and reach under the car and hit the fuel tank a couple times with your fist or your foot if you can kick it.
Then try to start it, If it starts up your fuel pump is dead.



The reason I think it is your fuel pump & not the filter is because a restricted fuel filter usually causes the vehicle to lose power under a load. Your car was hard to start but you did not mention it running poorly once it did start.

In summary, I think your fuel pump is not "waking up" when you first turn on the key but if you can give it a shake by hitting the tank it will probably jar it to life and work until you shut the key off again. The fuel pump is in the fuel tank on your car.

If it starts, drive it somewhere where you can work on it. The fuel tank will have to be drained & lowered to replace the pump if it is like most cars. Sometimes you get lucky and can access it through the trunk, I am not sure on a 2002 Malibu.

Good Luck!

Messed up window blinds...?



Yeah so, it's been like this for 2 days now and I'm seriously annoyed. I was just fixing them so people next door would quit watching me, and this morning the left side was up higher than the right. I can usually fix this but nothing's working. x.x Google's talking about some thing for PCs, that's not what I mean. &lt;_&lt;



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Most window blinds (horizontal) have 3 strings.. left, center, and right, that all gather together off to one side of the blinds (usually the right side).

If you look at where those strings come out of the bar at the top, you will see a small wheel up inside it.  This is a 'friction catch' for the strings.  If you pull on the strings you will raise the blinds.  Try pulling on just one string, to see which one it is.  Don't pull too far, you only need to see which side moves.  Then pull another.  You might find it convenient to use a marker to put a little color on the string, for future reference.  Black for left, Red for Right, for example...you can use any color, I just mention those two because most folks have them in a drawer, hehehe.
Ok, once you know which string goes to which side, you can even up the blinds... get the bottom level.  Then, to set the height of the bottom of the blind, you hold onto all three, pull down and off to the side a bit, to release the catch at the top... raise or lower all three strings as a unit, to where you want the bottom of the blind, and then engage that friction catch (the wheel) to hold the strings.  You do that by simply letting the strings pull straight up into the blind.  Just try to get the strings so they lay flat, adjacent to each other, as they go up into the blind.  If they bunch up...then you may have one string that will not be held by the friction catch... this is probably what happened to you over night, and that one side dropped farther.

Top radiator hose usually connects to the water neck / thermostat housing on the top of the engine. However it being a Citroen they might do it a little differently, but I doubt it. Hope that helps!

So long as you didn't drain the central heating then it should be fine.Modern boilers are fitted with pressure and flow switches,overheat stats etc,so unless its an older boiler with a cast heat exchanger and you drained the heating then it will be fine.If it is the latter then you could have melted the gasket seal.

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I own my own bodyshop business. Its difficult to give a precise figure without seeing the vehicle but you would be looking at a minimum of £1200 for a quality respray. Obviously if there is rust or dents/scratches etc then it could be quite a bit more.
If you are thinking of a colour change then you really need to have the inside of the doors / under the bonnet / in the boot done as it will look odd if its a different colour. 
For a colour change inside the vehicle it really needs the engine removing, doors and boot stripping etc and this would take the cost well over £2000

Look for the battery. The air cleaner will be on the opposite side usually right side when facing the grille. It's inside a plastic rectangular box. There are two captive set screws on the box toward the motor. The door of the box will swing open exposing the air filter. It's a little cramped in there and you'll gain much more room if you carefully remove the hose from the throttle body and completely remove it. The door to the sir filter cold air box will lift straight out.

All you need to know is the number of speeds and the horsepower.  Turn off the power to the unit, unhook the line wires to the burned up motor, pull the squirrel cage assembly (motor, squirrel cage, and shroud) out of the bottom of the unit and unscrew the motor/cage assembly.  Pull the assembly out of the shroud.  Unscrew the locknut that locks the cage to the motor spindle.  Pull like hell and pray...a lot.  Don't be tempted to beat on the end of the spindle to free it from the cage, you will mushroom it and then you will need a torch to get it apart.  You could use a fan blade puller, but I doubt you have one.  Once you have freed the motor, take it to your local HVAC supplier.  They will sell you a new motor.  Put the cage on the new motor and tighten the locknut.  Put the assembly back in the shroud and fasten, making sure that the plug in for the blower power lines will be facing you once you put the whole thing back in the furnace.  You may have to use the included shim kit if the cage doesn't spin freely inside the shroud.  Reinstall the whole shebang into the furnace.  Plug in the line wires.  Check for proper operation.  Change the filter.



Button up the unit.

Not much if you do it your self. Pull the motor and get the make and mod#  Then look up Grainger at www.grainger.com find the part. Then call the local Grainger in your state drive down pay cash and pick it up. Install just like you pulled it out.  NOTE :  Turn off power to heater be for starting this job. You will save a $500 plus

This is an open question without more information. If your doing it yourself... prices can range $100 just for the motor. It really depends on the size of the motor and brand. If your just looking for a price with using a contractor, it can range upwards of $500 and more. Check the model number/voltage/speed and any other specs that you can get off the existing equipment and then cross reference it on the internet air conditioning suppliers.



When you get more information on the brand / model / voltage / speed, 
look at the web page sourced will give you more ideas of pricing.

no good guessing.get  the data sheet from the suppliers of the paint.activator proportions vary from manufacturer.and thinner ratio depends on ambient temperature and drying times(oven bake or air dry).Ive got some neat stirring sticks from the makers,ici,ppg etc,that have paint/activator scales on one side and a scale on the other for thinners.all hell brakes loose if I cant find them.dont cost much and are worth it..Though i find a steel rule marked in centimeters works almost as well.BUT I never start without the data sheet.paint cost too much to screw around and take the chance of it running off and out the door.

Tom is right with his answer of 2 parts paint to 1 part hardener. This is the general rule of thumb with most makes of 2k paint.
I think the amount of thinners is a personal preference.... he quotes 5% and there is nothing wrong with that although i prefer to add somewhere in the region of 20% and give it an extra coat. I find that the extra thinners makes the paint flow that much better although you have to be that little bit more careful to avoid runs.

If the coffee was fairly hot then the cooling has caused a slight vacuum. Heating the contents would help, however the fact that it is a thermos will require a fair amount of time to heat the contents inside. Try striking the base of the thermos on your palm. Often this will break the seal that has created the vacuum. This does work well on jar lids.

Soak in VERY hot water for a long time. The combination of coffee residue on the threads and the (now) cool coffee is creating a very Strong vacuum. heating will change that vacuum into pressure and help you get the lid off.

Intermittent Overheating.....?



Hi there, my Fiesta mk5 is intermittently overheating. I'll drive along, the fan will suddenly come on strong and my temperature needle will keep going up (hotter) then come down to normal, then go up a bit, then down to normal etc.

When I open the tank which holds my engine water it is literally boiling and when I first turn it, there is a lot of pressure in there, so when I turn it, it makes a loud hissing noise and could be me, but it sounds like the rest of the engine comes alive as I hear all kinds of liquidy noises thereafter.



Possible block somewhere? Doesn't sound like a headgasket issue as my oil looks fine and surely it would just overheat, not bounce between normal and hot.

Thanks to any helpful guidance or advise.

The fan is activated by a temperature sensor - I think this is faulty, and your fan does not come on soon enough or stay on long enough.

Your fan has an over-run system that keeps it going after the engine has stopped if the temp is too high - does this happen?

It's quite simple to replace / repair.

Good Luck

Are you in traffic when the fan starts, you say the fan 'comes on strong' as the fan has only one speed, what do you mean? the fact that the temp. comes down to normal when fan starts suggests all is well with radiator and cooling system, the rad. cap should only be removed when the engine is cool because of the pressure and temp. involved, (thats why you get hissing etc.)

There is a hose leading to the top of the header (where you add water), take this off and there should be a tiny hole through it, these sometimes get clogged causing airlocks in the cooling system giving the symptoms you describe. If it is clogged run a very small drill bit through it.
 Good luck!.

Well, this is something I'd do myself, rather than call in someone.  The most professional method would be to run the cable up thru a wall....but I've seen some 'quick and dirty' methods too, where a cable was run out a window downstairs, and in a window upstairs, lol.. or just drilled thru the ceiling, and the floor above.

You don't necessarily need a licensed electrician for this.  Most cable and satellite providers will run additional lines for you (sometimes at no cost).  You should be aware that some providers charge for the number of TV's hooked up to the service.

Another option is to get a wireless system  - this allows a bit more flexibility in location, but does cost more than the parts to run a wire.

Good Luck

I'd suggest calling your cable provider. You really don't need to spend the money on an electrician to do it. I think the cable company would be much less. You might even be able to catch a guy in your area to do it for less than the cable company would charge if he did it after work and you payed him directly.

I'm assuming you have done other repairs/installs in your house, and if so, then this shouldn't be too difficult.
I throw out these ideas to get you thinking - you know your place and can best decide where to start it upward to your bedroom.
Where the cable comes into the house, you could buy a splitter and a short cable.  Remove cable coming in and replace it with the short one (probably 2' or so); and to the short one install the splitter - reconnect the one to the television on the lower floor.



If by chance you are in  the basement, you could visualize where your bedroom is in relation to the basement area.  Now you need to do the "guesstamet" about how much cable you will need, and add a couple of feet for luck.



If you have phone outlet in your bedroom, and the phone line comes to the basement your in great shape.  I'd take the cable to the bedroom and try and route it down the same openings.
I know this doesn't answer your precisely, but it will steer you into thinking of how you can do it "cheaply" - spend that money on a gift for yourself when you finish the job - nice reward.  Also, I believe you can get by without any tools, less maybe a pair of pliers.

Most keys have an immobilizer code now days.  Something the Cars computer uses to verify that it is a key and not a copy.  (so thieves cant pick the lock or use a copied key).  I would bet that the chip in your key is messed up if you can still use it to unlock the doors but not start the car and because you said the other key works find.  There is usually a way to fix this yourself if you have one working key.  It is usually a process of putting one key in and hitting the brakes and or gas a few times as sort of a diagnostic test.

What make is it? I'd presume a ford.
Most modern car keys have a transponder type immobiliser which means the key has a glass transponder in it which is a fine coil of wire and a chip which transmits a code picked up by the receiver on the ignition barrel, if the chip or coil is damaged or lost which happens sometimes when messing about or when changing batteries in remote keys then that key will not work, it will still turn the lock but not start the engine.
You will need a new transponder or complete key and depending on the year and model may need to be fully reprogrammed by someone with correct equipment or dealer.
If it is ford and you can get to bristol or bath message me and i'll give you a number of someone in the trade i use.

Sqeaking from car whilst driving ...?



Whilst driving there is a sqeaking sound that is driving me mad! I am not 100% sure where it is coming from (front or back) but it is definately from the passenger side (its a left hand drive car) I have made the below observations:

1. Seems to get more noticeable after a short time driving, when on bumpy surfaces and sometimes when taking corners.
2. Bouncing the back end of the car up and down when the car is stationary seems to make a similar creaky sound. This may be coincidence however.



Any ideas?

You most probably have some grit or gunge in the idle valve. This valve regulates the engine tickover, and as you press the  throttle pedal it opens to let more fuel into the engine. It just needs cleaning out. I have had this problem before with vauxhalls, but i am not sure where the one on your engine is situated. Mine was near the bulkhead on top of the engine, there is a rubber pipe running to it.

Battery Warning Light.?



This warning light stayed on after I started the vehicle and drove off. It only went out when I reached about 30mph. It flashed on and off a few times while driving and it was accompanied by a noticeable clicking from somewhere behind the dash. When I stopped the vehicle and let the engine idle, the light did not come on. Think its the alternator as its done 130,000 miles but need confirmation. Also, why doesn't the light come on again after driving and letting it idle?

Your alternator is dying (double check your drive belt), you can take it off and  get it tested for free at most parts stores...you've gotta' go there anyway because you are probably going to need to buy a new one .

I would check the wiring on the alternator first as the connectors can corrode after being splashed with water for 130,000 miles and your earthing straps also. You can check if it is charging however by checking the voltage at the battery terminals using a voltmeter. Approx 12v DC without it started or 14v DC if it is charging the battery when idling.

Can any 1 tell me if on a 2.25 landrover diesel engine o.h.v NOT O.H.C ?



if the engine is turned with the head removed would this upset the timing. I have just replaced the head gasket and now the engine wont rev properly and it blows grey smoke but on tick over the smoke is sort of blue and it has no power but starts better than it has ever done any advise appreciated thanks ( 2.25 series11a land rover 1969)

Start by checking the valve clearances.If there ok? then then diesel pump timing is out? The injection pump will need to be slackened and the pump timing altered.Mark the existing setting with typist fluid so you can get back to your original settings,then move the pump slightly and start it to see if it gets better or worse?Not the exact way to do it but it does work.Hope this helps.PS its OHV

HI
If you didn't remove the distributor the it should be Ok...If you had to remove the distributor then yes it well move the timing. Move the motor my hand to where the timing is on O* or TDC. then pull the distributor cap and see if it is pointing at the #1 plug wire or it may be pointing 180* off which is ok to as TDC comes up twice on a motor once for 1# firing and once for #1's exhaust stroke. If you rotate the motor again is should be pointing at the #1 wire in the cap.
Also you may have a plug wire out of rotation.. find the firring order and rotation of the distributor and see if you are ok there.
Good luck

I have a 1963 2.25 diesel. I assume the head has been torqued down to 90lb/ft for the 1/2" bolts (18lb/ft for the 5/16" ones) and that the head is not warped because grey/white smoke can be water.
I blew my gasket earlier this year and the pig would not start at all after I had replaced it. I checked the valve clearances because if these are out this can give erratic running and blue smoke. Eventually I hit on the cause which was the little copper and steel washers on the injectors. These were totally flat and useless. I had the injectors reset with new nozzles and when these were fitted it fired up instantly. I did a little tweak on the injector pump, wrong way first time and that produced clouds of multicoloured smoke.Tweaked it back the other way and it is now running totally clean. Adjusting the pump is a ball ache as you have to slacken all the pipes off at both ends and re-bleed after.

It wont upset the timing as its an OHV motor running push rods . As to the gray smoke is it gray or is it steam ?? . 
your fuel pump timing could be out . but if all you have done is remove the head and not touched anything else then its not that ( unless it was doing that in the first place .



Re check your tappet clearances



Adjust the tappet clearances for petrol and diesel
engines, inlet and exhaust to 0,25 mm (0.010 in)

Set No. 1 tappet with No. 8 valve fully open.
Set No. 3 tappet with No. 6 valve fully open.
Set No. 5 tappet with No. 4 valve fully open.
Set No. 2 tappet with No. 7 valve fully open.
Set No. 8 tappet with No. 1 valve fully open.
Set No. 6 tappet with No. 3 valve fully open.
Set No. 4 tappet with No. 5 valve fully open.
Set No. 7 tappet with No. 2 valve fully open.

try that first

It may not be the discs - brake squeal is usually caused by dirty or sticking calipers, lack of copper grease, incorrectly fitted or missing springs & shims.
If you change discs, pads should really be replaced at the same time.

Sand the pads with 80 grit sand paper and make sure all your contact points are luber. You can also bevel the edges of the pads,this helps with a lot of the noise, also get some brake pad glue and glue the backs of the pads before install.

You should measure the thickness of the disk , if it's worn too much then replace them , and fit new pads,  did you clean the disk edge when you fitted your new pads? cos you get a build up of rust that can  cause squealing



PS Country boy what planet you from? you never smear copperslip on the back of brake pads ??  we'd get the sack if we fitted pads dry ! I've probably relined more brakes than you have had hot dinners , mainly on trucks and copperslip is always used

Dont put copper grease anywhere near your brakes. It gets mixed up with brake dust and turns into nasty hard shat that causes more trouble than it fixes. Dont fit cheap pads because they can be noisy. If you got the money fit genuine parts. Change your discs if they are getting too thin or heavily scored. Check the back plates are not touching the disc as this will give a scraping sound.

The real answer is none of the above! Disc brake pad noise is caused by harmonics and vibration when the pad rubs against the rotor when the caliper pistons are stopping the car. Inexpensive brake pads don't always include the anti-vibration shims behind the pads. Even with the shims noise sometimes exists. In either case remove the brake pads and spray them down in both sides with CRC Brake Clean. Make sure the steel side of the pad is absolutely clean. Apply a .090 coating of bright orange CRC Brake Quiet to the steel non-friction side of each brake pad. This product is a very high temperature silicone silastic sealer which always remains flexable. It's purpose is to "soak up" disc brake pad harmonics and vibration to the point where noise will be non-existant. Let the Brake Quiet dry for 20 -30 minutes and re-assemble the pads inside the calipers. The next time you purchase disc brake pads always specify ceramic pads. They will not grind and remove stock from the rotors as does Semi-metallic or full metalic pads.

Be sure all the caliper floater pins are adequately coated with synthetic brake grease prior to reasembly. This whole process is necessary to completely eliminate brake noise! I gauaranty you'll have sucess if you at leats give it a try without cutting corners.



All the above products are avalable at NAPA, Carquest, Advance Auto and Auto Zone.

Alignment, suspension and brake shop. 45 yrs. experiance. Oh gosh! Never in a million years put any kind of freaking grease on the back side of brake pads. It'll get hot and drizzle all over the prake pad. All lubricants positively will break down the bonding agents that form the brake pads. Not to mention grease on the brake rotor! Where do you think you'll stop!!

The best thing to do would be to get a Chilton's or the service manual and start tracing the wiring diagram. It can be a long slow process but that's the best way to handle your problem. If you start wiring things directly you most likely will create more problems for yourself. You cant just wire in a switch for headlights, the draw is to great. You have to wire in through a relay to handle the load. Theres no quick answer when it come to electrical issues unfortunately. I would however first check the switch itself. That's the usual first part of the circuit to fail as its a mechanical device (manual switch on and off) that gets used and abused. Especially in a 20 year old vehicle.

It sounds like faulty wiring in a low amperage circuit.  Plug something else into the plug and see if you get the same result.  If you do then I would take a look at the circuit.  If there is no drain, it is likely that there is a short in the fan.  Regardless, properly wired circuits should not do this.

yes it sounds like a wiring problem.  not an overload you need an electrician to sort it out because it could be several different issues



now when plugging something else in to check make sure it is a low draw item like the fan if it was a toaster due to the high resistance of a toaster relative to a fan it might be the toaster that doesn't work while the lights work fine

Sounds like a short in the fan motor causing a very high amperage draw. I am surprised that you haven't tripped a breaker or blow a fuse.

Ditch that fan ASAP before it starts a fire.  Go to Walmart or Target and get a new one.  It will use less energy and make you happier in the end.

I have 1999 landcruiser amazon 3.0 diesel auto.When you start the engine from cold, the idle is very low and there is no power you cant pull away,it takes a minute or two for the idle to go up .Also sometimes it revs up and down like crazy with smoke coming out from the exhaust and a burnt diesel smell and you have to turn it off and re-start and the problem goes away??.The idle going up and down like crazy always seems to happen whilst driving or after the engine is warm??

The book average consumption for the car is 35mpg. You could easily knock 10mpg off that with bad driving habits.
First thing I'd do is give it back to your dad for a couple of hundred miles, and just recheck his consumption.

Just looking at your additional info - it's a very low torque 16v engine, it'll struggle like hell below 2,500 revs. If you've had an older car or a diesel before, it may well be that you're not uused to keeping the revs up.
My dad has a 2.0 16v VTEC Accord, and I have a hell of a job getting used to keeping it above 2,500 revs - My Nissan 2.7TD never gets above 2,500, as that's when the turbo's at max boost.

Firstly, you need to check for fault codes.. this will save time poking and hoping..

You can read the codes by jumping across TEN and GND in the diagnosis box, and connecting a 12V LED across B+ and FEN.
Turn on the ignition, and watch the LED for any flashes... long flashes are tens, and short flashes are units.

You can also have a garage read the codes using a code reader..

I would expect that if anything, you have a problem with the O2 sensor, as this is the most likely cause of the problem..

It would help if you gave your beast's fuel consumption in the form of Miles per Gallon or Kilometers per Liter which would give an experienced person some basis to assess your relative economy.  Also model year and total Miles / KM's  also are important. I will assume this is an older vehicle with plenty of total miles.



First, check the basic tune up items, Plugs, Temperature sensors, Oxygen sensors, thermostat. any of which can wreak havoc with fuel economy. 
Next check the brakes on all wheels - a dragging brake is like trying to tow a tank behind you!  also have the alignment (4 wheel) checked, a wheel toe issue not only will consume massive amounts of fuel but will also eat up your tires in no time. 
If none of the above locate the problem check the exhaust for restrictions (damaged pipe, plugged Catalytic converter )  and finally if necessary,have an engine power balance test performed to identify a weak (low compression) cylinder.

Take out one of the spark plugs and look at the tip.  If it is black then the car is overfueling and wasting your petrol.  A car of this age should be running perfect mixture and the tip of the spark plug should be a light beige colour.



The first answer is a poor one as it's just a bin-bag full of general automotive terms and not really what I would call proper 'advice'  It's about £1000 worth of checks and tests. Better to try some of the more practical stuff first.



Looking at the colour of the spark plug will tell you if the engine is burning more fuel than it should.  If the engine is using the proper amount of fuel and the plug is a light beige colour then don't worry about checking the engine or the sensors. It is more likely to be one of the other causes like poor aerodynamics (window open on the motorway, roof-rack, big rear spoiler) or low tyre pressures, that sort of thing...

Being a punto have you put a big daft stainless back box on it?
if so then it is probably larger and heavier than the original pipe and causing problems
if not then get under the car and look along the pipe until you find the rubber and mount if it there is no rubber then yes you need a new one if its cracked or broken then yes you need a new one.

Building my 350 SBC for performance?



I currently own a 1978 El Camino with a 1973 350 2 barrel, and I want to get the most 'band for the buck' out of it performance wise for not too much money.  The motor is basically stock except for free flowing dual exhaust and glass packs.



I'm not going to invest in headers because it already has a nice exhaust system.  This is what I am thinking of getting so far, so let me know if there's something else I should get.  I'm only looking to spend about $500 on parts.

You can test on a back street, where there is no traffic, and go about 30mph, and then push in the clutch, and then rev the engine about 3g's, and then release the clutch fast.  Make sure the gear is in 4th, Notice how the rpm's drop on the tach.  If they barely drop, and you feel no sudden urge of acceleration, then you know the clutch is slipping.

get out on the street and when your doing about 15-20 mph shift to 4th and floor it. If the car revs up but doesn't seem to try and pull then the clutch is bad. If the car lugs and trys to pull the clutch is engaging and good.

First off, if its a gas heater, sound of water sizzling could just be condensation in center flue pipe dripping down when heating up.
2nd, if you don't see water under it, or coming out of relief valve, then its okay.
3rd, an electric HWH would blow the heating element if there is no water around it.
4th, I need more detailed info to help you better!

Vauxhall Corsa Orange light on?



My corsa has the orange light on, the error code said the idle control valve was at fault, fitted a new valve and the light now comes on when the car is first started when it heats up it goes out and the car runs fine when it cools down the light comes back on when you check the error code it always the same idle control valve, so fitted another new valve and there is no difference, any body have any ideas.

My car died while i was driving, and does not start/turn over now, if it starts it just dies immediately, help?



it is a 88 supra, stick, and was running fine. Story, i was driving along when i was coming up to some traffic, so i put the car in neutral and came to a stop. when i came to the stop i noticed the car died and did not turn over after that. Now the problem is all the electricals work, but when i trun the key it doesnt turn over or anything. sometime it will suddenly start and dies without idling.

A similar situation happened to me the other morning.

I had to pull over on the interstate for a flat tire..but when i went to start back up to get back on the road..it could crank fine but after a second, the engine would shut down but the clock, lights, and radio still worked.

Turns out the problem with mine is that the rattling from the flat knocked loose/damaged a wire that was associated with the engine in some way.

But what was a $6 part ended up costing me $220 to get repaired due to the labor and equipment used to trace the wire.

I have a 2002 Hyundai Santa Fe, it leaks oil from the rear bottom..What should I do?



I just took it to repair shop, they said I have to remove and replace the differential pinion seal, the part only cost $30, but the labor cost $300, is that a reasonable price, they said it at least take them 2 and half hours to finish the job. Should I do it or should I take it to another to compare the price?

Will it hurt my car if I ignore the problem? coz it drives ok.

Please help..That's the only car that I have, I afarid it will broke down..

ignoring it will lead to future, more costly problems.  That is not a bad price.  What they are doing is removing all the gears, axles and then eventually the pinion.  You can get by, by just making sure your differential is full of gear lube/oil.  It is the same concept if you engine leaks oil, you just check it and add when needed.  The set back is the differential lube is a pain to keep checking.  As for other shops, now that you know what the problem is call around and find the best price.  Good luck.

I still don't understand..so are you saying I don't have to repace the pinion or I have to?

What he is saying is that if you choose not to replace it right a way, you need to check your gear oil level and make sure it is full (rear dif.) If you let it get low, it will be a whole lot more expensive. If you do keep it full, it will be alright until you get it fixed, however you can't forget.

You can phone around for quotes and compare prices.

If you just drive with it leaking, eventually it will run dry and seize up - and that is BIG money!
If you don't have the money right away you might keep topping the differential up, not sure if it has a filler plug you can access or not, check your manual, but the leak will get worse and it may blow out on the highway which is money for you and danger for others with the slick you leave behind.

If i have a 2004 dodge neon(auto trans) can i put a turbo in it and if so how much rebuilding would  ?

<answer>



Turbocharging in itself does not break engines.



The most important thing to check when doing a turbo conversion is that the air/fuel ratio is ok.



In order for the engine to run without melting and smashing to peices you need to make sure your air and fuel are being put into the engine in the right quantities.



Too much air is the biggest problem.  Fitting a turbo will put more air into the engine - that's how it works.  If the engine is 'forced' to accept more air in its mixture than it should have then this will cause the engine to heat up very quickly. Whether it then blows up or not is down to the quality of the materials used in the engines construction and the design of the internals. Some engines are more resiliant than others.



So... to avoid blowing up your engine you need to make sure you are adding extra fuel to go with the extra air you will be adding by bolting on the turbo.



Any engine can be turbocharged. It's how you control it from that point onwards that makes the difference.



The way to tell if you have enough fuel is to look at the tips of your spark plugs after the first hard run and see if they are white or black.  If they are black then this is ok for a turbocharged car.  If they are white then you should not drive the car again until the fueling has been sorted out - there is a chance you will blow it up. It is ok to limp it to a workshop at low rpm but stay well away from boost if you know there are fueling issues.



Too much fuel is bad as well. But you have to overfuel quite dramatically to do any serious damage to the engine.  If there is too much fuel in the cylinders then it will wash all of the oil deposits out of the piston rings and you will loose compression on the engine and it will slowly degrade the engines performance to the point where it does not run properly. But this is no way near as dangerous as underfueling. Lack of fuel can cause 'instant' engine failure. Overfueling will damage the engine over the course of many miles so should still be avoided.  You should check the mixture properly with a lambda probe once all your work is complete.  You can get this done at a rolling road / performance tuning centre.



Getting the mixture right is the most important thing.  There are many, many other elements involved in a proper turbo conversion... but the only one that is guranteed to end in hearbreak is failure to properly check the mixture...

The engine will require a lot of expensive work to make it strong enough to cope with the extra power and it will eat the transmission pretty quickly.
How about getting a tubo engine and trans from a wrecking yard?, I believe the PT Cruiser engine will fit but you may need to uprate the cooling system and brakes as well.
Who said hot rodding is dead? - good luck!.

The battery should come to no harm, but if you are unlucky some of the delicate electronic devices could be damaged. It really depends on how much current went through the car, something like a welder could do some damage, don't forget the ignition sends up to 40000 volts through the engine block every time a spark plug fires.

<answer>



The jack is inside the spare wheel.  You need the jack handle and wheel brace tool to lower the wheel and jack.  Put the curved bit across the slot in the plastic nut.



If the jack handle is not in an obvious place, try the box that you get to by lifting the squab on the front seat.

If you can't find a jack handle, you can get the wheel and jack out by turning the plastic nut with a large screwdriver, but that won't help you raise the jack.

The metal bit, we will call the wheel rim, and the black rubber bit, we will call the tyre.
It really depends on what kind of tyre you got and if the wheel rim was an alloy wheel or just a standard one.
£160 would be in the price range to be fair.

The wheel is the metal bit, the tyre is the rubber bit and if you don't know that, you should not be driving.
As to the wheel price, that depends on whether you have Allys or steel, but you don't know that either, do you? It then depends on what tyre you fit, they come from cheapo to very good. And you wonder why you get ripped off?

The bendix or as some call it the starter drive gear is shot.. it well spin when it is not in contact with the ring gear but it is actually stripped and well not spin the motor when under pusher. You can replace the Bendix or the whole starter which is the best deal..
good luck
tim.

The clutch has gone in the pinion, you might as well just replace the whole starter motor

Waite a minute! The starter solenoid is the electromagnetic devise on top of the starter that shifts (lever) the starter drive (Bendix) gears into the automatic transmission ring gear or flywheel ring gear.



If you can remember if the solenoid actually shifted the starter drive all the way to the end of the starter housing before it started to spin the solenoid IS working properly. If the starter drive just spins without shifting to the end of the housing the solenoid isn't working properly.

great question - my guess - the light would still shine out of the headlamps, as the speed of the light is added to the speed of the car.

There would be no light visible to the front of the car as you would be going at the speed it was issuing from the lamps.

You wouldn't even be able to see the car if it was travelling at the speed of light, so the question of whether you could see the headlights shining is irrelevant.

The best thing to use is a proprietary grout cleaner (see link below) with a scrubbing brush. Problem with grout is that it is porous and so the staining maybe a lot deeper than the surface, in which case you may be better off re-colouring the grout.

One low cost way to do it is to get a can of comet with bleach powder, or a can of ajax with bleach powder  or similar, use water as warm as you can easily work with and give the tiles and grout a good scrubbing with a goog brush or strong scrub pad using comet and water, rinse then make a paste with the same powder and fill in the grout lines with the wet comet (must have BLEACH) paste. Let it sit for at least a few minutes then scrub againpaying attention to the grout lines. Repeat until white. Sometimes you just can't get grout completely white without putting a thin layer of new gout down. Good Luck. Jo-Ann and Jerry.

I have another option for you.  Use an electric die grinder with a solid carbide grout removal bit, 1/8" shank.  Use it freehand, you don't need guides.  Grind out the old grout, clean up with an acid wash, flood with water, let it dry, and re-grout.  Might be more than you want to do, but it will certainly take care of any staining that you have.

Just trying to give you more ideas.

They make a pen just draw over the line and it's white, probably the easiest and fastest fix.  There's also a grout saw which removes just the top layer of grout that contains the dirt and stains.  You should be able to find both at Lowe's or Home Depot.  I've tried spraying and scrubbing with professional grout cleaner and it's totally useless on most of the grout in the hotel where I work.

I have a better idea for you. Buy a book called 'The Repair of Vehicle Bodies' by Alan Robinson.  This is the text book recommended for people doing the NVQ course in body repair and it is very good and easy to follow.

I think the Haynes car manual publishers do a Body repair Manual. But the book above will tell you everything you will ever need to know.

Maybe you're letting the clutch out too quickly and/or without enough gas.  Try giving a bit more on the gas pedal and letting out the clutch more slowly.  It's less noticeable when switching from 2nd to 3rd, 3rd to 4th, and even less 4th to 5th in most vehicles so that's probably why you're noticing it more when switching to 2nd.

What you are feeling (I think) is the loss on acceleration. When you shift to second, there is a short period of time when you are no longer under +g's but are either in -g's or 0g's. When you complete the shift you go back to a +g situation.
Learn to get the shifts quicker, or maybe at a different shift point.

Ive looked at your other posted question on this topic... It sounds to me like you have a wiring problem.  I would suggest that you turn the breaker off, unplug anything from those outlets, and call an electrician.

If you have a wire shorting out inside the wall, from a loose connection, a broken wire, whatever.. it could 'arc', and cause a fire inside the wall.  Don't run the risk... call in an electrician.

By the way.... if the wiring is 14 gauge, you should not be using a 20 amp breaker on the circuit.  IF you have a fire at this point... and they find that you have a 20 amp breaker in a 15 amp rated circuit.... your insurance company will refuse to pay off on the claim -- assuming you're still alive to make any claim.  Be Safe.

Good Luck

do not insert a larger fuse than what was there before. parts of the house have specific wiring systems, if you use a 20 amp in place of a 15, you could overload the wiring and cause a fire. get a 15 amp as soon as the store has 15 amp one back in stock. or go to a different store.



you could have burned out lamps
there can be a short somewhere
you tripped a GFCI outlet someplace
you fixed the wrong fuse
your fuse is bad (continuity test it)
you may of burned out a wire somewhere.



anyway, if you can not figure it out yourself, or feel you're not qualified, please contact a licensed electrician to fix the problem. electrical shock is deadly and you could burn your house down. disconnect power to the circuit in question before you leave it alone until the electrician comes. otherwise, if there is a short or open somewhere it could cause a fire.

ricks_n, This is a nasty heavy job as very few cars or trucks today have automatic transmission sump pan drain plugs. The nasty way it has to be done is by partially loosening all the pan cap screws concentrating on the back half which need to be removed completely. You'll need the largest oil drain pan you can find as you'll be dropping nearly twice the amount of fluid as a normal oil change. The rear half of the pan will allow most of the fluid to drain out. This is the heavy part of the job. The sump pan still is holding 2-3 quarts of oil. It's necessary to remove the remaining cap screws and carefully let the pan down and drain it into your big oil drain pan. There is one easily removable oil screen filter inside the bottom of the transmission that should definitely be changed. Buy the new filter first before starting the job so you'll be familiar with it.

I'm proud of you as this is the safest method transmission-wise to change the fluid. Your handbook in the glove compartment will tell you the fluid capacity of the transmission.

Thank you so much for giving me the encouragement and confidence of taking on this new task for myself. All I need to do is get a bigger oil pan to catch all that fluid and I will get that filter too.

Are you sure you need to change it, or just top it up.
I have had automatics and all I ever did was top them up. Check this out with your local garage/shop.

Remove plugs in bottom of gear box and differential/s after first placing receptacles underneath them to catch fluid,then remove filler plugs.When drained,refit plugs at bottom of gearbox and diff/s and fill with the correct fluids as per handbook.Normally on all wheel drives at 25,000 miles on transmission and every year or 20,000 miles on the engine.You can just take a sample of the engine oil extracted by syphon from the dipstick hole and have it analyzed to see if it needs changing,but this is only normally done on trucks with 7.5 gallons of oil in the motor.Only change the oils if you have just bought the motor as used and don,t trust the history.In any other respect,only as per handbook intervals.You only need to change the engine oil filters,just clean the transmission filter and refit.If you are unsure ,have a garage do it correctly.

Yes  there is a filter in the transmission pan.  To change the fluid, you have to unbolt the pan from the car and drop it down carefully so as not to spill the fluid or damage the pan.  The filter just slides oof and on the sump.  Also wipe the pan clean and also clean the magnet that catches metal shavings.  Change the gasket making sure there is no residue from the old one on either the pan or the underside of the car.  Reinstall the pan and refill with transmission fluid.

To do it right I would take it to a shop that can remove all the fluid. Draining it you're self is only going to remove whats in the transmission pan. The rest is in the torque converter which you cannot remove without the machine that shops have. Changing the filter is always a good investment.

DIY is like changing the cars oil but not changing the filter at the same time. Your adding good fluid to the old used fluid that's still in the filter. Some times that can be an entire Qt.

yes! change the filter. raise the car and support it so it won,t fall, get a large pan, take out the bolts and let it drain into the pan, change the filter, clean out the pan, put new gasket on, install the pan, just snug the bolts, don,t overtighten them or you will warp the pan, let the car down, put in enough fluid to bring it up to the add mark, start the car and let it idle, go through all the gears and back into park, check the fluid and fill itup and leave it down about 1/2 quart, take the car for a drive to get it hot, bring it back and park on a level surface, check for leaks and fill it to the full mark.

Yes the head gaskets can blow but having said that ive not had 1 blow on any of the rovers ive owned! (4) i will say it is more likely for the cambelt to snap.
Ask the seller when the cambelt and waterpump were done! If they don't know then the best thing to do is try and knock £200 off to cover the cost of the cambelt and get it done!

Ouch! Mileage is too high, expect problems with electrics and oil/water, as previous poster said. Rover went bust for a reason - the vehicles they produced were simply shoddy rubbish, even the Chinese bought the blueprints/machinery but left the factory and workers alone.
I would get rid, and perhaps buy a jap car of similar year and mileage.

This engine is nortorious for blowing head gaskets. There is a fix though, there is now a heavy duty head gasket available which gives normal service life.  As there is a fair chance you will have trouble within the next 15k it would be good insurance to book the car in to have this done at a time convenient to you.  To be blunt, unless you are a low mileage motorist later models Rovers are not much of an investment. By your year the workforce knew the writing was on the wall and had lost heart and the build quality, never brilliant at the best of times, started dropping further. Even ex Rover workers admit the 45 was a flawed car.

BUT - everything is relative. They look nice enough in a restrained way and are pleasant enough to drive really. As the collapse of Rover killed their re-sale values they can actually make quite a good buy for the man on a tight budget. My work partner has run 3 in a row with no troubles at all.  Pot luck - get a bad one and it will drive you up the wall.  Despite the reputation there are many thousands of perfectly satisfied owners out there who wonder what all the fuss is about.

Yep the Head Gaskets go on a regular basis. The Electrics play up BUT they are not a bad cheap car all that said. All I can say is check your water and oil very regularly for cross contamination

You could also have a sticky thermostat or pump that isn't allowing the water to go through the radiator and cool again.

The water in an engine pumps around to a certain temperature and when it gets too hot the thermostat opens to push it back round to the radiator to cool before starting the cycle again.

Check your oil, if it milky Colour then you have water in the engine so this could be a blown gasket. But if you are simply overheating then I would say thermostat or water pump

Price wise, a thermostat you could probably do yourself for a tenner if the hose is easily accessible, but if it's a water pump then you're probably looking at £200 fitted

EDIT : Check your oil dipstick as well, as it could just be a bit of condensation in the head. But if the dipstick oil is the same milky colour then it sounds like a gasket. Are you losing water and having to top up regularly?

Does it smoke white? White smoke with a sweet smell would indicate a head gasket. It might be a stuck thermostat. And you definitely need to flush your cooling system.

There is a quick basic test to prove where the problem actually is. It's a cooling system pressure test. Any mechanic who has this tester or any new car dealership can do this for you. It's very inexpensive. Then they can determine a plan of attack.

thermostat,temp sender,fan switch..... change them and see if the problem cures itself.if the system overheats to much it will blow the head even if it is ok now,alot of sludgy cream on oil cap and inside expansion tank suggests blown gasket,a little on oil cap may be condensation

a "clunk" is usually the result of componants catching up with each other,so if u have eliminated all the externals then it must be internal.my guess would be the dual mass flywheel(if fitted).a notorius weak spot and very expensive in repairs.dont expect much change from 1000.sorry.

Hi Community. I'm also In the process of replacing an old boiler  and the gas pipe appears to be a problem. ?



The meter is 50 m away from the existing boiler and the gas pipe is 22mm. I'm told that a Modulating  Boiler of 30 kw will require a larger dia pipe fitted, is this true. I have calc'd a 4 mb drop over that length at 3.7 m3/hr flow rate i.e. 22mb to 18 mb .will this work with this size of boiler. The existing 100,000 btu boiler is running at 14 mb  but I think it is turned down at the gas valve, to balance the cooker.
