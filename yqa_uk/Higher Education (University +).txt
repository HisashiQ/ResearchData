What is a 2.1 in British education?



I recently started a course in Accounting and Finance Management at a British university and I was browsing through a booklet that explained jobs in the finance sector and they constantly keep referring to something called "2.1". What is it and what on earth does it stand for?

A 1st is over 70%
A 2:1 is 60 - 70%
A 2:2 is 50 - 60%
A 3rd is 40 - 50%
A fail is less than 40%



Most people get a 2:1, and that is the minimum grade usually required by graduate training schemes etc

Now days, most colleges use some type of formula. If you meet their minimum score based on the formula, you have a good shot. They usually multiply the GPA by some number and add the SAT score times another number. If you meet the minimum number those two have to equal up to, they will consider you. Usually, unless you are aiming for ivy league, that minimum number is not very high. Then, they look at extra-curriculars, essays, volunteer work, etc... I think volunteer work has become a big booster and honestly almost mandatory for most colleges lately. Try to pull your GPA up if you still have time. If not, write a killer essay. The SAT will help, also, because it shows potential. You may want to address the slip in GPA in your essay. Or attach a separate letter explaining (and have a good reason) why you had some grades slip. Then explain how you brought them up or are more determined as shown by....fill in the blank. I don't want to say just come up with some bull****, but that is a large part of it. Put the best sping on the circumstances.

They don't just care about GPA, they also look at standard test scores and they do take your essay into account; so a student with okay grades and an amazing personality does have the possibility of getting in over someone with amazing grades, but a drab essay.

Colleges don't look a one thing or one score anymore. They want the whole picture of the student. Your GPA, SAT, what classes you took in high school and at what level. Did you take any AP classes. Hold any leadership positions in school or sports or clubs.

You do not have to be qualified to be a film director. of course you do need to know directing techniques etc. But in the film industry it is who you know not so much as what you know. For example I'm a Geography student at university and have never studied media yet I have worked in the film industry simply by knowing the right people :)

Hi friend
M.B.A, M.Sc and Phd are very god options.
Selection of course depends upon your taste and your financial capacity.
MBA is more costlier than M.Sc and Phd
In present situation do MBA with finance from a good college. In final year MBA select a good topic for your project.
You can attend campus interviews

It depends on you really. I started uni nearly 3 weeks ago and I still haven't really settled in. But that's just me, I don't cope with change very well.
You will make friends eventually. Most people at your uni will be in the same situation as you.

Took me around 2 weeks to build friendships.



Just speak to everyone, if someone is alone; why not go up to them and start a casual conversation?



The "Wow, I love your bag, where did you get it?" always works with girls, if you're a guy (forgot to look at your avatar, sorry) then start a conversation about football, or another sport.



Also, with the bag question, it can lead to a huge conversation about shopping AND you make a friend too.

when you find a new friend in your course, you feel settled, maybe... i had to keep changing when i started, though...
plus, if you live in student accommodation, is easier but as i was commute from far, think took time.
when i got the first assignment did corporate with others and got good friends. by christmas holiday, you'll feel settle, i think.
honestly though, if you have to work hard, (of course you have to) time just flies and might never feel so?

After reading everyone else's answers, it occurred to me that it took me about the first term to have really found my feet.  By then I was settled in the course, had made friends (although I cheated as a friend from home had gone to the same uni a year before), joined societies and could finally understand the local accent - I went to uni in the north east of England!



The best bit is a year later when you know exactly how to hit Freshers' Fair to get the best free stuff, when you can help out the first years with translating in shops and finding their own feet, and then you know you're truly settled there!



Give it at least two weeks before you make a trip home if you can as it'll give you time to make the break between home and uni.  Most of all, enjoy yourself and remember that you're not alone.

I think it depends what you expect. Also depends on your course - i.e. how many people are there. Generally if you live in halls you make friends quickly, unless you don't have the same interests and some people are just very different from what you will be used to, some are party animals, some religious, some not, some smokers and so on.



You will find people you get on better with eventually, and they may not be the same people you hang around with by the end of the year when you know everyone. So chill and enjoy things for now, freshers week etc
Join societies, clubs, voluntary stuff etc - Just make sure it's stuff you like, normally you meet people there - especially during 1st - 2nd week because they are most likely there to network too.

Depends. PhD is a "terminal" degree and generally higher than a masters. It matters what career you pursue. PhDs specialize and may limit you to the field of study in the doctorate. Masters degrees may be a bit more flexible.

You must earn a Master's degree to earn a Ph.D. Therefore, a Ph.D is the highest level of education you can reach. With a Ph.D, you can teach in schools, universities, and hold higher-ranking positions (you are usually given more priority because of your age and educational superiority). Ph.D holders usually have more experience and have completed more research associated with earning this degree.

I'm not sure, i know that physical therapists need to know all the same as nurses, physiology and anatomy etc. the only difference is the clinical experience.

It's like comparing apples and oranges. Each requires a different skill set. Nursing requires more declaritive and procedural memory...side effects and interactions of medication, how to administer certain procedures/medications, etc. Nurses have to be able to multi-task and handle several situations at once.



Physical therapy requires a lot more analysis, cirtical thinking, problem solving and investigation.



So, it really depends on one's skills as to which one is "harder."



As far as compeititveness, physical therapy is traditionally a more competitive and stringent application process and courseload.

Is it better to work in a Hospital or volunteer in a Hospital to get into Medical School?



I volunteer in a local hospital but i tried to get a job in a hospital. But unfortunately no hospital is hiring me. They say that there is no positions open at the hospital. So now i work in a day care school as an assistant teacher. I am a sophomore in college doing pre-med. Do you think that only volunteer work and no job in a hospital will help me in my medical application? Would working in the day care school do me any benefit towards my medical application?

It is better to get excellent grades in your science prereqs. and general courses. Winning an academic award or two, or being in an academic honorary (like Phi Beta Kappa) would also be nice. You must also get great MCAT scores and write a killer essay (if required). All of your references should be original and say that you basically walk on water and will be the best MD since Jonas Salk. Hard to believe, but being a varsity athlete also helps. Outside work counts only to an extremely minor degree. And I cannot overemphasis getting the best liberal arts education you can get.



Edit: Someone mentioned going to nurse training first. BAD idea...it will be a BIG negative in your application. "Well, s/he trained as a nurse...now s/he wants to leave that to become an MD? When will he decide s/he wants to be a lawyer?" I know that sounds flip, but I know how admissions committees work.



And, about the major...it doesn't need to be a science major. For example, my dentist's major was Agricultural Economics.

It depends on what you were doing. Most patient care jobs require some training. If you managed to get trained as an aide, either through on the job training in the hospital or through a CNA course, or if you got a job doing some other sort of patient care, it would look better than volunteering to just sit around with people or deal with assembling stuff. If you are actually doing something as a volunteer and you would only get getting a job in the kitchen, then its better to keep volunteering.  Reception work may not have patient car but may have you doing more than volunteering. Do whatever exposes you to more patient care, or at least to more of the hospital workings.



ADD: Yggdrasil brings up an excellent point. Only take a job if you can still get As in your science courses. If it distracts from your science courses, stick to volunteering. You should have something since most people will have at least volunteered, but science courses are the #1 priority and if you are struggling you need to have a flexible schedule.

You should see if you can become a research assistant for any professors for your school. It is a pretty common thing for undergraduates to do. See if they have a free EMT program (like they train you and you work certain amount of events for them). I would also listen to the other advice as well.

It depends on your overall course selections.  If you have a number of courses that require a lot of outside reading, lots of papers or include labs, you will have to be very careful to manage your time so you can devote enough to each course.  If one or more of your courses are in subjects that you might struggle to understand, you definitely need to make sure you have enough time - and energy - to study more than usual.



If you are at the point where you have some flexibility in course selections, add one that really appeals to you, or would be fun to take or you've had the teacher in a previous class so you already know what his/her expectations are...then go for it.



18 credits is not too difficult to handle if you make good decisions about course selections. I did it for a number of consecutive semesters and still maintained a high GPA.



Good luck in your studies!

Join a club, do things you haven't done before, go out and meet new people, essentially take yourself out of your comfort zone... everything was new to you back then, and it was so exciting because it wasn't something you had already taken for granted.



I completely relate to that feeling of things having slowed down after a while, and the best way to go back is to really just go at it like you did back then.

You might want to be more specific as to "good deal".



I majored in accounting and found that it gave me a good background on business, investing and taxes.  There is a lot to learn and at times it can be very difficult.  The math part is pretty simple, it really doesn't get much more complex then addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, unless your talking about time value of money.



Make sure if you choose this as a major that you explore jobs in accountant.  I say this because some people may hate working in accounting.



Bottom line, it is a good class to take and if you major in it you will have a background that is in high demand and can probably land a job right out of school.

No it is not bad.  You are .20 points away from a B-.  Try to get a few A's and it will boost up your GPA,  If you get a D in any class retake it because if you dont retake, it will pull down your GPA.  You want at least a 3.0 when you graduate.  Good luck.

that isnt a great GPA, it is average.  You should have a 3.0+ in all honesty. If you have any Ds or Fs on your record, you should look into grade forgiveness, some schools let you retake the classes and your new grades basically replace the old ones.  Only really low grades like Ds and Fs should be bringing your GPA down to there.

Advances in these two areas have been exploited in a variety of ways both for production of industrially important biochemicals (including enzymes) and for basic studies in molecular biology.



Therefore, a new commercial environment has been created, in which many famous scientists including some Nobel Laureates (like Walter Gilbert) opted to work for biotechnology companies. Scores of these companies are created and closed down every year.



In USA, alone there are more than 200 such companies including Genentech, Cetus, Hybritech, Biogen, etc. USA., Japan and Europe are leaders in biotechnology research and development.
Kindly hear some public sessions on wiziq.com.

Both would be accepted - the question is, do you want to go into business or science?  If you are looking at the MBA v. an MSc. in a business area, then definitely the MBA would be the preferred degree.

University of Phoenix question?



I have a few questions about those that have attended the University of Phoenix to get their degree.



Did the degree allow you to move ahead in the job force?



Did employers snub you at all for obtaining a degree from an online university?



Most importantly, I have considered taking a few math classes I can't seem to get through otherwise at the community college level at the U of P.  Once these two math classes are completed, I can transfer to a much cheaper school, one in the Cal State system of schools where all my financial aid will cover all my expenses (and then some!)



Will those math classes be able to transfer over to the Cal State System here in California?

Graduate thesis topic on Ideal L2 Self?



As a last-year English-major student at Eötvös Lorand University Budapest, Hungary, I'm looking for an appropriate thesis topic. Specialized in Applied linguistics, I'm thrilled by the notion of Ideal L2 Self as described in Dörnyei's 'L2 Motivational Self System' (2005; 2009). However, I just cannot find a niche in the field. So I'm looking for a question that hasn't been asked yet. Also, as I'm planning to carry out the research in Hungary, it has to be manageable. Thanx for your help!

University of Phoenix question..Another one...?



One of the things the U of P hypes is that they claim employers to be in high demand of people from their universities.  Now I am not so naive as to believe every word they say, but am curious instead to see how students view this statement.  They proclaim that having you work in learning teams is one of the most desirable traits employers look for.  Also, that because you write so many papers there, that employers are looking for developed writing skills as well.  Is this true?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



They want to know if you can pay your tuition and that's the extent of their commitment to you. UOP spends over 400 MILLION dollars a year on advertising and marketing. It is one thing they do very, very well.



Yes, learning teams are a great way to develop desirable team/collaborative traits that employers like...but all colleges require team projects.  Yes, writing skills are valued...but all colleges require writing skills. This is nothing unique to UOP...it's marketing talk.



One problem with UOP's learning team concept is they do not have effective ways in which to monitor and evaluate individual contributions against the entire team's performance.  If you get stuck with a person who doesn't pull their weight, the entire team is penalized.  They call it an opportunity to learn how to work and manage teams.  I call it complete disregard of their responsibilities to ensure the quality of instruction and education an individual is expecting, and paying for, is  received.



I am strongly biased against UOP and their unethical practices relating to how they recruit students with false promises, shady statistics and poor student retention efforts.



Employers do not flock to UOP graduates; many companies have policies that specifically exclude graduates from UOP from applying. There are also companies who don't care where a degree is earned.



To be fair, I know people who earned degrees from them and had good experiences and others who either dropped out or realized after the fact that they earned a degree from a school that does not have a good reputation in the business world.



There is an interesting website of student/employee opinions of UOP.



Check it out: UOPsucks.com  The volume of posts and the fact that many of the same topics are continually commented on makes for interesting reading.



Keep investigating so you can make informed decisions.  Regardless of where you enroll, good luck in your studies.

Definitely take a year out - you'll learn so much travelling and you'll have a fantastic time. you might regret it if you don't and once you finish compltely you might not have time to take a year out.. plus your friends will have jobs but it gives you a chance to meet even more people when you go back to uni!

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



Apply to U Florida, if you like it. Don't rely on your overall GPA. Yes, apply to schools that fit your overall GPA, but also apply to one or two schools that seem to be a reach for your overall GPA, but that fit your GPA from your sophomore and junior years.



The fact that you did well in your sophomore and junior years will be weighted quite heavily by university admissions. In addition, your strong SAT scores will support that. Don't *NOT* apply to U Florida because your overall GPA is too low, if your sophomore and junior GPA is in their range!



Have I hammered that in enough? :LOL: Apply to U F. I think you might actually have a shot there. And U F has the strongest pre-med program of those you listed.



When you're looking at schools, ask them what percentage of their applicants to US med schools actually get in. That'll tell you which one has the strongest pre-med program. But in general, if med school is your goal, go to the strongest uni you can get into and that fits you well, as things like your performance at uni, and the academic reputation of your undergrad program, matter in terms of med school admissions.



Thus I'd probably rank your choices as follows, but again, ask the unis what their percent admit rate is re: med schools:
- U Florida
- U Miami
- Florida State U
- New College of Florida
- Rollins College
- and then UCF and USF



You'll noticed I added in a couple for your consideration.



Be very specific in the question you ask them. Ask, “Of every 100 students who start out pre-med, what percent end up actually attending medical school?”



Make sure they don't answer "Oh, 90% of *qualified* applicants..." No. Wrong answer.

It depends on what you want to do in the future. Ask yourself what you would enjoy doing and gain a career in it. About universities i think its a good idea to apply by january if you are thinking to go university next year 2009. Choose the university on its prospectus, like how well they are ranked, whats their graduate employment rates etc...anyway you shouldn't get too bothered about applying at universities as you have quite some time and you will get a lot of help from your tutors and UCAS does much of the hardwork for you, and hope you get the best grades, just Believe and you definetly WILL. I hope that helped, and all the best.

Publishing undergraduate student research work in Mech Eng.?



I am working on CFD Analysis of various automotive bodies for Coeff of Friction and calculation on drag for frontal areas. My work also concerns aerodynamics in wind tunnel testings at specific wind speeds. I came to learn that I can publish my paper for ASME and maybe SAE. But here are my questions:



1) Are there anywhere else I can publish them.
2) Can I publish the same paper in different journals for different organizations/societies?

Getting an MBA in Canada, or the States?



How come in Canada most Business Grad schools want you to have at least 2 years 'relevant' work experience before applying?



And in the U.S they don't (they mostly just look at your undergraduate G.P.A and your GMAT scores?



..like a its the biggest contradiction ever, don't you find?  The Masters of Business Administration program apparently wants students from various academic backgrounds (e.g., psychology, sociology, political science), yet they require you to have business experience. Like how many sociology major graduates do you know working for a financial or marketing/advertising firm you know. Geez Louis.



</question>



<additional details>



I know the better schools do obviously have more requirements.. but i mean the whole point of getting a masters degree in business is to get a good job in business after, not before the degree you know. Its a waste of time to have some entry level business job for 2 whole years BEFORE you go to school to get a good job. see the logic.

<answer>



Stanford's huge endowment allows them to be generous with their financial aid packages. You can find more info about their financial aid here:
http://www.stanford.edu/dept/finaid/unde...



It's an awesome school, and the cost shouldn't deter you from applying. If you get in they will most likely work with you and your family to be make it affordable.



Here is the link to Cal Tech's financial aid site: http://www.finaid.caltech.edu/



Best of luck to you! : )

MIT is my dream school and I know that my chances are really slim, but I'd still like to apply.  However, my family prefers that I on the east coast for my undergrad, and we can't afford the huge expense anyway.  Do you think I should still apply?  Or should I just forget it?

In my opinion, it never hurts to apply. I just went through the application process last year, and although I knew I that I probably wouldn't get into Yale and that I wouldn't be able to go because of the expense and distance (I am from California) I still applied because I knew that I would be kicking myself in the *** later if I didn't. Also, those schools provide healthy amounts of financial aid, more so than lesser colleges, so if you got in, I wouldn't be surprised if the ticket was rather appealing with financial aid included. If you don't apply, you will never know, and so that was why I applied to Yale, and I am very glad that I did, even though I didn't get in.

It never hurts to try.  In fact I did too.  Also, because it was sorta deal with some of my classmates, who themselves applied to some Ivy League schools.



When I got to the interview, the interviewer told me that MIT doesn't have admission standards.  They just pick the best of the current applicant pool.  The problem is most of those in that pool are valedictorians, high ACT and SAT scores, and National Honor Society blah blah.



Well, I couldn't get my ACT and SAT scores up for sure and well I went to High School in a rural area.



Story short I didn't get in and I ended up at University at my state.  The physics and math programs don't really have big national reputations, but they weren't a joke.  Then I continued graduate school there and it turns out they have one of the best nuclear engineering programs in the nation.



They are options. If your going into science or engineering and you have to go to a state school, then try something in the Big Ten conference.  They have solid programs.

Is a Masters of Professional studies degree worth anything? I am considering it, but is it of any real value?



I don't want to spend the next 2 years earning a worthless degree and I don't want to get further in debt to earn  a degree that will not increase my value in the job market. It seems appealing because it is general and seems to be applicable to professional employment/management in general. The concentration will be in strategic leadership. Does anyone know if the degree is worth it? It is appealing because I can take most of the classes online and it will not interfere with my work schedule.

In the past, graduating in college is a must in order to have a good job. However, at present having other degrees proves to be better. Without masters you can surely land on a job but people think that having post graduate degree makes you a better manager and so the position are usually given to those with something extra in themselves.



Getting a degree online? That will be fine provided the said degree is from a legitimate institutions as there are so many hoax or bogus universities in the internet offering those qualifications for distant learning

I suggest you build on your undergraduate degree and look for a master's program that, at the least, has a program title that is reflective of content and that offers focused studies in a discipline that gives you greater marketability. If you are interested in Strategic Leadership, get a business degree or MSHRM; teaching or training...a Masters in Education.



You run a very real risk of a potential employer looking at the words "Master of Professional Studies" and wondering what the heck that means and dismissing your acheivements. It sounds like a graduate degree in being a professional student! You should not have to start a job search by having to explain your degree. Content confusion can be the difference between getting the interview or having your resume being tossed. Plus, in the age of electronic resume submissions, your resume can be filtered out because the degree name doesn't match any category the computer is programmed to read as valid.



Colleges do a disservice to students by labeling degree programs with ambiguous names. In a blatent effort to generate graduate programs that have mass appeal (ie; lots of revenue) and marketing them as opportunities for students to "focus their studies to match their career goals", degrees like this often end up with watered down content and little credibility. The appeal of the degree often lies in the flexible scheduling and ease of learning and not in its content, which is exactly what the school is hoping you buy into.  Graduate programs are inherently designed to focus, not generalize, advanced studies.  If the degree is offered by a for-profit online institution (like U of Phoenix, for example), you are further crippling your marketability.  There is nothing wrong with on line learning; it is an excellent option for working adults....just be very cautious as to the school's reputation, the quality of instruction and ultimately, the return on investment.



Ask the school for a list of students who have graduated from this program. Find out how many obtained jobs as a result of this specific degree...not just getting a job because a Masters was required, or a list of who were promoted as a result of earning this specific degree.  Make them show you hard data that supports the marketability of an MPS degree.  If they can't, well...



As to your question, which really is asking about continuing your studies...yes, by all means go for a master's degree...just not one in Professional Studies.



Please excuse my rant, but after years of working in higher ed, this trend of offering subpar degrees that serve to generate revenue at the expense of students just enrages me.

I don't know which Collage to apply to?



The two Collages in question are:



The Space
- A creative Collage which allows you to go on to a higher level of education. The courses I am interested in are Photography, Creative Writing and Directing.



Richard Hewish
- An Academic Collage which is highly thought of and specialises in more logical subjects. The courses I am interested in are Philosophy, Psycology, Japanese and English General.



My dream is to eventually become an Author. However, I know how hard it is to live off of that job and therefore I would like another job, working on writing in my spare time. The jobs I have in mind are:



English Teacher (abroad)
English Teacher

I've never heard of either of those schools. However, in my opinion, being an author will have very little to do with your educational process other than teaching you the basics of grammar and sentence construction.



Actors, directors, photography, artists, etc., all are based on one thing: TALENT : ) And trust me, if youve got talent, theres not a university on this planet that can offer you anything better!

Would you rather do a four year degree, or would you invest time in a 4 year bachelor's and then graduate school? If you don't want to do the latter, count Psychology out. Psychologists go through extensive schooling, and Psychiatrists even have to go to Medical School.



Publisher -- You would need to really make your company a big-named one in order to have authors want to publish their material through you. Again, this would take many years to jump-start your business.



Photographer is a cool job, but just like writer, it's not a stable job, nor is it a stable income. Are you planning on photographing weddings? Or abstract things in nature and everyday life? You must distinguish between the two because each takes you into a different path. You could do this as a hobby, along with writing. :) (How cool)



English Teacher would be really cool if you did it abroad. Do you have any idea where you would want to go? Personally, I say if you have the motivation and the time go for Psychology or Psychiatry, but if you don't, go for English Teacher.



Concerning the college itself, I don't know anything about either school, but you would need to go into a College or University with a School of Education.



Good Luck! :)

Lawyers don't do math LOL.  What would help would be a course in Logic.  These types of questions are on the LSAT (law school admissions test).  You can take courses in Criminal Justice to learn how the system works.  Political Science could be useful as well.
Paralegal training would be the most useful as paralegals do many of  the things lawyers do but must work for a lawyer and they don't get the really big bucks. You can major in anything and still go to law school but you must have a very good GPA to be admitted.
Engineering Students take a lot of math.  Calculus is required.  The other classes will all have math in them. You would take Physics and Chemistry and Design.  There will be math in every class  you take.

it means your degree will not mean much in the job market, you can't transfer credits for further studies

I would imagine they'd want to have your official grades on file and that there's a way for them to obtain them.

The best thing you could do at this point is to send in another application ASAP, indicating that the previous one contained errors.

Once they realise you cant even spell certificates the game is up! However, these days they hand out degrees as if they are napkins at a picnic so dont worry about it. Just turn up for the interview wearing something very short and hopefully the drug addled "professor" will forget all about your meagre qualifications as you attempt to do a Sharon Stone.
P.S. You may find a quick trim may be more important at this stage than a reference to a B+ in History. Good luck and let me know how it goes.

What will you do if they want confirmation of your results.

If you are selected for interview you will need to own up to the fact and put things straight. You will have to produce your certificates in your formal application I am afraid.

To save face you could write and say you don't want to go to college anymore and apply to a different one.

They will verify with the exam boards if you got these grades and you will have to bring along your grade certificates if you get called in for an interview. So either way...not good!

Learn from this mistake, I'm sure they wont think bad of you, just will see it as you trying to do well for yourself. Have a look around at other potential colleges. Try ICS www.icslearn.co.uk for maybe doing a couple of other GSCE/qualifications which should help too.

3.43 GPA, 1920 on the SAT's, 29 on the ACT's, etc... Which colleges would accept me?



I know not unless you are a college admission administrator most people have to "guess" what their chances are for certain colleges. Many people says a 3.43 GPA is average.



To give you some background info, most of my classes were Honors and AP classes, and just a few reg. courses here and there throughout my 3 years of high school so far. I took one SAT so far and got a 1920, I'm going to take it again in October and maybe for the third time in November. I ended up taking the ACT's and got a 29. If it helps I live in NJ, Volunteered 100+ hours, joined several clubs and were dedicated to them. I won a couple of Best Poetry awards during high school, and one of my poems was published in a poetry book called Tracing the infinite. I am sure that I got the best recommendation my teachers and counselor could give me, and I will work hard to write a great essay.



Now that I'm going to be a senior in HS this year with many other people, I'm looking for which colleges to apply to, and trying to determine which is a reach safety and match. Sometimes I feel so down whenever I hear people with 3.7+ GPA, which they earned no doubt about it. Still after I hear those GPA's it makes me wonder what kind of college would accept me.

I was wondering if these colleges would be a reach, safety, or match for me. Before some of you answer I do not want to go to community college and transfer.

Rutgers
Villanova
Boston University
Lehigh
Montclair
TCNJ

I know most of them are great schools and tough to get into. Out of all of them Villanova is my first choice.

I'm a graduate of Boston University, and I'm pretty certain you'll be accepted there. I would try to get that GPA up to at least a 3.5 or 3.6 (I had a 3.8 unweighted) if you want to have any kind of academic scholarship. I think sometimes students are so concerned with just getting accepted into a certain university, they forget to consider how they'll finance going to those schools if they do get accepted. Boston University's tuition skyrockets ever year (I think cost of attendace is around $47,000 a year). If you don't get an academic scholarship--and if you aren't rich--then just how do you plan on financing that education?
This is basically the only reason I tell you to get your GPA up. BU will consider you for their scholarships if you have at least a 3.5 or 3.6, but if you're just concerned about getting in, then I don't think you'll have a problem with that. 
Your hard factors (i.e. test scores, GPA, class rank) look pretty good, and I'd say your soft factors (i.e. volunteer work, extracurriculars, essay) are looking great as well. While I don't think you'll get into any Ivy League schools with those stats (although you never know), I'd definitely say you're on par with the schools you're looking to apply to.

Make a list of schools you want to go to.  Then  go online and find out their requirements to get in unless you want someone to do all of the work for you of which is something you should want to do.  If you can't find the information on your own then you should not being going to college.  Sorry, that's what I think about it.

This looks like a reasonable list for you -- a couple reach schools, several that are probably a good fit and one that is a sure thing. Montclair is the only school on the list that I would advise against.

I don't know how derdaktari got the idea that Villanova is an urban school.  It is on a spacious campus in the wealthy Main Line suburbs of Philadelphia.  I rank it up with Duke and Princeton in terms of beautiful campuses (I attended both Villanova and Duke an d used to live in Princeton).

Princeton Review has a tool where you can enter information about your interests and background.  It then gives you a list of appropriate schools.  The link is below

No your salary is not based off your college, if you and someone from yale get hired for the same job at the same company you will start the same

BUT

your college can change what kind of job you can get, for example if a lamar grad and a yale grade both go up for the same job at a better company that pays more.....the yale grad will almost certainly bump you out

to a point yes but the MAIN reason behind salary is the degree you get. If you get a art degree from the top ten school out there in art and then you get a engineering degree from a unkown university I can assure you that the engineering degree will make ALOT of more money than the art at the top school. Now if you are comparing the same engineering degrees then yes the better school will have a higher chance however GPA and other coursework also plays a factor. For example if you get a BS in engineering from a top known university or get a MS in engineering from a unkown university the MS will win over the BS regardless of school.

Yes, to some extent.



If you graduate with a useful degree (business, engineering, medicine, law (maybe) from a major/respected school, starting salaries can be considerably higher. A Harvard Law or MBA Graduate can start 2X or even more than a graduate of a mid tier school. Graduates of prestigeous schools may advance faster (in part due to competence) due to connections and networks made while at these schools.

For mid tier schools (i.e most major Public Universities, significant private universities) salaries will not vary greatly.

For lower tier universities there can be a large difference in salaries or for that matter a graduates ability to get a good job at all. Many companies do not bother to recruit at smaller schools or those with below average reputations. A graduate of one of these schools may still advance on their own competence, but the road is steeper and there are more obstacles.

It isn't true that an employer will pay more to an employee who graduated from one school rather than another.  However, graduates of top schools often have more options available to them, so they can pick the best offer and often make more than others to begin with because of that.

$44,000 is pretty good - it sounds well above the average to me, but it may depend on what majors are offered there.  Why would you not stay to graduate?  If you are concerned about salary, you can almost guarantee a higher one with a college degree than without one.

It more depends on the major, and the job prospects.  Better schools may have a bit of an edge in SOME areas, but not all.  Again, it's more on the major, the prep work you've done, any internships you've had, your location geographically, and the economy.

Folks posting here really ought to read the Wall St. Journal which proved most of them wrong last week. It quoted a Wharton professor who explained that kids from Dartmouth were paid more for the same job as those from Rutgers, which isn't a half bad school. While kids from top schools usually are not competing for the same job as kids from low tier schools, employers will pay more to get a top candidate.

The degree alone doesn't enhance your prospects.

What you do with your degree once you have it is the key to your success. Unless you can find a design company to employ you or you open your own design company things might not pan out.

Join Prospects and  keep an ear to the ground about job opportunities and graduate jobs. Try to get involved in the industry while still a student and go from there.

Dissertations are fun to write.

1. You need to do is choose a subject you are interested in or want to research.

2. Planning is key to the success of the dissertation or any other body of writing. Learn to use your word processor very well and research the referencing system you need to use.

3. Working consistently and methodically every day is the only way to get the work done on time and to a high standard. Reading and re-reading your work correcting, honing and re-working is all part of the work you need to do.

As someone has already said - start with something you are interested in.  It's a big help six months down the line.]

Most dissertations suffer from a lack of focus - they are to broad.  The best ones have a very narrow focus that allows detailed quality work.  The into and conclusions allow you to put this narrow study into a wider context (showing real world value).

You don't have to completely solve a problem (in most cases) but develop some knowledge.

Good luck

Contrary to belief, GCSE's are actually still important when applying to university. You may have excellent A-Level results but it is preferable to choose a candidate with both excellent A-Levels and GCSE's. A grade of C or above is required in Mathematics and English and often in Science's too. English language though is particularly important for studying Law as I am sure you are fully aware. Good luck with your application and I hope you are successful. 
ps Obviously standards differ between universities but if you intend to apply to more prestigious universities such as Oxbridge, Nottingham, Durham, York, Sheffield and so on then your grades are of paramount importance. x

Think of it this way:



The economy right now is horrible, right?



Well, if you graduate within the next four years, you will most definitely be welcomed in the job market with your economics degree. Economists will need to be innovative in their thought and would welcome some younger, fresh ideas.
Think of your possible success (and wealth - that is a motivation for many people, as it should be.)



Are you interested in your major? Most people tend to lose focus on the things they don't really like or appreciate. Is there something else you would rather be doing? It's never too late to change a major if you're willing to invest further time into it.



What I do to stay focused is make sure I get a dosage of every aspect of life so I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. My number one tip for you to be is SCHEDULING. Purchase a planner, make it your life-line. Write down times you need to study, deadlines for school assignments, exam notices, write down time frames when you can have some time-off by relaxing or hanging out with friends.



You need to have some time to do other things that are non-academic in order to stay focused on the assignments that professors ask of you to do.



Mentality wise -- like I said, think of what a degree in economics would do for you, especially in today's society and economy.



Last but certainly not least: Research the career you plan on entering after graduation. What jobs are available to students with an economics degree? Ask questions like that, talk to advisers, professors, economists, etc. Get a feel for what you're getting in, and you might find something that will rejuvenate your motivation and make you more focused on what you are working to achieve.



It's your money that you're paying for school; most importantly, it is your TIME invested into this degree -- use those resources well, use them to the fullest and don't let the next years drag by. Think positive. :)



Those are all things I did, I hope I helped.

Read as widely as you can. By all means focus on what interests you, but make sure you've also read a good balance of historic and contemporary literature. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Swift, and Austen are good bets. Think about what qualities make them enduring, and what modern writers might share, or aspire to, or rebel against these qualities, as revealed by their work. Develop a few ideas about what literature tells us about other ages, and about our own. Show that you can think and talk intelligently about your reading and you'll do well. Best of luck!

whatever you're interested in.... think about choosing a certain topic and reading different books that go into it, for example I wrote about texts exploring dystopian society in my personal statement. UCL interviews so it's not so important to have read specific texts, but more to have an opinion on it. don't waste time trying to get through the really complicated stuff (ie. Joyce) if you don't enjoy it because you're bound to be able to talk more animatedly and in depth on a text you "get". oh, and read a few critical analysis texts, it's always good to see other people's opinions. I'd recommend some of Shelley's poetry personally... try "Ozymandias" if you don't know it already. It's short but throws up so many ideas. Good luck!

Start with the Norton Anthology of English Literature. That should do it. It covers all the major writers from Chaucer to the present.

Taking 18 units in a semester?



Hi
I would like to know if anyone here has taken 18  units(semester units)(6 classes) in a semester and worked full time(relaxed job-where one can read for a couple of hours)?

I just finished community college(60 Quarter units) in 1 year and 3 months. I took 20 units(4 classes) and worked the same schedule I will be working now and maintained a GPA of 3.5.



I just want to know if anyone out there has taken 18 credit units and worked full time and managed?



</question>

They are all hotel management classes with the exception of one being a Business Marketing Class. I guess it will be a lot of reading and not application based like Mathematics or Engineering as a lot of you are asking.

I did 24 in one semester, worked full time, I was a cadet and married, and helped my es with his business.

I had no choice, I wanted my degree and a divorce, and it was the fastest way to achieve both.  It was difficult, barely rested, but I was able to graduate with a 3.8.

You can do it but it will be dedication and work.

Ok, hotel management - sounds doable, because you'll likely be able to do homework and study during those relaxed periods at work.  I've taken 19 credits in a semester before (most of those engineering lab classes) and worked part-time (only 10 hours/week) but I could have handled more... It's up to you of course and only you know what you can handle, but the fact that you're willing to try says a lot.

First off.  Anything is possible.  Secondly, it depends on the classes.  If its 6 classes that are all very similar...ie.  all engineering courses, or all english courses it will be hard.  It could be too much demanding course work (ie. engineering or biology) or it could be just too much writing (ie. english).  If its a mix of lower level classes it should be fine.  But it all depends on the kinds of classes.

Doing so is extremely difficult and I would not recommend pursuing 18 credits in a single semester and working full time.  Throughout the semester you'll find yourself crashing and fatigue will become an ongoing problem.  Do yourself a favor and keep to around 14-16 credits at most.

You may do well with business Information Technology.  This is aimed at managers and users of IT, and has an appropriate amount of technical content.  It requires limited maths, not the more advanced maths required by computer science.



You can get information on the range of UK courses from UCAS.

When you're 21 you're considered a 'mature student', and don't need need A LEVELS, although I'm fairly certain you need GCSE's. However, if you have relevant work experience they may consider you, and you can always do an access course. Just remember, there's no harm in asking. I did fairly rubbish in my A Levels due to problems and was accepted onto a course that required over double the entry mark just because I wrote a note to the admission's tutor for that subject explaining my situation. If you check on any given university's website they'll usually tell you the entry requirement for each course.
Good luck!

You need to be clear on why you want to go.  If you are not clearly motivated then you are more likely to drop out (having taken on a loan that needs to be paid back).  What interests you?  What do you want to spend the rest of your life doing, what would you like to be called/labelled?  UCAS (look on the web) have guides that may help you to find a course you want.  If your interests have links to professional groups then they will also be able to help identify a course.  For example: buyers, accountants, doctors, actors, engineers, musicians, etc . all have organisations who you can contact for help.

Depending on the course you will need some evidence of ability.  This could be based on your work, which might show aptitude for a particular area, and ability with arithmetic (e.g. if you do calculations).  However, many courses require you to have maths and English GCSE passed at C grade or above.  This is necessary to cope with the level of work.  In addition, you might be asked to do either a foundation course, or another exam, e.g. HNC or A 'level.  This is to give you experience with academic work, without having to incur the expense of signing up to a course and finding it doesn't suit.  Don't think of this as a hurdle - it helps to get you into the learning habit, and lets you check that it's really what you want to do.

At 23, with some life behind you, you should be able to get more out of the experience.  If you've developed work discipline skills then these can be applied to uni: time keeping, application to tasks, self-management.

Talk to the universities you are interested in.  They will have an "Access" office.  This is intended to help people who are not from families with a uni history, people not coming straight from school, and others who need additional information and support.

Do it.  Some of my best students have been from non-typical starting points.  They've gone on to successful and fulfilling careers.

Yes you can.

If you look at university web sites they will give A level requirements for entry but then they will have information for entry for mature students.

They look at your life experience and other skills.

BUT it depends on the course, you would struggle to do Uni level maths without doing A level first.

Going straight to uni is an enormous shock to the system. One of my uni lecturers started uni as a mature student with one O Level but says she wouldn't recommend it.

Access courses are designed for people like you, to bridge the gap between school leaving and uni. You could have a look at your local college for access courses.

Also some unis now do a 'foundation year', a sort of year 0 to get you up to uni year 1 standard.



You may also have more success at a 'new' uni. They have a lot of mature students and students who do not have traditional qualifications

What Masters can i do with my degree?



I have a 3rd B A hons degree in media communications with permance art. I got this 5 years ago and it is so open ended i have never really used it, now I would like to specialise in something maybe psychology, but do i need to have a degree in the subject first? or need certains grades? any help on where i can find this info would be great!
Thanks



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



If you want a Masters with the degree you have, you would most likely want a Masters that is related to that degree.  Most people who get a masters in communication either become professors or researchers.  Since you have a media comm degree, perhaps you should look at some form of broadcasting programs (broadcast journalism, radio, news, etc).

As for psychology, to Master in psychology you would first need a BA or BS degree (depending on where you want to go in the field of psychology) before joining a Masters program since Masters level classes won't cover the basics you should have learned in undergrad.

Everyone from your high school is not partying. Only a few loudmouths are and since they talk about the parties they attend they drown out the people who talk of doing other things on the weekend.

Everyone's not partying. The people who are are probably going to get crappy grades.

if you want to start going to parties then start going... but don't just go for the sake that everyone else is and you're looking around asking yourself if that's what you should be doing to.



and in my opinion you don't need to pick either working/studying or partying. you can balance both... but the reason people think it's one way or the other is because usually the people that party don't know how to control themselves and start partying TOO much. i knew people who went out almost every night of the week except maybe sunday and monday and in my opinion that's way too much. but you can definately go out on the weekend and still get your homework done and be serious about working in college

University Chancellors



What is the role of the Chancellor and a Pro-Chancellor at a University?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Chancellor is an honorary role with no 'real' power, usually a person who has made some real accomplishment albeit not as a academic. Examples are University of Huddersfield - Patrick 'Star Trek' Stewart and my Chancellor at Leeds Metropolitan University was Brendan Foster - a former long distant athlete. The main man is the Vice Chancellor, he is the CEO of the University. Usually a tenured Professor. e.g. at Leeds Met the Vice Chancellor is Prof. Simon Lee - Professor of Law.

Pro Chancellor are seconds to the Vice Chancellor and are usually drawn from the ranks of the most senior of academics of the University.

Hope this helps

Will going to university at 21 be as good as going when your 18?



I'll be going to university at 21 which is about two years time from now.
At the moment I'll be studying a National Diploma in Fashion Design in college for two years(i found it quite hard finding what to do after high school & also had no good proper guidance, though I've got a Distinction in a First Diploma but not so good grades in GCSEs).

So after college i would just turn 21 when i start university in September in two years time from now.

Will it make a big difference going to uni at 21 than at 18?
(will i be okay with not so good GCSEs?)

I don't think it will make much of a difference.  You might find maturity levels a little different between you and some of the less mature classmates.  But don't worry about it.

In the UK, 18 is about the same as 21 legally speaking.

Honestly, it has become much more common to see non-traditional students around campus and in classes than traditional.  When I was going through my undergrad as a traditional student I was more of the minority than majority.

I think a lot of ppl are choosing to go back and maybe change careers or expand their knowledge by taking some new and different classes.  Also in some fields it is very common for those to keep taking classes to move on their pay scale.  I guess education never goes out of style!

I went university at 18 and finished in June (I'm 20 now).

I was faaaaaaaar too young, went completely off the rails after always being a 'good girl' and struggled with living on my own. That is just me, but note I was never like that before I started!

I think 21 is a great age to start, your more mature, have a greater understanding of what you want to do and have time to get in that all important work experience the next 2 years!

And by the way your diploma is far more important than your GSCE's so don't worry about that..

Good Luck

You may want to rethink your career path. Here is why:

The Reality: Architecture has many pluses. Indeed, it made it (barely) into last year's list of Best Careers. Alas, for 2008, architecture must be moved to the overrated category. Not only is the housing decline souring the job market, but more potential clients are offshoring the work to India, downloading premade blueprints developed by top architects, or having lower-cost interior/exterior designers or building contractors design their structure. Two recent job satisfaction surveys painted a mixed picture: One gave architecture high marks, but the other rated it very low. A major cause of low job satisfaction is that many architects don't get to design buildings but rather must produce detailed drawings of the components of other people's designs, such as the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system.

Alternative: Interior Designer. Halfway between an architect and an interior decorator, interior designers recommend where a wall should go as well as the color scheme.

Will I be able to do Economics at University ?



I'm  thinking about doing Economics at University. I am doing A-levels in Law, Business, Economics, Critical Thinking. I am not doing maths and unfortunately i can't change it now
Will I Be able to do Economics at University?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



All the good universities require a maths A level - it's possible that some of the former polytechnics do not, but if you want to go somewhere where you'll get a degree which means something, then you need to do the A level. If you can't take it at school, have you looked into doing it at a local college, and maybe dropping one of the others? Critical thinking is often not even accepted by universities, so dropping that and doing the maths A level at college would be an idea - colleges usually offer a one year course and have evening classes etc so it would be fairly easy to fit around your schoolwork. Good luck!

Ignore them, or just nod your head and smile.  Don't let somebody on the same wage rate as you pull rank or tell you they know better. Always go to the boss first if your unsure about something as they're paid to take the crap.  Don't be afraid to speak your mind if something isn't safe ask for a written and signed method statement absolving you of all culpability never volunteer and never do anything the boss says he wouldn't ask of you himself without him doing it himself, get him to prove it even if its him having to stick his hand down the bog to unblock it.  In other words stand your ground, do whats asked or needed be flexible but don't forward yourself for anything stupid or dangerous or out of your remit for no extra money.  Things are tough now very soon they'll get worse.

Appear to be open, but really be closed. Appear to be considerate but make sure you consider your options properly. Keep everything close to your chest. Tell only what people need to know, not everything about you or what you think, feel or are about.

I got a 1570/2400 on my SAT test in 2006 now I've just finished my freshman year in UC Riverside and 1 summer history class in Fullerton Community College I have a 3.3 GPA in college and nowhere out of all the classes I have taken so far, I've been taking 4 classes per quarter, have I seen anything that is even close to what is on the SAT. Whats the point of this test I understand that there should be some sort of test to enter college but isnt the SAT the wrong way to test people, it has nothing to do with what you will encounter in college.

I feel the same way about the SAT... always have, and always will. I too just finished my first year of college.



Apparently this test is supposed to be "fair." Testmakers try to make it as standard and general as possible, to not give any one student an advantage in the test material than the next. They don't want to be accused for being biased towards anyone, right.

But not all students can memorize and spit out the answer. Not all students think alike in what the more important "theme" is... after reading a passage.



There's a big difference between just memorizing something, and truly learning something.... and that is what sucks about the SAT, it doesn't acknowledge that. Everyone has to learn the same way, think the same way (their way) and it's kind of unfair, but I don't think we will see  any changes with that.

Its not suppose to test your KNOWLEDGE, but rather your intuition and reasoning/problem solving. Though the problems you see on the test are not ones you will encounter in every day life or academia, they are a good assessment of intelligence rather than knowledge, to a certain extent.

In this way, colleges can have one standardized criteria for comparing people from completely different backgrounds or schools (because of grade inflation, etc, you need that standard).



If the test was on physics problems and chinese literature, then kids who study those specific topics would be at an advantage. Because it tests for general knowledge of math, writing and verbal, the only way to study is to simply gain awareness and general knowledge that you can acquire in any and all settings, although many kids try to short cut that approach by practicing the test itself and learning short cuts (not the intention of the exam).

It's pretty much an IQ test and it does correlate with success in college, though not as well as HS GPA does. The greatest correlation however is between SAT score and family income. Wealthy kids from highly educated families do best on the test.

The ACT is the test that measures what you've learned in classes. Kids who study hard but who are not as naturally smart do better on it.

It depends slightly on what examinations board you used for your GCSEs - they do vary somewhat. The main difference you can expect, speaking very generally - is that you will be looking at texts in far greater detail and will be exploring areas like 'the craft of the author', 'intended audience', 'use of language to what effect' and things like that. 
I loved a-level literature when I did it (which yes, I admit, was rather a long time ago now...) I would recommend it - you'll never read a book in the same way again ever...

Most combined subjects have lower grade boundaries as combining means less people apply for the course. This may be picked up by employers if they are particularly strict, but if your high school/A-Level grades are good this should not hinder you in anyway.

I think in a hypothetical world it would be beneficial for you to do two subjects as you will get more opportunity the more languages you speak. On the other hand...wont you find this a bit of a struggle. In the real world learning two languages. Do you have any knowledge of the potential language you are considering. If you are not at a foundation level for the potential subject then leave it. Do really well in French...as combined languages may mean you get just an average grade overall as one you are weak in could bring you down.

It depends what degree you earn.  If you earn a Ph.D., you can be called Dr.  Otherwise, you can put the letters of your degree after your name.  However, very few people who have bachelor's or master's degrees do this.

Contrary to the poster above me, the Ivy League schools are not Fordham and Berkley. Ivy League grads do not think they are better than everyone else, either.



Here is the list of Ivy League members in order of prestige:
1. Harvard (MA)
2. Princeton (NJ)
3. Yale (CT)
4. University of Pennsylvania (PA)
5. Columbia (NY)
6. Dartmouth (NH)
7. Brown (RI)
8. Cornell (NY)

There are only 8 members of the Ivy League.  Opposite to what the person above says, they do not "costs megabucks," the financial aid is very generous and students rarely pay the sticker price.



All of the eight members are known for their academic excellence, high quality research, and diverse student body.



The Ivy League attracts qualified students from all over the world. One who applies needs more than an impeccable transcript and extra-curriculars.



One needs to demonstrate passion and character through essays, alumni interviews, and teacher recommendations. The Ivy League is also know to look beyond the numbers i.e. GPA, SAT scores, AP scores, SAT II scores, etc. They evaluate you as a person, too.

The Ivy League is an athletic conference comprising eight private institutions of higher education located in the Northeastern United States. The term is most commonly used to refer to those eight schools considered as a group. The term also has connotations of academic excellence, selectivity in admissions, and a reputation for social elitism.

Is a Higher National Diploma from a U.K University equal to an Associate's Degree for work permits abroad?



I've been teaching English in Indonesia for eight years, since obtaining my Trinity TESOL in the U.K. I went to university after school, but for my purposes at the time, I took an HND in Performing Arts as this was my chosen career direction. I've found it difficult in many cases, and impossible in others, to apply for work in other countries in South East Asia and further afield. This has been due to my educational background not being to at least a BA standard, but I now see that some countries are accepting teachers with Associate's degrees with TESOL/CELTA certification. It's my understanding that an Associate's degree is a two year course, the same as my HND, but are both considered of equal value, or indeed, can they be in certain cases? Please answer only if you really know the answer to this or know how I could definitely find out. I really need to know where I stand as this could greatly enhance my opportunities for career development. Thank you very, very much.

Your problem is mind related. So for no scientific explanation for mind that is, what is mind, what is the origin of mind? To the best of my knowledge and personal experience only one organisation is there in our world originated in India and having few centers in USA will teach you in nonreligious manner all the secret of mind through meditation & introspection. http://www.vethathiri.org/Home/

It won't matter much what GCSEs you have, although good grades at Maths and English are always preferable.

You would need to have three good A-levels. Law is a very popular university course, and the better your A-level grades the better your chances of getting onto a course at a good university. It generally doesn't matter what subjects you do (although humanities based subjects are probably best). If your college or school does law A-level, it's not necessarily a good idea to do it. A lot of universities are wary about it as it has such a different format from degree level law.

The best course to take is generally the LLB law degree. You could check out the Law Society's website: http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/home.law

Well for studying law (as opposed to nursing LOL) you should check with the university you intend to go to for their entry qualifications. Generally speaking English, social subjects and RE are the ones most acceptable.

States require agents to take a course prior to the licensing exam.  NO degree is required, but there are separate exams (life, health, property, casualty) for specific licenses.  Many agents today have licenses in other areas (i.e. securities) to provide investment opportunities for their clients.

What are you studying?  If you can find some sort of job that's even remotely similar to what you might do some day, that would probably be great when you're finished with school.  It wouldn't even have to be that hard of a job. . . just something that puts you into the general atmosphere so you pick up how things really work, what people really do, and how they talk.

Either that, or can you take some summer classes somewhere that would help with your studies?  You might be able to go to another university that yours is affiliated with and study there for a few months.  That would be travel *and* getting some schoolwork done.

Calm it down. Everything will be fine. Uni is something to be enjoyed. And anyway, everybody's in the same situation as you. New place. New circumstances.

Relax. I can happily tell you that there are no bells. At least not where I am. Is this good? Or bad? It does mean you check the wall clocks and your watch a lot more. But really,
nobody's going to mind if you're a little late for class.

Good luck and have fun.

Don't worry - uni is a blast.

And there's nothing better than conflicting classes - I had two in my MSc (java and 3d modelling); I told each one that I couldn't make it as I was attending the other, and stayed in bed.

Passed both with flying colours. Uni's more about independent learning than lectures, anyhow...

First of all, you should relax.  The first day of classes, professors for first year classes are expecting flustered students.  Even if you walk in late, do it quietly and sit at the back of the classroom.  It'll be fine.

Now as to the back-to-back classes situation, look at what building your classes are in.  Are they in the same one?  If so, the difference will probably be okay; explain to both teachers the situation, and hopefully they'll be willing to work with it.

However, if you go to a large university where classes can be ten minutes away by bus you might need to reschedule one of those classes.



Even if they're in buildings that are side by side, the time thing should be okay.  Relax, have fun, and focus on the college experience! Good luck!

I can't imagine there being a bell at your University.  My professors tended to let us out early anyway, when their lecture/activity was done, there was no need to stay just to fill the time like in high school.

It is super scary, I have been there.  You will be fine and really like the extra freedoms.  You don't get in "trouble" for missing class (although it may be part of your grade in the course) you can eat and drink if you feel like it, and you could leave a few minutes early if you have to make it to your next class.

If you don't already know where your classrooms are located you should go early tomorrow to make sure you can find your way from one to another.  It'll be great! Good luck!

Let me just say that this is probably the most adorable question I've answered all day.
Colleges advisors are notorious for putting together horrible schedules (they basically don't care how you do it, but that you just get the credits in). Most professors understand this, and will let the class out 10 minutes ahead of time (so if your next class is scheduled from 1pm-3pm, the professor will let you out at 12:50pm in order to give you enough time to get to that class). Not all professors are this understanding however, and you might have to work something out with the professor personally, so that he/she knows you're leaving class early for a reason, not just because you're bored. 
Your freshmen year will be the worst by far, in part because freshmen are the last to choose their schedules. Once you become a sophomore, you'll have more freedom to choose a schedule that allows you enough time to get to each class, and might even offer you a break between classes (either to do homework, nap, or just relax before class).



I completely understand what you are going through. I'm from Alabama and went to Boston University in Massachusetts. I went by myself (read: no parental help), had to move in by myself, and had to figure out how to maneuver the campus on the subway by myself. It was a scary time, but after the first week or so, I had already begun to make friends and found that the freedom I was given was well worth the move and the hassle.

College is a big step financially and psychologically. It's a step many fail to take; so be proud that you've made it this far, and don't worry. Try to introduce yourself to the professor, as this will help him/her in not only remembering you, but also helps you to establish a rapport with them, which may come in handy if you need a recommendation later in your college career.

Remember: it's college, so no one is going to force you or check up on you to go to class. College will provide you with a lot of freedom, and it's up to you to decide whether you will use that freedom responsibly.

I want to work for Gaming companies, but what Major?!?



I would like to work in big gaming companies in the feature, like EA, Blizzard, Rockstar, etc, but I need help choosing a major. I mainly want to work in the arts area, like 2d concept/character design or 3d animation.My picks are Game Arts& Design, Animation, or Graphic Design. I think Game Arts & Design is the best for me, but it very limited and doesn't have this major in alot of schools. Which major fits the best? and/or any other majors I havent listed

And if possible, what good Universities/Schools are good for my area in Southern California? Near LA.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



For most universities, they only have graphics design or animations as majors. Some good schools that you can't go wrong are UCLA and USC. They both have strong art programs and their ranking will carry your degree far. Also, I'm not sure about USC, but I know that UCLA's graphics design major is very good. It might even be better if you can do a minor or even double major in something computer science related, but that of course will be very hard. A bit farther, UC Irvine is also pretty good for graphics design.

Would these grades qualify me for medicine?



I know that A levels is what medical schools really look at  but i think they also look at GCSE to decide who will get a place at med school or not. I received the following GCSE results. I know i am not smart enough for cambridge or oxford but I would be over the moon if i got a places at UCL or imperial or kings college etc that's would be a real achievement for me :)

I am currently taking biology, Chemistry,ICT and English and i tend to add sociology for A2. I think these subjects are acceptable? With the obvious grade requirements

My GCSE's are of the following:

Maths: B
Science Core: B
Science additional: B
Art: A
Drama: A
ICT: A*A*
English Literature: A
English Language: B 
Technology: B
R.E: A

Ps i was 2 marks off an A in maths would they look at the points or just the grade?

probably, yes. And no I don't think they look at the individual points of your GCSE's. I don't know that for certain but it's seems logical that they wouldn't - they look at thousands of applicants which means thousands of grades, I don't think they'd examine each individual's points and how far off they were. But saying that, it is an elite university.

No matter what way you look at it, 5B's is not good.
You would have to get straight A's at A Level and a very good UKCAT score to get in with those.
Im not saying dont apply but also dont put all you eggs in the medical basket.
Also get lots and lots of work experience, that counts for more than anything else.
Also, dont apply for medical schools you know you have no chance with.
If you are serious about medicine, start volunteer work and experience now,
I did admittedly get better grades but medicine is tough enough anyway so my advice is do as much as you can, look at the uni's websites and find out what they want most and do lots of that
Good luck, its tough I had a really good application, even compared to other applicants and yet i still only got one offer, its is unbelievably competitive so get ahead of the game.

I've failed my 2nd year at uni 4 times, would they let me re-take the year?



Yes, I know it sounds crazy. I passed my 1st year fine and then it all went wrong and I failed my 2nd year 3 times. I don't know if there is much point in doing it again as I don't particularly enjoy it but apparently I have a progression meeting enabling me to retake the year... I don't know if it is worth it? I will feel quite embarrassed if I do go as I will face the same tutor and they surely must think 'this girl is a failure!'



Besides, my main question was... Surely I have used up all my lives and they would have expelled me by now?? Many questions floating around my head.

Can I retake after failing so many times? Do I sack it off? Is there anyone in similar situation? If I quit will I regret it for the rest of my life?

Any advice will be appreciated.

So I am wondering... The reason why they 'may' be giving me another chance is only for money reasons. Oh I feel so confused what to do... =S

<answer>



When you say you've failed it three times, I presume you mean that you've used up all the permitted resit opportunities so have actually just failed it once (rather than having sat the year three times already)?

So, should you retake the year? Well there's a few things you need to look at:

Firstly, I'm concerned that you don't particularly enjoy your course. Why is this? Is the subject less interesting than you thought it would be? Is it just not taught very well at your Uni? If you can have a hard think about this it might help you come up with an answer.

Then, and this is probably the biggest factor, you need to think about why you failed - very honestly (after all, it's only you that you're answerable to). For eg did you not do the work because it wasn't interesting? Was it too hard? Did you just not work hard enough? Did you not understand what was required at level 2?



Obviously, there's no point in repeating the year if the same is going to happen again  - or if you scrape through and then the same happens in your third year.

Universities rarely 'expel' people! If you fail repeatedly, then it's more a case of you having not done what's needed to get to the next level. One of the way Unis are judged by the Government is on the number of people who progress (ie don't drop out for any reason) - hence they will give as many opportunities as is academically defensible to get through. It's not just about the money (money is always a factor in any commercial transaction!), a student who needs resits uses up lots of staff time so you're not actually that  profitable ;)

So, where do you go from here?
Well start thinking about alternatives. Do you have Plan B? ie what would you do if you don't get a degree? Would you be better to cut your losses, perhaps get a job for a year to pay off some of those debts, and then think about starting afresh at a new course you are more enthusiastic about in a year's time?  Do you need this degree for a career you've set your heart on? If so, would you better resitting your year at your present institition or starting over somewhere else?

I realise that I've posed more questions than given answers, but hopefully they will clarify your thinking

From where I'm sitting there doesn't seem to be a lot of point in redoing a year that you're not enjoying and aren't doing well at, but there might well be a whole host of factors I'm unaware of.

Finally, a decision making tip. Right now, tel yourself you've decided, say, to repeat your year. Live with that decision for a day or two. How does that feel? Like you did the right thing or do you have feelings of dread and depression. Now decide the opposite - you're going to leave. How does that feel after you've lived with that decision?

So basically, the class isn't the issue: it's your money.

I suggest you get your financial situation better before even attempting to take this class again for the fourth time (if you haven't used up all of your "lives").

HELP... does anyone have any experience with balancing a job and being in a sorority?



When I start school next January I plan on joining a sorority but I also need to keep my job because of my money situation. I will probably devote 2 days out of the week to school either Mon/Wed or Tue/Thur then work the other two alternate days plus Fri and Sat. I work at a bank so my hours are only from about 9 in the morning til 6 at night so all of my nights are open and Sundays are open as well. Was anyone else in a similar situation? How did you handle it with meetings and community service?

Try Sarah Palin. First have 5 kids, then run for Mayor. Next run for Govenor and hire someone else to do the job. Then go Skin a moose for the heck of it and fly a Cessna and shoot some wolves. 
Whoa...is that a Polar Bear I see floating out to the Equator...lucky guy sunning in Florida.
Spend $50K to make up the Mayor office to look like a bordelo and then put on some lipstick.

Oh yea, completely forgot; Sorority did you say?

Almost certainly yes.  Unless they are clearly 'not suited' to the university Oxford will interview almost everyone who applies.  Whilst your AS grades are a smidgen lower than the usual Oxford standard, your predicted grades meet the criteria and so they should be interested in interviewing you.

it's not down to which one is most interesting or better paid, it's which one interests YOU the most.  what's the point in doing all that hard work to go into a career that you end up hating/severely disliking if all you get is good money. it's no way to live a life, and you are in an excellent position to make sure you don't end up that way.

for example.  i couldn't make up my mind whether to do a degree in environmental sciences or Psychology and criminology.  both interest me highly, and appeal to me in different ways.  but i envisaged which one i could see my see myself working in.  and chose environmental science, but plan to do a diploma in psychology & criminology in the years after my degree - i could never see myself working in that field, it's purely out of personal interest.

read up on the careers that all those degrees can lead to and see how you feel then.  plus don't forget that most degrees have an extra years allowance - if you do most of the first year but decide you don't like the course you can change and still do a full degree.

Audiologist -- Doesn't fit with any of those degrees
Dietitian -- Again, doesn't fit.

A radiographer is different from a radiologist. You would be working under the radiologist, pretty much as their assistant. Radiology is a very good career, but if I were you, I would go on and be a Radiologist. It's definitely going to take longer, but they make much more.

A radiographer earns about $48,000.
A radiologist earns about $350,000.

My question is: does choosing these 4 prestigious medical schools decrease the chance of me getting in as they are all too competitive. Do u think i should change Cambridge with somewhere like Leeds, Leicester, etc?

Effective Communication Fundamentals
Communication is the complex two-way process, involving encoding, translation and the decoding of the messages. The effective communication requires a communicator to translate their messages in the way which is specifically designed for the intended audience.
Creating and delivering the effective presentation requires basic understanding of a communication process. Most of the business presentations require a clear and an unambiguous communication of the message in the way which can be clearly understood by a recipient.



Tps for Effective Communication



·



Be honest while communicating. Dishonesty will somewhere show up along a line.



·



Take interest in the people you are communicating with. Remember the people are more attracted towards those who have interest in them, and pays more attention to what they say.



·



Think before you speak or put pen to paper: what message you trying to convey? What outcome do you want to elicit?



·



Be direct and not aggressive. Lot of flannelling around can make the people lose interest and miss a vital point.



·



Don't use the jargon – and acronyms, and also the technical expressions, unless you are sure about that your listeners do understand



·



Write the way as you will speak. Do not fall into a trap of using the long words just because it is written down.



·



Take time. Whether in the speech or in paper, rushing will make you seem nervous, unconfident and like downright scared.



Ten Tips for Good Interpersonal Skills



Listen to the person first. Communication is the two-way process; getting all your message across depends on understanding a other person. 
Be interested in people you will be communicating with. Remember that the people are more attracted towards those who have interest in them, and therefore will pay more attention to what they will say. 
Relax. The bad body language like hunched shoulders, fidgeting, the toe-tapping or the hair-twiddling all give a game away. 
Smile and use the eye contact. It is a most positive signal which you can give. 
Ask the questions. It is great way to show the people that you really are interested in them. 
If the other person has different point of view towards you find out why they have such point of view. More you understand reasons behind their thinking more you will be able to understand their point of view or can help them understand your point of view. 
Be assertive. so that we can try to value their input as your own inputs. Do not be pushy and do not be a pushover. Try for a right balance. 
When you will be speaking try to be enthusiastic in appropriate context. Use voice and the body language to show this. 
Immediately don't try to latch to something which someone has just now said ... "oh yes it happened to me" and immediately go on and telling your own story. Make sure that you ask questions about them first and then be careful while telling your story so as not to sound like a competition. 
Learn from the interactions. If you have a good conversation with someone try to think why it all went well and remember key points for the next time. If it did not go well - again try and learn something out of it.
Body Language
We all do communicate with one another through our look as well as what we do say and how do we sound. In fact what our body is doing while we are talking (i.e. the body language) could often play much greater part in the communication than we do think.



Most obvious form of the paralanguage is the body language or the kinesics . This is a language of the gestures, expressions, and the postures. In North America, for the instance, we commonly use arms and shake hands and say good-bye, point, count, express an excitement, beckon, warn away, a threaten, etc. In fact, we will learn many subtle variations of each of the gestures discussed above and make use of these gestures situation. We will use head to either say yes or to say no, to smile, frown, and wink acknowledgement or flirtation. The head and the shoulder in combination may shrug to indicating that we do not know something about the topic.



The eye contact
The eye contact helps to create the better interaction and the rapport with the listeners. Always try to look at listener at the end of the sentence to reinforce a message in that sentence.



The gesture
The gestures can help to give your voice the extra energy and the confidence Try to gesture on some of the key words – this will give the words a greater emphasis.



The Presence
Adopt ‘Anchor Position’ whenever you do want to keep the body language calm and controlled. While sitting do keep the small of back into back of the chair. This will help and support your posture and do maintain the energy and the confident style. Aim to keep the body lan

Yeah you can probably pick up AS Maths but it would depend on your college. Although if you need a full A-level in Maths to get onto your uni course you'd have to do the AS and the A2. You could just carry on at your college for an extra year though, only taking the Maths course and working to make money for uni (for which you will definitely need a lot of money) in your spare time.

Does anyone have any job recommendations ?



im good at maths and economics and ICT.  I was to work in the construction industry but im not so good at physics(although i passed it) therefore that rules out a lot of engineering courses.



Can anyone think of any other jobs in construction which don't really need physics for?

Thanks in advance :-)

What opportunities are there in Finance for a math phd?



I am finishing my math PhD this year. I have been a slave for a while. I don't want to be one any longer. I don't want to take the 40k postdoc jobs that are available to the "best" math PhDs out there.

I know I am smart ... I got through a PhD from a top research U in 4 yrs straight and I will be 24 when I receive my degree in May next year. There has to be a way in which smart people can live with their head held high, without being crushed under the feet of secretaries and assistants who earn more with 2 yr associate degrees.

But my problem is, my degree and most of my education has been in "pure math". I have no internships either bec I never thought I would become anything but a professor. But I want to change now... I want the world to stop looking down on me.

Problem is... I have no idea where to start. I have no idea abt the business world. All i have is a hunch that there must be a way for intelligent people to get paid more than the average secretary. How do i make the start in the corporate world? What are the opportunities and what are the sectors that need smart people but don't pay peanuts?

There is a field called "actuaries".  They determine risks for insurance companies.  Stats are the most important math that they use.  They pay starting out is pretty good as well.  From what I see, 80k+.  Hope this helps.

Does your university offer a pre-med advisor? Make it a priority to meet with that person so you can plan out the classes and the volunteer experiences (like physician shadowing, etc.) that med schools will require of you, as an applicant.



To get into med school, you must first complete a certain series of classes, which always includes:



* 1 year general chemistry with labs



* 1 year organic chemistry with labs



* 1 year introductory biology with labs



* 1 year general physics with labs



And usually includes:



* College level math, sometimes including calculus



* 1 year English

Note that, if you did AP exams and think you could use some of those credits to fill some of these requirements, that's not good enough for some med schools. Some med schools require that you have actually taken the class in college, or to have taken a more advanced version of that class. Again, speak to your pre-med advisor for clarification on that one.

You can do your MBA course from open universities, I think. If you do not qualify for this, do not get dejected. Go on continuing your studies with a post graduation. Try to obtain a descent percentage of 55 or more. Take CAT, XAT or other exams like GMAT if you score well, you are sure to get an MBA seat, provided you do well in the GD and interview.

well frankly speaking india's top management entrance tests viz.CAT,XAT,JMET requires atleast 50%  in graduation to appear in these tests.whereas for SC/ST candidates there is 5% relaxation.but dont worry there are some institutes where the minimum percentage requirment is even less.u can also opt for distance MBA from IGNOU,SYMBIOSIS university which is a pretty good option.u should also see the MAHARASHTRA-CET,MAT,AIMT etc..

anyways if it like the culture... then u can have events that coincide with the national holidays of China. like recently there was the mid autumn festival...u could have had moon cakes, lanterns and stuff like that.

you can arrange for a cooking lesson from a Chinese chef.



Movie night with obviously Chinese Movies...but choose the English Subtitle ones so you actually get to listen to the language.

Have a culture night...you know have everyone bring (oriental) dishes that they made and dress up in the traditional wear...



Thats all I got at the moment.

Good Luck~

Which uni in the U.K offers the best postgraduate program? Which one is more employable? ?



G’day everyone,

I finished my bachelor’s degree two years ago in Taiwan and now I am thinking of doing my master’s in the U.K. Since I’d like to start next fall, I’m starting to look at some unis and just realized there are heaps of schools out there and I’m having the hardest time making a decision. So, as you can see, I’m v. desperate for some advice. I’ m mainly interested in areas such as media, culture, and communication (I had a B.A in English Literature.) and if possible, I’d like to work there for a year or two afterwards. I’m hesitating between Manchester, Nottingham, Leeds, and York. I know lots of ppl just can’t stop raving about Manchester, but how is the job market over there, in the sector of media industry?  What about Nottingham, they have an interesting program in cultural studies but I’ve been told it’s kinda seedy over there. I’m not looking to go on studying afterwards, so which uni is more employable? Would it be difficult for a intl graduate student like me to get a proper job there? I’m multilingual ( Mandarin, English, and French) and I’m more than happy to do entry-level job (admin, for example) and work my way up. Or, better yet, are there any other unis out there that might be more suitable for me? (London is definitely out of the picture since it’s ridiculously pricy for me.) Any suggestions r welcome and will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. :-)

I know from personal experience that all 4 of those universities are excellent! Like all cities they will have their seedy areas, but I spent the last year in Nottingham at uni as a post-grad and loved it.  York probably has the "quietest" night life in the way of big city clubbing, but has a thriving postgraduate community.



Check out the website www.findamasters.com to be able to search for masters.  My advice is do something you can be really passionate about, that doesn't pigeon hole you too much in a small subject area.

It would be very difficult for you to get a job whilst doing an MA/MSc full time due to the changing schedules of your work and the large work load.  Your visa as a non UK/EU student would likely have a work restriction in the region of 15 hours a week anyway.

Hope you decide to come here to study and good luck with your choice!

Ok, here's what you do, from this point, resolve to dedicate your life to the study of time travel and the eventual construction of a time machine and promise that as soon as it's done, to come back to 3 days prior to this exact moment and tell yourself to go into college. Or just do some work after college to catch up, that's what i used to do.

Just say to your lecturer that you're so sorry you've been off, and explain that you feel you're kinda lagging behind with the work, and enquire as to whether or not there is anything you could do at home to catch up, or alternatively, dedicate some time from your lunch break for a week?

If anything, they will be happy to help, for showing how keen you are on the course, and how much determination you've got to pass!!

Good Luck! And I'm sure you'll pass with flying colours!!

Talk to your professor and express your strong desire to get caught up with the work you missed because of illness. Set up a schedule with the professor for getting the work finished that you can actually accomplish. If you missed lectures, ask another student for notes, or ask the professor for a meeting to discuss the key points that you missed. If you show that you really want to get caught up, and follow through with any plans that you set up to get the work done, the professor should be understanding and even impressed.

In the future, contact the professor or another student before missing class to arrange for someone to take notes for you and get assignments for you.

Am I wasting my time studying for an HND?



My tutors at college say that I'm a very intelligent person and that I should go straight to university instead of doing an HND, but I'm not sure if that's for me as I like the college environment and would prefer to do an HND. I don't like the notion of debt or having to travel for miles to get to university on a train every morning when I have the college literally 2 minutes across the road from me. Would an HND help me get a good job, are they worth doing or should I go with the advice of my tutors and go for the degree?

I'm in Scotland, 
Thanks for your help.

No education is ever wasted so if you are sure this is the course you want then go for it. As for employment why not google the job you will be looking at when you do finish and see what qualifications are asked for. This should then help you to make a decision as to the validity of the course

It depends on what sort of job you are planning to do. As far as I understand it, an HND is more for vocational jobs, while you can get a degree to suit almost anything. An HND is equivalent to a normal bachelors degree, while some jobs while require you to have an honours degree. Also, I think you may have to have a job in order to do the HND (my partner is doing an HNC, and he is released from work one day a week in order to attend college).

If you know what job you are looking to do, try searching some job sites and the jobs advertised should tell you what qualifications you need to apply.

Hi,

I'm currently doing an HND at the moment.... the way I see it is, get the HND then the BSc... that way you'll go up the levels and have something to fall back on should you fail a year or whatever...

However, you've got to do what's best for you...



Also, does your college do BSc level as some do, that way you'd only need to goto university if you really wanted to go advanced....

best wishes, hope things work out for you... it's so hard making these decisions sometimes isnt it.

I think that by "city" university, you mean something close like a community college. The advantages to these are : smaller class sizes, less costly, close to home. Disadvantages: don't get the feel of "campus life", can't live in a dorm and see your friends all the time (unless you commute). I think that it's great to start out at a community college if you're going straight from high school. This is a big transitioning period, and you won't get shocked from being on a big university campus. On the other hand, if you're sure you're ready and want the true college experience, go for the university. You can eat on campus, be in sports/activities, make close friends, and have a blast if you manage your time right and stay on top of your studies. For me,that didn't work out because I got too wrapped up in alcohol, staying out late, bars, etc. I wound up back in community college :) Know yourself, research the schools, and find YOUR best fit. Good luck!

I would go for campus because city schools everyone goes home on the weekends. Campus schools there's not much to do around campus, but there is so much to do on campus and so everyone stays on the weekends! Go for city if you love the nightlife/city life though. It's up to you.

Advantages of a city are that you are in the middle of a city, especially good if you can walk home from night clubs fairly easily/safely, also good for shopping. However with a campus you have everything you need quite close together (and sometimes they also have better student facilities. It is possible to get the best of both worlds, for example in Newcastle both campuses (for the University of Newcastle and Northumbria University) are actually in the city centre. Some have campuses which aren't too far, my uni (University of Birmingham) is about 40 mins walk from the city centre, but that means we still have to get taxis home from nights out. Some are really out of the way, Warwick for example seems to be in the middle of nowhere! Most have good public transport links to the city centre though.

Good question.  I think the best way to live and work in your passion is to start a business with what you love doing.  So, seriously, maybe a business degree is a good idea, if you have a viable business that you would LOVE to run, you could study business with an emphasis in entrepreneurial studies.



I mean people make money off of crafts they make, art, writing... etc.  Otherwise try some job shadowing, go shadow like an optometrist, a dentist, a teacher, a scientist.  If you do that for two hours you'll get a good idea of what they do.

Good luck.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



As an Alumni Brother and Life Member of many decades, I can share with you my experience, as an undergrad,  with a Pledge of our chapter. This particular pledge brought his book for me to sign and in the course of a short conversation, I asked a question about the National history. The pledge did not know the answer, and I declined to sign at that time. He re-approached me on several subsequent occasions and, on each, I asked the exact same question, and on each, he still did not know. I never did sign his book, but when I asked if he felt that I was unfair in my expectations and treatment...he said NO, I was not.
At the Brotherhood meeting for voting on pledges, I stated my experience with this pledge and added that while I would not vote FOR him, I also would not vote AGAINST.
Keep in mind that Alpha Phi Omega is not a "social" fraternity, does not practice hazing, and generally does not practice "blackball" voting.
It appears to me that you are sincerely concerned about your oversight and I would expect that, if you apply yourself to the requirements of your pledge period, and demonstrate an interest in becoming a Brother of Alpha Phi Omega, you will find that a demerit or two along the way should not have much impact at all.

What should I study in college?



Okaayy so I'm planning to go into college soon, and I want to get at minimum a bachelor's degree. For a couple years I've been thinking something like Social Work or Sociology, something where I can learn about and work with people.



I have a strong passion for helping others, which would lead me towards social work.. except I want to do it on a bigger scale. Maybe helping one person at a time is all I can do, but I want to help many people. I can't think of any examples, really. I don't need to be famous or make a lot of money, I just want to do something that makes a big difference.



Can anyone help me with some examples of people who do this, or some jobs that might work like that? Thank you!

The thing about making a big difference is, it starts out small, and the more you do, the bigger it gets. If you want some good advice on what you should study, make an appointment with the college's adviser. It's their job to help you decide what to do that will best fit your skills and desires. ^_^

Give the best statement that you can. Simply put, it can be however long it needs to be. But, that doesn't mean write an essay. If I had to suggest, I would say 200-350 words. That's a range, so try to make an "essay" out of that.

Just because you go in to a four year schols doesnt mean that you have to pick your major right a way. It all comes with time. but I would not go to medical school if i didnt like it (which is why im studying something different) College is not like a Job, it is building a career, something you will do with your life. why would you do something to make you hate your life? It's better to be a good carpenter than a horrible brain surgeon

Studying is not about liking of disliking the subjects, but of getting an education. Ten years after you left college, you will not remember most of what you have learned, but you will be an educated person, who is prepared to confront and handle challenges in the real world.
So, make a choice and declare a major that is closest to your interests, knowing that you can change it anytime when you have found out where your real interest lies. If that does not happen, then maybe you are not college material.

Shall i drop out of college? (aged seventeen)?



I've been at college for about a month now, And at first it was a novelty...
I saw my friends and met new people, and the work was ok.
Now i've just lost all motivation, I was off very sick for a week, and when i went back i couldn't get back into the work, i don't like getting up in the morning to go to college..  It's really depressing how stressful or samesame the work is, I'm taking Travel and Tourism, and Leisure and Tourism, The course promised a few trips but the nearest one is in MARCH, and thats to a theme park. I was hoping to see the world with my eyes, not through a screen. Its all computer work see - I'm also taking ICT and Maths Key Skills, But don't get me started on those...



Shall i swap courses, drop out, or keep going?



I'd appreciate any advice

It's possible your bordeom and lack of motivation is just an after-effect of your illness.  Your body is still struggling, and doesn't have the energy that would normally make these tasks seem easy.  Give yourself time to recuperate before making any long-term decisions.



If you enrolled in college just for the field trips, then education is wasted on you, and your career will be a waste too.  The challenge of learning something new should excite you, not bore you to tears.  If you really don't like the subject, then try a different one.  That's the beauty of college - you have an infinite number of fields to explore.  So go find one that excites you.



Still, no major and no career is going to allow you to have fun every single second of the day.  No matter what you do or how much you love it, you still have to put in time doing tasks you don't enjoy as much, because those administrative tasks give you the access and ability to do the things you really want.  For example, if you're going to run a tourism company, you need to know how to calculate travel costs and figure out what is the lowest price you can offer to your customer while still making a profit.  Even if you just want to be a tour guide showing people around exciting locations, you will still need to know how to use a computer to access passenger lists and other crucial information.



This is your time to gain skills - you have the rest of your life to apply them in whatever setting you choose.

Thankyou, I really didn't pick it for the trips - I just wondered why it promised many but the next ones half a year into the course, and a day to a themepark. I probably deserved a verbal slap; But i wanted to enjoy my education, not abuse it.

I'd try and get onto a more interesting course, by swapping one of the other two. Maybe drop IT if you're on the computer in Tourism all the time.



If your college does Film Studies or Media (or Classical Civilisation. I'm doing it and it's so interesting and no coursework) or anything else you're interested in, then you could try and join that.



Hope this helps x

If you're really interested in Travel, keep going - the trips are a bonus. Don't forget your course includes leisure and tourism hence the theme park trip. Did you expect college to take you to Paris or Rome? If so, dream on girl - it ain't going to happen for a while yet. If you've lost interest in the travel and tourism industry change your course, don't just drop out or you'll miss out on all sorts of things.

DONT DROP OUT.  Its only your first month of school.  Also, there is always going to be boring stuff to deal with whether your in school or not, however things are going to be boring and even more miserable if you drop out of school and have to get some crappy minimum wage job for the rest of your life.  Dont drop out dude.  Also, maybe you just dont like your major. The first two years of college are almost like a continuation of high school in the sense that you have to do general education requirements.



Are you seriously going to give up the opportunity to have a bright future cuz your classes bore you?  You're not going to be able to see anywhere in the world at all if you drop out.  Stay in school, seriously.

Hi



Keep going for a while, see how things go, make sure its not spur of the moment. Im sure you hate it cuz ino the feeling, but in the future it will pay off. Alternativly, if its really annoying you in a few weeks, drop out. But plan it before hand, so you know what you're gonna do/ how your gonna do it before you do :) Also, At seventeen it may be best to wait till 18 until you can get a full time job properly....

I am sure that if you know another course which you would prefer to try instead if you are quick in discussing with someone at college, then you would prob be early enough to change courses, if this is what you want to do.



If working in the industry is really what you desire to do then stick with it you may get back into it again in a week or so.



If you were to drop out, could you not gain an apprenticeship with a travel firm and go to college through work once a week.



There are a lot of choices, I once felt like this back in the olde days in my college life I did drop out, I worked I had 3 children, own my own home, car etc.... but I was never happy I returned to study and I am now in my 2nd year at university, I am glad that I dropped out though because I have realised I would have never been happy in the career I chose to go to college for and would have wasted 3 yrs, instead of gaining invaluable life experience.



It is a very tough decision, I hope you make the choice which is right for you and your desired future.

Hello
For details about relevant qualifications, have a look at both occupational areas within the Connexions website at http://www.connexions-direct.com/jobs4u/...



Radiography is split into two career pathways, diagnostic and therapeutic.  As diagnostic radiographers need a degree in diagnostic radiography and therapeutic radiographers need a degree in radiotherapy, applicants must be clear which pathway they wish to pursue before applying for courses.



Entry requirements for both degree courses usually include at least two A levels plus five GCSEs/S grades (A-C/1-3). A range of A level subjects is acceptable, although a science subject is often required; GSCEs often need to include English, maths and science.  Other qualifications, including relevant AS levels, may be accepted, either on their own or in combination with A levels.  For a recognised two year postgraduate course, entry is with a degree (often at least an upper second) in a science or health-related subject.  Applicants are generally expected to have observed radiography in practice, must be medically fit for the role and will be vetted to ensure that they are suitable persons to work with children and vulnerable adults.



For physiotherapy, entry requirements are very similar although usually three A’ levels (at high grades), including at least one science, are required.  Training involves a recognised three or four year university-based course, leading to a BSc in physiotherapy.  It’s also possible to complete a two year postgraduate MSc for those who have graduated in other relevant disciplines.



As exact entry requirements may vary between courses in both professional areas, it’s important to carefully check out details of available courses and entry requirements at http://ucas.com/students/coursesearch/.  Contact the relevant admissions officer for advice if you have any queries.



You might also find these sites useful for information on both careers:



http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/ - see the radiography and physiotherapy profiles on the ‘Careers A – Z’ section.



http://www.radiographycareers.co.uk/ - The Society of Radiographers’ website.

Associates in Science.?



I went to school for massage therapy and earned my AS and well i'm just going to say it point blank the massage business sucks (just my opinion). So I was thinking of just taking other classes and changing my career but I am a bit confused. My diploma says I earned my AS in massage therapy so does that mean say if I choose to go into nusing I wil have to start all over again and get an AS in nursing? Thanks for any help!

Just because you're applying online doesn't mean you can't send them your recommendationn letters. Fax them, mail them, or e-mail them, so that your college gets them. You are allowed to send supplements to your application, like if you want to submit your latest SATs scores.

Is it okay for me to not get good grades in high school since I'm going to be an entrepreneur?



I don't want to go to college. You probably think I'm a slacker student who is trying to take an easy way out, but I'm actually the top 10% of my school.



I really think the stuff I learn in high school will not help me in my career of owning my own icecream fast food chain when i'm older. College seems like a waste of time and money. I just want to get out there and do it.



Am I making a big mistake?



I missed school today because I got in a fight with my parents this morning. I used to feel horrible about missing school, but today it didnt bother me because I have a direction in life now.



I would love to hear advice from you.

Missing a day of school won't hurt you. No need to be perfect; no need to feel bothered by it.



Keep the grades up, because:
1. The more you learn and know, the more it will help you down the line. It's not just for college. It comes in handy at the strangest times.
2. You never know, you may change your mind about college. Best to keep the option open.
3. Your parents will be happier and easier to live with if you do.



No, you don't need college to be an entrepreneur, though it does help to have some business knowledge.



Here's my advice:



You have a business in mind. Start working on it right now. Don't let your studies go, but in your spare time:
--- Start designing your business.



--- Research how to run a business, how to write a business plan.
--- Learn all about ice cream and the industry. What ice cream fast food chains have failed, and why? What will you do differently so yours won't fail?
--- Do you want to buy a franchise or create your own? Research that.
--- Get a part-time or summer job working at an ice cream fast food place.



--- Figure out how you'll pay for it and when it will start paying you back. Start saving now.
--- Figure out when you will open your first place or what steps you'll take between graduating from high school and opening.



You can write school papers and do projects related to this for some classes.

You are definitely making a mistake. Many companies require college degrees from the franchisees. Have you checked to see what type of education you will need to reach your goal?  You will also need management and marketing experience, plus money to buy a franchise. They don't come cheaply. So, how do you plan to make this money? Hopefully with a higher paying job you get after college.

If you think that an education will not help you run a small business, then you are a fool.



Most entrepreneurs go out of business because they don't understand how to run a business and because they are overconfident.  You already match both of those characteristics.



What will you do when your business fails and you have no education.

Yes, you are making a big mistake.
If you plan on running a business, you'll need to know the ins and outs of managing your own business and the only way you can is by going to college as a business major.
You're in the top 10% of your class. Just go to a two- or three-year college for business. You'll be a lot better off since you'll have experience and actually understand what it takes to own and run a business.



EDIT: Your business fails=You lose money=You don't have enough money to "try again and again."

Do I need the Leaving Cert to go to school in Ireland?



I'm a citizen of Ireland, my parents are from there, and lived there when I was younger. I have no citizenship problems, so school shouldn't be a problem in that respect. But what about the leaving cert? My cousin over there was telling me about it. I'm Irish-American so I'm in High school (but I did go to primary school over there). Anyway, do I have to have the leaving cert? If not, how do I apply?

College essay help!!!!?



I am not a strong writer and need help making my essay better. Also i would like to put in my experience of the first time i saw snow in the essay. Please be honest it will only help me out. I numbered the paragraphs.



1. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, “Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.” As a young boy I did not completely grasp the sacrifice that my parents made for me in order to have a better life. What would it take for someone to give up everything they know; to risk never being with or seeing family or friends again? When I asked my parents how they were able to do this they responded with one word, “faith.” Faith was guiding them to a new foreign country they knew nothing about. With no promise of success they made the journey for that one chance to live the American dream.
2. In 1995 my family and I emigrated from Ecuador to the United States. My parents were in their last year of law school and had already established a way of life. They wanted to move to America in order to have better opportunities and to give their son a better life. The move was full of hardships, but with every obstacle we overcame I gained a better self awareness of the person I am today.



3. In the plane that would bring us to our new home was where my first obstacle presented itself. Communication is something most people take for granted in their everyday lives. But, on the plane that day I was not even able to tell the stewards what I wanted to drink or eat. Learning a new language proved to be a struggle. My parents depended on me to be able to translate since I was younger and could pick up a new language easier then they could. Day after day I pushed myself to learn as much as I could with out giving up until I had mastered the English language. It is this determination that has been instilled in me since I was a child that drives me to accomplish any feat that I may encounter in life. The hard work I put into learning the language also came from my parents.



4. From the first day we arrived my parents had to start working in order to feed the family. My dad worked at Dunkin Donuts in the morning, washed dishes in the afternoon at a small café, and at nights bussed tables at a restaurant. My mom also worked hard cleaning houses. After a couple of years, all their work finally paid of. My parents saved enough money to buy that small café where my dad started out washing dishes. Over the years I have seen the hard work of my parents open up opportunities that we thought would never be possible. Their work ethics are reflected in everything I do in life.



5. The work and sacrifices of my parents have truly changed my life. A memory that I will always have is returning to Ecuador for the first time nine years after I left. One of the first places my parents took me to visit was my old house. As I opened the door and looked around the incredibly small house I had an epiphany, I realized how far we had really come, how much our sacrifices and hard work had paid off. After seeing where I came from and what I have become, I now know that no dream is impossible to pursue. To most the American Dream is to become rich and famous. I am neither of the two, but still I feel like I have been able to attain it. To me having the possibility to become anything I want is the true American dream. The United States has given me the opportunity I need and my parents have provided me with the character I need to succeed.

I'd make small grammatical changes like:



"Their decision entailed hardships..." in paragraph 2.



Also, it's very important that you not only illustrate how far your family has come, but also what you hope to do in the future. What career do you want to pursue? How will you use higher education to help the larger community? You make it very clear that you overcame numerous obstacles and risks, but you should make it even more clear how that shaped YOU and YOUR accomplishments. You should give perhaps one specific example, rather than the two/three brief examples you stated.



Writing a personal statement can be difficult. I like yours because it has a VOICE. A specific example would definitely make this personal statement a winner.



Good luck! :]



One more thing...
It'd be AWESOME if you could "tie up" the essay in the conclusion by saying something relating tot hat MLK Jr. quote you wrote in the introduction. You should say something like, "The staircase is there but I'm the one that will choose to take the next step." But use your own voice so it doesn't sound cheesy...it'll sound dope in the end and make a stronger impression on the readers that will be reading HUNDREDS of these a day! :D

I am planning to go for higher studies. For this the educational institution requires me to send them attested copies of my graduation certificates and mark sheets.

Second Exec-MBA Vs PhD?



To give you a little background, I am 30 years old, completed my Exec-MBA  in a top B-school in India(IIM), working in a top IT company. Now thinking about "what next?" in my pursuit for knowledge, I'm not sure what I want to do next. A PhD in Strategic Management(that was my major in my MBA) Vs a second-exec-MBA from another top school.



While a PhD in Strategic sounds exciting, I'm not sure how much it will help me in achieving my goal of becoming a CEO of top IT company in another 5-10 years.



Any suggestion/insight will be definitely helpful. Please advise.

Do you have something that intrigues you more than anything else?



Make a list of careers that you might enjoy and rang them.  If you like helping people then sociology, psychology, health related professions (nursing, X-ray technologist, occupational therapist, physical therapist, physicians assistant, MD).  If you like math, then finance and banking, accounting, CPA, insurance, business careers might fill the bill.

I'm a premed student working on two undergraduate degrees, but I've done tons of research.



there are two different lists for the "Top" Medical Schools. Are you more interested in the research field of medicine? Or are you interested in the primary care field of medicine? The schools posted on either of these lists tend to be the top schools in America, but within the list themselves, the #1 med school on one list can be #19 on the second one -- only because they focus greatly on one subject over the next.



Now, Based STRICTLY on RESEARCH rankings of schools,
Here's a list of the top 25 medical Schools in America:



1) Harvard
2) John Hopkins University
3) Washington University in St. Louis
4) University of Pennsylvania
5) University of California -- San Francisco
6) Duke University
7) University of Washington
8) Stanford University
9) University of California - Los Angeles (Greffen)
10) Yale University

Is telecommunication a useful degree?



I'm majoring in Journalism with a concentration in telecommunication and minoring in Film and Video.  I have always been interested in technology, communication, and film, so it's perfect, but is it a useful degree? I just want to get my money's worth out of college, and if there aren't many positions that demand this degree, I will have wasted it.

It's not really that useful, but it could be a LOT worse. The most valuable Bachelors Degree you could earn is a Bachelor of Science in any field. Telecommunications isn't bad, there are jobs out there that require a Tech. Communications Degree, but I would suggest that you think about a concentration in Technical Writing or at least be sure to take some courses in that field.

If you are major in Journalism,  that more of working with News channel, or other sources in that kind of field. But you don't want to be a telecommunication and be one of those people who call some one house to tell them about a bill or something else. You know we all  dislike those kind of people

First and foremost be a Good Listener. HR's need to be good and patient Listeners.
With dynamic corporate structure, mergers& acquisitions, cross cultural work environment, the Role of HR's have become very important.
Stress in Corporates is taking a toll on lives of people, so HR's need to be people friendly, conversant, non-tempermental to deal with employees.
They need to be  PEOPLE ORIENTED and excellent at Communication.
Enthusiasm and Pro-active HR's go on to become excellent motivators.

A law degree might not be that hard to get......I took a couple law courses before & I enjoyed them.
Although bassing the bar exam is very difficult, I know Cleveland State University's Marshall College of Law has one of the highest passing rates for the bar exam.



Engineering or mathematics degree might be hard to get becaus they have to take math, calc & physics and all that technical stuff.

Well it depends what you're good at doesn't it. I know I could never get a degree in anything scientific because that's just not the way my mind works, but equally there are a lot of people who are ace at Maths and Sciences but would never be able to get their head around something like a foreign language degree.



On the whole though, I'd say for most people anything Science-related would be the most difficult.

Studying in the USA? -multiple queries-?



Ok, I've been studying under the British syllabus (finishing up my A levels) and I think that I want to go to the US for my higher education. I've already done my SAT 1, scored okay (2080, retaking November) , (SAT 2 is gonna be pwned tomorrow =D). My academics have been fairly good, top 5% in the form and all that jack. I'm feeling the application deadline heat... so here is a couple to keep you occupied



-I want to apply to a good engineering school in CA. What colleges are good for my range? (i need a couple of 'safe' colleges as well, so don't hesitate to give good 1s which are not in my range anyway)



-I know every college has its own rules, but IN GENERAL, is the IELTS exam just as valid as the TOEFL for most unis?



-I don't really understand the credit hour system, as in how much is hour worth. I've understood that the A levels are roughly equal or higher to AP classes. If I manage straight As (apparently, its not a light feat =S) in 4 subjects in the A2 level,roughly how many credit hours will it give me? (I take Chem, Phy, Math and Further Math)



-Besides filling an online form and submitting a personal statement, what else does application entail? (sorry for sounding woefully stupid, but I really don't know!)And going a bit off topic, why do you have to submit them NINE MONTHS before term?!



Thank you so much for answering. If you're put off by all the questions, at least answer the ones you know. Saves you time, Gives me info...

i think you have a chance:)
its okay if you dont have your AP scores yet.  the difficulty of your courses show that you challenge yourself academically so this will definately make a good impression on colleges.
you should give it a shot!

What you can do is compare yourself to the students they did accept. This is how the middle 50% of accepted students scored:
SAT - Critical Reading Middle 50%:	600-700 (you're 560)
SAT - Math Middle 50%:	610-710 (you're 610)
TPR Projected Range SAT Writing:	660-730 (you're 640)
Average High School GPA:	3.60 (you're 3.7)



Remember, a full quarter of accepted students scored lower than this.



I'd say you have a chance, but not a really good one. Your test scores are low, your GPA acceptable but not wonderful. Your activities help. An essay that's better than okay would help, too.



Should you even bother? It's up to you. Applying is not free, and you may well be rejected. But you won't ever know if you don't try.

I would take some sort of chemistry courses since make-up is composed of chemicals.  It may be a good idea to intern or job shadow at a make-up company.

Vocational usually refers to some sort of trade education.  That is, not academic.  In the case of a portfolio class, it would refer to technical skills - such as painting, film developing, drawing, etc. - as opposed to theoretical skills.

Which syllabus does Raffles Institution follow ?



it is located in singapore.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The RP offers a seamless curriculum from Secondary 1 to Junior College, culminating in the Singapore-Cambridge GCE ‘A’ Levels Examinations. Since you no longer need to prepare for the ‘O’ Levels Examinations, much of your precious time will be freed up to hone the valuable skills and habits of mind you will need to surge far ahead in life.



The rigorous, yet stimulating, RP is differentiated to cater to the needs of our gifted and talented students. It prepares you for the demands of a fast-changing world where you will be expected to be responsible risk-takers when leading and serving the community and nation.



The RP is modeled on exemplary gifted education principles. The curriculum is based on the Integrated Curriculum Model (Joyce Van Tassel-Baska, 1986), developed for high-ability learners. The key elements of the curriculum are advanced content, higher order process-and-product work and overarching themes and concepts. Socio-economic learning is a key thrust of the RP curriculum.



What you can look forward to in the RP
The RP offers multiple options for research and independent learning. If conducting cutting-edge research is your cup of tea, you can look to dedicated faculty members from institutes of higher learning and industry partners for mentorship.



Character and Leadership Education is a cornerstone of the RP. The cultivation of national consciousness and the development of personal effectiveness and leadership competencies are undertaken in such a way that your experience is always authentic and of practical value.
The Raffles Philosophy course is also offered to all students and aims to nurture a community of inquirers with strong empathy and well-honed reasoning and dialoguing skills.

Forming group study in college is necessary. I am a college student and based in my experience, that studying with a group is very interesting. But, you have also to choose who's group would you like to belong. There are many group of student that instead of studying they just doing anything...Second, if you have doubts, problems, questions, or something you can't understand then your colleague can correct you....each one of you shared different ideas that you never know before...Hope this help you...

You sound like you'd have a decent shot at any of them, but college admissions can be very unpredictable one year to the next.



What you have to say in application essays can often matter a *great* deal.



If there's something that makes you unique or rare for a given school any given year, that can matter too. For example, Johns Hopkins might rarely have volleyball players apply this year, but UCLA might be flooded, or vice versa. Schools tend to like a good mix of who attends and try to strategize for it and most of that is entirely out of your control. It's important to simply be as honest as possible on your applications so you end up where something is truly a good "fit" for you, not just someplace that you think might impress others but ends up making you miserable.



Sometimes a school closest to where you currently live is more likely to take you, sometimes they say college is for learning and you need "diversity" in your life so you should go elsewhere.



Sometimes a school puts a lot of weight on test scores over anything, sometimes they really want extracurriculars, sometimes they want original self-starters, sometimes they say they have too many candidates already from your high school, etc., etc.... and it can even often vary one year to the next where their values are and why.



Anyway, your essays and writing (and recommendations) can shade a lot of how everything else gets interpreted.



Unpredictable.

Wash day or mufti day in my country is a certain day where one is free to wear anything casual. Or simply not a regular uniform day in other words. Usually it is being done to help ease the burden of those students with only 2 sets of uniforms. In my country, wash day is usually wednesday so that the students can was their uniforms and be prepared for it the following day

I don't think that Sheena is "trying to do the bare minimum".  I just think she would like to know what she's in for by wanting to go to a good school like NYU and what to expect as far as a GPA goes.  Sweetie is right though, it depends on the major you are going for. Good Luck!

I have no idea what univasity is. Do you mean university? If so, did you dream about it, or is it 'the university of your dreams' - the one you really want to go to?



If the latter, write about what the place is like, the course, the nightlife, the accommodation, etc.

Is it worth it to get a medical coding certificate?



I am thinking of going back to school, and i want to get a certificate for a better job- I've heard medical coding was the wave of the future?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I am a recruiter for the medical field and every day people come to me with a medical biling and coding certificate looking for work. Here is the problem, no one wants to hire someone without experience. It's really a tough place to be. It's not a position that medical esabilishments want to take a chance on training someone on the job because one mistake takes hours to correct and can cost the practice $$$. In my 4 years here, I have never seen one of our clients hire someone out of school with an externship.



In addition, its a really boring job....maybe you could job shadow someone one day before you decide to go to school

Depends on your chosen field, but as an employer who interviews college grads for jobs, I can tell you that we totally don't care.  1) A future employer will probably not notice.  They want to see the degree has been earned, end of story.  They totally don't care about how/when.  2) There are usually no employer/interview brownie points for "honors," and that can even be a red flag--hyper-successful college kids sort of have a reputation for being lousy employees in the beginning (no teamwork skills, it's all about "them.")



Some professions care about which school...some don't.  Save yourself the money, just get the degree.  And don't under-estimate the importance of going on for a Master's Degree.  That's a more worthy goal than a BA/BS with honors.

I'd vote for the 3 year program. Essentially, once you graduate few employers will even ask about your gpa, transcripts, or your program. In fact in the 15 years I've worked all over the world only when I worked for the Federal Gov't did they care about my transcripts and that was for pay scale placement. Save the money and the time, get your BA early and sink that saved money into a graduate program if that's something you'd like to pursue or start work early to get a head start on paying off any loans or college debt. Ultimately, you will not be hurt at all by doing the 3year program, especially if the only thing you get for the 4year program is a star on your degree, save that extra money and get out of there!

That depends on the classes you took in high school, what college you go to and what your major will be in college. In general, you can assume that you'll use a ton of the stuff you learned in classes you're interested in, and not so much from classes you're disinterested in. College lets you lead your own path much more than high school.

Depends what subject - but what i found is that the first few weeks - up to 2 months..usually its just refreshing the memory period where you look at things you learned in the subject in high school as a whole. Then once everyone has grasped the basis - you go on progressing, however things do ocassionally pop up from high school.



For example if you learned the times tables in school, these will be needed in college as they are the basis to some of the problems you may need to solve in maths.

You DON'T use the silly social stuff...prom?  Fun, but hardly a skill used in college.  Good social skills are a must, but social skills in college are based more in studying together (even if you're studying over a beer.)  Being able to contribute intelligently to a group project by knowing your stuff is more important that "looking cool."  High School academic skills are a starting point, but your college professors won't be impressed by high school grades.  They only look at how you're doing in THEIR class--can you keep up, are you able to build on your learning.  My experience was that I didn't need the high school sense of cliques and fashion, but I totally needed every ounce of academic skill I had--and then some.  You will use everything academic from high school, but college will demand you use it better and learn even more about it. Writing, math, PC skills, logic, reasoning, reading comprehension...all of it at a very high level.  Of course, all this depends on your major...but be prepared for the basic ed classes to move fast and have high expectations.  Good luck!

What is the accelerated MBA program like at MCNY? Can I do this while working a full time job. Is it at night?



I am looking for information about the MBA program at MCNY. Do they require a GMAT? If not, why and does it mean the school is not that good? I work on Long Island and work a Mon-Fri full time job...would I be able to handle the accelerated full time program? And most importantly, how is the school and is it worth it???

You can't be a surgeon in the UK without excellent grades.



Cardiff and Bristol won't be quite as hard to get into as Oxford but still you will need almost straight As



Our phone numbers are like the second example you gave, but if calling from abroad you will need to drop the 0 and add 44

Degrees in life sciences from OSU worthless?



I got a bachelor's degree from OSU, couldn't find work. So, I went back and got a master's (high scores on both, general honors on the first). I still can't find work, even though I'm using a master's (zoology) to search for entry-level jobs (lab tech, etc). Can't get an interview for jobs in other states because everyone only interviews local these days. Can't move before confirming a job at the new location because I'm broke. So, what use is a science degree (basic or advanced) from oklahoma state?

funny you should ask...my husband has a bachelors in psychology and will be looking to attend grad school for engineering.  Most definitely go the route of higher education...there is no reason to go back and get a bachelors..you already have your general education classes under your belt...although you may have to take some additional math courses. The beauty of a graduate degree is that you can get it regardless of what your undergrad degree was in...good luck!

As a career consultant i think best way to get Entrepreneur Management is to get Executive MBA- where atleast 2-4 yrs work experience is essential. ISB [Indian School of Business] -Hyderbad is the best institute in India to pursue Exe MBA. Other to institute also offer programme like SP.Jain Institute of Mgmt & SP.Jain International Centre @ Dubai & Singapore. IIM-Ahamedabad , IIM-Cal, IIM-Bangalore & NMIMS .
But without a single day of work exp. to pursue Entre.Mgmt degree~ you can take IIPM by cracking EPAT.
IIPM isn't authorised by UGC Act. But IIPM-Delhi campus is no doubt an world class

Hey, if you want to study at one of the universities which require the UKCAT, then I'm afraid you would have to go next year - it's not possible to switch courses in the second year as the subject matter you would have covered would be different. No degree courses allow you to do that. You also definitely need to do the test before applying. However - have you considered applying to one of the universities which don't require the UKCAT? They include some fairly prestigious universities eg Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, and probably more that I'm unaware of. If I were you I'd do some research into it as it would be a shame to have to wait a year because of one missed deadline. Good luck!

You can go for the Braford Clinical sciences course, then 2nd yr go to leeds for medicine (if you make it, that is).
Leeds, King's, Georges, Southampton, UEA - have 6 yr "conversion" courses but you usually have to have AAA in subjects other than science i.e. for those who only just realised they really want to do medicine and just picked the wrong subjects. Or Some of them don't accept A Level students though, so have a look at the criteria on their websites.
King's have a 6 yr course which accepts A Levels but you have to live in one of the boroughs listed on their website. (I'm not sure if you need UKCAT for these, but I know King's run their own test anyway so don't know if they would use it)
Some unis in the past didn't want UKCAT but not sure now

Basically I have a choice in majoring in economics with a bachelor's of business administration or a bachelor's of art. I need to know what the different opportunities I will have after college if I choose one or the other.

Please help! i am really tired. IS IT NORMAL FOR A RESEARCH BIBLIOGRAPHY TO BE ASSIGNED BEFORE A ROUGH DRAFT?



In my history class, my teacher assigned us to write a "Research Bibliography for Term Paper," but I don't even know what "Research Bibliography" means. Is that the same thing as a Bibliography and why would the teachers want us to turn in a bibliography before even showing research?
Is this normal or am i misinterpreting this?
I have to turn this "Research Bibliography for Term Paper" in tomorrow (we have NOT written an essay yet...just wrote one paragraph ideas on what we plan to write on:/)
Please help because I did research, but am unsure as to whether I am supposed to write an essay or just write the sources:/

A thesis is a longer research paper, usually done by students seeking to graduate from college with honors.  Not everyone will write one; most people won't actually.  It's supposed to be as a result of working on a research project with an adviser in your department, and may be original work in some cases - in addition to a thesis, you could present the findings at a conference or contribute to a paper.

Cornell has what is probably the most-highly-regarded school for hotel management.  Their graduates are highly sought-after.  No school can promise that you will get to manage a "business" right out of school.  In all those cases, you have to work your way up.  But many companies/stores have what are called Management Trainee positions.

I don't want to hurt you but you really need to learn how to spell if you want to go to college. A degree in management usually opens up a lot of opportunities but you have to complete your studies first and it is pretty boring and dry for some people to study management so you need to consider if you want to learn that for 2 or 4 years.

Community College to Engineering Program?



Hi.



My current plans are to become a pharmacist, but I might change that. I am in my first year of community college in North Carolina. I am currently taking intermediate algebra and won't be able to take Calculus until my last semester of my second year. If I were to become an engineer then I would probably transfer to UNCC. Correct me if i'm wrong, but it seems as if it is necessary to have Calculus 1-3 + differential equations before going into their engineering program. How would this work out for me so I can take 2 years here and transfer?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I would like to say that if you aren't already in calculus your freshman year of college, especially at a community college (much, much easier than state or private school), that you should enroll as soon as possible or re-evaluate your dreams.



I am on the same route to become a pharmacist and I know from experience that one needs an extensive background in chemistry and mathematics. Engineering is based on mathematics and physics.



If you cannot take or handle calculus, I would suggest that you find alternate plans to your career path, at least from engineering. I took intermediate algebra as a sophomore in high school (up to calculus 2 in high school, all passed with "A"s) and struggled with the higher level math classes during undergraduate. I passed them with good grades, but I would suggest if you are planning to become one or the other to step up your classwork.

A degree in English is really about reading and analyzing literature and not so much about writing - except writing about literature.



To be a writer you'll really want a degree in a specialized topic you plan to write about or a generalist degree in either journalism or communication.  At some schools the journalism and technical writing tracks are a part of the English degree - at most they are separate.



Magazine and newspaper writing are not the same unless the magazine is the likes of Newsweek.  Magazine writers tend to have a special area of expertise such as finance or fashion and they are more expert in those areas than in writing.

Yes, they need ll of that information.



They can help use it for career placement, and also if you later decide to transfer they can help you send all of that out. They will especially take it all into consideration for when you apply to a degree program.

I missed class on Wednesday, and since we didn't have class Friday, I didn't know that today we had a test in one of my classes. I did email the professor and told him that I hadn't been feeling good, which I havent been lately cause of the weather changing and told him that I wasn't feeling good.

Ouch dude, I think you may be unlucky on this one unless your professor is really nice. In my classes this semester, test make-ups are not allowed.



This is terrible but if you haven't told him something obvious already, make up a fake obituary of one of your relatives and give it to him. I know someone at my school that did this and it worked. Make sure it looks authentic, though. Only as a last resort.



Best of luck.

I don't know about career opportunities, but I am also looking into PhD programs at the moment and I have found many programs only want full-time students.  I found that several off the brochures and web pages I have looked at distinctly say that only full-time students apply.
In my opinion, full-time would offer you more opportunities for free education, assistanceships, fellowships, living stipends, etc...
And you would be done twice as fast!



According to money magazine (May 2006) both college professor and computer/IT analyst are the in the top 7 most desirable jobs and the most needed in the next 10 years!  So you have a lot to look forward to.  Good Luck!

Both of them give you a PhD in the end, the only difference is how long it takes you to finish it - you'll finish a full-time PhD much faster than part-time (fewer credits a semester).

<answer>



You are paying to be part of the UT system at university of Texas at Dallas.  UT system is one of the biggest and more prestigious of state institutions in the nation and you pay for that name... Similarly you would pay more to go to UC (california) that to go to another university in the state.

English, Finance, Confidence?



i am an international business student studying in Sg. I want to improve my English, Finance Knowledge and do at least "not bad" in my presentation. I also kinda lost my confidence during the period because i dont' speak English well and I look bad and fat for a business student. Any ideas how to raise my confidence up and improve my English??

</answer from>



<answer>



Are you in an English speaking country right now? If not, you should try to do an exchange program. Immersing yourself in the language is the best way to improve. I you are in an English speaking country, perhaps you could get a language coach (or at least someone that is willing to have lots of conversations with you). Or you could try watching a lot of tv or joining a group where you have to discuss things (like a book club?).

yes, unfortunately it is very true. a lot of students don't realize the level of commitment that it takes to succeed in nursing school. students have to maintain a certain GPA in order to be eligible to sit for state boards. it varies from state to state.

Undecided major... help me decide?



i love learning about cultures around the world and foreign languages and i like to travel.  i enjoy arguing social issues- sociology was a good class for me.  psychology was probably my favorite subject but i dont want to go through extra science classes or medical school to get a degree.  i hate math, biology, and chemistry.  i like philosophy a lot.  i love to write and read.  i speak almost fluent spanish.  i like history but don't want to major in it.  i like to teach people and would like to become a teacher but they are not paid enough.  im interested in government but theres a lot of corruption and i dont want to get involved.  i like listening to music although i have no musical talent.  im a very unorganized person, but very dependable.  i like to deal with people but i dont want to work any kind of customer service job, even as a business owner.  i don't want a strictly office job, either.  i hate the telephone and jobs that center around a computer.  i'm pretty active in the outdoors and playing sports but that really doesn't pertain to any jobs.  i dont know what else to write.  i plan on living single for at least a few more years after college so i need a job where i can support myself.

How long thesis defense last?

it depends on how many questions your panelist wished to validate and how fast can you think of an answer. Mine took 2 hours because they were so interested on the conducted research and keeps on asking...



the best thing to do is to inform you next lecturer of the defense so that he/she won't be looking for you in case you could not attend the class

Tickle the roof of your mouth with your tongue.  That's what i use to do.  Have a cup of coffee before class too. The caffeine may help and you may have to use the bathroom.

I hear ya! Had the same problem for 2 years, until I found stuff. you can buy it in most health food shops, or herbal shops, its completely safe. Its called 'concentrating essence'.  You put a few drops into a tiny bit of cold water and drink it, you do need to be taking it for a few days in order for it to kick in, but its really cheap, and I would highly recommend it, and its all herbal too!

We are in the same boat!
Having coffee before class is a good idea. But, it doesn't work for me.
When i am half asleep, it's worse. Nothing could help.I was once in a condition when I don't know the prof was behind me and acting long face at me. If i had to listen to the boring professor, it becomes worse.



That time, i played games on face book for a while and then try to concentrate.

It could be the "math disorder." I recommend taking your lumps and getting your c's and make sure you pick a major that has nothing to do with math so you don't have to take math classes for more than a couple years. This way it won't ruin your gpa.

The story starts with Canada accepting over one thousand teens that have lost their families during the tragic events of the World War II. After required paperwork, they start a new life with their host families across the country. The youth lived atrocious adult lives during the war, but as refugees they were again considered as children. Amongst the many orphans were Lilli, Danny and many of their friends. Lilli was an Auschwitz survivor who saw her mother and sister walk to their death. Her older sister was sent to Palestine. The other orphans whom Lilli met on the ship to Canada were Kurt, Sophie, Sylvie, Max and Danny of whom all ended up in the city of Vancouver to their new families. Lilli was assigned to the Chandler family but could not adjust due to Mrs. Chandler’s arrogance, and after an episode at school, is ordered to move out by her. At her next house, she must do cheap labour and baby-sit at the Davidson. Her desire to go to school and progress are put in danger. Whilst Lilly deals with hard times, she is comforted when the other refugees meet regularly and discuss their experiences. Danny culls to be independent and halt his education until he can provide for himself. Lilli finds friendship which was something she dearly missed, Marilyn, a Canadian-born. Marilyn and her parents expected a Jewish boy-orphan; however, it was delayed to another shipment of orphans. Marilyn does not understand why “the greenies” are not trying to fit in, yet she shows a little more compassion than her class mates. Marilyn and Lilli get suspended from school when they rally together amongst other girls. This leads the Mrs. Davidson to order Lilli to move out. Lilli’s social worker finds Lilli a new place to stay where she must take care of an elderly man. Lilli is offered a week to move out, and she keeps it a secret to Marilyn and her friends. As Marilyn gets to know Lilli and her orphan friends, she invites them for dinner. However, Lilli spoils the dinner by announcing that she is moving out of the Davidsons. Marilyn and her parents have a talk and decide that Lilli could stay with them. At last, for many years, she feels loved and home again.

Is the AFTRS film school any good?



Coz I want to write TV scripts when I'm older and possibly be a producer too, and ultimately I want to go to America since the film industry is much larger there. So should I attend the AFTRS school, like would it be sufficient, or should I travel to America and attend film schools there? I'm asking this because I'm wondering, would there be aspects that would be different if I studied in America as opposed to here in Australia? Like would American film schools be better since their industry is bigger, and stuff like that?

The outer surface of an electric motor steel shaft (0.1%C) is to be hardened to increase its wear resistance by increasing its carbon content. The carbon is to be supplied from an external carbon-rich atmosphere which is maintained at 1.1%C. A diffusion treatment at 981oC increases the carbon concentration to 0.3%C at a position 3.5mm below the surface. Determine the length of time, in hours, of the treatment. You are given that D at 981oC is 2.16 x 10-11 m2sec-1

Character Profiles - Edit please?



Could anyone please edit my character profiles please and make it more sexier? 10 points for best answer!



Character Profiles:



Lilli – Lilli is a 14-year-old survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. She has a vintage hair of cascading waves with bangs rolled back, secured and brunette. Her brown eye suited her hair and has a Caucasian nose. She is amongst one of the lucky Jewish orphans who get accepted to Canada. However, she may not be so lucky. She gets stuck with a snobbish family in Canada, the Chandlers. Lilli appears rebellious to the woman in that household, so she is told to move out. Lilli is an intelligent teenager and dreams of being a doctor. She knows over seven languages. She stands up for her friends’ and her rights and freedoms when Marilyn was suspended for wearing trousers to school by wearing trousers to school the following day and make their point.
Marilyn - Marilyn is a 15 year-old-teenager Vancouver-born Canadian. She has a victory rolled hairstyle, a hairstyle many women adopted after the victory of the World War II. She would put pin curls in her wet hair at night and sleep on them to be styled in the morning. She has blue eyes and oriental nose. Marilyn was fairly grand for her age. She was a typical teenager who followed the latest fashion and attended parties. Marilyn aims to wear vintage dresses with white collar and slightly flared skirts with grown up shoes. She is a very opinionated but certainly smart and courageous teenager. She shows compassion for the Jewish orphans. She discovers that the relationship between the refugees and the local teenagers is not very strong. For that reason, she decides to put up a party and she succeeds. Marilyn like many other Canadians learn the harsh lives lived by the orphans. She attempts to aid the refugees live their new lives and be fitting. At the time, students were not authorized to wear trousers to school. Marilyn and her friends alter that by standing up for their rights and freedom.
Danny – Danny is a tall, gangly 17-year-old Jewish survivor of the World War II. He has lost his parents and goes through psychological stages of missing his family, like most of the orphans. He is an intelligent and supporting teenager whom strived to provide for himself. His hair is cut short on the sides and long on the top. The long strands are slicked back with lard. He has brown eyes and hair. Danny figures that he is old enough to be considered as an adult so he decides to provide for himself and then continue his education. He understands to release the past and continue with the future. When Max is lost he cooperates with his friends and succeed on finding Max.

Should I transfer or should I stick it out? I am a junior now and very lost?



Hello I need Help



I just transferred to a new college from a community college, I thought this was the school for me, but now that I think about it more I think it was really my ex-girlfriend who wanted me to come here (we just broke up a month ago) my classes are hard as **** and I have failed all my first test really badly. My parents tell me that I am allowed to come home and go to a different school next semester and I have been thinking about doing that. I love the people here and the school is amazing, I don't like the way the Prof want to screw you over ( they say "The test won't be easy if you study a lot and read the notes and study more you may be able to pass with a 70". I always thought learning should be fun, if I do transfer I will be going to a lower rank school, but I will be home and I do miss my family a lot.



My question is, should I stick it out and just stress over everything for the next two years or should I follow what I feel is right and leave next semester and go to a school where I know I can do a better job at and not stress or pull all nighters trying to get my work done.



Please help me, I don't know what to do and my parents tell me to do what I want, but they thing is if I leave I will feel like a failure, but if I don't leave I am afraid I will fail out.

It sounds as if you have a lot to deal with right now.  How much of your situation is due to breaking up with your gf?  Some thing like that can really mess with your head in general; if it happens shortly after transferring to a new school, a person can feel angry, depressed or unhappy...all of which can affect your focus and ability to concentrate.  Add in that you miss your family and it sounds as if you have a lot of personal stress.



You wrote that you love the people and the school is amazing.  Why don't you try this for the current semester?



Talk to the learning or academic support office to learn how to learn at your new school.  Maybe part of the problem is just not studying correctly. Take advantage of any workshops they have on adjusting to their school, study tips and strategies...anything really that will give you a better sense of how the Uni community operates.



Talk to your professors if you are unclear about course expectations. If you have TAs, talk to them. Find study groups or a study buddy so you can collaborate.  Try to find people in your program who have already taken courses with your profs. Some faculty are just jerks when they toss out the sort of comments made to your class, so find out exactly what they want on their tests.



If you find yourself stressing over your break up, take advantage of the counseling services your school offers.  Breakups happen a lot during college and maybe talking to an objective outsider will help...I don't think it will hurt. They are familar with all the stressors you are dealing with right now. Almost everyone has adjustments issues on some level and they can help.



I encourage you to stick out the semester and see how it goes.  You might find that as your life balances out, you have a better sense of what your profs want, and when you are more confident in your abilities to succeed there, that you won't want to leave. However, if it still feels 'right' at the end of semester and you want to leave, then do it.



It's great that your parents are supportive. If you do decide to leave, I'd like you to think about this  ...realizing that a school is not a good fit does not mean you are a failure. It just means that it didn't work out the way you originally thought it would. Think about the larger lessons you are learning as a result of this. You are right, learning should be fun - don't spend the next two years agonizing about school.  IT'S JUST NOT WORTH IT ! ! !  Unless you would transfer into a school that is so bad it shouldn't even be open, don't worry about the lesser rank.



Good luck to you.  I wish you well.

I just graduated. I'm currently in a community college due to I don't want to pay 4 grand a semester vs 800 for my general math, science english that transfers to the college 1:1 for credits. Also it gives you a chance at a cheap price to explore different majors you may be interested in. Watch out though, lets say you want to major in culinary, you'll have to take a class on how to keep the kitchen clean basically. So know what you're getting into before you pay big bucks xp

Buying research papers from a reliable company?



Writing a research paper (or any kind of paper) for that matter has always been my Achilles heel when it comes to school work. Everything else is cake but writing always feel like pulling teeth from my brain.



I realize the ethical implications involved in buying a paper but I have decided I'm no longer going to torture myself with this. As such, I want to find a reliable website that is based in the U.S. and doesn't outsource to Pakistan, Ukraine or some other country. I Googled a few sites and all of them seem to have bad reputations as discussed on forums like essayfraud.org and essayscam.org. I also worry that ones that I don't recognize (or aren't listed on essayfraud) are just owned by the same fraudulent sites (which apparently some are) but just under a different way.



Anyone use these websites and have a good experience with them on more than one occasion?

I'm sorry you're having a tough time, but beware. There's software that professors use that scans your paper and will shoot it back as a plagarized work, if certain words or phrases pop up. (They're used to people doing exactly what you're trying to do.)

If you want to know about the club, ask around to Spanish teachers about when the meetings are or who the officers of the club are so you can ask them. You can't just sign up and say that you were in them, because not only is that dishonest but the colleges will usually check up on them if they are unsure.



Also, and this maybe a little late to say, but colleges don't like it when you join a bunch of clubs your junior year. That shows them that you are only thinking about college when joining these clubs and are not really interested. They like to see it when you are in clubs for years, starting Freshman year preferably. But try to actually attend and go for an officer position if you're really thinking about college. It shows that you like to take charge and be a leader.

No, because they'll kick you out of the club once they notice your constant absence.
Bascially, a club is made so that people with similar interests can come together and enjoy and shar that knowledge....



It's true most do look good on college apps but it'd look better if you actively participated and better yet, achieved something IN it; president, vp, treasurer, etc.



So usually, it's the club staff's responsibility to announce meeting time & place... just wait until they announce it and if after awhile they still don't, just talk to one of the members about it...

Based on your question, I can state (despite how premature it may be to come to such a conclusion) that things haven't changed since I went to high school (1992-1995).  Clubs were always fluff for college applications; and you can puff up the fluff by becoming a club officer or organizing club functions.  The funny thing is that there seems to be no real auditing of claims made re: club membership.

there is a difference between being an active member (someone who attends a certain number of meetings) and an unactive member (someone who signs up but doesnt attend meetings). you might want to check with the person in charge of the club to see if and when they really hold meetings.

Please help! i am really tired. IS IT NORMAL FOR A RESEARCH BIBLIOGRAPHY TO BE ASSIGNED BEFORE A ROUGH DRAFT?



In my history class, my teacher assigned us to write a "Research Bibliography for Term Paper," but I don't even know what "Research Bibliography" means. Is that the same thing as a Bibliography and why would the teachers want us to turn in a bibliography before even showing research?
Is this normal or am i misinterpreting this?
I have to turn this "Research Bibliography for Term Paper" in tomorrow (we have NOT written an essay yet...just wrote one paragraph ideas on what we plan to write on:/)
Please help because I did research, but am unsure as to whether I am supposed to write an essay or just write the sources:/

I imagine your teacher meant: "A list of sources you plan to use for research later". So any books you think you'll find useful, given your topic. Referencing page numbers and so on is probably not necessary, they just want an outline of what you plan to read.

Usually people turn in the bibliography along with the rough draft. Your teacher is smart, though.  The teacher wants to know if you did your research, first.  That's OK.



Just write out your bibliography in the format you've been assigned.



The old-fashioned way I learned was:



Albert, Jane. Research is Fun. (NY: Research Press, 1971).
Allred, Robert. Having Fun with Research. (Albany, NY: Beecher Press, Inc., 2008).

Yeah, like others have said, there's nothing at all unusual about this kind of assignment. Professors will check it to see if you're actually working on your paper, and many will also make sure you're not missing an important source or using something that's been debunked. It kind of depends on the professor, but that's what most of mine did when they asked my classmates and I to turn bibliographies in.



Unfortunately I can't help you much with what your teacher wants on the bibliography other than a list of references you're using (by the way, save the bibliography you write now so you just have to edit it later instead of retyping it all for your paper). If your teacher mentioned anything about annotation, then you need a write a couple sentences about each source, listing off the main things it covers and how you think it will be useful (e.g. "This source discusses X theory and defines terms A, B, and C. In addition, it has some pictures and graphs that will help me illustrate my point." or something along those lines). Check over your syllabus, the professor might have written something about that in the syllabus.



My only other recommendation to you is to make sure you get clarification on these things from the teacher a few days before projects are due so you're not scrambling around like this again. It's kind of tough to give you anything more than really general advice without knowing more details about what the teacher said about the assignment. Good luck with the bibliography, though.

its a in-depth book that shows many ways to format your information.  check it out if your library has it, i bought it off amazon for about $20.



this book is more specific towards research paper formatting, but that is what my art history instructor is requiring.

If the University is entirely online (like the University of Pheonix) I think they only hire part time instructors which would mean they dont get paid much for it.



If it is an on-campus based University that offers online classes........instructors have some say in what courses they teach, and maybe they could request to teach some online courses....full time instructors start at 44k/year & require a master's degree.
part time instructors make probably a little over $2,000 per course.

Do you moderate your gaming time while in college?



Hello,



I believe computer gaming can easily become a evil habit. In the past I was occupying all of my free time with gaming, but my problem was I was making more free time available to myself FOR gaming.



Now that college has started I don't play as much, but today I played for about 5 hours, and felt guilty afterward.  To the point where i started considering if I should uninstall the games from my computer or not. Now I sit here not able to fall asleep, thinking that I could have studied more instead of wasting that time playing games.



What do you believe to be the ideal amount of computer/video gaming to allow yourself? or  do/would you uninstall and programs that may distract you from your studies?



</question>



<additional details>



P.S. one of the excuses i keep telling myself is " hey i just spent $70 on warhammer online and subscription, i cant uninstall it now, that would be a waste of money"

I spent counless hours in my undergrad years playing games like Gunbound, Maple Story, Survival project, Starcraft... all games that you don't have to pay for on a monthly basis, making them easy to step away from if i needed to concentrate on my studies (plus it saved me lots of money).  Regardless, while Warhammer online might be great and all, maybe don't subscribe when you know classes are going to be getting harder, ie midterms and finals seasons.  Other than that, it's a good outlet for stress, and definitely a good conversation piece if you can make friends around you in college who you can play with.  Just make sure you get your work done ^_^` THEN play... and get enough sleep too haha

do MCA if you want to become a software professional and join a S/W company.
you can also do MBA. but it is only worth doing MBA in a reputed b-school. otherwise its a waste of time and money.
but i recomend MBA. if you do it from one of the good institutes then your life is set.
but prepare yourself to work very hard for MBA is a tough job!

You can probably get a scholarship at any age, if you are capable of going to college.  For example, if you are gifted, and are 14 or 15 but are capable of enrolling in college and have been admitted to one, it's hard to imagine that the scholarship foundations would not accept your application.  Just get your principal, counselor, home school teacher, or the registrar of the college which has accepted you to write you a special accompanying letter, if that may be needed.

It really depends on the scholarship. Some don't have an age restriction as much as a year-in-college restriction (e.g. you can only get a particular scholarship if you're a freshman/sophomore/junior/senior). Scholarships are usually very good at listing off every single thing that would qualify you for consideration for the scholarship as well as the things that would automatically disqualify you, so check the requirements for each scholarship that interests you. Many schools also have scholarships they give to some students, and I'm pretty sure most of them are free of age restrictions -- I got scholarships like those all through my college career and I was usually 1-2 years younger than most of the other students in my year who got the same scholarships, so I'm pretty sure there were no age restrictions in those cases. But again, you'll want to double-check with the individual schools and make sure.

<question>



Has anyone attended a top law school while simultaneously obtaining a MBA online from a reputable school?



Here's what I'm proposing. Get into a top-20 law school, only work summers (as usual), and take accelerated online MBA classes from a decent school starting in your second (2L) year (first year is just too much).



ASU, for example, has a great online MBA program where you can finish in two years by taking a series of six-week-long classes. You only take one class at a time, so in theory, if you are taking a full law school load it's really only equivalent to adding one more class.



The benefit, of course, is you finish a year earlier than even combined JD/MBA programs. Additionally, you get to take a wider range of electives in law school, not necessarily limited to those that double-count. Also, you don't fall into the "man (person) without a country" syndrome that many complain about, where you become close to fellow 1L's, only to leave them the next year in lieu of starting the MBA program. Then, when you're a 2L in law school (third year), you're kind of caught in between all your former 3L friends and your new 2L acquaintances. Finally, if you pull it off successfully, you will REALLY set yourself apart from your peers in the job market.



Of course, there are great risks. Obvious ones are grades. Sure, if you pull it off, it's great; but lowering your grades is simply not worth it. Also, some employers might view you as impatient, too much of a risk taker, and someone who isn't clear on what he wants to do (business or law)...



I tailor this question to top law school students. Then, I can see this being really to the advantage of students in second-tier law schools who are trying to get into the same big firms (500+, $160K) as those who went to top schools. The school itself won't necessarily be any easier (law school is tough no matter how you slice it), but the benefits are even greater.



So what does the community think?

Do graduate students get any sort of training before they teach?



Im a litle exasperated with the mix of graduate students teaching some of the undergrad classes at my college. They are smart and capable but some have no people skills at all. Or they are rude, condescending, and unorganized. There are some great ones but usually they have some background in teaching or tutoring that makes them great.



Is it different at other colleges? Ay current post-grad students that teach want to share their perspective?

Do I stand a chance to get into these colleges?



I'm aiming for pretty good colleges, and I want to see my chances of getting into these. Here is a summary of me: Weighted avg is about 5.05. Rank 3/550. AP Bio, AP Chem, AP physics B, AP Physics C, Statistics, Calc AB, Calulus BC, Computer Science A&AB, English, Spanish Language, US History, Environmental Science



All 5s. Scores. Literature - 780 US History - 800 Math 1 & 2 - 800 Bio M - 790 Chem 800 Physics 800



SAT score is 2370. 800 Math 790 writing 780 reading comprehension



Clubs - Varsity Cross Country (Sub 18 5K), Winter Track (Sub 5 mile, 57 sec 400, Tennis. Problem I think i have is sports takes up way too much time, I am lacking in clubs. National Honors Society, Deca, and Junior statesmen of america. Have positions in the later 2.



For an average college, I think this is Ok, but i don't know if it is good enough for the selective colleges I'm planning to apply to. How large do you think my shot to get in is?



Northwestern
Johns Hopkins
University of Pennsylvania



University of California--San Francisco
Stanford University

<answer>



With that list of accomplishments you should be able to get into Harvard. Just based on your SAT score alone you could more than likely be accepted by basically any college in the world. The colleges that you listed are good colleges but aren't on the level of the likes of Harvard or Princeton, which you would be able to get into with the resume you have listed above. So to answer your question, you most certainly will be accepted by each and every one of those universities. If not, they're absolutely, positively idiots!

<question>



Why did I get rejected from the sororities at UCSD?



I am currently a second-year student at UCSD. I rushed for the first time for Panhellenic sororities last year as a freshman. This year, I rushed again.



Both times, I got none of my top-ranked six choices, and was only given two choices (my bottom 2) for the second night.



I look completely different now from when I did as a freshman, I was more social in my conversations, I had great, personal relations with the girls I talked to, and I had cute outfits and related well to the other girls in the sororities and in my rush group. I even have many friends in each sorority.



So, I’m very, very confused and hurt as to why I wasn’t accepted into even ONE of my top choices, for TWO years in a row… is it something I did? What exactly are the girls looking for each night, in the conversations, or in the main application, that I did wrong?



I am very confused because I see other girls getting a bunch of choices, and then me having to withdraw because I’m left with two I’m not interested in at all.



So, please, please, let me know and give me advice if you can at all, and also let me know if it’s worth rushing AGAIN next year (as a third-year), or if I’d be better off transferring and rushing at another school.

College roommate troubles...?



I've only been in school for a few weeks. My roommate and I have been getting along fine. But she then invited her obnoxious friend over, and I just can't stand her. She's rude and a bit of a racist. She invites a group of people into my room without really asking permission. I don't want to cause any trouble with my roommate, but her friend is just so annoying. What should i do?

I feel for you. I had this problem my first year of school and the only solution I found was checking with the residence hall people (they dealt with housing assignments and all that) every few days for openings of single dorms (no roommates, solo room). It cost more but it was definitely worth it.

when it's just you and your roommate in your room alone, be very nice and tell her how you feel. if you don't say anything, it'll get worse and worse, and you'll have to deal with this the entire year. do you want to be miserable? if she doesn't take it well then let her cool off, but at least she'll know. if it continues to be bad then switch rooms, which will suck. however the inconvenience of the day or two of moving all your stuff would be worth it, especially if you're happier for rest of the year.

You should ask your teacher.  I just recently graduated and had several classes that I felt uncomfortable with after the first test.  If the teacher is reasonable(which some are not) they will tell you how you can still fair in their class.  If they seem to not be responsive to you when you ask, drop and find a better teacher.

Don't worry. Just stay calm. Be composed. Try to analyse where you have gone wrong. Try to reason out why you committed those mistakes.When once you've found out your errors, just rectify them ok, don't get dejected or desperate. Everything will turn out to be fine in due course. All the best.

Is it possible to gain extra UCAS Points?



I am doing a level 5 FETAC Course, in Business Studies- Secretarial Skills.



I am wondering is it possible to gain extra points out of it.



My course leader says if i get Distinctions in all my modules i can gain 400Points(Irish Leaving Cert). Can i put this towards an UCAS Application.



I would love to apply to University of Hertsfordshire for a Bachelor of Honors in Business Admin. The course is 260 UCAS Points. So far i only have 132 points.:(

well i am a psychology major, and i wanted to do this for my research paper, but i think it's a little racy... if u want, u can take the challene...



well i am an african american student and throughout my schooling career i have noticed certain things about students in the classrooms. when a black student is in a predominately white (or multiracial class), they tend to not participate in class very often. i noticed that when one of my professors was calling roll and pointed out to two black girls in my class that "they are awfly quiet"... they i looked around the room and noticed that besides those two (plus myself), the other 6 black ppl don't say a word in discussions either, while the whites did all the talking. so that made me wonder some more. in my anthropology, psychology class, and other electives i noticed the same thing. it made me look back on my previous college classes and that idea still held up. so i wanted to know what was the reason for that.... so, if u can find a variable to add to that, that could be something you could research about racial identy or how they relate to other races....



to clear the air, im not racists at all or im not trying to stereotype. i just noticed that little detail and wondered why...

Is it possible to withdraw my applications?



Is it possible to withdraw an application to a school almost immediately after you submitted it? I submitted two applications online yesterday, and then realized that I made somewhat large mistakes on the applications! I am going to talk to my college counselor at school tomorrow, but I am very worried about it and was wondering if there is any way to withdraw these applications and then re-apply later. Please help! Best answer gets 10 points!

You can't technically 'withdraw' an application because when a school enters it into their computer system, it will generate a student ID number that is uniquely yours...and filing on line results in an immediate ID generation. That number will always be associated only with you, so when you re-apply, your new application will be added on to applicant file that was originally created with your first applications. The only way this wouldn't happen is if one of the errors was a wrong social security number, but admission offices have ways to match those errors in the future.



I'm not sure from your question if you sent two applications to the same school or sent applications with mistakes to two different schools. If you sent two apps to the same school, all we do is merge the two applications into one and that's it!  That is not a problem for us at all. If you applied to two schools, just follow up with both of them.



(That's just a bit of info about how admission offices work, which may be more than you need/want to know but hopefully it helps to understand what happens when your application is received.)



Now, your real question is can you withdraw your applications?  ABSOLUTELY...you are already correct to contact them immediately.  Explain what happened and maybe you can have your application fees refunded (if you had to pay them.)



You don't explain what the large mistakes were, but if they involved something like listing schools incorrectly or other factual information, the admission office may be able to correct those without you having to reapply.  Those can be corrected by changing data that downloaded from the on-line application.



If your mistake was something like sending in a draft essay with mistakes in it instead of the final, a new application allows you to send in a new one but they may allow you to submit a corrected copy.



Explain what happened. Admission offices are pretty good at assessing situations and really do want to work with applicants who make mistakes.  You sound very sincere and very worried. I suspect they will work with you.



Good luck to you.  You will be fine.

Thank you so much.  The problem was with my grades and how I reported them vs. how my high school can report them to make you look better on the application.  If you can tell me anything else, please e-mail me.  I really hope this works out, and thanks again for the great answer.

Law Degree, Part-Time or Distance Learning, which would you recommend?



I am going to do a Law degree next year, however I am unsure whether it would be better doing it part-time or distance learning.  I have previous experience in a law degree which I did not complete. And I followed that by studying a Diplom in Law distance learning.  However, I have not combined the 2 before.



Can anyone with experience in doing a Law degree either part-time or distance learning give me some insight what to expect.  I will have to work so these are the only 2 options.

i think it would be very difficult to do a law degree without some tutor input.
One of my close friends did hers part time and began a new career as a result.
Some employers will also want to see that you have taken part in events, such as moots, which are not part of a distance learning programme

<answer>



My advice is to do the course Part time, Whilst distance learning is equally as hard, it is looked down on by lawyers,



In terms of work content, you will have your seven core subjects over the 4-5 yrs dependent on how long your part time course is, plus your electives.



Your main workload will be the associated reading, of case law, academic text. Law is very personal study driven, so you get what you put in it, but expect to be doing 16-20 hrs personal reading.



having studied a degree and diploma prior to this your well ahead of the game, as you know most of the work is surrounding assignment, and research techniques.



I don't foresee you running into problems in the first year balancing it with work, but as you know law is not the easiest of subjects and takes time and dedication.



I wish you luck, just don't burn yourself out

No,
It's never advisable to give such a big amount of donation if you can't get a job of nearly 15lacks or more from camous for rest is your's decision.
By the way there are many institutes where you can get admission without giving a single rupee as a donation and after compliting course you can get placement of nearly6/7 lacks.
So think properly before taking any step.......

So far as recorded history is concerned, by the Romans in the 1st century AD. After they had left, successive waves of Germanic tribes settled and pushed the remaining Romanised Britons  back into Wales and the west. These colonists became known collectively as the Anglo Saxons. In the 9th 10th and 11th centuries AD there were raids by the Vikings who colonised the north and east of the country. When an accommodation was reached with them by King Alfred that area became known as the Danelaw. The in 1066 came the last and most long lasting colonisation when William the Conqueror defeated Harald, the last Saxon king and created an Norman-French over lordship

Definately! I myself am doing a phd in IT and a masters in business, so yes! It's definitely worth it. You'll immediately see a $10,000 to $15,000 jump in the amount of money you get it.



It and business is a good combination these days so good job :P
Still, for business and It, experience DOES matter over a new shiny phd, but if you've been working for a company or such and then decide to get a masters or the derivative of it, it'll enhance your chances of getting a great job by an exponential amount.

Always. Even thought youre feeling pretty cushy right now, there will be a time when you may want to shop your options for more money or a better company. Also the job field is pretty competitive these days and education is one of the ways to filter people out. I mean, nowadays, you need a BA to work in customer service! At any rate, if you have the time, the money, and the energy to to go back to school you should. Pretty positive you won't loose anything by adding another another degree to your wall and you can raise the bar for your kids.

It depends on your career aim.If you want to stay in the technical side purely, i suggest you doing MS in construction engg or something and sticking to your trade. This is because once u start a career in management, you may not be sure whether u will be able to continue in your field as you might be offered to work in different area like HR or something. In that case, i prefer doing an MS or MTech. But if you are so adamant about doing an MBA, you may try specializations like operations and system(nowadays most universities offer dual specializations for MBA), both of which are relevant to the technical graduation you have earned.

The only way is practice... you need to apprentice, if you really want to be qualified. School for trades is a bit redundant. I don't care what they teach you in the classroom. None of it matters if you haven't worked on the job. Follow a master electrician around for a year.

If you have key skills qualification that can count towards the final ucas score. Key skills level 3 is worth 20 points and key skills level 2 is worth 10. Gcse is only part of the requirment which is for all subjects, but will not add to the total ucas points.  You can take up to 3  A levels, also two As levels which can make up a 3rd A level.

yeah good. but im not from England so did not realy understand all the A levels etc.

The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is the highest academic degree in most fields, including business.



There also exist a number of professional doctorates in business including the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) and Doctor of Management (DMgt) among others.

It's a PHD. But notice some of the most famous business people have no qualifications whatsoever. ie Richard Branson and Sir Alan Sugar.



These people have grit, determination and an instinct that is arguably  impossible to learn in a classroom.

I went to a community college for two years and now I have transfered and am a junior at my new university.



The transfer process is not difficult, so long as you know the admissions criteria for transfers at the school of your choice. Of course you will have to fill out the admissions application, and then you will have to submit an official copy of your transcripts.



But make sure that you get the bulk of your gen ed. classes out of the way, like the math, science and English courses. Don't worry about the classes that are geared toward a specific major: most colleges want you to start taking the degree specific courses AFTER you transfer.

Will I be accepted to Stanford or Brown?



Normally, I think asking these type of questions online is pointless and useless; however, I'm doing this just to get feedback from anyone willing to give any...I'm a senior now, and I'm wondering whether I should apply early to Stanford or an Ivy? I don't know if I have any chance at all...please be honest.



GPA: Unweighted: 3.94
Weighted: 4.58
SAT1s: 2100
SAT2s: math 790, ushistory700



I'm ASB treasurer, Octagon Club president for 3 years. Tennis and Track 4 years. Tennis captain. Class treasurer for 2 years. Key Club secretary. Various leadership positions in Key Club.



650 hours of community service.



Um...that's the gist of it. It would really be helpful if you were accepted to Stanford or any Ivys. I'm mostly aiming towards privates..please tell me if I have any chance at all.



I took 3 honors, 2 college classes, 4 APs.
Classes like Bio AP, Eng AP, AP US History, Calc AB. I'm taking BC, Spanish AP, Econ AP now.

Fascinating. Your GPA is excellent, but doesn't match up with your SAT score. Overall your in good shape with the exception of a couple things (EC's are solid)



SAT 1: I suggest you retake them and aim for the 2250+ benchmark. A 2100 SAT score and a weighted GPA of 4.0 don't match up very well. So retake it and own it.



SAT 2: Nice on math, USH - Retake it and go for mid-high 700's.



Good volunteering, nice leadership positions...have you done anything out of the ordinary though?



APs - What were your scores on the AP tests? Scores from 4 - 5 (mainly 5's) will help a lot.



Stanford is a reach for anyone especially if you live the golden state. Right now I say its a reach (retake the SAT's this will definitely boost your chances)



Brown - you have a good shot for Brown. I'd say slight reach/match.



Good luck on your college endeavors. E-mail me if you have any questions.

Both Brown and Stanford are ridiculously hard to get into. Kids with 4.0 GPAs and nearly perfect SAT scores get rejected every year. I'm not trying to disappoint you or anything, but it is the truth. Sure, you have a good chance, just like the thousands of other people applying. I think that if you really made your essays stand out and showed some sort of common thread or passion through them, you might have a better chance. Either way though, both schools are going to be reaches.

Well before you go to Medical School, you have to finish up a few courses that compose up what is called "Pre-Medicine, or Pre-Med." You usually take your Pre-Med classes in your first two years of college, also known as your undergraduate years. During this time, the standard course set-up is:



1 Year of Biology with Lab
1 Year of General Chemistry
1 Year of Organic Chemistry
1 Year of Physics with Lab



Those classes are pretty much the backbone of Medicine. Other courses include Biochemistry, Neuroscience, Pharmacology, Biopsychology, Anatomy, Genetics from the top of my head.



Basically, just do well it high school to attend a good college. Medical school really only focuses on your College GPA and perhaps its prestige. So keep your fundamental sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) strong, and you should do fine. Good for you for planning out your future early on.

First, graduate from high school. If you don't like band, don't do it. Do have some sort of extra-curricular that makes you happy.



As for GPA, that depends on where you want to go to college. Challenge yourself with honors classes, if you can. Obviously, the higher the GPA the better, but not at the expense of not ever doing anything other than studying/homework.
Talk to your school counselor about where/how to look at colleges.



Second, go to college. Get a B.S. or a B.A. degree. This usually takes four years. For medical school, your experiences at college are most important. You do not have to go to Hopkins for college to go there for medical school.



In college, talk to a pre-health/pre-med advisor for help scheduling the right classes and choosing a major. You'll need certain science classes, need to take certain exams etc.



Basically: All you need to focus on now is doing as well as you can and graduating from high school. In both high school and college contact the people who's entire job it is to get you into a good college (guidance counselor) and then into medical school (pre-health advisor in college).



Also: it's great that you are planning this so early, but also make sure you plan on some fun too. It is healthy and it will look good on applications.



Good luck.

Should i take a year or two off of college?



i am a junior in high school. i want to go to medical school, but i also play the drums. i love the drums and they are my favorite possession. i really want to try and make a career out of my music, but i don't want to spend 4 years of college with it. i was thinking of taking a year or two off to pursue this and if nothing came of it, then i will go to pre med school. is this a good idea?

bad idea.  you'll get distracted and not go to college.  do both as best as you can even if it means going to school part time.

Is it worth perusing university? ?



Hi,



I've recently decided I'd like to go to university to study Biology. I'm taking Biology and English A2 and AS law. I also took AS physics last year. I didn't do too well with my AS results, I got two C's and a D in physcis, I'm retaking some modules to improve this hopefully to two B's. Or thats my aim. I've been working so hard this year but seem to be getting no where. I'm aware that Id be lucky to get into university with my results. I attended an open day Plymouth and sort of have my heart set on there. I'm also worried as my dad is close to retiring my family can't really afford for me to go to university as I wouldn't be eligible for any grants or bursaries, they do however support me going.



Anyway, I feel like I'm fighting a loosing battle. I'm disappointed with my results. Would it be better to leave it a year and try and get experience/improve my grades or go for it?



Thanks.

A question for people who know about applying to colleges?



If they ask to "Please indicate the number of years you have taken each subject", do i include my senior year courses? I am a senior. i dont know if i should put 3 or 4. For example, i took 3 years of english but i am taking english this year too. would i put 4 instead of 3?

Include your senior year.  People in the admissions office will be looking for what you will have had when you get to college, not what you will have had when you fill out the paperwork.

You should include your senior year. I did this when first applying to college as I was advised to do so.
Also, after speaking to the admissions board for medical school, I was told to include all the courses up to the date I would be admitted.



One piece of advise when applying to colleges... DO NOT be afraid to call and ask the advisors questions, I was a bit timid and wish I had not been as the advisors are very welcoming.



Good Luck :)

I have no clue of what to do after i graduate high school!?



Okay the problem is that I have 2 things i want to to do after high school. I want to either become a Personal trainer for sports of any kind(MMA is my main area to focus in), or to become a directer/producer, basically work with films. The problem is that i have a shitty GPA of like 2.1 or worse. Plus the good schools i want to go to are pretty much not an option because its my senior year and i am already doing bad in school because i just don't care sometimes with the **** going on around me, and i just don't apply myself to it, i just want to start on what i want to do and not focus on what im told. Anyways, i just want to know if there still is a possibility to achieve my main goal of making movies with the way school is going now. The college i want to go to is Temple because my sister already went there and she said i might have a chance to get in because she already graduated from there. I just would appreciate it if everyone could just give me some ideas of where i could go with the way school is going for me. Basically to make it short i want to know all the possible schools i can get into for Film or fitness. Thanks more than a goat cat walking on a string of hair at 5 miles above the sears tower. Seriously though, to those helping me thanks a lot!

Which Cal State in So.Cal has the best History Department?



I'm a history major at a city college getting ready to transfer out.  I initially wanted to transfer to UCLA but my GPA might not be high enough to be admitted.  I could transfer as a Chicano Studies major, but as a precautionary measure, I'm checking Cal States.  So I'm not sure how to go about searching which Cal State has a good History Department.  I applied for Cal Poly Pomona, I know its well known for engineering but again, didn't know where else to apply.

About a recommandation?



I asked to a teacher but not school teacher.



She thinks that I am a immoral person who does not respect elder



... but I am not..



and I just asked to her recommandation.. to write



I think she hates me because .... she just poke me sometimes.



I am afraid that she will report or write on the recommandation I



am a immoral person..



Can she call to university about that and if I get refused from the



university, do they say to me that I was refused because you are a



immoral person?



Actually I was not immoral to her but one of her student..



Do you guys think that she will say that to university by recommandation or call?



Do you guys think If I get refused of that reason do college let me



know?



Do I still need to ask to another teacher to write me a recommandation



instead of her?

Hello
Since you’ve narrowed down your university options, try http://www.unistats.com/  to compare information between the universities and their courses.  It will take a little time, as you need to register and then compile the list of universities for comparison, but it should prove to be a useful exercise.



Check the relevant university websites for information, including dates for open days, virtual tours or feedback from current and previous students.



It’s well worth visiting on an open day for the opportunity to meet staff and students, check out university facilities and find out about availability and cost of accommodation in the university area, particularly for first year.



If this isn’t possible, then consider contacting individual departments such as the faculty for detailed information regarding course content, the careers service for information on graduate employment prospects or the Students Union for information on facilities and student life in general.



Perhaps some current or previous students will also provide you with feedback.



I hope this helps with your query and wish you well in your future study.

How many college courses should i take at once?



I plan on going to college in the Fall 0f 2009. I called my local community college where i plan on attending and i need about 14 classes to take and then i can apply to get into the nursing program after i finish the main classes. So how many classes should i take at once? I plan on working if i have a job but i haven't decided. I don't want to over do it to where i am stressing out but i want to get these classes done ASAP so i can go ahead and get into the nursing program. I plan on becoming a Pediatric nurse

while your determination is great, i would be cautious of overloading yourself. seriously, college courses can require a lot of time, especially if the have labs, and especially if they are medical related. they have the cut-off for full-time and overload for a reason. pace yourself, you will do better and get better grades. nursing programs are competitive and you have to have the grades to reflect your abilities to do it. good luck.

it depends. if you want a job you shouldn't do more than for classes (12 to 14 units). if you don't plan on having a job it would be best to do 5 classes.

Do you think this is a good university for IT?



I am just asking your personal opinion.



Do you think a university that instructs its students to do ONLY programming assignments and nothing else,



and also does not teach adequately the concepts behind IT



and does not give its students a chance to do research on IT can be regarded a good university?



It does only this, nothing else.

Hmmm sounds odd.  I would want a college/university to teach me everything there is in the IT feild and more.  More as in everything I would encounter in the IT feild, like customer service, business, management, etc.
I attend online at Kaplan University.  Their classes make me feel pretty good about my choice in schooling and towards my current and future career.
Maybe look into it?
Good luck.

It really depends on your career goals. Some jobs are available for people with Associate's degrees while some professions can't be done without a Bachelor's. You need to consider what career path you want for yourself because being in school for 4 more years around your age is not easy, I bet.

Well I'm not sure about in the US, but in Australia, most people above the age of 21 will qualify to enroll as a mature aged student, particularly if you have worked in the field you are trying to get into, i.e. worked as a personal trainer wanting to get into exercise science. Some courses don't offer mature aged entry, but most generally do (in aus :).

Seriously?



Well, you need to have an outstanding GPA. MIT is one of the most selective school in this country, plus they have very strict admission 'quotas' based upon your specific region and type of school. Are you from the East Coast? Private school? You need a much higher GPA than your Southern state public school counterparts. It's also slightly easier if you're female.



That's not enough. You need a high GPA with honors courses, AP classes, or whatever the top tracks your school offers. You need a diverse number of extra curricular activities, and you need leadership positions. You need to show that you might be a math/science kid, but you also like history/english/whatever. Think angular, but interesting. Because everyone has high scores and was the president of their math club. Do you have awards? Did you do research over the summer? Are you a Seimans/Intel finalist?



Testing requirements: http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/appl... . Short story? Math (1c or 2c) and Science. Think high scores. 750s or above, you know the drill. Check it out: http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/ac...



I'm guessing from your question that you'd be an international student? Good. Very good. US schools like that. However, remember that applying to a school in the US means that your transcript becomes the most important thing in determining your admission. How are your exam scores? Teacher recommendations?



Frankly, MIT is a very difficult school to get into, even if you are extremely qualified. So do your absolute best, both in and out of school, and always present yourself as an interesting, diversified candidate.

Your masters program doesn't necessarily need to be in the same field as your bachelors degree. In fact, MBAs are specifically designed for people who did NOT major in business as an undergraduate.



If you want to manage people in IT, you can either get an MS in a tech field like computer science, or an MBA. However, an MBA will make it more likely you'd manage people than an MS would. But either one could work.



Most MBA programs either require or strongly prefer you to have at least two years of full time work experience between your bachelors degree and applying to the MBA program. In addition, if you hope to get a job managing people in IT, employers, hiring out of MBA or MS programs, will require that you actually have worked in IT before you got your masters. So if you haven't already worked in IT, I strongly suggest you take a couple of years and work in the field, then apply to masters degree programs.



In addition, if you're lucky, your employer may offer tuition reimbursement, and will pay for all or part of your MBA. This can be a huge deal, since MBA programs tend to be very expensive.



If you decide to go for an MS in a tech field, your #1 choice must be Purdue. It's one of the best tech schools in the US. Your second choice could be Indiana U.



If an MBA, I'd have you look at those two schools as well, as your primary choices. But no matter where you go for your MBA, make sure it's AACSB accredited, or you may have difficulty with some employers coming out. That AACSB accreditation is key.

Time is a very crucial factor. Some  important Tips:



Know your strenghts. Understand which areas u are best at, and make the most of it.
Then turn on to weaker sections, u cannot ignore these, because some Exams have Sectional Cut-offs. So learn to overcome your weak areas with extra practice.

Each day, spend at least one hour on each subject. Make note cards from your notes and memorize them. Go through chapters in your textbook and highlight the important parts. Make note cards on the stuff you highlighted and memorize those too.



Keep yourself hydrated and drink lots of water. Eat a banana and some dark chocolate. Those foods have shown to help boost your memorization skills.



Every night before you go to bed, make sure to skim through all your note cards. You are more likely to remember information that way.



Since note cards can't be used to remember everything, get a list of practice problems from each subject. Try to go through each one WITHOUT using your notes or textbook. It is the only way to get yourself to actually know how to do the problems on your own. Go back and check your answers and then attempt a fresh set of problems.



I find it also helps me on exams if I "teach" someone else the material. Snag an empty classroom and a helpful friend and try to teach the material to them. Outline your notes on the board and talk about them.



Good luck I know you'll do great! Stay focused and get plenty of rest the night before! Don't forget breakfast the day of as well!

Haha I am in the same boat as you, I only have three weeks to study for 4 exams. Just plan your next three weeks and get into a good study rhythm and don't over do it. Don't be afraid to have a break while studying.
