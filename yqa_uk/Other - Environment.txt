Roxy: Sorry, I'm tired and didn't explain myself properly. Basically, the schools are on holidays and there are a bunch of 12/13 year old little bast*ards being a pain in the ar*se outside the local Kebab Shop.

As you probably know, the lbs are referred to as hoodies, not their clothes.

They do crazy things everywhere.We have the Earth Liberation Front doing all sorts of damage in the USA and Canada.Burning down Houses, destroying Vehicles, and Construction Equipment.And the Pollution they generate does far more damage, thus defeating their intended purpose.If they wanted to do something truly radical, they would concentrate on perfecting clean, renewable sources of Energy that would render those that cause pollution obsolete.But they're too stupid.They'd much rather destruct than construct.

Well, environmentalists consider pollution and wrecking  the planet  to be a criminal act, they will often justify their actions by saying they are preventing a great wrong.
Your example of vandalising cars is a pretty poor one, and that's more like mindless vandalism than environmental action. What you should use are examples of events wehre environmentalists have broken into private property to stop or disrupt the actions of polluters. Examples of this include the attempted shut down of coal fired power stations, actions to disrupt major polluters - remember the oil rig they wanted to dump in the sea was stopped by environmentalists breaking the law.

We all know the law is an ***, unfortunately there are some asses out there doing stupid things in the name of the environment too.

Personally, I gave up environmental protest years ago as it was too negative, I now spend my time acting more positively and am a lot happier as a result!

UK based advice on environmental health/local authority action on smelly neighbors



Neighbor makes my apartment smell like a 1950's working mans club. What can I do?
I live in England/UK. My new neighbor seems to spend her day going into every room in her apartment and smoking up a storm. I live upstairs from her and every room in my apartment stinks, as she opens her widow and patio door most of the time when I open my window more smoke drifts in. There is just no relief from it. I don't want to go & speak to her in case I get involved in a face to face argument with her, she is smoking her ciggies in her home which is hardly illegal. I don't know what I can do. I don't have large reserves of cash, to buy & run air purification equipment. The Local Council own our apartment. Can I make them do something to our flooring to seal it off, (her flat is privately owned & newly let to her through an agency, about a month ago).It cant be healthy for me, my kids or even our pets. Please help/advise.

I don't know how you all put up with the weather where you live. In Brisbane (Queensland, Australia), it's mid winter now and even though it's been colder than usual, our temperature every day this month so far has been around 22C (71.6F) with no rain.

Is burning newspaper a bad idea?



I'm looking for environmentally friendly ways to have campfires. I work at a resort on the beach, where I receive numerous requests for firewood, tinder, and such materials. I have wondered whether or not burning newspaper is a good idea.

I was thinking that, so long as the emissions from burning newspaper were not toxic (Or at least no more toxic than burning wood), I could compress old newspapers (We receive bundles of them daily) into brickettes for burning.

A product I've seen is here: http://www.taylorgifts.com/prodetail~ite...



</question>



<additional details>



By the way, obvious answers such as "Paper is just trees" will be viciously downvoted. I'm wondering if any chemicals used in the processing of the paper are toxic when burned, or something to that effect.



After some research, I've come to the conclusion that if I shred the newspaper, run water through it to remove most of any chemicals included in the production process, and then compress it, this should be sufficient to produce non-toxic brickettes. Is there anything else to take into consideration?

Historically, paper was bleached with chlorine, so burning might create dioxins, etc, but not much.  Since you are by he ocean, the most likely source of chlorine would be the ocean water which is loaded with it (as a constiuent of salt).  But all that is history.  Now the paper is bleached with peroxide. 
The ink is just fine.



We used to roll it into log shapes and then wrap it with twist ties.
If you do that, you also burn the twist tie, so you might think about what comes out of that, but it is so tiny, it really wont have an impact.

The other thing to take into consideration is the energy required to shred and compress the newsprint. Another possibility is the combustion products of the non-water-soluble components of both the newsprint and the ink. Perhaps a third factor might be the amount of particulates produced from burning newsprint vs those from an equivalent amount of wood. As paper has a relatively low high-heat-value, I suspect that the particulate emission might be relatively high, compared to wood fires.

Because the law isn't enforced.  Littering is illegal and you can be fined up to £2,000.  Unfortunately, paying street wardens would not be self-financing and the British public always vote for whoever they think will tax them the least.  So dirty streets are one of the costs of cheap Council Tax.

I was thinking exactly the same when I first went to Florida. I couldn't believe how clean the streets were. It just goes to show how people care for the area they live, but in the UK, people really don't give a toss! They just chuck it anywhere. There are a select few who do put their rubbish in bins...but I also think its down to the fact that there are hardly any bins around (well in my area anyway). There should be a bin at least every 100m or even less..that might help. But then that's our lowsy government and council for you.

When I first moved to the UK I used to ask the same question.
I've since learned that people litter because they know that the local councils employ people to pick up most of that litter and so it's an attitude that people have (which sucks) that somebody else will clean up after them. As we all know, most of the litter ends up staying exactly where it's thrown.

trust me, it's not as bad as it was many years ago!! there may be isolated areas around the UK that have the odd litter problem, but it was much worse back in the seventies! do you remember the "keep Britain Tidy" campaign. for a Government backed scheme, that was an astonishing success!! yes, it took years, but it DID work. if the rubbish back then was like what we have today, then it would be making headline news everyday! but sadly, no matter how hard we try, not everyone will care about the environment like we should....... :-(

There was a program advertised on TV the other night (UK) titled: 'The Great Global Warming Scam'. Mind you, the Gvmt have done pretty well out of it with all the additioanl taxes though.

I noticed that too.  I think it is because the American public is just starting to realize the effect of how we live, consume and dispose of items has such a large impact on the environment.



I also know many people personally who truly believe that the "green and environmental" movement is just another marketing ploy by large corporations.  They aren't aware that what they do in their lives, how they use products and dispose of them or what they purchase and how it is packaged can affect everything from natural resources, to energy consumption to land use.

When we had a hot dry summer the other year there were loads talking about global warming and drought. However, as its been pis.... down ever since people are less interested. There is the odd question about petrol costs and the global stocks - how long will they last etc.and of CO2 levels but not much else.



Interest all appears to be driven by what the media say  which is a shame because the newspapers and TV are generally giving a onesided view and rarely cover the full story. Certainly there is a complete lack of scientific argument.

Hiya was wondering if someone could help me???



well my cat cought some kind of lizard earlier today, and i noticed it this afternoon on the grass from the kitchen window and it looked pretty wierd.....so i went outside to investigate and to my surprise it was a lizard, it had pretty bad rigamortis from the looks of its arms and legs and it was a grey colour, it had a very much dinosaur look to it, it had n extremely pionty snout, not like a newt, and a really tiny head comared to its body!? its head was like that of a t-rex but not so curvy? its had tiny claws, and quite a thick tail that went down into a piont? im really intregued as to what this lizard is. i do live near woods which have ponds in if that helps. i really dont think it is a newt as my cats have cought them before. i live in the uk.

Geez, I had no idea so many people showered twice a day. What kind of water bills do you have? I shower usually once a day, though every other day is not unusual in winter. I just don't get that dirty unless I'm gardening (when I do sometimes have to take two showers in a day, but it's more likely that I'll just wait and take one after I finish gardening.)

I take a shower a day. I rarely take a bath. And if my feet get dirty, I wash them in the bathtub as soon as I get home. On days I have gardening or lawnmowing to do, I wait until I'm done to take my shower.

As far as recycling my shower water, I have a well-water/septic-tank system, so the water never leaves my property anyway. It just goes out into the leech bed and filters back down to the water table.

When did people start using toilette paper?



Is it not strange why people use toilete paper at times then other times you have no need to use toilete paper, think about it how many times does a dog need to wipe their anus, or any other animal for that fact? Not even stray muts. I never seen a dog eat feces off their selfs, dont try to use that. Animals lick their Genetilia, not anus. Serious Question. I'm not talking about "Diahrea" niether. Thats another question, what causes Diahrea? All of you propably think its a wierd question but, your liars to. I know what really causes diahrea but I want, "you know it alls," to tell me. Cause alot of "physicians" are BS'ers (liars). Humans can not have more GI tract problems, then stray street dogs. I want to know cause its wierd why people dont want to stop BS'ing (lying to) themselfs. Think about it.

ok Now i get your answer

Well if people is not used to using toilet paper to clean their butt. then if they're home they should just wash their butt clean instead of using toilet paper. Because toilet paper might be one of problems concerning global warming. But if you rinse your butt with soap and water then it would be cleaner and fresher. Less bacteria and it helps decrease global warming...

Every product is made from raw materials and after the useful life of product all will be waste if proper treatment process is nor folowed.  So the product must be produced using least harmful materials and process. The waste can cause major environmental problem and best way to control is to follow this 4 things

Refuse (Refuse the thins causing pollution)
Reduce ( Reduce the waste in its productin process or source like use of plastics.)
Reuse (things which causes pollution but is very important like plastic materials , try to use them again and again so that waste doesn't increse)
Recycle (Finally after all above, recycle the waste which is best way o controlling waste)

So make ur habits environmently friendly, start from today.

It will take ages for manufacturers to "design out" embodied waste in products unless they are forced to do so by law, commercial pressures etc.  The simple example of excess packaging around supermarket products demonstrates this: the supermarkets won't remove this unless they're forced to.

It does happen sometimes: when you used to buy a shirt, there was a mass of pins, plastic thingummies, cardboard formers, celluloid stiffeners, and a cellophane bag with it - all to make it look nice in the shop. M&S have worked very hard to eliminate most of this with their shirts - I'm guessing because it eliminates cost and increases profit.

When manufacturers see reducing embodied waste in a product is good for business, they'll do it.  But they may need prodding first.

Blossom: I applaud the (unwrapped swede) principle, but ... "grass roots" action only goes so far.  For companies to be influenced requires enormous pressure (and time, money, people, skills).



It can be done, if you have those resources at your disposal, but few of us do.



The answer is 'leverage' - apply the same amount of pressure as with the swede but generate greater results. Simple examples - lobbying your MP, providing "stories" for your local paper.  Presenting it as a "win-win" situation (as in the M&S shirt case) is more likely to be effective.



You have to use the same methods, Tesco etc, use when they want to get things changed in their favour.

It's a double edged sword. You shop at the supermarket because they sell the cheapest products. A single warehouse supplies branches across the country and the fresh products like lettuce, tomato or even swede are wrapped to minimise transit damage.

The obvious solution is to source locally produced, but then you are down scaling your crop production to meet the market demand and increasing end cost.

The price of embodied waste is passed directly to the consumer, there is no financial advantage in taking the pins out of shirts, (you are paying for the pins regardless and they are a marketing tool).

It's a no win situation, the objective is to mass sell cheaply. Whilst a minority will source locally, the majority are more concerned with the money in their pocket. The carbon footprint of basic food bought from Aldi and Liddell is greater than the big supermarkets, but the end product is cheaper and locally sourced organic food is out of price range of the greater population.

My thoughts are it's an economic issue and whilst I support any individuals action leaving the wrapper at the checkout means it is going to landfill with the supermarkets unsorted waste and taking it home gives you a chance to recycle.

Nothing is as easy as it would first seem.

trees are good because they create oxygen and because when they decompose they fertilize the earth they create shade which helps animals stay cool and certain plains grow. they also can help keep land in steep areas from falling. many animals and insects also eat trees or eat what lives in trees. without trees most of earths creatures and plants would die. most people would think that they would all die cuz there would be no oxygen but most of our oxygen comes from certain plaints in the water.

1. they take carbon dioxide and turn it into oxygen
2. they provide shelter in many way's ie. cut down and shaped into different shapes and sizes of wood for homes
3. they hold carbon therefore they are great fuel
4. they keep people from polluting ie. a kid will climb it for and hour instead of watching t.v. while using his air conditioning that will just keep blowing because they have windows open countering the air conditioning.
5. they are a good source of food ie. sap &gt; syrup, apples, oranges, other fruits
6. when they die all the little bugs eat them and poop and everybody knows poop makes great fertilizer.

Trees intake Carbon dioxide, which we breathe out, and expel oxygen, which we breath in. The also grow fruits such as apples or bananas which we eat.

Trees are also part of ecological niches.

Job related:
Had  a manager that was alcoholic/drug dependent but very smart in a wily sort of way and no one could pin her on it. She could get very abusive - when there were no witnesses of course. I worked directly under her and had to motivate the rest of the staff somehow. What worked for me was to listen. They really needed support and understanding.

I also encouraged them to do a good job for their own sake. Many wanted to slack off because good performance meant she got a bonus.

She eventually decided that I too had become the enemy and had me transferred out, attempting to get me demoted as well. But my performance at the next site redeemed me.



I wasn't completely OK for awhile, though. I was left with some pent up anger of my own that the next boss needed to let ME vent.



I found out that if we don't clean out repressed anger, it comes up in other destructive ways. Passive-aggressive behavior, accidentally breaking things, bursts of inordinate anger & stress related illness

Are there any schools that have faculty or graduate programs focusing on research with hedgehogs?



I absolutely have a passion for hedgehogs and I am looking into biological graduate school programs since I've already graduated with a BS in integrative biology.

If I had to study any animal, it would be the hedgehog. It doesn't really matter what biological aspect of the hedgehog it is; behavior, ecology, conservation, disease vectors, etc. As long as it is hedgehog related, biological, and interesting, it suits my passion and I would love to pursue it further.

I doubt there would be many studies going on in the states so I decided to ask on the UK forums.

Thanks, and I look forward to all your responses!

Talk it over with your mom, school counselor, doctor or maybe even your dad. You don't give a lot of detail here as to what it is she does or says to you. Could be you just need to open up the lines of communication and talking it over with someone might help...perhaps getting someone to be with the two of you when you talk.



On the other hand, if she is abusing you in any way, talk to your dad and let him know what's going on.



Sometimes, a short vacation from each other is all that is needed.  And keep in mind that things can seem worse than they really are for a teen because of the changes in your body.



I hope this helps you even if just a little.  Keep your chin up.

Don't LIE and make up stories about abuse. Those are HORRIBLE answers. You could get your parents in serious trouble.

Work things out with your mom. Talk through things. You'd miss her if she was gone.

Talk with your dad about your reasons for wanting to come stay. A lot of kids get a real big shock when the other parent doesn't even WANT them to come live with them.

Also, a lot of times, it's a court decision. You can't just go off living wherever you want. Just because your dad is more "fun" or something doesn't mean he's the best one to raise you.

Talk talk talk with your parents.

Privately owned roads are in itself property of a group of people, corporation, or community.  It is good that you were allowed into one without being charge with trespassing.  In large compound or subdivisions, where roads are being maintained by the owners themselves for their own use and to those that they extend this privileges, should behave and follow all road courtesy.  Police cannot even apprehend any traffic violators in any private road unless they are requested to provide assistance, nor can they enter or use them without permission from the owner or getting a search warrant.

In other words, just be thankful that you are allowed to use them and follow all their rules or you lose the privilege.

By the way Crow Act 2000 is only applied in UK and Wales, if you are from this places then you might as well check it out, but if you are from the US, then owners can do whatever they want with their property subject to Environmental restrictions or any applicable state laws.

It depends.  Is your access authorized, as in access to public lands via private roads?  It seems this may be a case of 'let the user beware', or be aware. From the link below:

"Colorado law does not require private lands to be marked, fenced or posted in any manner. Depending on the circumstances, trespass in Colorado may be prosecuted as a misdemeanor or as a felony. Additionally, the Colorado Revised Statutes state that "it is unlawful for any person to enter upon privately owned land or lands under the control of the State Board of Land Commissioners to take any wildlife by hunting, trapping, or fishing without first obtaining permission from the owner or person in possession of such land." The responsibility of knowing whether you are on private or public land is YOURS."

Don't dawdle if there's a guy with a shotgun headed your way.

We get meat bees real bad in our lunch area, so I bought a couple of those bug zappers that look like tennis rackets, and I keep it with us all during lunch. I've killed several so far. (I've got a mean backswing.)

How do you feel about the House voting to allow offshore oil drilling off our coasts unconditionally?



The Democrats lost their backbone due to the elections and went along with the Republicans to vote to overturn the ban yesterday! What do you think? It's just enough away from the coast so that oil companies don't have to pay the states they are drilling the coasts any money to drill and take out as much oil as they want. It's a scam, and will destroy the entire echosystem of our oceans. Be prepared to see more dead seals and whales and oil spills along our coasts.

You act like we are the only ones out there drilling.  There are several rigs out there beyond the 12 mile national boundary line already pumping this reserve.  Furthermore, there are so many safeguards in place in and around oil platforms that setting up a pipeline closer to US Shores will be MORE ecologically friendly than using ships to move it in from further out at sea.  It will also cost less than shipping helping further reduce the cost to the end user.

The only SCAM is the one that the green left is trying to perpetrate.  Almost all sea faring oil spills come from tankers colliding with other ships or running aground.  Pumping out from platforms is far safer to everyone involved, including animals.  Installing a pipeline from closer to shore is even safer than that because no tankers are involved.

Furthermore, any small amounts of oil are contained by oil absorbing buoys and we have now discovered an enzyme that is suspended in beeswax powder that eats oil slicks and leaves the water clean afterward.



Now go hug another tree and make up some more inaccurate 'facts'.

Many Democrats actually don't have backbones. That is why this day in age with wars going on we need someone with marbles.There will be less of a problem drilling off our shores. Less distance for the oil to travel,rather than ship our oil to the U.S from the Middle East. A smaller chance of error in a ship spilling. What about the ecosystem in the Middle East? It's ok to POTENTIALLY harm theirs though right? Why are the Chinese allowed to drill off our coast but we are not? because of the dolphins right?

Besides the ecosystem, we need to drill now, hands down. We need our energy Independence! then we wouldn't need to fight wars in the middle east. Furthermore, then they can kill all each other like they have been doing, blow themselves back into the middle ages and it will not matter to the US of A because our supply doesn't come from there.

Many Democrats say it will take forever to reap the benefits, but I tell you what... If Clinton let us drill back then we would be rolling in the dough right now. In addition we wouldn't have to outsource jobs for oil exploration.

Purely in cash terms, how does the price of nuclear compare to coal, oil, gas etc in UK power generation?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



in terms of original cash output a nuke plant will cost about 3 times as much as a "dirt burner"  However the life span of a nuke plant is roughly 10-20 yrs longer than a coal or oil plant.  So with that in mind you have 10 -20 yrs to recoup the initial out put.  This should bring the cost down simply for fact of the extra time.  Place the costs of the materials into the equation and you now have a variable that is inconsistent and can make the fossil fuel power generators far more expensive than a nuclear plant.  In Cash terms???  Nukes will cost less over time.  Less maintenance, Longer lifespan, Fuel source that isn't in high demand in private sectors and is therefor more abundant or readily available.

I feel bad when anything dies - especially by my own hand (or foot :)
I bet it feels as much pain and confusion as I would if a giant stepped on my head. If I injure something though, I quickly kill it so it doesn't have to suffer. Even ants.

I was in the car and i saw a small, bright yellow spider, with short legs. It was flat and looked like a crab. I flicked it away but it came back again, looking pretty aggressive. I really did not like the look of it at all! There is a possibility that it came from somewhere else because some friends from Hong Kong were over at the weekend and had been in the car.....................=O HELP!!

Likely a crab spider. They live in flowers and ambush whatever comes to feed on the nectar.

They walk across land & ice, swim in the sea.
As the sea gaps get larger they are threatened.

Legal noise pollution limit is for industrial/commercial use.
Human noise( voices) is not in this category.
General limit : Daytime 6:00am to 6:00pm in housing/dwelling areas :90 db for not more than 5min. (Singapore)
Different zones e'g School or hospital  have different limit;
Certified meter recording is required.

My educated guess would be that it refers to the increased immigration of people (whether from other countries or within the country/ state) to the coast. Same thing as "sea change". I live in Australia, and the coastal population is growing a lot faster than the inland population. This is a trend occurring in many parts of the world.

North Atlantic Ocean storms are named by the U.S. National Hurricane Center from preset lists. There have been six lists of names in use since 1979 (List I). The lists make use of names from both sexes. They are in alphabetical order and lists are recycled after six years, with List VI in use for the 2008 season, although the names of notable hurricanes are retired by the WMO on request. All letters of the alphabet are used except Q, U, X, Y and Z.



Gender alternates both between adjacent names in a list (a male name is followed by a female one and vice versa) and between initial names between lists (if one year's list starts with a female name, the next year's list begins with a male one and vice versa).



If the names on a list are all used, storms are then named after the letters of the Greek alphabet (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc.) Greek names, unlike the names in the regular lists, cannot be retired. In case a storm reached the magnitude that might otherwise have lead to retirement, the storm would be listed with the retired names with a footnote indicating the Greek letter would still be available for future storms. The use of 21 names was established in reference to the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season which had been the record holder for the most storms in the region. This record was broken during the 2005 season, which saw 28 storms (27 named and one unnamed), and saw the first use of the Greek alphabet to name storms.

We get these every year in the Northern states.  "Indian Summer" is a brief warming period sometime around October.  September can be cold, and October is colder.  Indian summer can bring temperatures into the 80's so it feels like summer and this lasts about a week.  Then just as suddenly as it start, back into the low 50's for a high.

In the UK an Indian summer is what usually happens when we get a higher temperature than normal in Sept and Oct, when we get one it means that we do not need to put our summer clothes away so fast, I do not think that one is likely this year, we have not even really had a summer as yet.

I proceeded to kick them and they came right out of the ground leaving a fresh spot of wet ground with not grass underneath. keep in mind this mushroom does NOT have a stem and is BLACK...

Disastrous 'eco crunch' threatens planet
29 October 2008 NewScientist
We face an ecological credit crunch far greater than the global financial crisis, warn leading environmental groups.



In the latest Living Planet Report, WWF, the Zoological Society of London and the Global Footprint Network say the Earth's natural resources are being depleted so quickly that the equivalent of two planets would be required to sustain current lifestyles by the mid-2030s.



"We are acting ecologically in the same way as financial institutions have been behaving economically – seeking immediate gratification without due regard for the consequences," says Jonathan Loh of the Zoological Society of London.
etc



richard; "your question should be: How do we organize an economic system that would be sustainable?"
quite so,
but i would have to put that in the economics or politics section, where there are few scientists or even rational thinkers.



linlyons, in my dark moments i share your pessimism, but try to go on "expect the best, prepare for the worst" these days. i think amy's optimism is working on me!



fred; "f these "hidden" costs are included then pollution and squandering of resources would become uneconomic". that's the nub of the economic argument. you should get best answer for that alone, and bonus for mentioning the wonderful macy.

personally i believe that most political powers think that it is black and white when it comes to the environment and the economy. either the economy does well and the environment suffers, or the environment is protected, and the economy suffers. they don't look at the options of eco-tourism, or sustained fishing, or investing in alternative energy to create jobs, money, and protect the environment. i am waiting for someone to be elected that can see the grey as well, it doesn't have to be like it is now.

Economic growth is not the same thing as physical growth.
Resources are finite.  Money IS NOT a resource.  It is a counting mechanism.  It IS NOT finite because numbers are not finite.
Your power law curve only shows existing resources.  It does not show resources no longer in use, or resources yet to be used.
It is theoretically possible to have positive economic growth with negative physical growth (i.e. paying to make things smaller).

Well one can argue that the present human way of life is unsustainable and that something must give. There will come a point when resources become a limiting factor to human life styles.



To say that we are killing the earth is a little over exaggerate. Yes, we may cause the extinction of some species (maybe even our own) but life in its self is very resilient. One just needs to look at all the mass extinction events in the earth's history and see that life prevailed, maybe not as it once was but something survived and repopulated the earth.

The idea of moving from the current industrial growth model to a life sustaining society is well expressed in the work of Joanna Macy http://www.joannamacy.net



this change has been termed the Great turning http://www.greatturningtimes.org



The economic model might work OK if it accounted for all the services the environment provides for free, eg water filtering; waste treatment; flood protection ...
even Darwin pointed out in a very good book about eathworms that the use of chemical fertilisers was unsustainable and unnecessary when nature does so much to create and maintain soil fertility for free http://www.questia.com/library/book/darw...



If these "hidden" costs are included then pollution and squandering of resources would become uneconomic

I have heard that when the move for alternative energy increases, the energy powers cause lower crude prices. Humans being so fickle will stop the advance and fall back into apathy until the next time.

clearly there's a problem.  worse, greed runs the world economy.  what's not clear is, how bad will it have to get before sanity participates in decision making.  if one looks at global warming, it'll have to get quite bad.  not that global warming is particularly evident in many places, but the climatic inertia dictates that if we stopped putting out co2, there would be fairly serious consequences.



our use of the rest of the world's resources is the same.  oil is running low.  not that i'm advocating burning it all, but many are.  we'll have the same problems with other resources.



a significant part of the problem is the population increase.  and China is the only country making any effort to address that problem.



maybe the ultimate question is, will we be able to avoid a nuclear war in the process.  and i'm not optomistic.  consider, today, there are several more, somewhat unstable, leaders (including ours today) of countries that have nuclear weapons.  and once started, there'll be no stopping.

No. Our economy is killing itself. The Earth will change, survive, and change again. With or without us.



I understand where you are coming from, Littlerobbergirl, but i think your question is not the right one. Too often I see people making a false distinction between our environment and our economy. Our environment is part of our economy. It enables us to create wealth, and it sustains our lives. It is as much part  of our lives as a bakery is part of the economy. Depleting, polluting, or destroying our resources is just plain stupid.



The fact that our current organization of (parts of) the global economy is so destructive says something about our quality as economy organizers, not about "the economy". It's we the people that are destroying our own sustenance base.



By the way, by "organizing the economy" i do not necessarily mean communism, socialism, or whatever certain people start shouting once you start to combine the words economy and regulation.



A capitalist market economy does not come falling from the sky. It functions under the conditions of certain rules, such as well defined ownership, and equal access to information.



Lots of rainforest is being destroyed because property rights are ill-defined, or simply violated. Pollution in rising industrial economies is rife because they lack the institutional framework to control factories, or because the public is ignorant about their effects.
Etc.



So your question should be:



How do we organize an economic system that would be sustainable?
imo.

Metal prices have been abnormally high for the last few years.  They have dropped down to normal levels.  The two biggest users of copper are auto manufacturing and building construction.  The slowdown in construction has dropped the demand for copper wire and pipes.  New car sales are down so manufacturers have lowered production.  Sales have dropped in most manufactured goods which has lowered demand for metals.  When the economy improves and people start buying stuff the demand for raw materials by manufacturers will increase.  That's when prices for scrap will increase.

I agree with winterrule, but would like to add: Metal recycling mills bought a buttload of steel at $500 a ton, copper at $3.50 a pound, etc. They have huge stockpiles of raw material that they bought high, and now have to sell low...ouch! This is why Timken Co. stock dropped 30% in one day. When the mountains of raw materials that they have on hand are used up, you may see price increases. My guess would be late 2010.

Yes, you should get a life vest and wear it 24/7. Also carry a big cooler full of beef jerky and bottled water. And you should be continuously taking big, deep breaths and hold it as long as you can in case the ocean sneaks up on you.

L.A won't be swallowed by an earthquake, it's just not physically possible.  The thing to worry about (if anything) is a Tsunami, which can be caused by underwater earthquakes.  This is only a concern if you live in the nice coastal areas of Los Angeles, which it sounds like you do.

Read my sources and decide for yourself if global warming is actually happening.  By the way, scientists are just trying to make a living and when you scare people you get a lot of research funding.  Also, NASA recently amended its temperature tables and the hottest year on record actually occurred in the 1930s.
PS the first site is really good.

The modern environmental movement started with the publication of Rachel Carssons Silent Spring, on the disastrous effects of DDT on wildlife population. I think that was 1963.



Previously, "environmentalists" focused on the establishment of natural reserves. Whereas these first wave environmentalists considered nature as something outside of civilization, modern environmentalists have focuses on the role of human action on the quality of our direct environment, not just isolated forests and lakes.

I would probably not commit a "bad crime" but a series of smaller crimes such as having breakfast in hotels that offer free breakfasts. Even If I was caught, the most time i'd get is 2-3 days.

Honestly, the best thing you can do is ignore this douche, he obviously has huge personal issues if he's finding joy in harassing others. The reason his lame friends join in is because they're afraid of him. Don't be afraid of him, just focus on getting through your school day, and eventually he'll realize he can't phase you and he'll back off.



The worst thing to do is retaliate, it'll just give him more ammo to use against you.
If he is verbally and physically harassing you, you should go as high up in the chain of command at your school and let them know, regardless of being called a snitch, because if he's not doing it to you, he'll probably go and pick on someone else.
The best advice I can give, and I know it's cliched, is to not let it get to you. You are the superior person in this situation because you don't get off on making others feel worthless.



I encourage you to be an advocate for yourself and also those who are not strong enough to advocate for themselves.

If you "sell" back your plastic bottles to the CA CRV, do you still have to remove the caps?



because i was reading that in states without CRV, if you recycle your bottles, meaning they get picked up by a different garbage truck and go to a landfill, you should uncap the bottles. but what if you sell your bottles back for a nickel each? do they still end up in some sort of landfill, and so you have to take the cap off anyway?

No. I just "sold back" a big bag of plastic soda bottles two days ago at a recycling center off Carmel Mountain Road near Rancho Bernardo, and all my bottles still had the caps on them. I haven't done this for years, but the $15 I got will buy a few gallons of gas.

Yes. We have a large recycling program at work, and every quarter they have to have a meeting to remind us to "remove the cap", because they will go to the landfill instead. I think the plastic caps can be recycled in another plastic grouping, but for now, please remove caps first.

Besides via lightning strikes and human folly. I live in Los Angeles and we have a crap load of brush fires, but I still don't know how the hell they even start. From my knowledge, fires start at 451 degrees Fahrenheit, but there's no way that it gets that hot up in those mountains. Or can it?

The evaporation of water in plants is balanced by water absorbed from the soil. When this balance is not maintained, plants dry out. When under this kind of stress, they release a gas called ethylene (which is flammable).



You're correct in saying that 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the autoignition temperature of most fires. However, this temperature is required only because it supplies the activation energy needed for combustion. It is possible that the plants in your area can become extremely dry and brittle due to constant exposure to the harsh sun. Once they become dry enough, a ray of warm sun can set something on fire.

What is happening, is that drought conditions are making the dead brush so dry, when it is dry and brittle, there is some kind of gas that is formed. When the right conditions exist, the chemicals combust.



This is why all of us tree hugger freaks are screaming so loud about the Dangers of Climate Change.



If the Ozone continues to rebuild, it wil hamper the atmospheric cyclone system; meaning no more cool winds coming in the top atmosphere and doing the natural filtering that must happen to bring that healing rain all living things require.



The increasing phenomenon of forest fires, will continue until there is a reversal of the pollutants that are jacking up our environment. Yes nature has some pollutants that cause some changes, but what man is doing is causing nature to rebel against that which is harming her...that would be us.

Animals are endangered because we as humans have destroyed their natural habitat through deforestation to build homes and communities. Humans have also caused species to become endangered by hunting them for game or food sources. Diseases have also plagued some species causing them to become endangered too. The main reasons is because of humans.

Because of people. For example, people can get a lot of money for a rhinos horn or elephants tusk. They have been poached so much that they are becoming endangered. Also deforestation can affect animals too. There homes are being destroyed, and they are being forced to adapt to new surroundings, or they will die. Some animals may have nowhere else to go there fore they will die out.

Because some animals and humans have non-functional genetic mutations that are not flexible enough to allow them to adapt to changing environmental conditions. This called technically a non viable mutation, kind of like those in human kind that are not able to work and support their own existence and need the surrounding community to keep them from dying. This where environmentalists do the most harm to the environment through supporting and maintaining evolutionary dead ends instead of letting them die off naturally as Darwin documented so more viable variations could survive and fill the niche.

Where can I buy empty ink cartridges to recycle at Staples?



Staples gives you $3 in rewards for every ink cartridge you recycle there, up to 3 cartridges a day. I figured it's $270 a month if you go everyday... But where can I get so many ink cartridges? anywhere to buy them?



</question>



<additional details>



They have a new policy where they give you Staples rewards, and not coupons like in the past. With Staples rewards you can accumulate all of it and then spend on something at the end of the month

Cottonmouths, like many southern species, get as far north as the area near St. Louis. Except for the interior of the mouth and the sulfur-yellow tail on juveniles, they look very much like the non-venomous water snakes (which ARE found in Ohio).

I think it helped me alot. I was afraid me and my bf came face-to-face with a cottonmouth. It almost bit him but it's nice to know it wasn't venomous.

Western Cottonmouths can be found anywhere from south Illinois to south Alabama, and from west Oklahoma to West Texas.  So, actually, they're not in Ohio.  But they're really cool snakes and its too bad their habitat is pretty small...

endangered animals can be good if you research an animal in your area(state or province)People have had it up the ying yang with reports on the Panda and snow leopard in Ontario go with Barn Owl,in Arkansas go with Ivory Billed Woodpecker(some ideas)Go with something out of the ordinary
For recycling pick an item newsprint,aluminium pop cans follow the process from pick up to processing to final product make it interesting and pop out at the classmates and teacher

i would say recycling. you can do these and that to save the endangered animals but then if we still compete with nature by doing things to harm the environment it still doesn't make any sense. in comparison, trash does more harm than killing animals. AND everybody can relate in contributing in this problem.

Where can I find a "badge" to put on my website to show that I recycle and am environmentally friendly?



My company is going green and we are doing everything we can to become environmentally educated.  We would like to let our customers know what we are doing by having a "recycling tag/link" on our website and in our email signatures.  I have seen them around, but can't seem to find anything online.  Anybody know of a (real) certified site that can certify us and add a link to our page?



</question>



<additional details>



The link/tag needs to be certified.  It cannot just be an "image" that you cut and paste on the background.  It has to be real and stand for something.

Will a harsh New England winter wipe out the Asian Longhorn Beetle problem?



If not, how can I best protect my trees if they reach my town?



Long story short: One arrived in Massachusetts about 6 months ago, assumably in an overseas shipping box, and now around 2500 trees are dead.

NY or NJ spent close to a billion $$ to get rid of their problem a few years ago.



It seemed to have worked, until more were introduced.



I know whenever we have a very cold winter in Maine there are fewer tics and potato beetles the next year.



Supposed to be cold this winter, so cross your fingers.

I hope your winter does the trick.  That would be ideal, since poisons cause so many other ecological  problems.  There's always the next alternative, which is to bring in some carnivorous little critter that eats the offending critter.  But then, of course, what's to be done about the new little guy when he gets out of control and upsets the local ecology in even more unexpected ways...

"The entire economy of mankind is a subset of the economy of nature" Bjorn Lomborg



These two items are fully interchangeable.
Diverse ecology can, by the nature of it's productivity, sustain a thriving economy. Healthy forests which are well managed can provide endless generations with timber, food, clean air (which has economic costs), and aesthetics. To strip all the trees (liquidate the asset) for a quick return would have long range negative economic impacts.
Over bearing environmental restrictions can stifle  economic progress, such as not allowing power lines to connect wind turbines to the grid (this is really happening right now). Some restrictions go so far as to say if an endangered animal is in the road, you cannot move it out of the way, because that would be interfering with it, and multimillion dollar projects have been stopped because of this.
Here in Florida, if you have Mangrove trees on your waterfront property, you are not permitted to prune them back. Some properties grow so thick they loose their water front, but all too often since the law is all or nothing, the beautiful and endangered trees just go away on a weekend even when owners would love to keep just a few. and I would love to grow native orchids in my yard, but if I did, I couldn't prune my trees anymore, so I only have exotic orchids and a modestly manicured yard.



The following book is wonderful at explaining the unintended negative consequences of well intentioned environmental laws.



Good Luck!

The converse of this question would be more appropriate: To what extent is the economy being protected at the expense of the environment. The elemental basis for all life is directly related to the health of our environment. A group of leading economists and ecologists recently estimated the dollar value of the services and goods obtained from biodiversity as $33 trillion per year while in comparison the world's annual GDP is $29 trillion. For example, are you aware that 50% of all pharmaceutical medicine is derived from a living organism? Yet do pharmaceutical companies give back by preserving tropical forests? Not at all. Think of the environment as a bank account from which we have been making large withdrawals and small deposits. Eventually the account will be overdrawn unless deposit/withdrawal equanimity is established. Mankind is now driving between 50 and 150 species extinct every day! The planet has not experienced such losses since the die-off of the dinos. 67 million years ago. As the great biologist E.O. Wilson adroitly observed: One experiment and only one planet.



By the way, I do not at all recommend Bjorn Lomborg's books as the citations are many times wrong and the point of view is quite biased.

Starting in 2007, daylight time begins in the United States on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November. On the second Sunday in March, clocks are set ahead one hour at 2:00 a.m. local standard time, which becomes 3:00 a.m. local daylight time. On the first Sunday in November, clocks are set back one hour at 2:00 a.m. local daylight time, which becomes 1:00 a.m. local standard time. These dates were established by Congress in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Pub. L. no. 109-58, 119 Stat 594 (2005).



Not all places in the U.S. observe daylight time. In particular, Hawaii and most of Arizona do not use it. Indiana adopted its use beginning in 2006.



* In 2006, daylight time begins on April 2 and ends on October 29.



* In 2007, daylight time begins on March 11 and ends on November 4. [New law goes into effect.]



* In 2008, daylight time begins on March 9 and ends on November 2.



* In 2009, daylight time begins on March 8 and ends on November 1.



Many other countries observe some form of "summer time", but they do not necessarily change their clocks on the same dates as the U.S.



Daylight time and time zones in the U.S. are defined in the U.S. Code, Title 15, Chapter 6, Subchapter IX - Standard Time.

I am interested in knowing who coined the expression "clean coal", what it applies to, and what its relative merits in terms of environmental implications and economic viability are.



Even without having definite answers to these questions, my guess is that the air near a nuclear plant will be a lot cleaner than near a "clean" coal plant, so would choose to live there.  This does not mean that I necessarily endorse nuclear power over other sources of energy.  Issues of nuclear weapons proliferation, terrorism, nuclear waste disposal, and the safety of reactors generally, loom large. Research & development of alternative sources, solar power especially, should go full speed ahead.



I agree with 1st grade rocks that if the alternative energy programs started under the Carter administration had not been discontinued by Reagan (and failed to have been reinvigorated by the succeeding administrations), we would now be much better off.

Clean coal is when the flue gases are treated to removes nasties such and oxides of nitrogen and sulphur, you do this by passing the flue gas through a lime stone slurry, this fixes the sulphur as gypsum which can be used as plaster board, the fkue gas can then be "re burnt" at very high temps to remove any other nasties. Howver, the C02 just goers right out the chimney!!! Global warming ahoy! A better way to "burn" coal is by gasification, the new kid in town, look it up, you can use garbbage in stead of coal. If you are burning coal then it is not carbon nutral source of energy.

"Clean Coal" reminds me of Newt Gingrich,  who devised the list of buzzword lies and usurptions the Greedy Old Pedophiles have used ever since in all political campaigns.



There is no such thing and although the nuclear plants are clean in the immediate (non-waste-disposible) sense, the coal plants won't kill you quickly but a nukular plant could if gone bad.



So, I'll go with a nuke plant with proected clean water ponds/lakes that attract and support wildlife.  Maybe set out some cameras for candid shots of Freddie Cougar if he makes it to the area without getting shot by some idiot.

For one thing, the amount of waste delivered to some landfills isn't sufficient to warrant the expenditure. The army doesn't worry whether something is economically feasible; municipalities, in contrast, must do so.

It most likely means "midges".  It's either a typo or you're reading it wrong.  They are small, biting winged insects that look and act similar to mosquitoes.

You could try to raise some money and give it to the World Wildlife Fund or the Nature Conservancy.  They buy up rainforest so it does not get slashed/burned.

How about suggesting to an organization that is trying to help the rain forest to pay the people who are cutting it down like 2 bucks a tree the people cutting down plant. People are only cutting it down to make money, so if you try to bribe them with money, they will do what you are trying to do. You see, they would not be cutting it down if they weren't going to make money off of it in the first place. So they will leave it alone and plant more for the money instead. Why spend thousands on buying the forest instead of paying them to plant more? It's only common sense I am using.

which one?



the one in south america is cut down, so more cows can graze outside. eat less meat (too much fat and cholesterol isnt good for your heart), drink less milk (too much milk is causing osteoporosis) and dont use leather.



indonesian rainforest is cut down for oil palms, so dont use too much palm oil.



its a problem cause people are going to buy as much as they can. awareness is helpful, otherwise we will have to wait for politicians to take some actions. they are the ones in power.
