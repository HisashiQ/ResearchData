You can either have your hands crossed on your chest, or behind your head.  After you "sit up" you lay back down and do it again.



Hope I helped.

The sit-up is a strength training exercise commonly performed with the aim of strengthening the abdominal muscles of the  abdomen and hip flexors



begin with lying with the back on the floor, typically with the knees bent in an attempt to reduce stress on the back muscles and spine, and then elevating both the upper and lower spine from the floor until everything superior to the buttocks is not touching the ground.
