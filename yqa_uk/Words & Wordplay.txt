If it were me, I would make sure. When you're sure, then just get as much courage as you can and just tell him. There isn't always an easy way.

It doesn't really sound that serious, I mean he's just a guy you've been dating? He's not a long-term boyfriend? Unless you've been with someone a certain amount of time its best not to jump in and say you love them till your very sure, because when you say it you should want it to hold a lot a value and to be taken seriously as apposed to just being a term you throw around. And most people (male or female) are going to freak out if you haven't given the relationship time. Hope I helped, and good luck.

Many neologisms have come from popular literature, and tend to appear in different forms. Most commonly, they are simply taken from a word used in the narrative of a book; a few representative examples are: "grok" (to achieve complete intuitive understanding), from Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert A. Heinlein; "McJob"

This doesn't appear to be a neologism.  None of the words seem new or used in a totally new way.  I guess you could make a case for "whollop" but most readers will probably just assume it is wollop, but spelled incorrectly.  And if Simon were to thump or wollop wildly, it would indeed seem dangerous, so this doesn't appear neologistic.

We are living in an age where neologisms appear almost daily and soon come into common use and are, thus, no longer neologisms.
"Podcast" or "blogspot" would be good examples.

My favorite at the moment is S. Colbert's "truthiness."

Many examples of unusual neologisms that will never catch on can be found in the speech of some people who have schizophrenia or a brain injury that affects the language centers.  An example would be, Carrots contain FRANGITUDES, the things that cause freckles.

The first one, the infidelity is singular, otherwise it would be infidelities. Then the sentence would read "Infidelities are a source of conflict". The other thing is whether there are many conflicts, or just the one, so it depends on the content of the rest of your statement/question.

Does it make any difference to your life whether you know what an adjective/noun/verb/plural etc is?



For example, in writing this question, I have not sat and thought about what verbs or adjectives I have used, in terms of the terms 'adjective' and 'verb', although I have thought about what words to use.

Therefore, why do I need to know that language is catagorised into verbs, nouns, etc etc, what difference does it make to my every day life?

Do you think in terms of these catagories of words when you write or speak, or does it mean nothing to you?

you clearly do know what all these types of words are, even if you cant catorgorise them in your head. It is important if you want to be creative or correct in writing, as you will be able to construct better. Most people can do this without knowing what an adverb is or such.

Nope.
I always found it incredibly useless to know that. You'll find that you have to learn many things in school, just for the sake of learning things that important.

For example: this does help if you want/have to learn foreign languages that you can't "feel" your way around with experience.
It can also help you understand more complicated sentences if you don't have feel for language.

I'm afraid that it is very important that you know what these parts of speech are. They are taught at the very beginning of your schooling to enable you to construct sentences correctly. The fact that you think that you have forgotten them means that you use these parts of speech without being aware of them - a tribute to your teacher!

There is no doubt that one can get on with one's life quite satisfactorily without knowing what verbs, adjectives etc. are; however, knowledge of these categories ensures that as you continue to learn new vocabulary and new ways of speaking, you will not get into too many bad habits. Pragmatics in linguistics is all about suiting the way you speak to the situation you are in. You do this naturally in some situations, of course: for example, not swearing in front of your parents. If you fully understand how to speak English (if you don't know all of the word categories, you don't! You may *speak* English, but you don't *understand* it!), you can separate when you are speaking standard English and non-standard. With this knowledge, you can then alter the way you present yourself to people: something that can be quite important in certain situations, such as job interviews or at work. Your comment to drunken fool is partly right. You can speak, perhaps quite well, without knowing what verbs and adverbs are, but in fact you don't know for sure how effectively (that is to say correctly) you are speaking.

it's sort of arbitrary &gt; if you ask a woman how long before she's ready, it could be anywhere from a couple of minutes to an hour.  But she's going to say, "I'll be ready in a jiffy!"

Nick of time is at the last moment, before some calamity would've occurred had you not acted in time.

"Brand name" is the generic term for products like pens that are called biros, vacuum cleaners - Hoovers and paper tissues - kleenex.
Isn't "Brand Name" the term you are looking for?

In trademark law, it's known as a "generic."  Generics can have two meanings, at least.  The first is an item that cannot be trademarked...for example the word car cannot be trademarked now because it so common.



If I wanted to create a business called "Cars", I wouldn't be able to fight a legal battle if another business opened up with "Cars" in the name.

The second use, and the one you reference, is when a brand or product name has become so common that it's considered the word used to describe the item and not the brand.  Example:  Xerox is a brand, but people say they need to make a Xerox of something instead of saying they need to make a copy.



People say they need a Kleenex instead of a tissue.



These are brands that are in danger of becoming generics.  Some items that are already generics that were once brands:  Aspirin and Nylon.  Companies can protect their trademark on a brand by fighting those who use the names generically, and by requiring people to use a registered trademark symbol when the word is used.

Follow up question...........



I always thought you put a comma in these cases.

I went to the store, and i bought loads .



.Is that correct? I know you can also do this to the same sentence

I went to the store; i bought loads. or



I went to the store; therefore,i bought loads.

Is the first sentence wrong? i thought you needed a comma before the word and.

it is quite depend on the sense when somebody is saying that. that comma in this sentence 'i went to the store, and i bought loads.' is not an essential one. it is also can be written, 'i went to the store and i bought loads' grammatically. we put the comma in there normally when we are writing in the style of speaking.



and in the second case, that semicolon ';' is to show that the fist sentence is finished but also can be written continue with the next following sentence. that means, you can assume 'I went to the store. I bought loads' or 'I went to the store, I bought loads.' 
cheers

However, it is correct.

i think you would just put 'I went to the store and I bought loads', because there, no reason for a comma is given-because they can both stand alone as their own sentences. I think it has to do with clauses or gerunds or something like that. I've forgotten over the hot summer months though...but I am pretty sure that the correct way is: 'I went to the store and I bought loads.' An example in which you would need a comma before the 'and' (which you may be confusing this with) would be: 'I went to the store, bought loads, and went home.' Or 'Going to the store, I bought loads.' is another example. Sorry if I haven't helped you at all, though I hoped to have done so!! ;)

P.R. also is the abbreviation for Puerto Rico or Puerto Rican.  Of course,  there's nothing illegal about being Puerto Rican.  But 'getting arrested abroad' may or may not imply that one has done something illegal.  There are plenty of prejudiced people in the world and perhaps that is what the poster was alluding to.

PR can stand for lots of things. Anything from Personal Representative to Poppy Rammer (person who smuggles drugs - usually heroin - upon or within their person.) Within the context it is difficult to say. Many things that are both legal and allowed by the authorities in one country might be suppressed in another.

Interestingly enough, this question is not as absurd as some might think.



But "how" shouldn't be "whow". The reason is that the other words were originally "hwaer", "hwen", "hwaet" and so on. Over time, the spelling representing the sound "hw" became changed or transposed to "wh", even although the "hw" better represents the sound made. "How" was never "hwow" and could therefore never be "whow".

Chain letters????????????????



A lot of people on MySpace post chain letters saying that your going to die or have bad luck if you don't re post this in a certain amount of time. So I never re post them and nothing ever happens so I know that they are completely  untrue or at least some of it is untrue. I read one that said if you don't re post this the poster has a tracker that can track down your address and where you live and he will come and kill you. Is there any possible way that someone could do that. Hahah I know this is a stupid question but I'm just wondering. I still didn't re post it because I hate those things. Thanks =)!

There is no way for any chain letter to do what it says. The original writer of the chain letter would have no idea who is posting what, and where. Don't forward them - they're just annoying.

No, the only purpose of chain e-mails is to create online chaos.  It started with Internet old-timers who blamed AOL for ruining the Internet by making it too easily accessible.  They started looking for ways to overload the mail servers, and chain e-mails were born.  If everyone who received one actually sent it to 10 people or whatever the instructions say, the number of e-mails generated would be astronomical, and it could be enough to overload some mail servers.  I always just ignore those e-mails.

It sounds like you're having a really tough time. Try talking things through with someone; your boyfriend, your parents, another member of your family. Don't suffer alone. It's good that you've at least told someone about it; self harm is not a good thing (I know, I've been there) and all you can do is find some other method of escape. I find reading helps a lot .. I've been having a pretty sh*t week and so I've started reading loads to try and get my mind off things.

All in all, it will get better, you just have to get through the bad stuff.

I am pretty sure this is the wrong section but oh well...
You have a fmaily history of mental disorders. Nothing to be ashamed of. That tells me your chances of having the same or other disorder is 50%. If what you are saying is true, you have a disorder much like depression. What you need is PROFESSIONAL help. Yahoo answers is not where you will find it. Happiness is available, but not on the web. Sorry.
However, it is not far away. A phone call gets things going to a local doctor-even a medical doctor can help you find the avenue you need to right your ship.
I am sure your boyfiren is great, but you have to be solid before you can really appreciate a lasting relationship. If you are saying you will commit suicide if he leaves, that will increase the stress in your life and his, thus causing strain on the relationship.
Get help and do not be afraid of getting meds. Lots of great people take medications to balance themselves out.

Hi, please understand, don't ever think about ending life, not eating causes hormone fluctuations that can make you think this way.
I can`t stress this enough, seek out a dietian from a gym or from the phone book, make an apointment and chat with them about your feelings and let them show you how to eat to avoid this. The best part about learning about nutrition is that you learn to cook better, meaning you get to eat deliciuos food while not gaining excess, so pickup some books. 
Not even to mention any man will value this lol. The old saying has some merit "The way to a mans heart is through his stomach" Ha
You`ll soon realize negative thoughts were can be caused by eating improperly.



After that, try to find a subject that you enjoy, something that you really think is cool. Writing poems, music etc... maybe a sport, maybe going to the gym, taking a course is always great (I luv exercising and then cooking delicious food). Taking personal interest courses is so good because we end up meeting people that are like ourselves at the course. Anyway the human mind seems to thrive from evolving or growing, in order to do that, that requires learning, daily, try it, try to learn one thing a day even its just a trival question. Read a good book on poetry and finish it, you`ll mysteriously feel good. If we don`t learn, we constantly circulate the the same info around the brain, this is frusterates the mind as its a learning machine that feeds from getting new information. 
The best to you, take care.

It sounds like you have a lot of things you are worried about.

It's good that you have an outlet in poetry and music. It's great to have something to turn to that can help you release some of those built up feelings.

If you aren't happy with your appearance, that's hard. But, just know that we all aren't in some way....I was always very thin when I was growing up and my friends made fun of me for that! So, I think we all want to be different than we are in some way. I would work on changing what you can control...and do your best to let go of what you can't...seems hard or impossible, but what can we do? We're all in the same boat in one way or another....even if we have different things we don't like about ourselves. We all don't like something.

If you are at all feeling suicidal, PLEASE talk to someone about it. You can even call an anonymous help line, like the Samaritans. Or talk to a school councilor or teacher, or friend or anyone! It's just important that you get help for something like that.



When we have change in our life, it's normal to feel overwhelmed. Moving to a different country and being separated from your family is pretty difficult. But, please don't base your happiness on other people though...like with your boyfriend, for example. Until you are ready and old enough to get married it's cool to just group date and have fun! You shouldn't worry about a boyfriend that much when you are 17! Trust me....I was 17 a few short years ago and now that I am happily married, I realize that most of the guys I dated were just preparing me to know what to look for...and NOT to look for when I found my husband. We dwell on our friends/boyfriends a lot as teenagers...but then we get older and grow up and realize none of it was as detrimental to life as we thought. Family/spousal relationships are most important. If we were able to realize that as teenagers more....it would be a lot simpler.



As someone in my mid-20's I'm young enough to remember what it was like when I was your age, but old enough to know there are things that will probably become important later, that you never realized you would care so much about. So, I hope you start looking forward to things like college and setting goals and planning what you want in life now. You should be looking forward to the things you will get to do in the near future. That may give you some hope and direction....if you have some goals you are setting and working towards.

Do you think you would be able to talk to a councilor or therapist? It's really helpful to talk to someone like this to work out some of the things that are bothering you. Even for a short while. You will learn a lot of strategies that can help you cope with your problems.

Just know that even though you may not like your situation now, there is the ability to change it and build your own life and future that will make you happy, if you are willing to work at making good choices that will allow you to do so. Find what you believe in and what motivates you to try to be better.

Good luck.

Please don't kill yourself.  I don't think being 5 feet tall and 8 stone is such a terrible thing.  Most of us have had to stop and re-assess what we thought was important in our lives at some time, and it sounds like you've reached one of those points.  Being thin does not equal being happy, it just means a great deal more worrying about how to stay thin (and worrying about dieting 24/7).



You're separated from the people and places you know best, and everything feels unfamiliar.  I can't solve the problem, but I can tell you how I dealt with the homesickness part.  I just dealt with it one day at a time.  I suppose if I had smiled a bit more, I would have found friends more quickly, but I didn't.  I spent a miserable few months until I found someone else who seemed to be just as miserable as I was, and we each tried to prove we were more miserable and unwanted and misunderstood than the other.



I can't look back and see exactly where it ended, but it did.
Everyone has "something" wrong with them, probably I should have said "things".  Mostly, they just learn to deal with it.  Those who say they don't are liars.
One last thing that I think deserves capital letters.

DON'T LET GLOSSY MAGAZINES TELL YOU WHAT VALUES YOU SHOULD HAVE.
The main reason they sell is because they are full of apparently beautiful people leading apparently perfect lives, the publishers know this and cash in on it.
Start talking to people again, even if it means giving up listening to music 24/7, and try to give any conversations you have your full attention.  People are happier if you seem interested.



Just take it one day at a time.  Good luck.

Sometimes you need to let yourself feel down and then have a good cry. But to help yourself carry on you need to train yourself to be a genuine positive thinker, even if it doesn't cure how your feeling completely it can only help that you look for the good in situations. Besides that talking can really help. Talk about your problems and keep looking for a solution, don't moan too much because that won't solve anything. People feel like you do all the time, once you realise that your not alone at all, and that in fact all those people who feel like you also think their alone, you won't so isolated. You want to be happy? Think of ways you could be happy. What do you want out of life? Your here, so you may as well enjoy the experience rather than punishing yourself with thoughts of death. Try to take life less seriously, just walk with the punches, take the bad bits and move on, that's all you can do. Obviously you can't force yourself to be happy when your sad, but you can try and help yourself by working things out, looking forward, being positive and more laid back. Hope you feel better real soon.

You're suffering from severe depression, low self-esteem and suicidal ideations.  You need psychiatric help, which consists of counseling, medication, and possibly hypnosis to determine the underlying causes of your depression, and the fact that you can't seem to "find" yourself.  I would suggest that you get help immediately before you do yourself great harm.  This question does not belong in Words and Wordplay, by the way.

A proboscis is what the mosquito uses to suck your blood, or an elephant to spray you with water... "an elongated appendage on the head of an animal". Proper plural is proboscides (not probosci, but what the heck...). For humans proboscis is used facetiously to mean your schnoz, a.k.a. nose (especially when it is of pronounced size).

<question>



I want to express such meaning, how should i write(or rewrite) this sentence?



how should i write(or rewrite) this sentence
I'd better ___ her today
i want to express such meaning:
the sentence has the mean that i should yield/obey/give ground... her

but that's not the case that i'm afraid of her
instead, it's more like the relationship between a big bro and a little sister

maybe you guys should forget about the "i'd better"
because i don't want the feeling 【(absolutely avoid this feeling)】that is a weak person to a strong person
wat i want is the opposite

the person who says this, is a mysterious, skillful,proud,self-centered...person
anyway, nothing can change his mind unless he wants to (by pity,perhaps)

and the person who he's talking to is a 15-year-old girl who is menstruating today. And she wants to know one of his secret.
and the man is thinking whether to tell her

(i'm writing a novel as an english learner)

What Does It Mean When Your Eyes Change Color?



My Boyfriend Has Eyes That Change From Green To Blue To Brown Quite Often... He Doesn't Have Hazel Eyes, But All We Know Is That His Eyes Turn Brown When He's VERY ANGRY. His Eyes Can Go From The Deepest Green To The Brightest Blue Without Any Cause At All... Today His Right Eye Was Blue And His Left Eye Was Green... Sometimes One Eye Will Be Half Green Half Blue, And Sometimes Gray... We Have Discovered That The Greener His Eyes Are The More Amerous He Feels! Please Let Us Know If You Have Any Explanation Or Comment... Thanks!



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Multicolored eyes are fairly rare, usually benign, and frequently genetic in origin, occurring in maybe 1 percent of the population. Alexander the Great supposedly had them. So does rock legend David Bowie.  Some people's eye color does change for no apparent reason.  Others will sometime reflect the color of a shirt or blouse they are wearing.



Genes and eye color:
Stress, for example, is known to affect genes important for the immune system, which also may affect eye color. Certain foods may also affect eye color.  Read more about it at the source link.

The NATO phonetic alphabet, more formally the international radiotelephony spelling alphabet, is the most widely used spelling alphabet. Though often called "phonetic alphabets", spelling alphabets have no connection to phonetic transcription systems like the International Phonetic Alphabet. Instead, the NATO alphabet assigns code words to the letters of the English alphabet acrophonically (Alfa for A, Bravo for B, etc.) so that critical combinations of letters (and numbers) can be pronounced and understood by those who transmit and receive voice messages by radio or telephone regardless of their native language, especially when the safety of navigation or persons is essential. The paramount reason is to ensure intelligibility of voice signals over radio links.



A-  Alpha
B-  Bravo
C-  Charlie
D-  Delta
E-  Echo
F-  Foxtrot
G-  Golf

no golf shoes. You were prob. at a hotel that also had a golf course on the premises and people wear their golf shoes from the hotel to the course and vice versa. But, that's what it means. No golf shoes...golf shoes have little spikes that mess up the flooring.

If she's actually ordering the  computer, number 1 is the best choice. The others are too wordy to describe this.

If she's calling with questions, but not placing an order (yet),  number 6 is the best. The others are wordy and sound bureaucratic. But I'm sure sentences just like these are spoken and written all the time!

Why does this still happen?



People think it is wrong to use a comma before a conjunction that joins two independent clauses. I'm very surprised how many people do not use a comma before a conjunction joining two independent clauses...it's shocking! Tell me do teaches.. teach kids these days?

I never use a comma before a conjunction and that's what I was I taught back in the late 60's at secondary school.  I also don't use one before the 'and' in a list. Eg ...her hat, coat and bag. Personally I think commas before a conjunction are unnecessary  and look odd and don`t agree with the `Oxford` comma.

I will be training as an English teacher next year, and I will certainly be teaching my classes that it is more than acceptable to use a comma before a conjunction. My understanding was that you have two complete sentences you can use a comma followed by a conjunction to separate them (see my first sentence).

There are many pivotal points in life.  Some are defined by the society you are in, such as 'coming of age' which is usually denoted by the age you become a 'young woman or man'; or graduating from high school, when you can go to work, go to school, live with your parents forever; The time you graduate from college - grad school or get a doctorate; When you turn 40, technically mid age; Retirement.

These are all times when you choose to do one thing over another, a fork in the road.



There are other points in your life that are hard to recognize.  Choosing one partner over another provides for different opportunities.  Choosing one job offer over another also provides different opportunities.

A pivotal point is one that you cannot redo after making the choice.  It sets you on a path that cannot be reversed.

Why do people refer to the year as 2,008 instead of "twenty-oh-eight"?



The years use to be abbreviated, not they're not anymore.

For example people said "the year is nineteen-seventy-seven" instead of "1,977.

Here in BC where the 2010 Olympics are being much talked about, people are saying twenty-ten for that year. I think it's just a case of using what comes off the tongue more easily. Some people used to say nineteen and eight.

Partly because twenty-oh-eight doesn't roll off the tongue very well.
Partly because there was such a fuss made about the "year two thousand" (not the year twenty hundred), that people started saying, two thousand for the year--and it carried on to two thousand one, two thousand two, etc.

Quite simply, it just sounds better.

To refute your second example, 1,977 is a mouthful and 19-77 is just easy to say.

It's like how we say "big, red truck" instead of "red, big truck". It sounds less awkward.

2008 is probably easier to say than 20-0-8.  I believe when we reach 2010, people may start saying twenty-ten instead of 2,010, but I may be wrong.  When we changed to the new millenium, it was the year two-thousand, so the single-digit numbers seemed to follow that two-thousand number.  For what it's worth, 2000 -- whatever, and 20-whatever, still mean the same.

if wrote a check for $1,977 dollars in the written space you could write "nineteen HUNDRED seventy seven dollars" or "one thousand nine hundred and seventy seven"  If you were to write a check for $2,008 you could NOT write "twenty zero eight"  It's how you say the amount of time. "two thousand eight"  It is not twenty oh eight.  It is two thousand and eight.
And people had one hundred years of saying 17??, 18??, 19?? and now we are 8 years into the 2 thousandth year.

After comma use. .......



I was good, but i cried because i was upset.

After a comma like the above. Do you read the sentence, missing out the word but, or does the fact you have put the word but up there make the next clause independent?

I.E

but i cried because i was upset (dependent clause) or is it correct to read it this way. i cried because i was upset( independent clause)

"but" is a coordinating conjunction part of the Fanboys set.To use a coordinating conjunction you must have two complete sentences to join and you have that. The second sentence is complete and includes a subordinating clause "because I was Upset."

It originally meant a person in the circus who bit the head off of live chickens for money.

Now it means you are a nerd or computer "geek" - a person who isn't into all the popular things - do your own thing, even if it's considered silly or stupid by your peers (example: a 14 year old boy wearing the same superman shirt to school everyday, a girl wearing clothes that are out of style because she cares more about her brains then her friends - she studies all the time and wears big glasses, etc.)

generally it means someone who is not up to date or interested in popular culture......even the coolest non conformists still get called this....its a term people use to try and make others conform......

but it can also mean someone who is cleaver
finds it hard to stand up for themselves or is mild mannered
who is quiet
or who lacks social skills

often quiet people get branded as this, despite not fulfilling any of the other criteria!
its an insulting term....the world would be better off coming up with a name for excessive confomists too....to balance it out.....I think "fashion victim" may be its opposite counterpart.

In my own words, geeks are a sub-culture that shuns the expectations of other sub-cultures.



Technically proficient due to short lived obsessive curiosity
Emotionally vulnerable, often offset by contrived pragmatism
Often frustrated by normal physical limitations
Open minded fascination with the unattainable
Very sociable with other geeks.

It depends what he says in the texts.. Does he take the conversation further or leave it dead where you feel like you need to keep it going? If so, then he doesn't sound interesting.
He maybe not be as up front of a guy to call and text first.. Or he muight be getting advice to play hard to get..
Its a tricky situation but you will usually be able to tell in person if he's interested or not. And make sure he's not just playing games. Don't text him for a couple of days and se what he does.

He is not as keen as you... He may simply be not as keen as you are, or he may be wanting to keep the upper hand subconsciously to avoid vulnerability, or he might be trying to send you a silent message "Doooont be such a stallllkkkker", or he might just be busy!

How many messages are you sending this dude?

Have you tried asking him?
Any answers you get here in relation to this question will be pure speculation.
He might not really care too much, but not want to seem impolite.
He might be too shy to take the initiative in communication.
He might be a little busy and forgetful, where your text reminds him to stay in touch.
Any number of reasons.
Ask him.

When you HAVE to do something, you don't really have a choice in the matter, for example you HAVE to breathe to stay alive.

However, when you NEED to do something, you are aware of the situation that must be dealt with, but you might not act straight away i.e I really NEED to go to the gym soon!

Basically, needing to do something is just a stronger way of saying you have to do something. For example, when I tell someone I have to use the restroom it can mean that I do of course have to use the restroom but I may just WANT to use the bathroom even though I don't NEED to use the bathroom. Having to so something may be a stronger way of saying you want to do something. All the while, saying that you need to do something means that you must do it without a doubt and you can't avoid it.

Have to- I have to have everything in the world.

Basically, like its been said, 'Need To" is important necessities that need to be accomplished. These things cannot be put off.
"Have To" is for greedy people who can't have enough and want more and more. Greedy people these days, huh?

First of all, answer yourself honestly - who will end up looking after the guinea pig, who will pay for any costs, and where will it sleep/play etc?
If you are prepared to take full responsibility for the guinea pig and agree to do so, put it to your Mum again. But if your Mum is going to be the one, then she's right to say no. If she says no, even if you promise to look after it, don't whinge. Be very good, nice and responsible for six months and then ask again.

Ask nicely.  Get your facts straight, plan how much it will cost to buy it including the vet's fees, housing, food and bedding.



As with any pet, keeping a guinea pig requires a commitment to care for it during its life which could be 4-7 years or longer. The commitment required to care for a Guinea Pig includes not only routine feeding, care and time spent with the guinea pig but also the provision of veterinary treatment if the guinea pig becomes ill which can be costly. Although proper care will go a long way to ensuring that any guinea pig remains happy and healthy there may still be times when prompt veterinary treatment is needed and once a guinea pig is ill it can deteriorate quickly. However, some insurance companies do offer veterinary insurance cover for guinea pigs.

Guinea Pigs can be kept outside or indoors and the decision as to where the guinea pig is to be kept will affect the type of Cage or Hutch required for the guinea pig.

Promise to look after it and keep that promise.  Tell her you know it is a living thing and needs to be looked after properly.  See if you can do chores around the house to help pay for the cost, like collecting leaves, hoovering, setting and clearing the table.

du = you, gut = good (eg. Du bist sehr gut = You are very good).  I'm not sure what riescht means in German but it's close to the word recht, which means right (as in opposite to left)... maybe this is slang? My knowledge of german is limited so I'm not sure, but I hope this helps a bit. I would guess that playing around with a combination of these three words might help you work it out.  Or else, check out the rest of this song's lyrics by Rammstein and see if it helps provide more context.

A Solution Tip not a question.?



Rust-free scoures,

If rusty steel wool drives you crazy,simply store it in a zip-seal plastic bag or container in the freezer,after  each use.That way it won't rust and will last much longer.Saving you money.

Just Rope Maker is all you have. The trase used to be called cordge makers some 300 years ago. You could perhaps us the name rope twister as ropes then and now are made by twisting strands of fibre together.

I think you're right- I looked around the internet and there doesn't seem to be any particular name for someone who makes rope (as a chandler makes candles or cordswainers make shoes- I thought chandlers sold ship-equipment and cordswainer sounded plausible, but no luck.)

Is the word sorry misused frequently?



I ask this because the other day walking down the street a young lady stumbles and almost fell down, I was just passing near her and I heard she said "Sorry". I asked myself sorry for what? Sorry to whom? To the sidewalk?  My husband was putting some dishes in the dishwasher and a glass hit some plates, he suddenly said "Sorry" (sorry to the glass, the plate?). I told him not to worry because I don't think the dishwasher will feel any pain.
I know that to express politeness we say sorry to someone (not something) about any thing we did without mean it. But, has it use gone to far up to the point that now we have to say to convince others "honestly, I am really sorry". I will like to know how many times any of you being alone and making something silly you have said "Sorry".

You're absolutely correct that 'sorry' is used without thought.  We're so conditioned to ask forgiveness for everything, that we even ask it of the dishwasher and the cement on the sidewalk.  It's funny.  And you're SO RIGHT!!

Rewrite the following passage in which a safe, comfortable setting/atmosphere becomes one of fear and menace.?



Change the atmosphere for each paragraph. change some words but not the actual setting; keep the setting the same just make it sound fear and menace.

The cottage stood hidden from the road, help protectively by the surrounding trees. Ivy climbed the walls, making it difficult to see what colour the stonework underneath had originally been. The windows peered inquisitively out at those who approached, while the door was always opened in a welcoming smile.

The little house was cosy and friendly. It smelt of woodsmoke and apples when you walked in and little squares of sunshine fell through its tiny windows. It offered no sound apart from the crackle of logs on the fire, or sigh of wind in the chimney.

New wooden floorboards had been laid in a couple of rooms over the bricks, for warmth, and these had shrunk as they dried; just sometimes you’d get the feeling as if somebody else had stepped on to the board you stood on, and made it bend a little.

The cottage was hidden from the road. Ivy clung to the walls making it difficult to see the stonework underneath. Dirty window obscured the view to see inside but menacing eyes from inside could vet any visitors before the door was opened.

The little house had a musty damp smell. The walls were dirty and paint was peeling off the woodwork. No-one had cleaned it for years. Cobwebs hung from the ceilings.

Old creaky floorboards lay unevenly and were covered in dust. The house had a sense of the past and it many ghosts. It felt cold and unfriendly.

Exclusion means being omitted. For instance if you are taking out a life insurance policy there will be a list of  ''SIGNIFICANT EXCLUSIONS''  where the company  will not pay out if anything on the list happens.

Because each word is probably derived from two different languages (i.e. 'monkey' may be a latin word and 'donkey' may be a german word, hence the different pronunciation). Thats why the english language is so hard to learn.

I think it's like, wiht courage, it's something which you summon up from within yourself, and it's last longer, where as bravery is something that only exists while you are doing a certain act. 
That's just my opinion.

There really is no difference in the definition of the word.  They both mean the same thing.



COURAGE - definition: The state or quality of mind or spirit that enables one to face danger, fear, or vicissitudes with self-possession, confidence, and resolution; bravery. Courage is the quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger, pain, etc., without fear; bravery.



BRAVERY - definition: The condition or quality of being brave; courage.
the quality or state of being brave, fearlessness

Indeed the meanings of the 2 words are completely interchangeable. the only difference is with the use of the words themselves.

Examples are:
He is very brave. Not he is very courage.
He summoned his courage. Not he summoned his bravery(technically both are correct But in practical use the word courage just fits better)

I have applied for the Nursing program which will start in Spring 2009. That program is through a local community college, but it offers a Associates degree in nursing as well as a Registered Nurse license. I chose that college because it's near, I can afford it, and it's in the top 10 in the country for their program.

I want to be a nurse because I like caring for people when they need help. I've always had a soft spot for babies, so the NICU is where I think I will work when I graduate. I think it will be very rewarding knowing that in the long run I've helped many children have a life.

Since the college only offers an Associates degree, I would have to go to another college to get my Masters or Nurse Practitioner degree. I don't need/want those degrees for any other reason than I want to top my sister. It's a lame reason, I know. I just feel like it's something I really want to do.



Another reason that I'd like to be a nurse is I can pretty much work where ever I'd like. I could work in America, Africa, or anywhere else. Nurses are in such hugh demand that I'd have no problem getting work in my lifetime.

If its in the newspapers it must be true.

There is a joke about an engineer a physicist and a mathematician on a train travelling through the Scottish countryside. (Ayrshire cattle are famously black and white)
They spot a cow from the train.
The engineer remarks "I see Scottish cows are black and white"
The Physicist rejoins "Well at least one cow is black and white"
The Mathematician Looks across and says " one cow has one side which is black"!

You want it translated into English?

If so:

It's sad when people you knew, when you walk past someone, like they were never a big part of your life. And now you can barely look at them.

If you wanted what it actually means, I think its how sometimes you can know someone for ages, then eventually you might act like you never knew them... if that makes sense.

It means it a sad thing when you lose contact with people who were once good friends. People who you used to see everyday and who once meant a lot to you and you to them can just become another person on the street who you walk past and say hi to, but nothing more.
its a sad part of life, but one that happens to most people.

it means that people that are best friends with you can come and go because you find new people to be with and you use the term "i knew (insert name here)"and then you find a new best friend and your old best friend is not your best friend anymore she or he is just a friend that you talk to now and again does that answer your question?

Simply another name for a Hot Rod or whatever you want to call an older, restored, fast show car.  There is a whole association devoted to the term.

I would like to inform you that, unless I recieve my $200 compensation, I am taking this matter to court.

"do not" is negating your sentence
and "legal court" seems a little redundant.
but just $200 is fine.

I don't know all the specs, but I did know a guy that worked at Ford in '67 and got a Shelby.

Apparently Mr.Shelby was allowed to do mods to the mustang, hence the cobra snake on the trim. Peers called it a 'Glorified Muskrat', Back in the day, nobody had respect for that little car (smaller than the rest of the Muscle Cars), therefore the Muskrat moniker.(An aside:  At the Ford plant they had a Mustang Corral for the Mustang owners, very close to the entrance, and anyone that owned a foreign car had to park around the perimeter of the parking lot)

The engine was more powerful, the snake was classier than the horse, and it was a chick magnet... but now it's 40 years older.

Sorry I don't know much more about the car, but as an aging 'muscle car' devotee, I'm much more into practical vehicles... something I can tote a sheet of plywood home with.



A couple of years ago, I had a date with a guy that had a Vette. He bitched all the way that the numbers on the speedometer were too small for an old fart to read.. yet old farts were the only ones that could afford new ones.

Does that tell you anything?

Have a happy life!

1967 was the first year for the GT 500 (the first GT 350's were in 1965).

The original colors of the GT500 were metallic grey with some twin black racing stripes. It featured a 1967 Mercury Cougar tail light panel minus the chrome trim, a flip-up spoiler, and two sets of air scoops on each side. This was also the first American car to feature a factory roll bar. The new GT500 featured a 428-CID (7 L) big-block V8. It was fitted with a "Hi-Po" 302, 4-speed manual transmission, and included front and rear disc brakes.

oh! I know, if you remove one letter from each of them it become one of those words you can say backward, but stays the same.
for eg, remove the a from assess, and you get ssess, which is the same backwards as it is if you read it normally.

"fundamental



c.1443, "primary, original, pertaining to a foundation," modeled on L.L. fundamentalis "of the foundation," from L. fundamentum "foundation" (see fundament).



Religious senses of fundamentalist (1920) and fundamentalism (1923) began in Amer.Eng. with a movement among Protestants c.1920-25 based on scriptural inerrancy, etc., and associated with William Jennings Bryan, among others. Fundamentalist first used in print by Curtis Lee Laws, editor of "The Watchman Examiner," a Baptist newspaper.
" 'Fundamentalism' ... appears to have been used first in connexion with the (American) Northern Baptist Convention of 1920 to describe the more conservative delegates who desired 'to restate, reaffirm, and reemphasize the fundamentals of our New Testament faith.' ... Now 'Fundamentalism' ... appears to describe the bigoted rejection of all Biblical criticism, a mechanical view of inspiration and an excessively literalist interpretation of scripture." ["London Times," Aug. 25, 1955]
Garry Wills, in "Under God" (1990) traces the terms and the movement to the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1910, which drew up a list of five defining qualities of "true believers" which other evangelicals published in a mass-circulation series of books called "The Fundamentals." A World's Christian Fundamentals Association was founded in 1918. Applied to other religions, especially Islam, since 1957. "

The only place where the dodo was found was on the island of Mauritius about 350 years ago. Unfortunately for the Dodo Mauritius became a calling in place for sailors across the Indian ocean. They found the Dodo easy to catch but not very good to eat. It was probably the dogs and rats eating the eggs that did for the Dodo Within a short time the Dodo was extinct. From this came the expression in popular usage.

Did these same men also believe that women should have no property rights  -  but nevertheless were quite happy to claim ownership of the woman's money or property as their own legal right, as soon as they wed?

With men in charge, making poor decisions, the world is in the sorry mess it's in.  You can't blame the women for that.



It just goes to show you can be famous without being bright.

The specific word for a country ruled by a king (and don't forget a king can only be male) is a kingdom. A kingdom, however, can have a queen, as in United Kingdom.

That said, I think you are looking for PATRIARCHY which is defined as a community of related families under the authority of a patriarch or father-figure. Patriarchy was the accepted social organisation in 18th century Britain, e.g. when a woman married all her property was transferred to her husband and married women were not allowed to engage in business and similar activities without the express consent of their husband.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



From English for Students website:

"The British navy frequently used this expression in the 18th century. In those days, the importance of a ship was determined by how high its colors or flags were flying. These flags or colors were raised or lowered by a system of pegs: the higher the peg to which the flag was attached, the greater the ship's honor. So if the flag was tied to the highest peg, it implied that it was a very important ship. When the flag was placed on a lower peg, it implied that the honor given to it was not great. So when you bring or take someone down a peg or two, what you are actually doing is lowering or reducing the honor or esteem of that particular individual."

I think it is great!  It DOES sound exotic!  In case you were wondering about the origins of the name in mythology.  After Prometheus' theft of the secret of fire, Zeus ordered Hephaestus to create the woman Pandora as part of the punishment for mankind. Pandora was given many seductive gifts from Aphrodite, Hermes, Charites, and Horae (according to Works and Days). For fear of additional reprisals, Prometheus warned his brother Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus, but Epimetheus did not listen, and married Pandora. Pandora had been given a large jar (often thought to be a box actually i.e. Pandora's box) and instructed by Zeus to keep it closed, but she had also been given the gift of curiosity, and ultimately opened it. When she opened it, all of the evils of mankind escaped from the jar, although Pandora was quick enough to close it again and keep one value inside: hope.  Between this and the Eve story...Bad ju-ju for us chicks!  ; )

Mine may be a little over descriptive, or just thinking too much outside the box- but hopefully you'll ge some nice inspiration from them.

Celestial Blue maybe? It may sound a bit too exotic but has a nice ring to it.

Venetian Blue

Regatta Blue

Sapphire Blue

Hawaiian Blue

Obviously with words its hard to know the shade to look for- but Im sure there's a nice one in the list.
You can deffinately find some nice ones for that shade- but right now thats all I can give. May I suggest looking at paint colour schemes from paint companies. They try to give you fancy names that sound elegant and might help you in your cause.

Anyway- hope you find that perfect word.

Give your shower head a bath.

Is your shower head clogged with lime scale? If possible,unscrew the shower head and soak it overnight in a bolw of white vinegar .In the morning,remove the deposits with a brush with moderately stiff bristles.
If you can't unscrew the shower head,don't worry,just pour the vinegar  into a plastic bag and pull the bag up around the shower head.

According to The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre:

"Harlequin,  young lover of Columbine in the English harlequinade. His name, though not his status, derives from the Arlecchino of the commedia dell'arte, where he was one of the quick-witted, unscrupulous serving-men; and so he remained in Italy. But in France Marivaux turned him into a pretty simpleton, while in the English harlequinade he was first a romantic magician and later a languishing, lackadaisical lover, foppishly dressed in a close-fitting suit of bright silk diamonds (derived from the patches on his original rags), sometimes with lace frill and ruffles. He retained from his origins the small black cat-faced mask, and a lath or bat of thin wood which acted as a magic wand (see TRANSFORMATION SCENE). One of the first English Harlequins was Joseph Haines (?–1701), in Ravenscroft's adaptation of Molière's Les Fourberies de Scapin (1677)."

It's another word for sh*t, but mainly used to say somethings good like "oh that band was the shiz" but don't get it confused with shizzle because that means sure, as in fo' shizzle means for sure. People don't really say shiz instead of sh*t anymore though, so if you see it it will mean something is good. It can also mean stuff/things like people say "i need to take my sunglasses n' shiz"

A joke to uplift you ?



A woman goes to her doctor and asks for a face lift, and the dr. says "Well nowdays you don't need to have surgery, all we do is insert a nob under each ear and you turn them to lift the skin"  Ten years later she returns to the Dr. and says "Dr., I think something is wrong I seem to have bags under my eyes "  the doctor looks closely for a while then says "Aha, I see what the problem is, you have been turning those nobs too much, the bags you have under your eyes are your breasts" and she replies " Ah, that explains the goatee"

Speculation is a financial term that describes investments that carry high risks but, if they work out, they pay out really well. Overspeculation would occur if a lot of people paid into many many high-stakes investments and very few worked out well. The results would be a huge loss for most people.



"Overspeculation in frontier lands" would probably amount to a lot of people investing in new colonies and businesses with considerable risk to their own profits. Given the context as the Panic of 1819, I believe it's on target.

Why is, "He must have done." better than, "He must have?"?



Watching old episodes of Doctor Who I've heard a lot of people using a sentence structure unfamiliar to me. They will say, "He must  have done." rather than, "He must have." I consider the latter much more familiar and I don't see anything wrong with it. What is the purpose of adding done to the end of the sentence? What is the name for the grammatic error that it might help to avoid if there is one?

Can u shorten this for me? ?



i want to ask this question, but its too long... can u please shorten it for me someone? i keep making it too long. thanks so much if u do it.



im 13. my parents split ages ago. my dad has cancer. i go to my dads every second weekend and wed. nights.
my dad met A (not using names) about 5 years ago, and a while later they bought a farm together and live together. A is really, really nice and i dint have problems with her.
i want to be a vet or vet nurse when i grow up, and she is a vet nurse. she used to take me to work with her on the holidays and weekends. i cleaned a bit and looked after the animals. i absolutely loved it. she even gave me a bit of money at the end of the day which was awesome.
then she didn't ask me to work with her anymore. i was really sad but didn't say anything.
i started horsetrading on the weekends when i was at my dads. my friend, B, wanted to come too, so she pushed and weed led till she could stay the whole weekend once a month.
then i got a horse and stopped riding lessons. so she didn't come anymore. A would say 'i like B, shes so nice. i love it when she stays here. we should do this with her, blah, blah, blah.' ANNOYING!!
B takes her pets to the vet where A works and is always going on about how nice A is (like A does about her). Her and her mum seem to take their pets to the vet for the weeniest teeniest thing, just so they can see A.



it is holidays now, and last week, while at my dads, A was really especially nice and sweet, which was weird.



this week, at my mums, i went to B's house and her mum was the same. last night B stayed over and her mum was avoiding me and was mysterious. later B read a text message aloud saying 'i will pick u up at 8am to get to the vet with A'. i said 'huh? what r u doing?' but she said she didn't remember &lt; LII IE!&gt;
i found out and i cried silently all night. B took my work at the vet.



my dad texted me today asking how i was without B and told me him and my horse loved me very much. i just asked him why no one told me why my 'friend' was now doing the work i really loved. he hasn't replied.



i know i probably seem like a spoilt, jealous little cow but im not. im really, really upset! it feels so horrible.

very complex. often people dont like to have family members as subordinates or bosses, because it becomes awkward to give instructions, fire, or complain. that is why she must have not wanted u around. because she felt if she told u you were not doing something right, u might hold it against her. you can either ignore the whole thing and act like nothing happened, or ask her point blank and tell her to be frank.

I am not taking you up on shortening your question.  I do not see any need to shorten it.
I also do not think you are a "spoilt, jealous little cow"  you have every right to be upset and hurt.  This is bewildering and painful and would be even to an adult, much less to a 13 yr old.
It can be very very painful to follow up on hurts like this, but I challenge you to do so.  Show this question/story to your dad for a start.
I am praying for you all.  Holding a grudge of hurt in the end can only hurt you so fight it through w your friend and family until you all can understand each other and what all happened.  Ask yourself what you want now? More chances to do other work at the vet?  Training?  Then state that to A and see if she can help you achieve that nonetheless.  Just because she hired B doesn't necessarily mean that she is against you and doesn't have more for you to do.

Its like "are you serious?" in slang. Like do you really mean what your saying? or in other words just sending the message that "wow, thats pretty cool/different or weird" or  like" Hmm I think you should really rethink what you just said!"



Ex: I think my boyfriend tried to tell me that he loved me last night!
"Are you for real??"
"Yes, he was going for the L word untill he said he had to go!!"



or



" I think I'm voting for Obama"
"are you foreal????"
"well, he seems pretty okay now that Joe Biden is is foreign policy man"
"Joe Biden doesnt care about foreign policy! you better rethink and look over your facts before making such a decision!"

Or, it's a perfect day.... for.....A summer rain storm.



Doing something over and over until you get it perfect.
But then, I am a perfectionist.  Don't just let it go to .. I tried and it wouldn't fit.  So I tried again.  practice makes perfect.

hi guys
i am currently going to community college i am 20. first i wanted to transfer to California state university as a psychology major but then i found out that a Bachelors degree is a minimum requirement so i decided to change my major. I decided to go into dental hygiene program at a community college and i will be taking the prerequisite courses hopefully by next semester.

Should i repeat the sociology course? can i repeat a class in order to improve my grade at community college? am i allowed? please guys help me out. Guys am i too old to start a dental hygienist career cuz i chnaged my major and i just feel old to do teh dental program??

SMS is short message service. Short Message Service (SMS) is a communications protocol allowing the interchange of short text messages between mobile telephone devices. SMS text messaging is the most widely used data application on the planet, with 2.4 billion active users, or 74% of all mobile phone subscribers sending and receiving text messages on their phones. The SMS technology has facilitated the development and growth of text messaging. The connection between the phenomenon of text messaging and the underlying technology is so great that in parts of the world the term "SMS" is used as a synonym for a text message or the act of sending a text message, even when a different protocol is being used.



Multimedia Messaging Service, MMS for short, is a cellular telephone standard for sending messages that include multimedia objects (images, audio, video, rich text). MMS is an extension of the SMS standard, allowing longer message lengths and using WAP to display the content. Its most popular use is sending photographs from camera-equipped handsets, although it is also popular as a method of delivering ringtones as well. The standard is developed by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), although during development it was part of the 3GPP and WAP groups.

Listening to colleagues as a manager is vital because, 1: It provokes teamwork and getting on well together, 2: managers should listen because it gives other people a chance to explain what their problems may so the manager can resolve them instead of yelling and shouting orders which doesn't get anyone anywhere.

Well, in this case, if you are referring to the Brown cabinet reshuffle, it could mean this - as in "rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic".



However, the phrase means that the prime minister, to deflect attention from his current problems - and to replace certain members who have already abandoned ship, has decided to change some of the ministers (officials) in the central and controlling committee of his government, the Cabinet.



Cabinet itself comes from a word meaning the room where the king's ministers met to consider the government's business.  It never signified a piece of furniture, even though some members of government over the years have been decidedly wooden.

Some would say "Is" is the definitive article, so in a sense, "is" could actually be the answer. If you had said "What is a good question?", "What" in its own is a prompt, or enquiry, so what could be could construed as a question in its own right, and "What is a good Question" could be a statement as well as a question. So for me, Yes this is a good question, it's actually a GREAT question, not from the point of view that it is actually asking a question - simple answers could be yes, or no, but what it does do is prompt debate and discussion. Big thumbs from me...

Summum bonum (Latin for the highest good) is an expression used in philosophy, particularly in medieval philosophy, to describe the ultimate importance, the singular and most ultimate end which human beings ought to pursue. The summum bonum is generally thought of as being an end in itself, and at the same time containing all other goods. In Christian philosophy, the highest good is usually defined as the life of the righteous, the life led in Communion with God and according to God's precepts.

<answer>



Summum bonum means "the greatest good"--in classical philosophy, it refers to actions and policies which result in the most happiness for the greatest number of people.



For instance, if the Roman Senate had the choice of two actions, one which resulted in a moderate amount of happiness (or benefit) for 5,000 people, and another which resulted in a vast amount of happiness (or benefit) for 35 people, philosophers would calculate the summum bonum by determining which action represented the total "greatest amount of happiness." It was, of course, an inexact science.



These classical philosophers thought that creating the largest amount of happiness among the greatest number of people was life's goal, and that it was possible through reason and virtuous living to accomplish that goal.



Later, Christian philosophers borrowed the term and gave it a more futile meaning; they thought that happiness was to be found not through creating good in the world, but only through seeking the love of the Christian God. And, although it was every person's duty to seek God's love, Christian philosophers felt that humans are so fundamentally flawed that it is impossible ever to fully earn God's love.

"to do" and "to visit" would be more commonly used. The meaning is the same for either one. The "to be" form is usually used when you want to emphasis that this is a future event.

There should be some programs in the internet with this. But if you have something like a flash card maker in your computer, you could use that lol. Unfortunately, the easiest way to get around this is to buy a book with Japanese kanji and learn 5 to 10 a day or week and test yourself at the end of the week. Worked for me!

Sony Corporation, headquartered in Tokyo, is a leading manufacturer of audio, video, communications, and information technology products which serve the needs of the average consumer as well as the professional markets. It recorded annual sales of approximately $88.7 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008. (Sony 2008) Despite Sony's success in other areas, their mobile phone sector was problematic at that time because of being an late entrant in a market that had already been dominated by three other competitors, Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson; in addition, their weak position in intellectual property rights resulted in high loyalty fees, making them even less competitive in terms of the price of the handsets.
Ericsson, one of the world's best mobile communication technology companies with excellent operator relations and telecommunication infrastructure business. Despite being in the third place in the global mobile phone market, they suffered a great loss in 2000 for about SEK 16.2 billion. (Sigurdson, 2004) The reason for their decline lied in the lack of customer-orientation in terms of both customer service and customized -designed handsets.



As a result, in October 2001, seeing the potentials of the other party to compensate their own weakness, Sony Corporation and Ericsson established the joint venture Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, in which each party held 50% of the shares.

"has passed" is the present perfect tense



"passed" (without the has) is the past tense



You use the past tense when referring to the past.



She passed away last night.  She passed away while sleeping.



You use the present tense to refer to an action that happened in the past that has a connection without the present.



She passed away.



Once you use a time reference in the past,  you are obliged to use the past tense and not the present perfect.

They both mean the same and you can use either depending on the words following.



The first is a simple statement as it is; or you could add something.
My grandmother HAS passed away after a long illness.



The second you might add the day or date she died.
My grandmother passed away last week after spending a long time in hospital.

has is basically like a passive verb. when you want to stretch or slow down your sentence you put it in- it doesnt add any meaning to the text.



if you want to be direct- you dont put the has in. so in a formal written piece or an instruction manual you wouldnt write 'has'



has is like the word just



i arrived at school on time
i arrived at school just on time



adds no meaning but stretches the sentence



hope this helps

Nouns: Fans, tests
adjectives: these, "of endurance" would also be an adjective because it describes the tests.



I am not sure if watching is used as a noun, or even an adjective because it could be argued that it is describing what the fans enjoyed. It might also simply be a verb.

It may relate to a matter of office.



I would read this as meaning something related to a political office, not an office you work in.



In any case, after may, must, might, can, could, will, would, shall, and should, you don't need an s-ending, even with he, she, or it.



Example:
It may happen.
She might win.
He should go.

Say "cheese" is an instruction used by photographers who are having difficulty getting their subject to smile. By saying "cheese", most people form their mouths into what appears to be a smile-like shape. Additionally, the absurdity of saying "cheese" for no apparent reason can incite glee in some people.



For more info and some trivia about the expression, see the site below.

Cheesing is apparently a slang word for smiling lol.



Plus the word cheese, which creates the smile look when said was thought to have been funnier than saying another word that creates the smile look like please.

I think it means it is not concise enough. The person uses too many words to describe or explain something... they make it more complicated than it needs to be.

An excess of words is wordy. using more words or bigger words than are needed to convey a meaning. "He is intoxicated by the exuberance of his own verbosity", means that he likes to use big words.

Wordy means using more words than necessary to express thought. wordy may also imply loquaciousness or garrulity &lt;a wordy speech&gt;.

prolix suggests unreasonable and tedious dwelling on details &lt;habitually transformed brief anecdotes into prolix sagas&gt;.

Well, it seems to me, in my opinion, and perhaps in the opinion of others as well, that when a piece of writing - a composition, that is, seems to have more words than is needed to express, or otherwise convey, an opinion, or an idea, if you will, then we may determine to define it, for all intents and purposes, as wordy.

Dude is American in origin althiugh it is probably based on an Irish word dud ( with a long vowel sound) meaning an ignorant or foolish person. Originally it was used to describe a city dweller in a rural setting who was largely ignorant of country ways. but nw the usage has spread to refer generally to any male person. The female equivalent is Dudette.

subjects he is good at - foreign policy
2. Ke



2. Keep mentioning John McCain so many times- he didn't mention Obama that much - I feel like he is running the President instead
3. Good closing statement,  but still mentioniong about John



Palin:



1. Wink few times - like trying to flirt with audience
2. Didn't say God bless you America at the end - didn't sound like a faithful Conservative at all
3. Hold baby every time things are over- she should try to stay away from this scene as a leader.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I politely disagree with your first statement--that Biden not looking at the camera "shows his ignorance and arrogance." Are you a psychic who can read Joe Biden's mind?



In your second question, what does 2. Ke mean?



Your other statements seemed pretty accurate. Palin threw in a zinger near the end of the debate when she said, "There you go again, Joe, talking about the past."

Question about the grammar behind "go to bed hungry"?



also, sentences like, he talks funny, the wind is blowing wild and free.



Why can we use adjective like that, at the end of a full sentence?



If I say, I go to bed hungry every night, this case, hungry is not a adverb,which would make sense to me. the way i can understand ,is  " I feel hungry when i go to bed each night"



anyone please explain the grammar behind of this use for me , knowing that "funny" is not ad. word in "he talks funny" really bothers me....



</question>



<additional details>



well , no I'm not a native English speaker, still in a  long... continuous process of learning English.



I am aware that grammatically these sentences are incorrect, but I just hear lots of likes of this kind of sentence on TV I mean dramas, not just from people

I am guessing English is not your first language. Unfortunately English is used very sloppily by many native speakers. Yes, it should be "He talks funnily", where it's an adverb. The wind should be "Wildly and freely" if it's describing how the wind is blowing. But perhaps it's a wild and free wind that just happens to be blowing.  Sometimes words are moved out of their normal sequence in order to provide emphasis. This is why, when you are learning a foreign language, you cannot rely on books alone: you also need to listen to the spoken language.

Compound nouns (Bedford 36/Hodges' 15a3)
When a sentence indicates joint ownership in a compound construction, the possessive form is attached only to the second noun:



Deanna and Brandi's vacation plans
Tim and Bethany's wedding invitation



Note that individual ownership is marked by a double possessive:



Courtney's and Mem's grade point averages



Tim and Bethany share the same wedding invitation, whereas Courtney and Mem each have their own grade point averages.



................So, going by the aformentioned information  I found on a grammar page, it would be no. 3.

Yes, it makes sense, but multifarious is usually used in conjunction with issues, ideas, or parts of a whole.  I think your sentence might work better with the word "multifaceted."

My mensa (IQ) activities... What does this mean?



My dad bought me a mensa challenge booklet, I completed the first test and scored 14/15, unfortunately having a miscalculation, this gave me a rough IQ of 125. However, later on in the book there are tests out of 20 then 30. The top score, 165. If i were to do these could I score higher? I mean i've improved my IQ abilities lately, one month ago I wouldn't have been able to do any of these questions. Give some advice on what this all means, because I doubt my IQ is 125... could be?

anyone  can  memorize  an  answer.  mensa  is  all about  people  who  can deduce not  just  cite  from  memory.  yes  once  you see  some of  these tests  and  you  get  a feel  for the  kinds  of  questions that  are  on  them  you  gain  confidence  and  you  can  focus on the  format.  but  all  the questions  will  be  different and the test  will  be  timed  and  your  score  will  be  a  function  of  your  score  and  your  time.



mensa only  accepts  people  who  score in  the  top  2  percentile



(better  than  98% of  the  general  public  taking  the  same  test) and  does  not  use  raw scores  as  such

Are you talking about "The Boy In The Striped Pajamas" ?



Because if you are......



Bruno and Gretel are Brother and Sister.



And, Bruno is very innocent, so i suppose that would make him seem younger. Its because back then, children didn't know everything kids know now a days, because kids now are exposed to so many horrible things, they all act older then they should, so maybe Bruno acts how every nine year old should act.

An unabridged dictionary will not only define these words, it will also examine their etymology--explain how these words came to be from other languages. Why bother? Because roots, and prefixes and suffixes will appear over and over again, and you'll KNOW what they mean without having to look them up. The best dictionary, period, is the Oxford English Dictionary, but even the shortened version is two very thick volumes. There are many very thick "Webster's" dics. in any library, and you should become familiar with them. Even a "college dictionary is lots better than nothing, and will be available in paperback.
Why not dictionary.com? Well, you won't always have a computer handy, and too often you will find out that one of those sites (like answers.com) may not have a word here or there that you need, or worse that a site is going to pay-as-you-go.



We learn what we do, and you'll learn more than if I just threw my English degree at the problem.
