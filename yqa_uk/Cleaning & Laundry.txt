I spilt a can of coke all over my drivers seat in the car, how do I remove the stain?



It has been there for a couple of months and looks like I've had an unfortunate and revolting accident, would like to sell car. How do I remove this stain without having to take it to a professional?
The material is a soft material similar to cotton. Should I use a mousse?

To get rid of it, start at one edge and pull the carpet up and take it outside, then keep doing it until all of the carpet and pad is removed. This must be done now or the urine will seep into the floor and then the floor must be replaced also.  DO IT NOW.

There is no better product for consumers than urine off



Urine off will work great for both urine and feces. Urine Off is the only consumer product that works very well. Natures miracle and many others do not contain enough enzymes/bacteria. The consumer product is the same blend of enzyme/bacteria as a Professional would buy.

We have treated hundreds of homes with very high success using this product. http://www.urineoff.com

THEY HAVE GREAT INSTRUCTIONS ON THEIR SITE FOR SUCCESSFUL REMOVAL

Washing Machine - Bosch Logixx WAS24466 - End of Cycle Beep...Aaarrrgh!!



Does anyone know how to programme the above washing machine so that it doesn't make that annoying, repetative bleep when it's finished its cycle?  I have lost the instruction manual (that only took 2 weeks!), but I recall reading that it is possible to remove the audible signal.

It needs to go, it's driving me bananas on an otherwise absolutely perfect washing machine!

If none of the other suggestions work you can apply wood stain that comes in a pen to the water mark. I think the best place to find it would be in a hardware store. It comes in many types of wood colors. It won't remove the stain but it will cover it up.

I've used cigarette ash and olive oil for water marks this may work.  You mix up the ash and olive oil to a thick paste, apply it and leave over night, wipe off and polish as normal.

Best washing powder for lingerie?



I want to start hand washing all my new lovely (and expensive) lingerie, and I know to wash it in cool water, but I'm curious if there's a particular washing powder/liquid/whatever that's best for hand washing lingerie?



I actually wash my stockings with Pears soap and cold water, but I'm pretty sure that won't cut it for bras and knickers!

First, buy some stain remover spray (I like to use oxy clean) and spray it on the stain. Don't just spray a little, but saturate the stain to oblivion. Then, put it in the wonderful box called the WASHING MACHINE!

1. Move the **** laundry basket. You're asking for trouble there.

2. If none of the above suggestions work, you can try chlorine bleach, but be aware that it will damage the fabric (and is environmentally unsound). Don't follow the instructions on the bottle: they invariably call for too much bleach, which could eat holes through the fabric. A glug in a cup of water is fine. If you have a top-loading washing machine, let the washing machine fill empty, add the bleach solution, let it agitate for a few seconds, then add your shirts. Verify that the stains are gone before drying.

3. If that fails, tell your girlfriend what happened. You could tell her you want to know where she bought them for future reference, then run out and replace them, but if this is a serious relationship (and who buys T-shirts for a guy otherwise) you need honesty. Trust me, this is a minor issue: she'll be angry, but lying to avoid her getting angry at you is a really good (and, sadly, a very common) way to sabotage a relationship. Take your lumps.

Laminate flooring. How can i clean it without wetting it?



Ive had it down for about a year now and im scared to clean it. Because when i mop it the water makes the joints swell and it dosnt look as good as it did when i first got it. I wring the mop out asmuch as i possibally can but the floor still looks saturated when ive finished mopping. 
Any ideas on what i can use?
And please dont tell me about products like star drops or laminate floor cleaner ive tried them all. 
And i carnt get down on my hands and knees with a cloth, then dry it, ive got a 4 year old son, so i havnt got time for that either.

Buy yourself an ordinary mop (not the string type, the sponge type, like a vileda).  Then, use dettol floor wipes. You put the wipe on the floor and the mop on top and mop away.  It cleans, dries very quickly as it is only a cloth (bit like a nappy liner), and the beauty of it is, it gets all the dirt off the floor and you can throw it away at the end of your mopping - and your mop is still perfectly clean as it has not touched the floor!

I have wooden floor and two dogs, I have done this for years and it is ideal.

LOL...with a 4 year old, you don't have time to get down on your hands and knees!  It sounds as though the flooring isn't sealed if cleaning it  makes the joints swell.  Have you called the manufacturer or the company who installed your flooring?  I'd start there.  I would think you would be able to damp mop the floor without any problems.  Maybe try an H2O steam mop?  I have all hardwood floors in my home, and I just got one of those mops.  It does an excellent job on my floors, and leaves no water behind.  Good luck!

A product that comes in a GREEN bottle called BRUCE works very, very well... I clean a house that has laminate floors and once a month I use a slightly damp mop and wipe the floors down with a mild solution of vinegar/water.. I then dry the floor with a microfiber cloth.. Once a week- I use BRUCE and give the floor a once over... I have a microfiber cloth mop that polishes/dusts the floor... The owners have 2 dogs and it works very, very well... I would suggest that product....

Apple juice stains are not usually that hard to shift. Could possibly been caused by something else?

In any case, let the cloth dry and soak stain with lemon juice (neat), it may take a few times, but it'll shift it.

This works - after you rub it down with pantyhose (and if some is still on there) Soak the shirt in liquid dish cleaner (like Dawn) - make sure you concentrate the Dawn in the armpit region! After it sits (about 2 hours) - hand wash the dawn out, put that bad boy in the washer, and BAM. Like new. :D

The recent inclement weather has forced the spiders indoors... where it's nice and warm.

I use horse chestnuts (conkers) discretely in the corners of every room downstairs and it keeps them away... They are really easy to pick up in the autumn. Peel off the green prickly outer shell and leave the brown nut in the corners.

Bug bombs are dangerous chemicals.  You need Orkin or Terminex or a similar exterminator.  They do not use dangerous chemicals to rid you home inside or out of bugs.  We have Orkin on contract to do the interior and exterior of our home every 3 months and nothing they use is harmful to humans or pets.  We are bug and spider free.

They are coming in because it is hot outside. They like dark corners in your room and eat the moths and flies that come in. Vacuum the spiders and their webs up. If you just knock down the webs, the spiders will just build more.

A bug bomb is insecticide in a spray can that you set off, and it sprays poison in  your room while you are else where. I have used these and the it killed all the bugs in my house except for spiders!

What's best for washing outdoor chair covers (white/green/brown) that are dirty and a bit mildewy looking?



We bought an outdoor setting a few years back and made the mistake of not taking the padded chair covers inside at night time.  Although they've been under cover, they have been left outside heaps and now look really dirty and mildewy looking. I've tried bleach, pine-o-clean etc. I think I even tried water & vinegar last year then left them in the sun but nothing appears to work. Would love some suggestions!

Clothes Dye - Why Do You Need Salt?



I have just bought some clothes dye that goes through the washing machine, and I had to add 500g of salt!! That seems like an awful lot! Does anyone know why?



Also, becuase it has gone through the washer, we have to wash it once with dye, then another time with just the jeans and some washing powder, then another time just with powder (I assume to wash out the machine) Has anyone else used a washing macine dye? Will my next lot of washing be alright? Or could some of the dye still be hanging around and ruin my clothes?

Thanks for your help!!

The salt is to fix the dye.  If you run a not wash with detergent after dying then there will be no dye left in the machine.

I would NOT use this on ordinary utensils at all. I'm sure it would be much too powerful!



It is primarily used for tough grease/burnt on stains on cookers etc. 
Just use ordinary washing up liquid and even then I always rinse off the residue as you don't want to be ingesting that either!

Things You’ll Need:

Nail-polish remover 
Soap 
Acetone-based nail-polish remover 
Warm water 
Shallow bowl



Step1
Do not attempt to tear or force apart the glue. This could rip your skin.



Step2
Apply acetone-based nail-polish remover to the area. The acetone breaks down the bond.



Step3
If there's a lot of glue on your skin, soak the skin in nail-polish remover to dissolve the bond.



Step4
Clean the area with soap and water after removing the glue.



Step5
If you don't have nail-polish remover, soak the affected skin in warm, soapy water.



Step6
Slowly roll the skin to work the bond apart as the warm water soaks through. Continue doing this until the skin is free of glue. 
___________________

If you get Super Glue in your eye or mouth, keep the eye or mouth open while you rinse it with water for 15 minutes. Seek medical attention immediately.

I'm not too sure if it will work on plated taps, however when watching that show "How clean is your house" they suggested putting a few table spoons of baking powder and some vinegar to make a very thick paste and put in on some glad wrap.  Grab a rubber band and use it to attach the glad wrap to the tap ensuring that the baking soda and vinegar surround the tap end.  Leave it for a while, testing every 10 minutes and leave for up to 30 minutes.  The lime scale should come off fairly easily that way.



Lemon or white vinegar on it's own will remove lime scale from taps also so it depends on how thick the lime scale is.



Good luck. Hope it helps.

Half fresh lemon, clean soft cloth, mug.
Step:
1. Extract lemon juice into a mug.
2. Pour into the taps
3. Leave it for 30 mins.
4. Use the cloth to remove remaining limescale
5. Rinse with clean water.

<answer>



Step1
Mix equal parts of white vinegar and borax to form a paste. Mix as much as necessary for a single use as it can harden when stored.



Step2
Remove the knobs from the faucets. Place them in a container filled with equal parts vinegar and boiling water. Allow them to soak overnight then rinse thoroughly.



Step3
Apply the vinegar/borax mixture to the faucets and allow it to sit for several hours. Wear gloves to apply the mixture and press it in firmly. Use cotton tip applicators for hard-to-reach areas.



Step4
Scrub the faucets vigorously with a scouring pad until all the limescale is removed. Repeat Step 3 if limescale is still present.



Step5
Rinse the faucets thoroughly. Use boiling water to dissolve the mixture completely and prevent smearing. Dry with a lint free cloth.



Step6
Prevent limescale from recurring by using a water softener and drying your faucets after every use. Limescale is caused by hard water drying on the faucets. It requires less time to prevent limescale build up then it does to remove it. 
________________

Always wear gloves when handling the vinegar/borax mixture. It is irritating to the skin and can cause dryness.



Never use a wire brush to remove limescale. It will damage the faucet.

No way, you will get sick.  Dampness will case arthritis in the future.  Also, who wants to sleep in wet clothes.  The cheapest way to dry clothes is to hang them over your bath rod.  Also, you can hang shirts and pants up on a hanger.  Make sure when you hang up clothes they do not leave holes or stretch out.  Those kind I would lie flat to dry..  But no way do you wear your wet clothes to sleep, that is just not healthy.

Great question.  Here's why...
You are NOT cleaning wood, you are cleaning the finish that is on the wood, whether it's lacquer, polyurethane, wax, oil or whatever.

So, to clean it naturally, for most finishes, a mild, simple wash with water and pine oil (like Pine Sol or Breath o' Pine) will do a good job and are natural products with few if any added chemicals.  Just wash with a sponge, rinse with clean water, towel dry and for extra protection, a light layer of wax.

Murphy's Oil Soap will get it really clean, they actually sell a spray variety for wood cabinets and furniture. Then you can add a sealer, like Pledge or even plain orange oil. That will keep your wood shining and protected.

it is best to use a commercial size washer and dryer (like in the laundromat).  I have a front load washer that is for large loads, so that is what i use.  wash on warm and spin for longest time possible to remove all the water you can.

place in the dryer with a clean pair of cotton tennis shoes.  dry as long as it takes to fluff the comforter back up (the tennies beat the feathers/down apart so they don't stick together)

Any suggestions on cleaning silk? ?



I got a shirt for $2.00 at the thrift store. Its like a $40.00 shirt. Well I noticed in a photo or in really bright light, it shows a slight stain. Looks like it could have been grease or something. Was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to get it out. It's dry clean only. I don't want to spend money on dry cleaning on a $2.00 shirt if they can't get it out. Are there any at home remedies? I managed to get a stain out of a $200 dry clean only wool skirt at home, so I was wondering about this. The last time I took something to the dry cleaners they ruined my item.

Cleaning silk takes more care and effort then cleaning a more durable fabric like linen. Before you clean silk it is best to try a small part of the silk in an unobvious spot to see that your method of cleaning the silk has no ill effect on the fabric. Silk can last a long time with proper care.

This is one method you can use to wash silk by hand. Take two quarts of very cold water and add a half cup of a mild detergent such as a baby detergent. Add two tablespoons of white vinegar to the two quarts cold water and detergent.



After you have mixed the detergent and vinegar to the cold water take the silk item and gently dunk it into the water and detergent mixture. Dunk the silk item up and down into the mixture. As you dunk the silk item up and down be careful that you don't soak the silk item. When the silk item looks like it has cleaned up it is time to rinse it.

Rinse the silk item in cold water. Dunk the silk item up and down until it is rinsed clear of the detergent water. You can let the silk item drip till it is just wet. Then you can take the silk item and roll it up into a towel and iron the silk item while it is still wet.

Make sure if you are not sure about the wash ability of the silk item that you test the silk item in an inconspicuous spot by dipping the spot in the solution and see what happens to the silk item.



If you are worried about the silk item turning yellow you can help prevent the yellowing by putting a half cup of white vinegar into the rinse water. Again if you have any concerns about what may happen to the silk you may want to test the silk on an inconspicuous spot before dunking the whole silk item. Washing silk does not take a lot of time. Washing silk is easy since silk will shed dirt fairly well by itself.

Things You’ll Need:

Cornstarch 
Liquid dish detergent



Step1
Flatten the section of silk with the stain on it. Clothes or drapes can easily lie flat. If the stain is on a piece of furniture, smooth the section of fabric.



Step2
Sprinkle cornstarch on the stain. Pat the cornstarch into the stain, pressing to make a thick layer. Leave the cornstarch on the stain for 24 hours.



Step3
Brush the cornstarch away from the stain and shake the piece of silk or brush it hard (if it is on a piece of furniture). The cornstarch should absorb the grease. If more cleaning is required, continue with Step 4.



Step4
Rub a small amount of liquid dish detergent into the grease stain on the silk. Let it sit for a few hours.



Step5
Rinse the dish detergent from the stain. Let the fabric dry. 
__________________

For silk-upholstered furniture with grease stains, use as little stain remover as possible.



Test the liquid dish detergent on a non-stained section of silk to be certain it won't harm the fabric.

Go to the local everything store and find those home dry-cleaning bags or home dry-cleaning kit.
Next have your friend scrub the entire inside of dryer with a rag and regular anti-biotic dish soap and water, soak up some large towels in the water with the dish soap, wring them out and run them through the dryer for 30 minutes. Then fill some small mesh bags (about 3 0r 4) with some kitty litter mixed in with the dry cleaning powder and run the dryer again for about 20 minutes on "air-dry" setting if she has it.
Make sure she disconnects the hose from the dryer to the outside vent and cleans it out thoroughly after she has done the above.
If she still has a lingering odor, have her spray the inside with Oust Air-sanitizer and odor neutralizer and shut the door quickly. The trapped spray should neutralize any remaining odors.

I would run an empty cycle...and you may have to do this a few times.  I would try one with hot water and some bleach.  If that doesn't work...use white vinegar and lemon juice the second time around.



Sorry....I misread it...I thought it said washer.  But for a dryer...try soaking towels in white vinegar and drying them on the highest setting in the dryer.  Also make sure you clean out the lint traps very well and wipe everything down in white vinegar.

Phone dysons technical helpline and ask them.  I had a dyson 3 years ago and it made a loud noise and smelt of burning.  When I contacted them there was a design fault.  They replaced some of the parts free of charge and it was fine.

How do I clean these shoes?



i have a pair of leather shoes- they are almost like an earth shoe, i bought them last year, wore them the entire winter (live in midwest) most comfortable shoes in the world. But, they got salt stains on them and water marks and they are brown but they look really bad. I really want another pair but can not find them, so my question is, what can i use to clean them, maybe take away the salt stains. any help is appreciated.
thank you

Well, I live in Canada where we have LOADS of salt on the roads here. The only real way to remove calcium stains on your shoes is actually, quite simple:



Use plain white vinegar. With a soft toothbrush, dip it in the vinegar and lightly brush away the salt stains.



Don't worry, the vinegar smell will disappear as soon as they dry. Once you've removed the salt, take care to use a protective spray this year.

Unfortunately, the only thing to do at this stage is rest.  drink lots of water, juice, etc.  Eat bland/light things like crackers and broth based soups.  Don't move around a whole lot if you can help it.  Good Luck...I remember how terrible hangovers are!!

aspirin. avoid water, it can cause the alcohol to affect you, like the night before.



next time, take a goody's powder, BEFORE you go to sleep, it will take the edge off of the hang-over the next morning. i know for a fact that this works.



crackers, and starch foods, like bread are good choices for you to munch on. it will absorb what alcohol is left, and make you feel slightly better. juice is always good. stay away from dairy, and milk. it could turn sour, and make you feel even sicker.

When I get up with a hangover what helps me is drinking orange juice and take about 1,000 mg of vitamin C. The fructose in fruit juice helps the body burn alcohol faster.
Drink water also. Alcohol dehydrates us.



Also time and eating a good meal will ease the symptoms as well.

Are you talking about food or are you talking about something that will make your house smell good?
The two previous posters have some good recipes but for something that just smells good, take a pot (a small or medium size) fill it half full of water and then add things like cinnamon sticks, cloves, orange or lemon peel or any other dried herbs and spices that you like (all of which you can buy in bulk cheaply) put it on the back burner of your stove and turn it on to the lowest setting, mind you don't let the water evaporate out of it, if the water gets low, just add more.



DO NOT leave it on overnight!

This one I would take to the cleaners, along with lipstick or ink pen stains.  My grandparents and then my parents owned 8 dry cleaning stores in Southern California.



These are tough stains to get out, the professionals use special detergents and other chemicals, even air pressure and stream to remove some of our stains. It helps if you tell them what the stain is, usually the clerk taking in your clothes will tag it or just walk it back to the spotter if the plant is there at your location instead of a drop off store.



It's really worth the extra money on your fine clothes.



Home remedy- a hot iron and paper towel on both side of the material, and Dawn dish detergent and a toothbrush.  You need to break down the composition of the spot, or change the characteristic. Melting it into the paper towel changes the characteristic, the Dawn can breakdown the chemical bonds. Keep turning the paper towel to a clean space on the towel while ironing and melting it to transfer the wax crayon to the paper towel.



Some dry cleaners won't even take it. Last summer I took a job as a server, I now live in Reno, NV. Here people are offered to play Keno, and there is a black crayon at everytable. That day I ended up with one in my front pocket, that night I washed and dried it...thank goodness with only just my uniform, being that my apron is black as well as my pants.  Four of the dry cleaners in my area wouldn't even take it.
I had to go to our personel office the next day and told my supervisor my problem...she sent it out with other uniforms they have, when it came back it was perfect.



The cleaners can do it, the can get it out, It's tough just finding someone to take the time to do it...offer to pay extra.



I would only try this home remody if you don't have the choice for the dry cleaner, or if the item you are trying to clean is not an expensive addition to your wardrobe and you won't mind throwing it out, if you are unsuccessful.



Good Luck.

Did you get my message on 360?? It's damn rude of you not to reply.



You know what happened to me today, well yesterday.
I was cleaning my laundry pen. I happened to find an old can of cat food, which I'd been using (not personally, but I have been tempted) while I was pregnant.
I lifted it up and the lid went POP and OH GROSS. It was full of maggots.
The stench was disgusting. I have chills thinking about it. I wanted to cry, I had these maggots all over me.



Chuck a few spoons of drain cleaner in it. I do. Just stand back.



Source(s):



Tell me about the smell. We have septic here. Oh goshy they can stink. I was hurling abuse at Hubbister for smelling, but it was the septic. hehe
The maggots, oh I sobbed like a baby. On the phone to Hubbister, who proceeds to laugh his butt off at me. Pffft. He is lucky he is so sexy

wow, ever think of cleaning the unit out?



washing machines accumulate alot of filth and bacteria.



public units are notorious for being disease and germ carriers....



once in a blue moon.. use lyme, bleach,  other hard water, rust and bacterial agents in a empty machine and let the cycles run...  then double rinse.



it's like with a dish washer... you must run the cycles through with detergents and cleansers every so often without dishes/clothes to ensure the plumbing,  filters,  jets and tubing stays free or as clean as possible of residue, build ups... rust, lyme and bacteria among dirt that's course and can clog the system and thus damage the unit.



make sure to use the HOT water settings.

Hey Girl.
Try checking the rubber seal around the door.



The seal has folds and sometimes stuff gets stuck in the folds.
(this is starting to sound obscene)
********be careful when hiring repairmen, though because they tend to let their butt cracks hang out



****lol Hearts.



You can tell whats on MY mind, huh?  Sorry if I've made you hot and bothered....be sure to take some of that frustration out on that sexy "butt crack" repairman.

Hmm..I don't know about that. But I have front load clothes washer that gets the same kind of smell. I'd try running it empty with bleach or something of that nature..maybe even a few times.
You could need a part or something replaced too. In that case, find yourself a hot repairman to come and do ya..I mean, do the job.

If nail polish remover didn't work no other solvent will. It is basically acetone which is a very strong solvent. I would try a mild abrasive like a Scotch-Brite or fine steel wool.

Hairspray is the trick, you need to spray the stain, then dab it with a soft dry cloth, this may need to be done a few times but it should work!!!

To remove ink stains from carpet, put rubbing alcohol on a washcloth and blot the ink stain. The alcohol will need to sit on the ink stain for thirty minutes or so in order to dissolve the stain. After the alcohol has done its magic to remove the ink stain, blot the remaining ink stain with a clean wash cloth. If the stain is not removed on the first try-try, try again.

If it was my carpet, I would try hairspray first.  Hairspray will take ink out of clothing, but I've never tried it on carpet.  I would spray the spot down really well with hairspray, let it soak in for a few seconds, and then use a dry cotton washcloth to blot it up (not rub, that will spread it).



If the stain is bad enough, you just may not be able to get it out at all.  Good luck though! :)

I agree with the hairspray technique.  Just don't rub it in.  Spray it on the carpet and blot it up with a clean white rag until no more residue exists.  If that doesn't work, then I would try the vinegar and water remedy.  Don't rub it as it will show a wear spot on your carpet and will spread the stain.

Vinegar and water can do wonders for lots of stains so it's worth a try.  An oxyclean paste should work as well.  A dried stain is tough.  This is why dark fluids shouldn't be used in carpeted areas.  Hardwoods or tiles only.  Cleanup is easy.

If you use a dryer, place a fabric sheet in there to give it some softness.



Line dry, they will become somewhat stiff.

Because my children have such sensitive skin, we only use fabric softener on our throw blankets for our couches and chairs.  There is no harm in not using them.  Use a dryer sheet to keep the close from being staticy, though.  Or, if you use the softener in place of sheets, try fabric balls for the dryer.  They help to add fluff.  They help to cut down dry time, too...so they are pretty economical.

You can get away with not using fabric softener liquid in the washing machine but in the dryer you definitely will want to use a dryer softener sheet because your clothes will have static cling and be stiffer.
They won't smell as fresh either since we get most of the scents from the dryer sheets than we do the detergents.

Ketchup stain.. white shirt..?



A couple days ago I got ketchup on my white shirt. I wiped it off, then washed it. Before my mom put it in the dryer she didn't make sure the stain had come out. So.. it has already been dried. After it happened I didn't realize I should have used the tide to go stick.. so.. last night I tried using it and it took a little more of the stain out.
But, the stain is still noticeable, what else can I try to get the stain out?

you got a thing called "vanish" selling at your side of the world mate?
that thing works like a beast!



since your shirt is white, you might want to try hydroden peroxide (bleach) if vanish doesn't work. once i used carpet cleaner sprayer that worked like a bomb as a last resort. (although the thing smelled like bleach, had to wash it in the washing machine again).



if you decide to use any of the above mentioned, soak it in the solution (hot) for a few hours, then try scrubbing the stain. then rinse in warm water. then put it in the washing machine.



if you use bleach and your shirt is not white completely (maybe some other colours here and there), ONLY just squirt out some bleach out of the bottle at that area and try not to get it on anywhere else. then afterwards rinse in warm water before washing it.



hope that helps.

Burnt my shoe with hair dryer?



Hello,
My new sneakers got wet in the rain so when i got home ... i used a hair dryer to dry them and by mistake when i was drying the inside of the shoe i burnt the inside foam of my shoe and now when i am wearing it ...it's itching the top of my feet :( what can i do to fix this problem ?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



If the burnt part is the foam cushion, where the bottom of your foot touches, then tear it out of both shoes and get a cut to size replacement from the drugstore or Walmart for a couple bucks.  You can use the old one as a template to cut the new one with scissors.



If your foot itches, its probably just dry skin.  Put some vaseline on that spot of your foot before bed and wear clean white cotton socks to bed.

The problem you have is even if you manage to get rid of the felt tip, it would have damaged, altered,changed the surface of the table. Any change and the balls will be running incorrectly. Leave it I say. At least the table is not "damaged." thanks.

I don't think there is much you can do, besides a recover. Recovering isn't that hard once you figure everything out. If it doesn't effect the play then you may want to just leave it alone. If it is driving you crazy then call a billiards place and talk to them.

Problem: flushing the toilet with seat cover down?



I know that people will put the seat cover down, particularly after a number 2, to flush the toilet.



My flat mate puts the cover down before flushing. BUT, a big problem with this is that he ... leaves behind some of his ... number 2's because he can't see what's not been flushed.
This isn't the first time, more like the 4th and it disgusts me when I'm the next person to use the toilet, even though he didn't mean it.



So the first and second time I let it go as a disgusting one-off, but it keeps happening so I talked to him and basically explained this to him and he ignored the fact that it might be disgusting for the next person and just said it prevents germs coming out.



Is it too much to ask that he checks it's all gone after flushing?

Mythbusters did testing on fecal matter and toothbrushes.  It did not matter what you did, the stuff escapes from the bowl.  He needs to leave the lid up and hold the handle down until the flush has completed.  He may have to flush twice.  If he does not want to do that, put a lock on the door and charge him $5 for you to flush it.

It is just common courtesy to check that you haven't left anything behind.  Also, I think it is great that he puts the seat down before he flushes.  Very sanitary...so this is amusing to me that he wouldn't double check that the toilet is clean before he leaves the bathroom.

When you flush, the tank lets a lot of water through the main valve at the bottom, but it also sends a little water through the over flow overflow pipe that sticks straight up through the middle of the tank. Once the initial water drains, the bowl fills again with this water while the tank fills for the next flush.



There should be small tube leading from the float valve in the tank to the overflow pipe. If this feed sends too much water into the bowl, it will overfill and "flush" again. You can try adjusting the flow from the valve if it has one, or you can pinch the tube with a paperclip or binder clip. You don't want to cut it off completely, just slow down the flow. You can disconnect it completely, but that might make cleaning the bowl more dificult.



I hope this helps.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  u can Keeping clean tile and grout can make the difference between freshening up a space and having to endure a complete renovation. The best way to clean tile surfaces is to use a soft cloth and warm water when dealing with mild soil. While more stringent cleaners or scrubbing implements may sometimes be necessary to clean tile, it is best to start out using the mildest options possible to protect the glaze.



If your surface isn’t glazed, consider applying a sealant to protect it and to make it easier to clean tile. If you did not install the tile or have it installed yourself, you may be unsure about whether it is glazed. Apply some water to test it. If the color changes to a much darker tone, that means it is a porous surface that will absorb water, and it requires a sealant.



Some people suggest vinegar to clean tile on a regular basis. While it may remove some residue and appears to be a good choice, vinegar may damage tile surfaces and may also change the color of grout. Other mild household solvents and cleaning products can be used to clean tile, but it is important to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. Only use products clearly labeled as safe for tile surfaces.



If scouring is required to clean tile efficiently, look for a non-abrasive cleanser and use a nylon scrubber rather than steel wool or other coarse scrubbers. For grout, try a brush that has soft bristles, such as a soft child’s toothbrush. In addition, whenever you clean tile, it is very important to rinse away all cleaning products and residue thoroughly. Dry the area and then polish the surface. You can use a buffer if desired.



It may be necessary to apply more sealant after heavy duty cleaning or the use of heavy duty products. If so, always make sure both the tile and the grout are completely dry before you begin the application, and allow the sealant to dry thoroughly before using the tiled area. hope this will help

You need to find out if anybody from your family vomited somewhere and it was not cleaned up, sometimes it happens especially with kids, I mean parts of vomit (like clear fluid can also smell). Just go around ask and sniff. Of course air the house a few times/day, wash beddings, mop the floor with some nice smelling, disinfecting stuff, vacuum. The smell will go away, sometimes it is only in your nose after episodes like this. Good luck.

If it the actual smell you are trying to get rid of, and not trying to mask a surface that is so damaged it cannot be cleaned, do vinegar.  I put full strength vinegar in several small bowls throughout the house (behind pictures, behind the paper towls, behind the trash can, etc) and let it sit until it is evaporated...just repeat.  If you want to make the house smell too, do the same with diluted essential oils.  I am not big into sprays or things similar to that.

open windows for a few hours whilst hoovering the house and mopping surfaces with Zoflora.  Clean all clothes and bedding.  Ensure no drains are blocked with sick, pour down bleach in these areas and leave for a couple of hours.  Close windows then spray all fabric such as cushions and curtains with neutralising agent such as neutradene and finally light a few scented candles in every room and fill the bath with hot water and put in loads of lavender scented oil.



Previously when a bad smell wouldnt go it turned out there was still an unfound "smellant" e.g bit of sick on back of door or in corner etc.



If this still doesnt work then fight fire with fire....make a big pan of cabbage soup and fish curry !!!! that should overpower the smell of sick.

Open windows really are the key while you're cleaning/disinfecting your house. It lets in fresh air and allows germs to float elsewhere. Lysol, Oust, and Febreze are great products to use to combat odors as well. Clorox Clean Up with bleach is good too.

My apartment is full of lint. It's everywhere. How do I get rid of it?



It's in my clothes, settling on every piece of furniture and even floating around in the air. I have been unable to breathe through my nose for a couple of years maybe because of this. Some possibly relevant facts - I'm on the 4th floor of an apartment block, I've had a stray cat for about 6 years and don't have air conditioning.



Please help, I'm losing my mind!

Start with an air purifier.  We had three thoughout our house when my son developed allergies.  Also...swiffer, swiffer, swiffer. There isn't so much you can do to be proactive.  So, get a really good static duster and dust a couple of times a day.

What Bob said: Your landlord should be checking the filters to your heating system. You can't be the only one with breathing problems.



Until he does, use an air cleaner and a good vacuum, and dust frequently with a slightly damp cloth. That should help lower the level of dust in your place.



Good luck!

I already have outdoor lines and 2 Mrs. Pegg's Handy Lines but I'm looking for something small to be able to hang a few pieces of laundry  in the bedroom (maybe 10 or so). I don't want to get the humidifiers going because they are cool mist and honestly, I freeze at night with that cold air blowing around and want to hang some wet laundry instead. I'm limited on space so I need something small (narrow). Thanks!

I live in a trailer too and feel your pain!



Get the space bags [the ones you vaccuum the air out of] and put all of the coats, blankets, and clothes in them. For canned food and things like that I'd see if I could make some room in the pantry or kitchen cabinets, if not, then get some clear storage bins. As far as magazines and other paper items, chunk it. The space bags are expensive, but worth it.

for extra storage, there's these bed lifts you can buy at the store to lift your bed a couple inches and give you storage underneath.  re-evaluate what you have, and what you really don't need, you should sell.



you can also always install shelves, cabinets in your two bedrooms.

To remove adhesive residue from clothing, first rub an ice cube on the adhesive to freeze it, then use a dull knife to scrape away any excess adhesive. Next, apply vegetable oil to the adhesive until the adhesive begins to loosen. Use a dull knife again to scrape away any excess adhesive. Rinse well with a grease cutting detergent (such as dish detergent) and cold water. Continue to apply vegetable oil and rinsing with detergent and water until you´ve removed as much adhesive as possible.



Apply a laundry pre-soak, then launder as usual, but do not dry until all the adhesive and stains are gone, as heat sets stains. If any adhesive remains, place the clothing face down on an absorbent cloth and apply dry-cleaning fluid to the back of the stain/adhesive. Let the stain dry, then rinse thoroughly and launder as usual.



A commercial adhesive remover such as Goo Gone or Goof Off would also do the job.

set your washing machine on the lowest water level, pour in a cup of bleach, throw in the shoes. Right after the dasher starts to turn,(just enough to mix the bleach in) stop the washer. Let the shoes soak for about  an hour. then continue the was as normal. they should be pretty and clean when they cone out.

Baseball caps can get very dirty. They are rather easy to clean, though. Here is how you can wash a baseball cap by hand.



Things You’ll Need:



Laundry detergent



Old toothbrush



Step1
Fill your sink with lukewarm to warm water.



Step2
Add about 1/4 cup of laundry detergent to the water. Only use laundry detergent with bleach on baseball caps that are white. Otherwise you will stain your baseball cap. It's alright to eyeball it if you don't have any measuring utensils at your disposal.



Step3
Place the baseball cap in the sink. Let the cap sit in the water for about a half hour or so.



Step4
Use the old toothbrush to scrub the baseball cap while leaving the hat in the water. You'll want to scrub particularly hard in the areas where the hat is stained.



Step5
Rinse all the soap thoroughly off of the baseball cap.



Step6
Hang the baseball cap in a dry space or in front of a fan in order to dry the cap. You may want to wash your baseball cap in the evening so that it can dry overnight.



_______________



Avoid placing your baseball cap in a washing machine or a clothes dryer. Regardless of what settings you use, placing a baseball cap in either of these machines is always a risk.



**************************



You could try this too.... but I prefer hand wash !



Step1
Wash the baseball cap in the dishwasher if you want it to retain its crisp shape. To best keep the shape of the bill, get a baseball cap washing cage. These are available online and in some general merchandise retail stores and are exactly what they sound like. They act as cages for a baseball cap, holding it in its shape while it is washed in the dishwasher.



Step2
Set the dishwasher for a washing cycle, but don't set it for a heat dry. A drying cycle can shrink a baseball cap after it has been washed. Once the wash cycle is over, take the cap out and allow it to air dry in its cage or sitting on the counter if it is not in a cage.



Step3
Put the baseball cap in the washing machine if you are less concerned about keeping its shape. The washing machine is a harsher washing method and will cause the cap to be less rigid. Some people prefer this shape, however, and consider it to be more comfortable. But, like the dishwasher method, don't use the dryer. Allow the baseball cap to air dry so that it won't shrink or warp while drying.



________________________



If you use the dishwasher to wash your baseball cap, don't wash it with dishes. The food on dishes may stain the cap.

you don't need a baseball cap holder, to wash your hat in the dishwasher. just the top rack does just fine. and it holds its shape too.....  i am unsure about letting it go all the way through the dry cycle. it usually dries half way through the dry time it takes...

Shout is great for everything. I will put it on both sides of the fabric, let it sit overnight then wash it in cold water the next morning. If the stain still looks like it is there repeat the cycle. Dont put in in the dryer though. The heat will set in the stain

I assume the stain has dried. Try flushing it with peroxide. Soak with peroxide and let stand for a few minutes. Rinse with cool or cold water and repeat if necessary. Then launder as usual.



If it's a small stain, you could dab a very small amount of diluted bleach onto the reverse side of it then launder immediately as usual.

You can try setting it out in the sun for the afternoon and see if the sunlight and fresh air doesn't kill the odor. If not, try saturating it with Febreeze. Smoke is a really hard smell to get out of items, though, so running it through the wash with a shake or two of baking soda will probably be the only way to really get it out.

My parents smoke and when I go over to their house, I come home smelling like and ash tray. I found a product called Refresh'n Dryer Towel. You wet the towel with water, wring it out and put it in the dryer with your smelly clothes for 10 minutes on high heat.....and the smell is gone, without washing your clothes. It works great and the towel lasts for 25 uses.

I have a Model DG-308 dryer that has a broken lint filter housing/outlet duct (Part #3-4810 or 306657). Any idea where I can find a new or used replacement part. I've contacted a dozen places online, but the part is no longer available. The dryer works great, but a cheap little plastic piece is broken. I could use either a new or used replacement. Any help's appreciated.

Do you tidy and clean your room in a certain order?



I do! I'm bored so I thought I might tell you haha.



First I collect all the cups (because I have a glass of water for when I'm in bed lol) and any rubbish that's lying around.
Then I pick up all my clothes and put them in two piles, ones dirty clothes, the other is clean clothes. I sort them out, clean in wardrobe, dirty in laundry basket.
After that I pick up any other things and put them in my drawers.



Then I dust and polish stuff.
Then I clean my windows and window sills (because my dog likes to sit in the window and gets his wet nose everywhere).
Then I make my bed, change the sheets etc.
Then I clean my sink



And finally I vacuum!!!



What do you do?? Also, are all 15 year old girls clean and tidy?

Well, I'm not fifteen and haven't been for some time.  Yet however, most young ladies I know are fairly well organized.  I'm a bit more anally retentive when it comes to cleaning my room though.  I have three laundry baskets.  One for whites, one for colors, and one for black.  Before I put any clean clothes back into them after the clothes have been washed, I take a sponge and some Windex and wipe out the inside of the baskets.  I start with the book shelves first, then the trash bins, then the desks(I have one for drawing, painting with brushes and an air brush, model building and individual hobby projects and one for the computer), then the bed followed by the floors and the windows.  Once a month, I do the walls too.  I never eat, drink or allow the cat to do the same in my room

You can make homemade stain removers with varying combinations of the following ingredients:



Borax



White Vinegar



Lemon Juice



Water



Salt



Baking Soda



Liquid Bleach



Club Soda



Borax is one of the most useful product ingredients for making homemade stain removers and has several different options and directions for use in laundry on the box.



One teaspoon of borax mixed with a teaspoon each of white vinegar and lemon juice will make a homemade stain remover that effectively removes ink and many food stains from most color-safe fabrics.



----------------------



Baking soda mixed with water to form a paste makes an excellent homemade stain remover for perspiration stains on clothing. A saltwater mixture is also an effective pre-soak for heavily soiled clothes. Another version of homemade stain removers that can be effective as a spot remover for delicate fabrics is three tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide mixed with one tablespoon of ammonia. This mixture should not be made in any larger quantity and should be discarded after use.
--------------------------



Mixing chlorine bleach with water will yield a homemade stain remover that is safe for non-porous surfaces such as enamel. Use one tablespoon of chlorine bleach per cup of water. You can mix it in a clean spray bottle and keep it stored for several weeks. Remember never to mix chlorine bleach and ammonia and always to work in a well-ventilated area when using ammonia or bleach.
-----------------------



If you prefer to eliminate chemicals from your homemade stain removers or cleaners, try straight club soda or a lemon juice and water mixture for fabrics. Vinegar and water cleans glass surfaces well, and the addition of a drop or two of liquid dish soap will make a hard surface cleaner. Experiment with different mixtures for different cleaning purposes and you may find that you prefer homemade stain removers for their effectiveness and cost savings.

Actually your girlfriend is not supposed to your laundry every time and even if you were not supposed to cheat on her you couldd've just asked her the reason why properly you really don't know how to keep a girlfriend get some help. And yes it was an overreaction go apologize to her know.

Cheer is good, but there are other things u can do to prevent fading too.



on graphic Ts and polos, i always turn the inside out and unroll the collars. This helps a lot with fading, and prevents a huge crease from getting in ur polo collars. in fact, i'm doing laundry right now :P

go to www.thriftyfun.com; they have information there on how to set the colors in your clothing; another great thing to do is wash them in cold water; it is more the hot water that makes them fade than anything else; in fact, you can easily make your own laundry detergent for pennies & that works great; I have never encountered any problems; www.tipnut.com gives some great make it yourself laundry detergents both powdered & liquid; good luck!

I like Cheer and Woolite. Tide has a new detergent called "Total Care" which is supposed to prevent fading. I haven't tried it yet, though--it seems overpriced.



Anyway, a few other tips...
-Always use the gentle cycle
-Always wash your clothes in cool/cold water
-Always turn everything inside out, especially jeans
-Adding a cup of vinegar along with the detergent will help prevent fading (doesn't smell the greatest, but the smell will go away when the clothes goes through the rinse cycle)
-Never over-dry your clothes

I would soak it in a mixture of baking soda & water for overnight and see if that doesn't remove the problem. Good luck!  You can also get a product called x o from QVC.com; it is made by Don Aslet & is totally organic but removes all odors from all things; it is used in nursing homes, hospitals etc; but this will do the trick; I would try the baking soda myself first.

Things You’ll Need:



Bowl for mixing



Water



Baking soda



Laundry detergent



Washing machine



Step1
Wash the clothing in cold water with your normal detergent. Do not dry.



Step2
Make a thick paste from baking soda and water. There's no real science to this. Just make it thick enough so it's not runny yet thin enough to spread.



Step3
Lay your shirt out, flat on a towel.



Step4
Spread a thick layer of baking soda on both underarm areas of the shirt.



Step5
Let the shirt dry--with the paste on it--for at least 24 hours.



Step6
Rewash the shirt as you normally would.



Step7
Dry as normal and then wear free of smell.



___________________



Don't worry about purchasing brand name baking soda. The generic equivalent will be fine.



The longer you let your shirt sit with the paste, the better the result you'll have.

You don't say where the rust is, on the INSIDE of the pan, or the outside. If inside, I would toss the pans, because the teflon finish that was applied has been compromised and small bits that you don't even notice could be flaking off into your food. Might not be harmful, but why take chances...



If  the rust is on the outside of the pan, you can try good old SOS pads, or naval jelly, but it can be aggressive, so if you decide to try the naval jelly, take a q-tip and dab a TINY amount in an area you can't see and make sure it won't further harm the outer finish.



Either way, I would still toss the pans.

Could I wash a "dry clean" only duvet cover...?



I have a red duvet cover that is 65% cotton & 35% polyester with the reverse side being full 100% cotton...



I'm wondering if anyone has experience in this area - do you think I would be able to wash something like that?  I have a front loading washer, so it would be gentle on it, and I only wash my colours in brights, as well as use the lowest heat setting on my dryer...would this work or is this asking for trouble?  I really don't have the money to dryclean, so I'm looking for a solution other than just airing it out.



Thanks in advance for all helpful answers!

I would try washing your duvet on hand wash or the gentlest cycle and letting it air dry.  If you have a clothesline, then that might be the best,  but if you don't then there are wooden drying racks that may be purchased that can help.  Outside of that I would also consider using dryel.



If all else fails, and you don't want to risk ruining the duvet, then I would take it to the dry cleaners.

clean out your filter is one suggestion, but in my experience over the years, it is a result of too much dishes in the dish washer at one time.



You have to understand that if you place a dish or pot or pan at a certain angle, it may block the lower spray arm from getting through to the dishes, thus  leaving a film or material on them. My wife tends to over load the dishwasher, and this is the result of doing this.
Try running a load with a few less dishes or pans, and see if that makes a difference. You may also need to add additives that help the plates and pans to be for lack of a better word (slippery). Do you have hard water? here in the high desert we have very hard water and it does not always look like the dishes or glasses are clean, because of a film that developes on them.



Good luck I hope I helped you with your issue

Then a fresh new amount of water is pumped in and it should be clean for the second wash or rinse. The food is not getting pumped out after the primary wash.  There could be a clog in the line.  There is a screen around the intake for teh pump and it may be clogged as well.  Bottom line is that all of the water is not pumping out after the first wash. there is also a possibilty that there is so much food on the dishes that some of it is coming off during the rinse or last cycle. There should not be any aprreciable amount of food on any of the dishes. If you can see beans or the like then you simply need to modify your habits as to include rinsing off the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. For people that have a low usage there is a rinse cycle to serve that scenario.

I've got the same problem - I checked my directions & the main thing that I could find was that something is maybe blocking the water spray or my dishes aren't loaded properly...



I'm also wondering if maybe I've run out of rinse aid..?  You know - the stuff you put in a slot about once a month and it's supposed to shine your dishes spot free...  I don't know why that would have an effect, but I know I'm always lazy about it & since I put it in a few days ago I haven't had any unusual food residue...



My manual has pictures as to how to load my dishwasher - maybe give yours a look or look it up online and make sure you're doing it right and haven't sacrificed efficient cleaning for mazimized dishes crammed in the dishwasher...I know I like to do that. :D

How long have you had dishwasher - if new then refer to instruction
book or get in touch with manufacturer.
If you have had dishwasher for some time - has it ever done this before?
If this is the first time and you have had the machine long enough to be out of guarantee then-
1.  Have you set the controls for soft or hard water in your area?
2.  Have you sufficient salt in the container?
3



Have you filled the rinse aid  compartment with liquid?
4  Have you taken the remove able parts out and cleaned them?
5.  Have you run a rinse only cycle?

Sometimes this can be the result of not running your disposal prior to running the dishwasher.  Most times they are connected and as long as you run the disposal first you won't have any trouble.  Make sure to run the hot water while you run the disposal, that will help it all go down if there is anything greasy in there.

I don't know really.  But, my guess would be that the dirty water is not draining for some reason and is filling higher than the spray wands.  Have you looked through the owner's manual or called a customer service number for the manufacturer?  If it is an old dishwasher it may need to be replaced.  Repair might cost as much or close to the cost of a new one.

I have found that mine does the same thing if it is not loaded properly, or if it is too full, or too many large items that make it hard for the water to circulate around properly.
If any of those are not the case maybe it is just time for a new one.

Make sure your water is getting as hot as the manufacturer recommends.  Also, check filters and remove any debris, then run a cycle with no dishes with two cups of vinegar to clean out all the pipes and stuff.  It works!

Rinsing before you put them in the washer will help. Make sure all the food residue if off. My dishwasher is supposed to have the garbage disposal built in but I don't really trust it so I rinse everything.

Check inside where the water drains and see if it's clogged. Also try using a product that clears clogged sinks and put it in both drains if you have 2 sinks. It's probably just blocked somewhere in the drain line and this might help.

I recently bought a fleece but want to return it even though i've worn it a few times...?



2 weeks ago I bought a fleece from J. Crew.  I've worn it a number of times since then but I have kept the price tag on it.  Now the fleece is on sale for $20 cheaper and I want to return it and rebuy it at a discount.  However, the fleece is a little loose considering I've been wearing it.  Also, the store only honors price change adjustments within 7 days of purchase, and mine has been 14 days.  Is there any way I can dry clean the fleece so that it looks brand new, considering I have the tag on?  And then I can return and rebuy it?  Does dry cleaning make it look good as new?  Another alternative is that I go and ask for a price adjustment even though the limit is 14 days.  What should I do?

Well ok, considering the time it takes for you to get to the cleaners and back, the gas, and the amount they charge you to dry clean it while the tag is still on, you might as well keep the fleece even though the price has gone down. See its not worth all the effort for 20 bucks. I suggest you just going over there and seeing if they are willing to either honor a proce adjustment if not letting you return and rebuy the fleece right away. They may be ok with it, you never know.
If you just want to return the fleece completely, since you have the receipt, and the tags are attached, I dont see any problem. If it was a quality fleece then it shouldnt have gotten so dramatic loose by wearing it, that could even be your excuse for returning it, the fact that the quality was poor and became looser as you tried it on a few times. Good luck

I wouldn't try dry cleaning it because the cleaners often will remove a tag before cleaning it.  You could try it yourself in a dryer, the tag might get funky though.



Maybe try calling the store (or another J. Crew store) and see what they say.



Tell them you have the fleece and you noticed it is now cheaper and it is only 7 days past the time.  The manager may be able to override the 7 day requirement esp. if you are only asking for the price adjustment.  I don't think they will let you return it and rebuy it - meaning you'd have to return it and then buy a different one.  And that is more of a loss to the company which is why I am hoping they would just refund the price difference.  Good luck - it's a bad economy and I think some of the managers may be more sympathetic if you are nice and polite.

I would go and ask for a price adjustment and see if they give it to you. Otherwise you're out of luck, sorry.



You can't dry clean with the tags on. Dry cleaners will put the fleece in a special washer with chemicals- they do not actually clean it 'dry' there is liquid involved just not water. It will screw up the tags so you can't return it at all.

If you have the receipt return it, with the tag on, unless it looks really worn sales clerks don't check it how it looks, whether it was worn or not, I return things often even after wearing them a few times (once I even washed something, the colors blended in the sweater), with receipt and tags no sales person ever argued, just go and return it, what is the worse can happen?



These returned items won't go back on the sales rack among the brand new ones, stores have budget for returned stuff, they may mark it down. Don't worry they won't go broke.

Try this ( it is basically the same advice I gave a few days ago about wine stains in carpet):



Get some borax powder from a hardware store or supermarket. Make up a solution of about half a glass of hot water to dissolve about a level tablespoon of the borax and add a tablespoon of white vinegar. Stir it and pour it into an empty sprayer bottle.  Spray some of the solution onto your black marks. Not too much. You don't want the liquid to soak through to the underlay. Sprinkle some more borax onto it. Not too much...Wait a minute or two ( it's not really important how long, but not too long!) then get a dry old cotton rag/towel and press it with your thumb, perhaps, onto the moist area of carpet for a few seconds, then use a new part of the cloth and press again. You should see a lot of the dark color is now on your rag. Repeat the process until the carpet is much cleaner. You can then also rub across the marks. Next, if you want to, put some water on the spot and press again to remove any residue of borax and vinegar. If your carpet was actually burnt from a spark, then some of the fibres may be permanently discolored and I don't think you can do anything about that.

Washing To Clean Ugg Boots



Single layered sheepskin Ugg boots with the wool on the inside can be hand washed in cold to luke warm water using a mild wool detergent. Don't put them in a washing machine. Hand wash them. Use a suede brush or nail brush to scrub and agitate the inside wool in order to free dirt. Use fine sandpaper to remove stubborn grease stains from the outer layer.



Rinse with a clean sponge using cold water.



Do not use hot water or hot heat after washing. You can place the boot in the spin cycle of your washing machine to wring out the water.



Let the boots dry in the outside air and what ever you do, don't place them near heat since that will really shrink the footwear. When they dry they will already have shrunk a little which is natural. After wearing them for a few hours they will regain their shape.



If you get spotting because of raindrops on the outer layer you can rub the leather against itself to remove the stains.

I love Tide. It pretty cheap if you buy it in bulk. I love it because it's the only detergent that gets stains out and it cleans the best. (It also smells great)

Tide is the best to be used.  The cheap products you have to usually use double the amount.....which you'll spend the same amount of money as if you were to buy the good brand.....that's why I use Tide.

Self cleaning oven question?



I have a new oven and it's self cleaning. I set the self clean function and let it run, now that it's done thought there is still some crud in there and the window is still greasy and has some goo on it from when my apple pie exploded last night. So how can I clean it? I used to use Easy Off on my last oven, but I don't know if it's okay to use it on a self cleaning oven. I've tried using my green Mrs. Meyers cleaner, and Fantasitik and it's not working well.

You can use it on self cleaning ovens, just not on continuous cleaning ovens.  I made that mistake.

Self cleaning, what a joke, it never works. How the makers can still legally claim that is criminal. I have tried virtually everything and still cant get mine properly cleaned. Try putting a tray in the bottom to catch anything that drips, that's easier to clean than the oven itself. Then its just a case of getting hubby to do it lol or just do the best you can. Mmmm apple pie, love it.

Easy Off will probably be OK, but check the manual or contact the manufacturer first. They will probably suggest running another cleaning cycle. The general principal of a self cleaning oven is tha t it cranks up to ~800F and incinerates everything.



In the future, I would also recommend "elbow-grease" cleaning after something like a pie explosion before using the oven for cooking again - or running the self cleaning cycle.



Good luck.

When there is left over "crud" in my oven after using the self clean function, I usually grab my plastic scrubber and a bucket of water and scrub it off.  Mine is a Whirlpool Gold with the glass top, and most of the time does a good job, just have to wipe out the charred pieces -- but sometimes when I use the short time method there is some left over "crud" to contend with.  Also, my oven has always left my window dirty after self cleaning so I use my trusty plastic scrubber and Softscrub.



Although they now sell Easy Off for self cleaning ovens, I am afraid to use it.  My husband has lung problems so I have to be careful with all my cleaning products.

Fisher Paykel dishdrawer?



I have a FP dishdrawer- it is 3 years old, and has been rarely used.
The other nite I did try to use the bottom one, and it would not work.  F@.  I have a manual, but need help from someone who knows what they are doing- please, if you are not familiar with this unit, don't reply- it just makes finding help worse.
FP will not let anyone talk to a technician- nobody.
Also- the top drawer wouldn't open correctly the same nite the bottom one stopped.
These are a piece of junk.
I need help, and would like to be in touch by email with someone who could help.

How long do I have to wait in-between using bleach and ammonia?



I need to use bleach for something in my bathroom. But the clorox wipes I use have ammonia in them. How long after using one will I need to wait before using the other? I don't want to create any noxious fumes!



</question>



<additional details>



How can I stop using them both when the cleaners I'm using have them in them!!!???  Like I said (if you even read the question) the clorox wipes I use have ammonia in them. I need to use the bleach in my drain. I need to know how long to wait in-between using them so I don't die! Sheesh!



The clorox wipes are specifically for the bathroom... it says on the container not to use it in areas where I'll be preparing food...



I use vinegar for a lot of things in the bathroom... but there are some things that it just won't work with. Like deodorizing the sink. I've tried the old baking soda, vinegar, and hot water combination several times. The only thing that's unclogged my drains (there are 3 girls with long thick hair) is bleach.



I simply want to know how long to wait in-between using the two. I normally don't use bleach. Should I wait hours? days? I don't want to create deadly fumes. That's the question. I know all about vinegar and natural products. I've been cleaning with my family business since I was 4! I just want to know how long to wait!!! Can anyone tell me?

If you are using the bleach in the drain then you probably are letting it sit for a while to do its job.  After you are done you should run some hot water down the drain to see if it is cleared up.  After running warm or hot water down the drain it will be safe to use a cleaner containing ammonia, since virtually all the bleach is either used up and turned to salt or down below the trap which will prevent fumes getting in the house.

hair stuck in the sink or anywhere creates an horrific smell a great surface cleaner is Lysol and get an strainer that keeps things from going down your sink and . also ammonia is very strong but if you use it and let it sit for at least 5 min. and then pour hot scolding water down the drain that will help wonders you also try Borax and or alcohol,they clean various surfaces and don't create harmful fumes.

Save the amonia wipes for greasy messes in the kitchen.  Use "bleach" wipes in the bathroom.



Even if you are not using much, you have the potential to make some very seriously nasty fumes.  Clorine gas was used in WWII as a chemical weapon.  The amount would be small, but why mess with it at all?

You should stop using them both.  Use a disinfectant in the bath room bleach and ammonia are old school professionals don't even use them any longer.



Remember with a disinfectant you have a ten minute kill time so spray it down and let it sit for then minutes then wipe it down.

So now you are learning the valuable lesson of being a squeaky wheel.  You need to constantly ask and become a pest about the second apaprtment so the mgmt company doesn't like seeing you enough to move your request to the top of the list.



Also if the first apartment has bugs, the second one does as well.



You're better off demanding the kind of bug eradication that requires all humans and pets to be out of the apartment for 24 hours while it works.  Then demand they pay for a cleaning crew to clean all the surfaces.

Thats what is happening at our house too. We did two things. First we bought some Ant killing spary at home depot. It works very well, then we just wiped them off the counter with a paper towel. Next (if that doesnt work) we hired a bug killing agency. They sprayed our whole house with anti-bug fumes (non toxic) but we had to move out for 3 days. the company that fumed our house did it really well. Hope this helps!

Sounds like it's going to rain. Not much you can really do about that but if you want you can always get traps. If not ants hate vinegar, oregano, fabric softener. Put fabric softener sheets on the counter after you wipe them down with vinegar. About the ones in the drain, you're only going to get them if you poison the nest so lay down a bait trap so they carry some poison back to the nest. Good luck- I hate ants.

Bleach and apple cider vinegar, mixed 50/50 and leave it sit in an open bowl while at work or on vacation. Do it as many times needed.



It will wipe anything out permanently.



What you smell may be a form of mold that can not be removed by normal means.



All flooded homes in Louisiana is livable if they did this treatment.

usually, dusts are caught in fabrics. So, its good if you could beat those things you can't wash, wash those you can.

I would use a little Murphy's Oil Soap in hot water and then damp mop it.  If you're talking about a poly finish, it's tougher than you'd think.  Just be careful to wring the mop out so that it's only damp, not soaking wet.
