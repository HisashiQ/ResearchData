If they're over 5 years old you can't go wrong with sparklers! Kids love that kind of thing - I used to write my name with them =] Just keep an eye on them and make sure you've got a bucket of water/sand nearby =]

I used to have a great time on Bonfire Night with my family as a child.



The best memories I have are of barbecued sausages and burgers with lots of onion!



We used to really enjoy making the Guy together. I'd ask all my neighbours for a small piece to make the Guy with before they'd all come over for the bonfire night gathering at mum and dads!



We also used to have toffee apples, which I'd help mum to make. She'd mix up the toffee and I'd pop the apples in!



A barbecue is always good at Bonfire Night-and roast potatoes that have been slightly cooled so you can eat them! YUM!!

While that sounds great for adults, Kids like smores and hot dogs.  And ghost stories and games.  Roasting their own hot dogs on sticks or skewers and toasting their marshmallows for the smores is part of campfire fun.  We all remember it from our days.  Let them.

Google homemade gifts and a bunch of sites will come up with great ideas for you to choose from.



You could also go to Michael's or another craft store and buy some ceramics, boxes, etc.  to paint.  They will also have a lot of other crafts that you can choose from. Homemade Chocolate-Go to Michael's, WalMart, or candy supply store and choose the molds that you want to buy and pick up the chocolate and whatever fillings you may want.  Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave.  If you do it in the microwave put it in for about 20 seconds stir and repeat until completely melted.  Make sure you stir the bottom so it doesn't burn.  Then pour into your molds and place in the Freezer.  when the mold is cloudy take it out and flip them over and shake gently.  If they don't come out put them back into the freezer.

have you tried to search it on yahoo or google? I know personally I plan to make blankets... Purchase 2 pieces of fleece.. I try to buy 2 different pieces for example one piece has puppies on it the other side is just plain purple... the size of the fabric should be 1 yard and a half each....... place the two pieces on top of one another and cut slits alll the way around the edges.. this gives it a fringe effect.... then tie the finge pieces together and you have a nice blanket...

Who really is qualified to tell you about Islam?



Are you qualified? What is the only thing that we are allowed to call to the world outside our circles of trust?
Is it not line 1 verse 1 only?



</question>



<additional details>



man - your right not muslims anyone is muslim even the POPE was born muslim and he is not qualified to teach anything. MUMMINS are the ones that are in dawa not just any muslim.



Omar - is that next to the one that says "I am a retard of the year" award you got?



medc - you mean the Quran alone is enough? Is that what you are talking about. I can write can't I, of course I can read but what am I reading if I don't understand it fully nor was taught how to read it properly?



Again who is qualified to teach Islam? Surely not any of you! LOL thats a pasta fajoli!



Salman there is only 2 types of people left here since Muhammed SAW left... those in dawa and those in jalaleen... those who practice as MUMMINS and the rest are muslims... so your wrong, not everyone is qualified and not everyone is able to teach what is needed to be taught, that is why this ummah is in the state it is in because of what you just said.



Nida - The quran came to Muhammed SAW in revelations I don't see anyone washing my soul and inserting wisdom! I don't see Gibreal beside me now do you? Again Al Quran is not the only format of teaching, it is good for those who have pure hearts but again most people that read Al Quran have no idea what it means. So again your wrong also.

That is correct no brother is better than any other brother other than in dawa of Allah SWT. So the most qualified is the one that teaches, the rest can only suggest, ask and interperate what they believe.

Where I live Wal Mart is putting pictures on mouse pads, glasses, car cups, tee shirts and a few other things and I'm sure they do it online or at other stores.  I hope to get a picture of my grand daughter's boyfriend with her so I can put it on a mouse pad.

The children have been ordered by Allah to obey their parents at all costs. In case the parents teach the children something that goes against Islam, the children should ignore that, but even then they have to be polite and behave well with their parents, and take care of them.



There is no scope of deserting your parents in the eyes of Islam.

About hijabs websites..(it's a real question)?



Salam alaikum!
Eid Mubarak!
Ok, I want to make orders for hijabs and islamic stuff on the internet. I found 2 websites, of which I think could be good. I wanted to know if anyone have been customers to those, and if their products have came the same as when ordered (colors, size, quantities, qualities...), and in a short time?! I am in Canada, so I am expecting a small delay (due to border crossings and stuff.. but still).
AND please, do not report me, I am not, in any ways, promoting websites of any kind. I am just wondering if anyone have made business with them, to know for their services. Thanks...
The websites are alhannah.com, and 411hijabs.com
Again, do not report me please....it's real questions.
Does anyone have other/better websites, or website I should not get into?... It's my first time shopping for hijabs/islamic stuff online! Have a safe and happy Eid everyone!
Ma3salam!

@ Iranian Princess:.... I'm no sure what you are talking about... are you living in your own world or something. If you are ex-muslim, then why are you coming on this section, and always give a bad comment on almost all serious questions?!... Ok, so you are not muslim, I think we all got it now. Anyways, have a good day.

411hijab is in Dallas TX (I believe) and Im thinking about ordering from them soon.
I've never tried alhannah but I have ordered from www.ejilbab.com  and there are a few items on www.hamidahsfashion.com



I would say check and see the prices and the cost they charge for shipping.
Hope you find what you need.

Hi!



Where are you in Canada?  I'm in Toronto, and there are stores here that sell "Muslim-friendly" clothes, including hijabs.  Unless you're importing for re-sale, you might be able to find some closer to home.



One store in particular had a very nice girl working there.  Since I'm Christian, I had NO IDEA how to put on a hijab, and she helped me do it.  e-mail me if you're here, and I can help you with addresses.

I love christmas but enough already!!

I think it's a great idea for stocking stuffers. I always get my son a bag of "Santa's Coal" chewing gum, for the times when he's been naughty. My mom used to put an apple, an orange, and a lemon in my stocking. The lemon was a little joke for when I was naughty, not nice. My son also collected Yu Gi O cards, so I would put a pack or two of those in there with his other stocking stuffers.

When I got married, for my first Christmas with my husband, money was tight.. so I went to Michaels craft store, and bough several bows, like the kind you put on presents. Big ones, little ones, curly ones. And then, I put them in strategic places on my body, and gave him myself as a present! It was really fun to be "unwrapped", and he really enjoyed it.

When do your sins start getting counted?



Do they get counted when you reach puberty or before that. I hope it is puberty because When I first turned 15 i commited a sin that i am very ashamed of and i regret it. now that i think about it i cry and i don't want to go to hell. I have a fear of going to hell. I am so stupid. I didn't get my first period yet, so do all my sins before my first period not get counted? please help.

When you are old enough to become aware that what your doing is sinning. And don't forget, IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW WORN, DIRTY, OLD AND TATTERED A DOLLAR BILL IS, IT'S STILL WORTH A DOLLAR! And btw, all you have to do is ask Jesus for forgiveness, and whatever you've done in the past is forgiven. Don't let the past run your future. Learn from it and move on!

after puberty, when you become aware of your action, or in other words when you start performing calculated actions on purpose to accomplish your own intentions.



we say that a child is innocent because his intentions are always good, while an adult's intentions could be either good or bad and therefore should be accountable for them.

_________________________________
"Puberty is known in Islamic law as al-bulugh, or Tamyeez, (coming of age as a man and woman). There are three signs of puberty (bulugh):



1. Discharging semen as a result of wet dreams, known as inzaalul-manyyi. Allah (SWT) states: "But when the children among you come of age, let them also ask for permission, as do those senior to them in age..." (Al-Qur'an, 24-59)



In a hadith, the Messenger of Allah (saas) said: "Friday bath (ghuslul-Jum'ah) is mandatory upon anyone who has experienced a wet dream." (Bukhari/Muslim) The point in this hadith is that Islamic obligations are not incumbent on anyone until they reach the age of bulugh.



2. Appearance of hair around the pubic area is another sign of puberty. If a person sees that even without wet dreams, he or she has attained puberty. This may happen at the age of thirteen or fourteen, and parents should inform girls and boys about these signs.



3. Reaching 15 years of age: When the person reaches 15, he or she is a man or a woman, and anything that is obligatory on a man or woman is obligatory on him or her from that time on.



In a hadith reported by Abdullah Bin Umar (raa), he said: "My parents brought me to the Messenger of Allah on the eve of the Uhud Campaign and I was fourteen years old, so the Prophet (saas) did not enlist me in fighting." But a year later in the Campaign of Al-Khandaqq, I was fifteen, so this time the Prophet (saas) enlisted me in combat." (Muslim)



This hadith indicates the age of 15 is the legal age for a Muslim boy or girl to be responsible for his or her religion as well as worldly responsibilities. Some of us who reside in the western world, seem to think adulthood depends on State laws. In some states it is 18, while in others it is 19, or 21, and so on. This is a very serious mistake, as the juvenile will reach puberty (bulugh) and adulthood, but go on without observing his or her Islamic duties, such as Salat, fasting, or being restrained from that which is prohibited.
Puberty - Girls



Girls reach puberty and adulthood when they experience the above three signs. However, they have a fourth sign, that is, menstruation (hayd). Whenever a girl experiences it, she is a woman even if she is 12 years old. At that time, the Qalam, the pen of responsibilities, begins to flow and to record the deeds of the servant, good or bad. It is interesting that in the western world the case is the reverse. You see, when a juvenile reaches the age of puberty in Al-Islam he or she should be careful about anything he or she does or says. On the contrary, in the West when the person comes of age, he or she is allowed to do things which are detrimental to his or her well being. They are licensed to read, watch, and listen to so- called adult material, as if when one is an adult it is time to be irresponsible.



Indeed, if puberty is attained during the days of Ramadan, say at midday, and the young person is fasting, he or she should continue his or her fasting and there will be no obligation on him or her to make up the fast. If he was not fasting, it is incumbent upon him to observe the rest of the day in fasting, because he has become an adult upon whom Islamic rites are obligatory. Girls in menstruation can't observe half day, nor should they make that half day up."

Yes your sins start counting when your get your period,(for girls)
Allah SWT does not want to punish people, he loves when his servents ask for forgivness ,Allah loves those people who put their hope into him only. Inshallah Allah will forgive if it was a sin.



The prophet Muhammed SAW pbah said "The best of sinners are those who repent to Allah sincerely'



There isnt really and Aya in the Quran that says when your accountable but you should look for HADeeths I read a hadeeth once that said The prophet Muhammed SAW pbah said that when you reach the age of puberty you are accountable but since your 15 i guess you are accountable since 12 and 13 are the age of puberty. If you know right from  wrong then just dont do a sin if you know its a sin, inshallah Allah is the most forgiving.

I am quite sure you will not be going to hell, at least not to the metaphorical hot fiery one.. The word hell actually usually refers to the grave. The hot one - gehenna in the original language - refers to the place outside the walls of Jerusalem where the rubbish of the city was thrown and burnt. It is thought that probably people who were crucified and their bodies unclaimed were thrown into this valley where the fires burned.



It was this image that probably everyone in Jerusalem would recognize when Jesus mentioned 'burning in hell'.



If we are truly sorry for what we do we only have to pray to the LORD God through His son Jesus for forgiveness. God hears us and if He knows that we truly are sorry our sins are blotted out. This is what the Bible tells us so never be afraid.



Some churches sadly make people feel dreadfully guilty, which is not what God wants. He just wants us to try hard not to sin but human nature means that in God's eyes we are all sinful whether we are priests or members of the congregation. Jesus is the only man who has not sinned, though he was tempted. Jesus did not sin because he knew his Father had a very special purpose for him.  xxx

Islam prohibits males and females from flirting with Muslim or



non-Muslims, being alone with them and having physical relationship.



It is not haram if they talk in public place, library or discuss in class room in the process of their education or eat in restaurant in the company of other friends  to get to know each other with intention to get married without touching each other. .



Allah commands to females in quran to protect their private parts, keep their gaze down walking in street and not step on the path that may lead to physical relationship. Pre-marital sex or having any kind of physical relationship with a male is abolutely Haram (prohibited) in Islam before marriage.



Restraining onself from having physical relationship is hard once becoming intimate with each other.. For this reason Muslim girls are taught to stay away from boys except the normal talk in class room or discussion in meating etc.  We are taught to maintain purity of hearts, body and souls all the times.

No it's haraam.  You'll start out being friends, and then it will grow into something more(I know from experience).  You'll end up developing feelings for each other that should only be for your husband or wife/wives.  Men and women shouldn't intermingle with each other or interact with each other outside of blood relations.  They should be seperated at all times, unless it's around immediate family members(husband, sons, mother, father, grandparents, grandkids, daughters)

The problem is that while some of us know our limits there are tons more who don't. All around you, especially in those places where free interaction between the opposite sexes is in vogue, one person gets involved with another, leaves him after everything's done, hooks up with another, even have multiple partners and so on.



Its immoral, and many are even involved in pre-marital (you-know-what).



In Islam culture, there exists strong and firm conditions when interaction occurs between people of opposite sexes, especially for teenagers, and unnecessary interaction is discouraged.



But these are volatile areas. You can't simply prevent a girl from having some guy friends and vice versa. In today's world, it sound impractical.



The only solution is for the guys and gals to always stay reserved and protect their privacy.

Having seen various answers to your question, I want to make one thing clear that the friendship of a woman to a man, non mehram is certainly prohibited as in the teachings of islam.
I do have several GFs but it doesnt change the rules of islam, so Islam prohibits these relations.And every Moslem including should abide by the teachings of Islam at all costs.
May Allah teach us and guoide us to the right path and make all of us practicing Moslems (Aameen)

i think you mean non mahram sister...that means someone whose not your bro, dad, close uncle (mums bro) or son.....basically ppl she cannot marry (through God's permission) are her mahrams.......boys n girls shouldnt communicate with one another alone as shaytaan will always interfere and whisper things that could lead to sins. Even if you are 100% certain that you dont like the guy, shaytaan will persuade you somehow believe me...

What the hell the answers he are just stupid. What if you have a class assignment to do and your partner is a girl. Are you not going to interact and just get very bad grades.



Keep in mind after Muhammad's wives had to interact a lot with men after Muhammad's death to sort the saying of Muhammad and for business purpose.



Now if the mothers of believers can do so why can't other Muslims?



I think the people here are to narrow-minded and think that men and woman have sex on their mind 24/7.

I've learned a lot over the years. I've been married twice, and I've come to the conclusion that the first time I didn't think, the second time I thought with my heart, and next time, (if there is a next time), I'm gonna think with my head. I am now extremely picky, and have certain standards that he will have to meet before I even think about dating him. I am very sentimental though as far as things go. I also am all squishy when it comes to animals, old people and babies.

Well, a lot of the music contained within mainstream hip hop and other genres of today is pretty terrible.  Truly, the golden age of music has passed as most of what is in the mainstream today is worthless drivel.  You really have to look hard and deep for any good music; but fear not- it does exist (albeit hidden).

Well, the shops are starting to sell christmas stuff, therefore why shouln't you start to feel christmasy?
I would start and put a bit up each week, rather than going all the way now (including tree). Saying that, my neighbours leave their window decorations there until April, which I think is way worse than starting to decorate in October.
Merry Christmas!!!

I wouldn't completely decorate but do a few things.Its so tempting when you see it in the stores. my daughther's first Christmas we had our tree up at Halloween  cos we couldn't wait to see what she thought of the lights by christmas my oldest and hubby were sick of it but me and the baby still loved it. and my tree is always up 2 weeks before thanksgiving so go ahead and start doing it now and enjoy yourself for christmas while everyone else runs around shopping and complaining about how they have to decorate and do this you will be one step ahead.

Inside or outside? But it doesn't really matter, put them up if you want. There are no laws saying you have to wait. You may, however, decide to wait to turn on outside lights until late November, just because it can get really expensive. Personally, mine are going up on November 1st! (only in my room, my mom won't let Christmas decorations be set up anywhere else until about December 14th) I love Christmas, but I also love Halloween, that's why they're waiting. MERRY CHRISTMAS!

When I go into the stores in October and I find Christmas music and decorations I get furious.  The capitalist swines who want all our money will stop at nothing to get their product sold.  They inundate our children with toys and games; they overwhelm our senses with raunchy music and even raunchier packaging; they submerge us in their never ending search for our precious funds.

I'm with you. I want to put them up too. But I know if I do they wont be special near christmas. Look at it this way, Christmas is in 12 weeks and 1 day. It would be feasible to put them up in 7 weeks time (Nov 19th), and 7 weeks is nothing! You can hold out for 49 days!



In the meantime, go to shops and buy decorations, decide which colour scheme you want and light lots of candles. You might also consider starting your christmas shopping now! That always makes me feel christmassy.

Not only her, all the wives of the Prophet (s).



The Prophet is nearer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are as mothers to them. And blood-relations are nearer to one another, according to the Book of Allah, than other believers from among the Helpers and the Emigrants except that you show kindness to your friends. This is also written down in the Book. (33:6)



O wives of the Prophet! if any of you be guilty of manifestly dishonorable conduct, the punishment will be doubled for her. And that is easy for Allah. (33:30)



We do not curse her as meekel is suggesting, but we do knowledge that she fought Imam Ali (as), and 10000 Muslims died that day, cause of her, and she will be judged accordingly. Allah says the mother of believers should not leave their homes, she went to fight Imam Ali (s) in the battle of Jammal for miles.

Because she was one of the wives of the Prophet (p.b.u.h.):



033.006 النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَى بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ وَأَزْوَاجُهُ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ وَأُولُو الأرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَى بِبَعْضٍ فِي كِتَابِ اللَّهِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُهَاجِرِينَ إِلا أَنْ تَفْعَلُوا إِلَى أَوْلِيَائِكُمْ مَعْرُوفًا كَانَ ذَلِكَ فِي الْكِتَابِ مَسْطُورًا



033.006 The Prophet is closer to the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers. Blood-relations among each other have closer personal ties, in the Decree of Allah. Than (the Brotherhood of) Believers and Muhajirs: nevertheless do ye what is just to your closest friends: such is the writing in the Decree (of Allah).



Al-Qur'an, 033.006 (Al-Ahzab [The Clans, the Coalition, the Combined Forces])



But, of course, some people like to curse the Mothers of the Believers going against the statements of the Qur'an.

What can i do................?



My grandma is 61 years old, and her daughters (my aunts) leave their kids at her house everyday so they can go work.



My aunts don't pray my grandma enough money. For instance, my grandma only gets £60 pounds from one of my aunts every month, and the other aunt says 'i am not going to pay just pick up my child from school and don't give her food if there isn't any' !



I visited my grandma today and she was crying. It was painful to see a old woman cry. She is only 61 years old, and she doesn't even look it! She hardly has any wrinkles!
So my mum gave her money and said go out treat yourself, but my grandma keeps buying food for her house and she cooks everyday and hardly anyone gives her money to go out and get the food! So she has to use her pension money to buy food and stuff for the house, which is so unfair!



My grandma also pays bills for the internet with her pension money, and she doesn't even use the Internet! My uncle, his son and his wife use the internet and they don't bother to cough up!



It is so heartbreaking to see a old woman going through so much pain. I know my grandma has done many wrong things, but she is still human and every human makes mistakes...



She also had to go hospital a couple of days later because she was so stressed and she was vomiting and ended up with a ear infection which can lead to her having one deaf ear...



What can i do or say to help her get money from my aunts? Seriously...?

Aww.



Maybe you should gather all of your aunties and uncles and your gradma together (make an excuse for a meal/ davaat to get them to come even). Once everyones there, then say something and let your grandma tell them how she feels about it. Discuss what the problem is and how it's very unfair for an old lady who should be relaxing at her age. Inshallah something can be arranged to sort it out.



If you really want your grandma to be worry free, then maybe volunteer to take care of the kids sometimes, to let your gradma relax. Suggest that you all put money into her weekly shopping for the kids. If your grandma is finding it difficult to look after them altogether, then put money into a baby sitter, or a carer who can help your grandma.



I think it's very unfair for your aunties to do that and not even pay her for food etc, the reason why they drop them off at your grandma's is for work, so where's the money from all that work going if they don't even take care of their kids!?

Gift Ideas for Boyfriend?



Ok, im already thinking about Christmas.... So,trying to think of what to get/makefor my boyfriend. Let me tell you a little bit about him (& i)



He's 21 yrs old, we basically dont drink... margarita every now and then,occasionally glass of wine with dinner... He and i have been together for almost a year and a half, with being friends for about 6years now. We live together, for for the past yearish.. Ok, Now,hes not into sports, very much into video games (warhammer, star wars galaxies, city of heroes, vanguard, Everquest2...) He likes science...mainly astronomy... planets, stars....galaxies....and he absolutely loves physics....thats about all i can really think of... Lets see, so far,i think im going to try and get him a DVD set of "planet earth"  because thats soemthing that he wants... i usually make my gifts, and so ill probably make hiim a little other something, either an ornament or a fleece blanket... Last year he got me a laptop among alot of other gifts, and i felt so bad, because all i did was make him a stocking and put things in it.... so i know that he spent prob. around $800 on me... or more.. so, im trying to find something really really nice to get him or make him... any ideas would be much appreciated.!



Thanks alot in advance!

Get him an Xbox 360!!  Sure Playstation 3 has better graphics but the 360 is much better for the fun factor!

Get him this one!  (Copy and past the link!)  Also some good games to start this Si-Fi dude is Mass Effect and Star Wars: Force unleashed.  Make sure you get it from a place like Game Crazy or Gamestop because they hook up free rentals an what not.



Get an extra controller too!

Shias whole religion is based on cursing and abusing not only Muawiyah,(RA) But the family and all companion of prophets.



They r doing it ,considering it , as a Ibadah (act of worship)..



Shias' book says that all companions were Munafiq and turned toward kufr (mazallah),except three



which were ,miqdad,Abuzar ghiffari and salman farsi.



Does it make any sense ?



Their books r filled with haterd for sahaba and family  of prophet(saw).



We can't even read those things .or repeat them



Unless its very important to do so.



One of the islamic scholar said:



.ومن يكن يطعن فى معاوية

We read in Sahih Muslim, Chapter of Virtues of Companions, Section of Virtues of Ali - see Chapter p1284, Tradition #5916



Muawiyah, the son of Abu Sufyan, gave order to Sa'd, and told him: "What prevents you that you are refraining from cursing Abu Turab (nickname of Ali)?" Sa'd replied: "Don't you remember that the Prophet said three things about (the virtue of) Ali? So I will never curse Ali."



Ibn Kathir records:



"Mu'awiya ibn Sufiyan ordered Sa'd [ibn Abi Waqas], saying to him: 'What prevents you from insulting (tasabb) Abu Turab?"



In her letter Umm Salama [ra] the mother of believers the wife of the Prophet (s) wrote to Muawiya:



"...You are cursing Allah and His messenger on your minbar, and that is because you are cursing Ali Ibn Abi Talib and whomever loves him, and I am a witness that Allah and His messenger loved him." But no one paid any attention to what she said.



One of the favorite scholars of Salafies/Wahaies namely Muhammad bin Abdulhadi al-Sindi (d. 1138 H) in his esteemed commentary of Sunan Ibn Majah testified that Muawiyah ordered Sa'ad to curse Ali bin Abi Talib [as].



نال معاوية من علي ووقع فيه وسبه بل أمر سعدا بالسب كما قيل في مسلم والترمذي



"Muawiya insulted and abused Ali, verily he also ordered Sa'ad to abuse Ali as it is mentioned in Muslim and Tirmidhi"



Sharh Sunnan ibn Majah, Kitab al-Muqadma, Chapter: Merits of Ali bin Abi Talib [ra]



The reference can also be read on the online Sharah Sunan Ibn Majah at the folowing Salafi website:



http://hadith.al-islam.com/Display/Displ...



The Messenger of Allah said: "Loving Ali is the sign of belief, and hating Ali is the sign of hypocrasy."

Do you think it's too early to start buying christmas presents, and if so WHY?



I started in August. I had 20 people to buy for and now I have 3. Whenever I bring it up at work people say "Oh God, how can you even THINK about christmas yet?" But I don't see why people think it's silly to start buying early. After August pay day there are only 3 pay days left before christmas, and nearer christmas you need to buy (if you have them) christmas chocolates, christmas food, christmas drinks, party outfits and you also need money for taxis, meals and drinks out. So if you leave it until nearer christmas surely you'll just have less money as gifts need to be bought too?!

I feel the same way, I shop early for most of my important gifts.



I still continue shopping through the holiday season but most of what I buy is items that go on deep sales before xmas, all I have to do is pick of a few hot sale items, this saves me money and stress of shopping during the busy season, giving me mroe time to focus on decorating cooking, and of curse family, which is the most important part of the holidays.



There is also a large amount of things that don't have good sales during the holiday shopping season (no sales or equal to or worse sales then now.)
By doing this I get to shop around, I also have a long time to find that gift that is "just right", by the time the begining of December comes around so much is picked over and there is very little choice left on the shelves.

Hello Red Cat person after my own heart i always start early makes sense to me since i have so many i want to buy for and so little money it takes the pressure off and you are right we already have so many other things to worry about the closer we get to Christmas that this is just one less thing i have to think about. that way i can just enjoy the days leading up to with out the worry and fighting the crowds that one of the reasons i shop early i hate have to shop with a crowd and it so much easier on the old pocket book what with the cost of everything going up except that.

There are 3 reasons for starting buying presents beforehand:
1) You don't involve yourself into Christmas presents rush
2) Some things may cost less now than right before Christmas
3) If you see a really good present now, there is no guarantee that it would be available before Christmas.

Have you ever sponsored a family for Christmas?



In Canada we have a program through the Salvation Army where middle-class and upper-class people sponsor a low-income family for Christmas.  These sponsors buy gifts and food and Christmas items for specific families, and anonymously, make a low-income family's Christmas a whole lot better.



My family has been the recipient of these wonderful gifts, but because these gift are anonymous I have never had the chance to thank these amazing people.  So if you have ever sponsored a family ... Thank You from the bottom of my heart.

What to get my sister for Christmas?



She's my half-sister...the only sibling i have.



She's 12 years older than me. Currently she moved in with us because of money problems. I  don't really know her, she moved out to her dad's house when i was born, so I never got to know her like a real sister.

I believe that they are real. You can read the 4th verse in the 113th Surat, Surat Al-Falaq, of the Qur'an which states (what means):



113.004 وَمِنْ شَرِّ النَّفَّاثَاتِ فِي الْعُقَدِ
113.004 From the mischief of those who practise secret arts;



Al-Qur'an, 113.004 (Al-Falaq [The Daybreak, Dawn])



Don't mind the translation, the verse teaches you to take refuge in Allah from the witchcrafts. It is also mentioned that the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) was also bewitched and then later was taught by the archangel Jibreel (Jubra'eel) to seek refuge in Allah from the effects of magic.



As for superstitions, I personally don't believe in them because they are mostly words with no basis and just conjecture.

if you are talking about the zakat al-fitr, I believe it is best to give that to your local Islamic mosque/charity.  If you want to send in something as a sadaqa, then there are several organizations worldwide which accept such donations.

WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE IN KILLING OF KARBALÂ?



It should be borne in mind that this tragedy did not take place all of a sudden like a bolt from the blue. It was in fact the manifestation of the plot of Sabayees which had claimed the life of Uthman , the third Caliph and the son-in-law of the Prophet



Twenty- five years earlier. Caliph Uthman’s martyrdom took place on 18th of Dhu Al-Hajj, 36 A.H.



In the next twenty years which include the reigns of Omar and Uthman , the second and third Caliph of Islaam, many more countries were conquered under the banner of Islaam and the Muslim empire extended over a vast expanse of the globe, comprising Iraq, Syria, Iran on one side and a large part of North Africa including Egypt and Morocco on the other. But the historical process has its immutable laws. As the Revolution of the Prophet  was challenged by the reactionary movements on the Arab land, the same happened with the conquests of those two Caliphs. The first target of these reactionaries was the person of Omar who was assassinated by Abu Luloo Feroze, a Parsi slave from Iran. It was purely an Iranian plot hatched by Hurmuzan, an Iranian general, who thought that if Omar was removed from the scene, the empire of Islaam would fall like a house of cards. But by the grace of Allah (SWT), it survived the calamity. Abdullah Ibn Saba, a Jew from Yemen, under the garb of a Muslim, took his sojourn at Madeenah. He had all the trappings of an expert plotter and the Jewish genius at intrigues, an attribute of his clan. He planted subversive ideas among the people. He pleaded for the usurped rights of the house of the Prophet  Muhammad , carried out a propaganda campaign against Caliph Uthman and incited the people to revolt. He declared Ali to be the rightful successor to the Prophet Muhammad  and dubbed Uthman  as a usurper. He told people that every Prophet has a wasee and Ali is the wasee of Prophet Mohammad and, therefore, entitled to be the caliph after the Prophet. He also preached the divinity of Ali , thus striking at  Tauheed, the very root of Islaam. The Iranians, who had embraced Islaam only a few years before, were taken in by this propaganda because they had a long history of kingship and hero-worship. They were familiar with the divine rights of kings, and hero-worship was diffused in their blood. They readily accepted these ideas and became their champions. Similarly Abdullah Ibn Saba floated another viewpoint related to the second appearance of Prophet Isa (AS). He argued that Prophet Muhammad , who is the best amongst the prophets of Allaah (SWT), would also appear with Christ, for the contrary would imply that he is inferior to Prophet Isa (AS). This was the same argument used by the Qadianis in later years, who invented the notion of the death and burial of Prophet Isa (AS) in Kashmir. They argued that it was illogical for Prophet Muhammad to have died and for Prophet Isa (AS) to be alive in the heaven. Unsophisticated and illiterate Muslims saw a point of adoration in it for Prophet Muhammad and fell an easy prey to that sort of propaganda.



Abdullah Ibn Saba travelled all over the Muslim lands and set up his propaganda centers at Basra and Kufa, but his attempts failed in Damascus. Then he went to Egypt where he formed a party of his supporters. Consequently, the last two years of Caliph Uthman’s reign were filled with machinations, intrigue, and turmoil all over Muslim territories. It culminated in the most unjustified murder (martyrdom) of Caliph Uthman who was the ruler of a vast empire and had tens of thousands of soldiers under his command but refused to shed the blood of Muslims in self-protection. Governors of provinces from all over the empire besought the Caliph to allow them to send troops to quell the uprising and to protect his person from the rebels who had surrounded his residence, but he remained strict and steadfast in his decision. It is perhaps a unique and unprecedented episode in the entire history of mankind that a very powerful man, like the Caliph Uthman , refused to use authority for his personal safety and let himself be assassinated. May Allah (SWT) shower His blessings on him.



The murder of Habeel (son of Adam) by his brother Qabeel is perhaps an incident comparable to Caliph Uthman’s assassination. When Qabeel declared his intention to kill Habeel, the latter announced his resolve, in the words of the Qur'ân:



Even if thou stretch out thy hand against me, I shall not stretch out my hand against thee to kill thee; lo! I fear Allah the Lord of the worlds. (Al-Ma’ida 5:28)

Islamic History is very much injected by hypocrites .



After the bright sun is raised of islam by the Effort of Muhammad (saw )& his sincere companions,backed by Allah's Full help .



the people who were not sincere in adopting islam ,had a great deal of jealous .They were burning from inside .



And they tried to bring it down by many means .



one of them was a, lies and fabrications " ,which played an important role in all the tragedies occured .



Uthman's martyrdom was also the result of the act of Hypocrites ,and their fitna didnt stop there .they were continously active .Those r all responsible ,the incident of Karba .



(Shias sources even brings many narations about that fitna ,Ibn Saba .)



so they made the situation so complicated that even sahaba of high rank stood against eachother .( Both having good intention)



And it didnt stop there ,even uptill now ,that germs r active among muslims .



So we better ,forget the fabricated history .(history student knows ver well that the same book who talks ill about some one ,on the next page praises the same person



the problem of shias is that they take every thing which goes in favour of their self made (based on shirk ) Concept of Imamat .and reject other.
And as their  false believes r supported by their So called 12th imam ,they r not ready to accepet any thing else.



WE MUST move on with Quran & sunnah

Ubaydullah Ibn Ziyad (the governor of Yazid in Kufah) was leaving Iraq to Syria after killing Hussian (as) in the battle of Karbala, with a guard of his followers. Shuraih (the payroll Judge who gave verdict that the blood of Imam Husain is Halaal) noticed that he was silent for a long time, he approached him and said: "O Ubaydullah, I think it bothered you that you killed Husain?! Ubaydullah said: No! Indeed Yazid had ordered me to either kill Husain or he (Yazid) will kill me.



Sunni reference: History of Ibn Athir, v4, p140



The above gives evidence to the fact that he was Yazid who gave the direct order to kill Imam Husain (as). Later, when the scandal of his horrible crime and the abuse of the household of the Prophet started shaking his regime, he condemned the act of Ibn Ziyad in public and disassociated himself. It has also been reported that:



Yazid ordered the head of Husain brought to Syria, when it was put to him he started abusing it and beating it with his stick and said the following Poetry:



I wish that my elders in Badr witness the fear of Khazraj from the falling of the swords. Then they would have cherished and savored (my act) and by saying O Yazid may your arm be powerful (for getting revenge by killing Husain).

lol, your way of typing shows how illiterate you are! And what's with "Prophets", there was only 1 prophet, Muhammad SAW



Anyway, What I think of such a Prophet is that it was very nice of him to let her do whatever she wanted, play with dolls etc.. never had sex with her until the age of 18+ ( we aren't even sure whether she was 9 when she got married, so stop ranting about her marriage at the age of 9) and she had reached puberty so it shouldn't be a problem. And her marriage was NOT forced. A detailed research in Islam will tell you that her marriage was with her and her family's consent. So, it so wasn't a case of Pedophilia.

Gift for bedridden grandma?



Any ideas for a special and suitable gift for a bedridden elderly person?



My grandparents raised me, and we were really close. I now live in another city and don't see her often. She first broke *both* of her hips (she is really tiny and fragile) and then had a stroke (DVT clot) from being bedridden. Her vision is very poor. She's really gone downhill and this may be our last Christmas together.



She wears compression boots and hospital gowns, so clothing, robes, slippers, etc is not a good option. The nurses have little time to spend with her, so things like lotions and creams probably won't get used/applied. Her vision is poor, and the nurses never put on her glasses, so books and videos are out. She has poor manual dexterity and movement because of the stroke, so crafts, etc. are out. See why I'm stumped!



I was thinking perhaps a musical ornament that I can ask the nurses to wind up or turn out. Thankfully, her hearing is the one thing that is OK.



Is there anyone out there who can help? I want to make her last bits of time her meaningful. I am the only grandchild (!) on that side of the family, and my grandparents raised me for most of my years, so we were very close.



Thanks for your help.

I'd go with a radio headset, or a cassette/dvd player with headphones.  (Something simple, with only a few larger buttons)  You could throw in some books on tape/cd that she would enjoy.  The bible on cd if the bible is important to her.  Maybe even a recording of yourself telling her how great she is and how much you love her.



Something you made yourself might also be a good gift.  A handmade or embroidered pillow to keep in her bed, if you're able to do that kind of thing.  A nice quilt or bed blanket would be used and appreciated.

although her vision may be poor, perhaps having some nice pictures of you made to put up in her room so when she does have her glasses on, she can see the girl she helped raise.  since she doesn't get to see you often, i'm sure she'd like to be reminded what you now look like.



a nice radio with a multi-disc cd player.  get her some cd's that she would like (my grandparents who are in their 70's like the 40's music a lot).



the nurses can help her with it if she can't figure it out.

No...it's part of the joy of childhood.
However...
I wouldn't brainwash the kid with the Jesus stuff until they're old enough to see how illogical it is & how destructive it can be to the fabric of society.
The greatest sin of all is to indoctrinate youngsters with the distorted religious beliefs of adults.(as opposed to harmless childhood fantasy like Santa)
Santa is far more appealing & less damaging to a kid than Jesus could ever hope to be...

I would say no. If it's your christian, your not at all worshiping santa as a god, so it doesn't go against any commandments. Santa is simply a character in our culture that every kid should share in their childhood. It's something fun and magical, it opens up their minds and expands their imagination. Theres no sin in that.

It depends. Do you consider lying to your child a sin?



Personally, I am not telling my kids about Santa. Not because of religious reasons, but because I think it's silly to tell our kids that a fat man rides around on a sleigh giving buckets of presents to "good" (AKA well off) kids around the world in a timeframe of 24 hours.



Any kid with half a brain should be able to see through this, and I'd just feel stupid telling this story with a straight face. There are more important lessons to be taught about Christmas. Tell the kid about the *real* St. Nick....



Also, if you're celebrating Christmas, you might want to tell them about Jesus. Remember him? The concept around which this holiday was created? You don't have to be religious to celebrate winter holidays, but please, make the holidays *meaningful* at least.  Educate your kids. Make them volunteer by visiting homeless shelter with presents or nursing homes with lonely residents who have no one to share the holidays with.



So what if people disagree. So sue me.



Sorry if this comes off as hostile. I don't mean to be, I just want people to remember what Christmas is really about, and not just about wanting heaps and heaps of presents. In my opinion, one meaningful gift and kind words to another person means more than $3000 worth of gifts ever could.

When do other families start decorating the house for Christmas?



well i have a little girl and she loves all the christmas stuff!.....ive been known to put the tree up way too early because we get so excited to see our daughters face when she see's the tree!! last year we decided to go all out decorating the whole house and yard with lights....im just wondering when a good time to start decorating is? i know alot of people wait till the first of december which is what i was going to do but i just feel like you put all this time and money in to decorating and if i wait till december its up for such a short time!! i also don't want to stand out for having my stuff up to early!! ive noticed people slowly starting to get lights up now...not turning them on but puting them all over the house...what do you think? when is the best time to start decorating and when does your family start decorating????

I try and hang lights outside pretty soon here and just leave them shut off because I dont want to climb the roof when its full of ice and snow. We put up our tree the day after Thanksgiving. It gives us something to do without having to go out and try and beat the crowds shopping.

The old tradition's over isn't it?
The twelve days of Christmas (as in "A partridge in a pear tree" etc.)
were from Christmas Eve til January 6th.



And, as a child, bringing in and decorating the Christmas tree on Christmas Eve was absolutely the done thing, and a great thrill.



I still hold on to not a thing before December the 1st, and I'm the last amongst those around me.



I can understand those facing ice and snow by Christmas wanting to get them up, unlit, early on.
Not a problem, here on Bodmin Moor.



(but of course, no-one here keeps their decorations up till January 6th any more, except for massive outdoor displays: I can understand those facing ice and snow by Christmas wanting to get them up, unlit, early on.  And waiting til better weather to take them down.)



But here, some shops had Christmas goods out two weeks ago, and last week I heard my first Christmas music (A singing, animated, Santa).  When it starts that early the cheer and the magic has evaporated by the time Christmas (finally!) arrives.



If we can't get back to Christmas Eve, an embargo until December the first for all would be good. Four weeks of Christmas rather than twelve days, that I could manage.

What did you get for Eid present?



My cousin gave me a pair of boots, he said when you read a surah, (I have this in my pocket) and wear the boots you can Fly?



I read the Surah and nothing happens.



Do people lie to you about miracles of Quran that don't work, for example that the Quran has no errors, or is it just me?



I'm pretending to fly so I can make myslef believe my Surah has miracles.



Why do we as muslims have to pretend all the time and make up excuses?



</question>



<additional details>



I mean all ramadan I've been pretending I'm not having haram thoughts becos satan is locked up, but I was, I can't pretend  to be like this muslim anymore.



Ninja...you can try my boots...but you'll have to pretend too...I'm muslim check my profile.



To dishonest muslims...how come you never pasted this 'This is something I cannot help, muslims insist everyone is born a muslim, I guess I'm still a muslim in that sense.'



See I'm muslim. Prove me wrong.



Then you say there are no errors in the Quran...you geniuses who quote half texts when it suits you.



Slayer Muslimatics..... now your talking...Inshallah I will try this...Camels Urine...is it from this Hadith :

You foolish slayingly slain slowpoke swine!! You didnt read the instructions well....



Read the Surrah AND memorise it. When you put the boots on, start reciting it with your eyes closed, real tight!
After 72 seconds, you will find yourself at the seventh level of the skies.



If this is a boot from CAT or CK brands, then its another way. You have to write the surrah in a piece of paper. Photo copy it!
Then put one paper in one of your boots, and the other, EAT IT! Drink a camel's urine!



Then you're off to go!



My present was a slayingly swords. I can press a button, then RPG rockets come out from the tip. Another button makes fire come out from the sides!!

I didn't get anything because we aren't financially stable right now. I'm quite happy with the trip to our cousin's house, really.

Nope, absolutely not! I talk about good looking guys to my friends haha (a bit too much I think - they're getting sick of me say "oooh look at that guy he's so cute!") Its natural - theres nothing wrong in saying you think someone is good-looking. Being a muslim, I know my rights and wrongs but that doesn't mean I'm gonna go out with a guy. You can't control who you find attractive or who you fall in love with but what you can do is try not show it to him.

Contrary to some popular belief, the Twelve Days of Christmas are not the 12 days before Christmas.  Rather, the Twelve Days of Christmas are the 12 days from December 26 (St. Stephen's Day) to the Feast of Epiphany on January 6.



In some cultures, Christmas celebrations take place on December 25th; while in others, like Armenians, Christmas celebrations take place on January 6th.  [Armenia is the first Christian nation.]

Is it haram to give thank you (greeting) cards?



my friend has done so-so much for me in helping me along in my journey (towards islam). she's done so much i don't have enough time to write it all down. but anyhow, before getting out of her parents car after leaving from mosque, i gave her a thank you card. pretty much thanking her for all she had done for me and just saying that I thank Allah everyday for her.
is it haram or not to give cards? i'm just wondering because there are a few things that are not allowed in islam that i did not know about until she told me.

of course not!!!. islamic teachings are supposed to be for the welfare and coexistance of people. and showing appreciation for a good deed is just the natural course of doing things. dont be baffled with haram. what sounds good or meant in good way is surely good.  haram is when one does or says a thing that leads to hurting another.

My favourite thing about christmas is this:
On christmas eve when everyone has gone to bed, I go and sit in the room with the tree, with just the lights on, the flickering of the flames from the fire lending a glow to the room.  I sit there with a big mug of hot chocolate with a little bit of something alcoholic in it and I curl up by myself on the sofa and I just sit and smile and look at the christmas tree twinkling away in the corner (we always have the biggest we can get - about 7ft) with all the presents underneath.  I love looking at the baubles that have been collected over the generations, at all the different ways the presents have been wrapped, the cards hung on ribbons, and the snap and crackle of the fire.
I sit there every year for about 45 minutes, all quietly and happily by myself and think how wonderful it all is.
I love that little bit of 'me and the tree' time.
There isnt a single thing I dont like about it.
Even the washing up becomes a laugh when theres a crowd of you doing it in silly hats and little squiffy from too much wine!
Merry Christmas!!

Everything you list and colder weather, coming into a warm house and seeing the tree. Father Christmas, and happy good feelings that when remembered can keep us happy all year round. For me "everything" is an understatement. I love all of it from the run up to the after glow lasting way past the last 12th night celebrations.



I can't help but wonder how many other people think of Christmas throughout the year.

Global sighting is to be able to sight the moon anywhere in the world, and they declared eid Tuesday inshallah because of sighting the moon in several countries, and some countries already prayed eid prayer by now. [due to the general command of the prophet to all Muslim to sight the moon, and doesn't say in specific area of Muslims. In fact prophet accepted sighting of other towns and city when there was a communication]



Local sighting in Canada(so I am assuming same for USA) started fasting september 2nd and therefore cannot have eid on Tuesday (or else they'd have 28 days of Ramadan instead of 29/30). It is either Wednesday or Thursday for them. They are waiting to sight the moon Tuesday night, if they don't sight it, the month of Ramadan would complete with 30 days (meaning eid on Thursday).



Calculated method is a new system introduced in the religion, and mainly ISNA and those masaajid connected with them is following this method. They declared eid to be on Wednesday loooong time back. It is prohibited to use scientific calculation because of the saying of the prophet:
"We are an illiterate nation. We do not use astronomical writing or computation [for our fasting]. A month is so and so (and he pointed with his hands three times, folding the thumb on the third time, meaning twenty-nine days) or so and so (and he pointed with his hands three times, meaning thirty days)" [Bukhaaree and Muslim and Abu Daawood].

we are required to go by what the community decides, some places the moon may be seen and some it may not be seen, both parties will be right, if they have good intentions, the person responsible as far as getting sin would be the one providing the information, it he is incorrect allah will deal with him on day of judgement, if the community happened to follow eid on a different day than another city, only the people looking for the moon would be responsible, the ones announcing it. not the whole of the community for trusting them.

I personally do not think it is wrong but then I am not religious in any way. It's something you'll have to decide for yourself, I suppose you have to weigh up what is more important to you, your faith or your boyfriend. Although I don't see why you can't continue to worship as a muslim even if he does not. We can't all believe the same things.

well, its up to you but does he believe in marriage the way you do?
ie; what is marriage in the eyes of god and what it stands for, and your beliefs, etc.
also if you had kids what would you raise them as, etc.
its more complex then to just think like that but im sure you can figure out whats best for you.
can you both eat the same food, can you stand alcohol? what about life style and culture/different upbringing....
what about your family, friends, community, culture...
best of luck!
( :



- Hello, these are the only very few realistic issues you might have to think about and i guarantee these will be facing you.



- maybe give it 'four years' before marriage at least, and see how it goes....
i wouldnt think atheist guys would be jumping to marry you  like that, id say something really strange was up with that.... you should be running fast for your life!....



seriously, if you ever want to get rid of him just ask him to convert 'for you'?? ( :
i also think marriage is meant for people who can 'at least' relate to eachother.

yes, as it is stated in hadith only men can marry non muslim women and they have to be virgins, of only jewish or christain faith. and they must allow their children to be raised as muslims, females are definitely not allowed to marry non muslims, take it from me a man that does not have allah in his heart can never truly love you remember that i married a converted muslim man, who feared god his whole life and was looking for the truth, do not condemn your afterlife for a few measly years on earth, allah will reward you greatly on earth and the hereafter for following his path. abandon this man, no matter what you may think. allah knows best.

I believe that it's not about what is right and wrong, what you should do or should not do, it's not black and white. Do what you, alone, feel is right. Pray and meditate, and decide based on your own personal feelings what is right for you, not what anyone else tells you to do.



Also, i'd suggest examining exactly why would Allah swt tell us not to marry a non-muslim... and decide whether that reason applies to your situation or applies to modern society....if that makes sense...

IT'S ABSOLUTELY NOT HARAM AT ALL!!!



My mother is a muslim and my father an atheist. me and my 3 sisters we are all muslims. and I thanks god to have made of me a member of such an happy family.



the reason why the Koran doesn't encourage muslim women to marry non-muslim men is because in the 7th century arabia, and even beyond this area, women couldn't survive by their own and needed protection from another man: their fathers, their brothers or ultimately their husbands.



but that protection gave to men total authority on their wifes and daughters. if a muslim woman at this time wanted to marry a non-muslim man she could have never been able to practice her muslim faith. specialy in the context of persecution wherein islam is born.



remember the reaction of umar(the 2nd calife) when, prior to his conversion, he heard that his sister had embraced islam? he beat her husband for having authorized her conversion.
fortunately islam gave rights to women which improved their juridic status.



now I am gonna give you the opinion of Tariq Ramadan on this subject: as long as the man you like don't put ANY restriction to your religious practice and doesn't prevent you, or your children, from whorshiping god as islam requires it, what is absolutely the case in my family, you're free to go, IT'S 200% HALAL.



my father is an atheist and absolutely doesn't care about religion, he only beleives in mathematics, but not being a muslim doesn't prevent anyone to act rightously. my mother is a VERY-PRACTICING muslim. result: I am muslim, as are my 3 sisters. and I am sure that i am a better muslim than a lot of people here.



I am very surprised by the fact that some muslims in this thread just blindly shout that it's haram or bad for a sister to love a non-muslim man. in my opinion it's more a cultural than a religious reaction. I have to say that my mother is from west africa and my father from central africa. in those 2 area inter-religious marriages are not a sensitive matter, as it may be in the middle east or the indian subcontinent.



Islam is a religion of love, the koran has been sent down to teach us to love each other not to put barriers between us.



good luck sister.

Everything in the 3 is halal for you don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Muhammed SAW said a woman has a right to choose whom she wishes to marry. If their father did a good job then they know who they are going to marry.  But that is rare! Since the fathers don't teach the sisters anything.



Its frowned upon but its acceptable.  Anyone tells you other wise ask them to come do your dishes for a year then you will listen to them.

Where can I get Christmas cards printed for my charity?



My Boss has asked me to find a company who will supply Christmas cards for our chosen charity this Christmas. The only problem is the charity is unregistered and is based in South Africa. If anyone has any suggestions it would be great. Even if you know of a company who produces Cards for UK charities.



Thanks in advance!

I dont believe you should 'ask' for anything. I guess you would have a roof over your head, meals on your table everyday, clean clothes & a loving family? I think that you should have a wish list and if your parents can afford it/them then be greatful for what you are given and think of all the little kids that get absolutely nothing every year. I tell my children that those who 'want' never get, instead if you wish, they may come true. Try not to be so self centred and selfish, as you wont go very far in life.

Honor killings have nothing to do with Islam



When are you non Muslims going to organise a protest against your slaughter of Muslims all over the globe or your environmental rape of the planet ?



You miss the point about protests- they are meant to convince authorities to stop doing/do something. So protests against honour killings arent needed - who are they adressed to? -legislation punishing them is

Afraid you get typical answers from the brainwashed Muslims here--I ,however am a forward thinking gay Muslim .
The reason there are no protests is that the Quran says its legal to beat the sh*t out of your retarded wife and kids --and its legal to rape underage girls as Muhammed did it--as we know Muslims do whatever they want ,ignoring the law of the land so that they may destroy whichever country they were lucky enough to be sh*t into.
Lets hope they see the error of their ways.
Hugs and kisses to all.

The Holy Prophet (S) said: The month of Ramadhan is the month in which Allah, The Mighty, The Glorious, has made fasting obligatory upon you. So one, who fasts in this month in a state of belief and with the intention of recompense, shall become free of his sins just as he was on the day when his mother gave him birth.

Gay Muslim??? I think you need to read what is in the Quran rather than worrying about the cover. Did you read in the Quran what happen to  the people of Prophet Lut( Peace be upon him)?.

Brothers and Sisters!  Have a very Happy Eid.  Doesn't it feel great after fasting one month?



Now let's thank Allah for giving us opportunity to serve Him by fasting and charity and His blessings us every day of entire month for our fasting and our rukus and sujuds in our Salats. Ask Allah's help to keep us on the same level of piety as we observed during the entire year.



Remember to pay Eidul Fitr charity of $10.00 for each person in your household  before Salat of Eid starts to your Imam so he can pass it on to the needy Muslims so they can buy gifts for their children also.

Asak !!! EID MUBARAK TO ALL. Yes, it feels gr8. We ve celebrated Eid, here. It was gr8. Going to namaz early in the morn, wear new clothes, greeting and hugging everyone. Distributing briyani to all. On the whole it was fun but of course hectic. Atlast, alas, i got only 100 rs(IND) as eidi :(. But yes i am happy with it. Insha Allah, m praying that i should go to job and give others eidi next year on behalf of me. Pray for me. Remember me in your duas, friends.

Ok first thing Math is singular. No "S needed.



Secondly that's great that you enjoy math so much but do something you are passionate about. You can do whatever you want in life. Just make sure all of your subjects are in order because you might be good at math, but if your english is poor you won't succeed.

If you love maths and politics, why not consider a career in statistics?



If you want more help with this question you may get better responses in the careers guidance section, not the ramadan section.



To the other users: Using the term "maths" is correct as it stands for mathematics, not mathematic!



(So many people on Yahoo answers try to correct people when they have no idea what they are talking about themselves!)

Well, first of all, congratulations!



Not many students are good at maths. My father has the assumption that your strength in education is centered around your strength in maths, so he always urged me to get top grades in maths.



I am not bad at maths, and though I like it, I am not all that good at it either. I seem to love geometry and arithmetic, but not algebra. Algebra (with its endless love affair with x and y) is somewhat annoying to me.



Now the career for you should be engineering, not medical science. How well you'd perform in medical science depends on your ability to memorize loads of information efficiently, and you also need a strong memory.



In engineering, strength in mathematics is much more essential. So I think that this career is suitable for you.

I don't think it would matter much because what I witnessed in this section for the last month is that many, many muslims fasts were voided anyway because of their behavior, filthy language, fighting, name calling, insulting.  I know enough about Islam to know Muslim are to refrain from such behavior, but it appears to have gotten worse.  I don't understand why one would go without food or drink in order to praise God and then act like heathens.

i see month of ramadan as a period of refueling yourself in faith and discipline.



after its over we should continue to read as much quran as we did, recognize our sins the same way as we did, and continue to supplicate as much as we did.



throughout ramadan, i didnt even watch tv because i was consumed in my prayers. now it feels strange to turn on the tv and not be continuously praying...so i turn off the tv, and go pray.

You're right, there are far less Muslim women in sports than non-Muslim women, and one of the reasons is Islam.
In Islam you're supposed to dress modestly, so that your body parts are covered (not all) and aren't 'clear'. You know what I mean.



Tennis-have you seen the clothes they wear when they play tennis? There are Muslim women who do play tennis, but that doesn't make what they're doing right. Plus, when they move and run and jump, it's immodest. Against what it's supposed to be.



Football- They play football, Muslim women do. As long as they're shorts are long and they're shirts aren't tight and are long, I don't see why they can't. Yes the running part here is the same as the one in tennis, but loose shirts can solve the problem.



Swimming-I don't need to start on that. Wonderful, modest clothes they wear, don't they?



In short, Muslim women can play sports as long as they keep in mind that they are Muslims and shouldn't wear  the type of clothes that aren't allowed in Islam.



P.S. I play sports a lot, and there's nothing wrong with it when I know that I won't be attracting unwanted attention.



There's no denying that women can't play certain sports (on TV), but that's why we get more reward. Because we're holding our desires and following Islam.



(Keep in mind that if your husbands the only one around, you can play whatever sport you want to play in whatever way. It doesn't matter. NO restrictions then, only when you know other (non-mehram) men will be watching you)
Hope this answered your question.



(Can I ask you to stop generalising and calling everyone a fundie? You don't know half the people here and you still call them fundies like you've known them all your life...)

In your mind and all non muslim minds everything that a non muslim woman doesn't do or can't do is considered as oppression. And besides have you seen what female tennis players have to dress like? no self respecting muslima would even consider wearing that kind of stuff.



EDIT- All female athletes have to dress like whores. Look at womens volleyball, basketball,swimming, softball, track, football and all sports except for snow boarding. Modesty is a big part in our lives.

They think everyones personal lives is their business.  Personally, I love sports.  I play soccer all the time but with a hijab and modest clothes. Women aren't restricted in Islam.  Islam just says to be modest in dress and manner.  I agree with everyone above- most sports make women out to be whores.  That's not respect at all.  The holy Quran permits sports but come onnnnn, who'd wanna dress in tiny tiny shorts?  I mean, how do you even move around???



ps/ And umm excuse me, what do you mean in all aspects of life?  Muslim women have made HUGE advances in science, mathematics, literature, etc throughout time.  Islam made women much more free than either Christianity or Judaism back in the old days.  I think you should study how women were treated in your own religion before you question ours.

Okay, so people think it's okay to judge a Muslim by his deeds-by seeing whether he's performing the five daily prayers, giving Zakah, fasting, etc.



But it's not okay to say who's going to Heaven or Hell right? Right...
What about those who follow some rules and reject (disobey) some? How do you classify those? No one follows all the rules of Islam. So if a person fasts but doesn't pray, is he a bad Muslim or a good Muslim?

Sometimes you just can't help but label people. I know its unfair, and it can be misleading, but it needs to be done.



For example, it IS our duty to point out those Muslims who confuse terrorism and jihad, and support the terrorists. They are not good Muslims, and they need to be identified, they must be helped so that they can clear their misconceptions, and if they choose not to mend their ways, we must warn others of their influence.



Similarly, we should also stay on guard for Muslims who spread mistaken ideas. We must point out their misconceptions. Of course, it is important not to be aggressive or say they are bad Muslims right to the face.



Judging is a very serious matter, and volatile, and may create disunity, but in some cases you have to judge.

It isn't in our hands but in a way you can see the difference between a good and bad Muslim if you know what I mean. For example,  a bad Muslim would lie, steal and hurt others whilst a good Muslim would be truthful, modest and help others. Do you see where I'm getting at?



But I myself consider myself the worst even though I don't do bad things or things that are against Islam - that way I can't judge others.

if a person does a sin openly and blatantly, or does so out of ignorance there is nothing wrong in correcting that person.  Of course how that correction is given is really the key.  You should never publicly humiliate a person.  But taking him/her to the side and having a sincere conversation about the matter is a good thing.  Whether or not they change of course is up to them.

For me its easy to judge people, i can tell it very easily who is a good muslim and who is not.



''Thou shall not judge'' is a teaching of Bible. But in Islam we do judge people according to Quran and Hadith.



I have seen many western musilms who are influenced by the teachings of Bible coming here in this section and calling even the Qadianis ' Muslims'.



Another, funny thing is that, we hear all these complains from the non-practicing Muslims only that we are judging them too much, lol. Well, if you dont follow the basic teachings of Islam, like not praying 5 times, not fasting in ramadan, doing Zinah etc, then definitely you are a bad Muslim.



" Allah is the only judge '' is a lame excuse.



Those who wear hijab and those who dont are certainly not the same in Allahs eye.



Those who pray 5 times and those who pray 3 times , are not the same.



Similarly, those who protect their private parts from Zinah and those who dont, are not the same.



-----------------
Thanks to Muhammad Basheer, he clearly pointed out who are good muslims and who are not. ( count how many thumbs down he get from the 'Bad Muslims'.



---------------
@ YHWH-Ra-ah -The Lord my Shepherd



Your knowledge of Islam is limited. You need more study of Islam. Those who worship Jesus and Ezra will burn in hell for eternity.
The verse you are talking about doesnt say  Chirstians and Jews will go to heaven like us. Its talking about those Jews and Christians who were the real followers of Moses and Jesus.



2nd, Allah made it very clear in MANY places in the Quran that,  the only accepted religion to Allah is ' Islam'. Whoever chooses a different path will find their permanent abode in hell.



This is the difference between a good Muslim and  a bad Muslim. One studies the Quran and understand it, the other dont.

Allah (S.W.T.) describes the qualities of a good Muslim in the following verses of Holy Quran.



1. Those who offer their Salat (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness. (Quran-2:23 Surah Al-Mu'minun)
2. And those who turn away from Al-Laghw (dirty, false, evil, vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allah as forbidden. (Quran-3:23).
3. And those who pay the Zakat. (Quran-4-23)
4. And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts from illegal sexual acts). (Quran-5:23).
5. Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat (all the duties which Allah has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts) and to their covenants; (Quran-8:23).
6. And those who strictly guard their (five compulsory congregational) Salawat (prayers) at their fixed stated hours. Quran-9:23).
7. And the (faithful) slaves of the Most Gracious (Allah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness, and when the foolish address them (with bad words) they reply back with mild words of gentleness. (Quran: 63:25).
8. And those who spend the night in worship of their Lord, postrate and standing. (Quran-64:25).
9. And those who say: "Our Lord! Avert from us the torment of Hell.  Verily its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment. (Quran-65:25).
10. And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes). Quran-67:25)
11. And those who invoke not any other ilah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse -- and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.  Quran-68:25).
12. And those who do not bear witness to falsehood, and if they pass some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity. (Quran-72:25).
13. And those who, when they are reminded of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat.



Those who do not have or lacking in these qualities are not good Muslims.

Funny, Muslims I meet in person don't act this way, maybe it comes from living as a minority here (in Canada) or maybe they can see my genuine interest better than it can come off in a post.

People who often see me think that I am very narcissistic, unchaste and excessively outspoken.



These are misconceptions:



Taking pride in ones self is not to be confused with narcissism. I eat properly and work out. I enjoy dressing nicely and accessorizing. It makes one feel good about themselves when they look like they have cared for themselves.



Unchaste is something that people believe to be true because people from both sexes are very friendly with me. I have never been one to run and hide when men begin discussions. Because I am able to enjoy great conversations with men and women some think of this to be proof of my questionable ways. But I have never even spoken to a guy over the phone (not including telemarketers) or held a guys hand other then my husbands.



My mother used to say that if a man can see your molars then you are laughing to hard in front of the opposite sex, which would entail that you have been engaged in discussion for far to long. Well conversation comes naturally to me. I am a good talker and a persuasive individual. Sometimes I can go off on tangents but it is just how I am. I have a sarcastic and humorous personality, But being outspoken to me is when a person is self-righteous and blatantly rude.

My questions have been reported for about five times..... yet I'm still here, very much active.



So I guess you need to get reported at least 7/8 times before you get the boot.



However, I think they also take in account the period between the last reported Q/A and the next one. If, say, you got reported 5 times within the space of 5 months, you are in danger, but if the next reported one is 4 months later, they will not likely think of suspending you.

No, they are not haraam, but I still agree with your husband. She is 10 months old that means she will forget about it in like 10 min. so why buy something that is not exactly the symbol of Islamic culture.



Sure, it's a creature of God, but it's not exactly a "dove" if you know what I mean. They are filthy animals and when you want to insult someone you say "you pig" or "you swine" so why get her to have a connection with such an animal? Are there no other more lovable animals buy her?

Is it in our hands to tell people who's a good Muslim and who isn't?



If it isn't, how come I see people telling others that what they say isn't right and that they aren't good Muslims. Can we be the ones to judge who is on the Straight Path and who isn't?
I want your views please. Avoid cussing and attacking others' beliefs.



Thank you very much.

Anyone can answer by the way. Doesn't matter if you're Muslim or not. Just want your opinion on the matter.



@Esra: Correcting people is something we should do. It is our duty. But I agree with you. =) (Thanks for the star by the way ;))
@Muhammad: I love your answer and the way you think. Thanks for your answer. =)
@forget...: Mmhmm, I understand what you mean, and I do agree somewhat. Thanks for your input.



Thank you for your answers...
Okay, so people think it's okay to judge a Muslim by his deeds-by seeing whether he's performing the five daily prayers, giving Zakah, fasting, etc.



But it's not okay to say who's going to Heaven or Hell right? Right...
What about those who follow some rules and reject (disobey) some? How do you classify those? No one follows all the rules of Islam. So if a person fasts but doesn't pray, is he a bad Muslim or a good Muslim?



@umhuda: There's a difference between correcting people and judging them. What you say about correcting them is true, but can you judge those?
@Na2sA: And what do you know about what a person is in Allah's sight? To say that if a person doesn't perform the five pillars of Islam is not a good Muslim is, in my opinion, not right. "Thou shall not judge" is a teaching of Islam too, not only Christianity. Shall we go around judging people now just because we THINK they aren't good Muslims? Think again.
@Mohammad basheer: Thanks for the verses. Very useful indeed.



@Adnan: You're right about how people are damning other to Hell. But where on earth did you hear that Christians and Jews are going to heaven?

but saying who's a good person "Muslim" or not and whether their going to hell or heaven is only for god to judge

Sometimes you just can't help but label people. I know its unfair, and it can be misleading, but it needs to be done.



For example, it IS our duty to point out those Muslims who confuse terrorism and jihad, and support the terrorists. They are not good Muslims, and they need to be identified, they must be helped so that they can clear their misconceptions, and if they choose not to mend their ways, we must warn others of their influence.



Similarly, we should also stay on guard for Muslims who spread mistaken ideas. We must point out their misconceptions. Of course, it is important not to be aggressive or say they are bad Muslims right to the face.



Judging is a very serious matter, and volatile, and may create disunity, but in some cases you have to judge.

It isn't in our hands but in a way you can see the difference between a good and bad Muslim if you know what I mean. For example,  a bad Muslim would lie, steal and hurt others whilst a good Muslim would be truthful, modest and help others. Do you see where I'm getting at?



But I myself consider myself the worst even though I don't do bad things or things that are against Islam - that way I can't judge others.

if a person does a sin openly and blatantly, or does so out of ignorance there is nothing wrong in correcting that person.  Of course how that correction is given is really the key.  You should never publicly humiliate a person.  But taking him/her to the side and having a sincere conversation about the matter is a good thing.  Whether or not they change of course is up to them.

For me its easy to judge people, i can tell it very easily who is a good muslim and who is not.



''Thou shall not judge'' is a teaching of Bible. But in Islam we do judge people according to Quran and Hadith.



I have seen many western musilms who are influenced by the teachings of Bible coming here in this section and calling even the Qadianis ' Muslims'.



Another, funny thing is that, we hear all these complains from the non-practicing Muslims only that we are judging them too much, lol. Well, if you dont follow the basic teachings of Islam, like not praying 5 times, not fasting in ramadan, doing Zinah etc, then definitely you are a bad Muslim.



" Allah is the only judge '' is a lame excuse.



Those who wear hijab and those who dont are certainly not the same in Allahs eye.



Those who pray 5 times and those who pray 3 times , are not the same.



Similarly, those who protect their private parts from Zinah and those who dont, are not the same.



-----------------
Thanks to Muhammad Basheer, he clearly pointed out who are good muslims and who are not. ( count how many thumbs down he get from the 'Bad Muslims'.



---------------
@ YHWH-Ra-ah -The Lord my Shepherd



Your knowledge of Islam is limited. You need more study of Islam. Those who worship Jesus and Ezra will burn in hell for eternity.
The verse you are talking about doesnt say  Chirstians and Jews will go to heaven like us. Its talking about those Jews and Christians who were the real followers of Moses and Jesus.



2nd, Allah made it very clear in MANY places in the Quran that,  the only accepted religion to Allah is ' Islam'. Whoever chooses a different path will find their permanent abode in hell.



This is the difference between a good Muslim and  a bad Muslim. One studies the Quran and understand it, the other dont.



-------------
@ asker
"in my opinion its not right'



Islam doesnt depend on anybodys opinion.If you think someone who prays 5 times and someone who doesnt pray have the same level to Allah then you are '' Islamically'' wrong.
Allah loves those more who worships him more..



Anyways, as i said before, only the bad muslims will complain to much about these stufff. I am assuming you are one of them. Its ok if you dont pray/dont feel like to pray 5 times. But dont think that your level is equal to the one who is always following Allahs commandments.



Anyways, i dont waste my time on arguing with the people who are below my level.
Salam and have a good day.



---------------------
@ YHWH-Ra-ah -The Lord my Shepherd



Read my answer again.Bible and Torah has been corrupted.Those who are still following them will burn in hell.In these verses Allah is certainly not talking about the present day Chirstians and Jews.

Allah (S.W.T.) describes the qualities of a good Muslim in the following verses of Holy Quran.



1. Those who offer their Salat (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness. (Quran-2:23 Surah Al-Mu'minun)
2. And those who turn away from Al-Laghw (dirty, false, evil, vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allah as forbidden. (Quran-3:23).
3. And those who pay the Zakat. (Quran-4-23)
4. And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts from illegal sexual acts). (Quran-5:23).
5. Those who are faithfully true to their Amanat (all the duties which Allah has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts) and to their covenants; (Quran-8:23).
6. And those who strictly guard their (five compulsory congregational) Salawat (prayers) at their fixed stated hours. Quran-9:23).
7. And the (faithful) slaves of the Most Gracious (Allah) are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness, and when the foolish address them (with bad words) they reply back with mild words of gentleness. (Quran: 63:25).
8. And those who spend the night in worship of their Lord, postrate and standing. (Quran-64:25).
9. And those who say: "Our Lord! Avert from us the torment of Hell.  Verily its torment is ever an inseparable, permanent punishment. (Quran-65:25).
10. And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but hold a medium (way) between those (extremes). Quran-67:25)
11. And those who invoke not any other ilah (god) along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse -- and whoever does this shall receive the punishment.  Quran-68:25).
12. And those who do not bear witness to falsehood, and if they pass some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity. (Quran-72:25).
13. And those who, when they are reminded of the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat.



Those who do not have or lacking in these qualities are not good Muslims.

I know that as humans we do tend to be judgemental. Whether it be in matters of religion, education, or behaviour.. we're always judging people in the back of our head. And I think it's a habit that most of us, including me, should ought to stop because when you criticize someone and point out your faults, you're really not doing anything good. You don't know what that person lives through everyday, and you should look at yourself before you look at others.

Do you let your kids believe in Santa?



I grew up believing in Santa, the tooth fairy and the Easter bunny.



But as we became parents for the first time, my husband and I decided that we wouldn't have our children believe in those characters.  We feel like we would be lying to our children.  A "little white lie" is the same as a regular lie.



I know there are those who believe differently than me and I can respect that.  So no being mean please. :-(

Absolutely not!  :)  I'm with you - it is still lying.  I never believed in Santa growing up but Christmases were just as fun.  My Mom told us, "I will never lie to you" and we grew up knowing we could trust her implicitly.  She would not always agree to answer our questions, or she would gear her answers to our ages, but she NEVER lied to us and I am sooo grateful.  It would have been devastating to me to learn that the one person I trusted most in the world had lied to me.



We have never lied that way to our children and they have never felt deprived.  Remember, too, if you are Christians, that Santa can be confusing to a young child.  Afterall, supposedly "he knows when you are sleeping; he knows when you're awake.  He knows if you've been bad or good - so be good for goodness sake!"  Sounds an awful like Jesus knowing everything, too.



Good for you and your husband for making such a wise choice.  I hope you stick to it.  Your pay-off will be in having a child who knows that Mommy and  Daddy are completely trustworthy - even in the little things.

i see no harm in the tooth fairy, santa and easter bunny. they are all part of the childhood imagination.  they all catch on to it eventually.  neither of my children resented me.  they enjoy helping "play santa" with the younger kids in the family.



the maddest i have ever been was when a child told my 4 yr. old there was no such thing as santa.  his parents, like you, didn't want their child believing in those characters.  so he decided to tell EVERYONE in daycare.  needless to say, those parents had to deal with some very angry parents. if you don't want your children believing, don't allow them to ruin it for other kids.  some of us like to see the excitement in our children's eyes.  they're only kids once.  let them enjoy it!

I definitely see your point. My brother-in-law is 11 this year, and I think it will be the last year he believes in Santa. It has been fantastic to see the love, warmth and festivity at their house, and I think his belief has been a big part of it. Not to mention its so much fun to help him lay out things for Santa and the reindeer, and then to take bites out of them after he goes to bed! Compared to my parents house, where we weren't ever really a Santa believing family and its always just like another day of the year.



However, my BIL is starting to question the whole Santa thing (due to kids at school). I don't think that he is upset, angry or worried about the notion... I think the way he sees it is, its a big secret for the adult world to keep, and he is just too proud of himself that he's working it out.



Anyway, my point is, I see YOUR point :-) but I do think that it adds a great atmosphere to Christmas for kids.

For me personally Santa Claus is a standard that we can set for our kids. Like when you tell them if you get an " A" you can have this.



That is were Santa comes in, they are not yet in school, but we tell them no fighting, or no being mean or else Santa is not bringing presents.



I think that children should be allowed ot have fantasy, fantasy is all around us, in movies, in cartoons, in books. Were can you draw the line?



My kid took a picture (real live) with Spider-man at Walmart when they were promoting the movie. He is currently the biggest fan of Spider-man. I respect that because I know this will give him a guidance between what is good and what is bad. Plus how can I tell him that he doesn't exist when he has a picture with him.

If I never believed in Santa...my life would be ruined. Don't do that to your children! They need fantasy in their lives because the real world will hit them like a sack of bricks eventually and from there on out it's miserable.



Also when I was a child, I was neighbors with people who didnt let their kids believe in Santa..I don't think Santa is the cause of it but now they are all criminals. And also if your kid is friends with kids who DO believe in Santa... your child will probably tell them otherwise and ruin it for them.

Sure.
Why not?
To keep the spirit of Christmas burning alight in time.
For the little ones  in honouring and worshiping God for the Liberation of Freedom from world war two as Thanks giving day for that Freedom in time.
We can't tell the little one on what the Liberation of Freedom from world war two was all about in time.
That was how our ancestors created Santa to remind the little one on what Christmas is all about in time.
As adults in time we have to learn and understand on what it's all about in time from a different perspective.
Not in behaving like little children until old age in time.

No. I will not. I agree with you 100%. I truly believe that we are doing the right thing. There are others ways that kids can have fun and enjoy Christmas. Volunteering by giving gifts to kids at a local homeless shelter is one. I support reasonable gift giving between friends and family, but the whole commercial Christmas theme has been blown out of proportion. And I don't agree with lying to your child, and about such a silly and unbelievable tale...

Edit: You don't have to thumbs down me just because I was smarter than your kids, and I don't plan to lie to mine (if they'd even believe). I feel like I'm being attacked for wanting to tell the truth about what Christmas REALLY is. I'd never make my kids tell everyone else that there's no Santa, but obviously the kids who figure it out first tell everyone else regardless. I refuse to lie to my (future) kids!

Why did the Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) use torture in some Hadiths?



'When the Apostle of Allah . . . cut off (the hands and feet of) those who had stolen his camels and he had their eyes put out by fire (heated nails), Allah reprimanded him on that (action), and Allah, the Exalted, revealed: "The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His Apostle and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is execution or crucifixion.' (Abu Dawud, no. 4357)

Why do this?
Why not just reprimand them?

I also heard that one on raiding expedition and old woman was torn in two.
Why would Muhammad(pbuh) allow this?

well actually i doubt that the second part is true... seeing as how when muslims go to war its haram/forbidden to kill children, women, and elderly destrpy land like crops farms and kill live stock and homes. you are only allowed to kill men and those who are attacking you. so for example the army of israel we have permission to kill them, becuase they rae attacking muslim land. that is halal. but o kill the innocents i mean those not participating is haram. this is what the prophet said, some hadiths are weak perhaps you need to look it up in a better source and not the net.

All stories are passed down, they are embellished and changed. We can't rely on any of these stories being accurate. I believe in god but not in the bible or any other religious document. I think God knows the good from the bad without worrying about all that stuff.

Even if a person is not intellectually educated islamically, they will be able to say that The character of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was so kind and good that he never hurt women and children, so i don't think that he could have allowed his companions (ra) to hurt them either. And when you are reading Ahadeeth, make sure that it is authentic and from a strong source. I really couldnt believe it if i read that the last messenger of God would act so violently, even during war with the people who tried to kill him, he told his men to remain quiet, so he is not an aggressive Prophet.

That is a false hadith! Honestly, one cannot understand how some Muslims can actually believe in these things when they go against the nature of the Prophet (SAW), the hadiths that say he wasn't like that and the teachings of the Quran which forbid such horrendous things!

this is the hadith from.. Sahih Bukhari...

The Ayat related to this hadith.. is



The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on the opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.

Most probably this hadith is not correct even if it is in Bukhari .
The first option was execution , this what makes me suspect this hadith . It is not mentioned that why did he burned their eyes , why would he do that , is such punishment  written in the Quran  ?
And the rest of the hadith is that he left them to die in the hot sun without giving them water or food , this is very hard to believe .
Why would he do that , is there anything in the Quran suggest such behavior. May Allah forgive Bukhari for filling his books with such lies .

I would create a few games at home - I think trick or treating has lost it's charm (in the UK that is) and it's not ideal for small kids.

Bobbing for apples - Maybe fill your washing up bowl with water and put some apples in it



Bake cookies and decorate them together halloween style with sweets

Dress up together as monsters (doesn't have to be expensive) can be done with household items and clothing, e.g. bin liners, marigolds, old clothes, saucepans for hats, card and paper to make masks.

Buy a pumpkin and carve it. Let your child help you empty the contents.

Buy 'scary' sweets and make wee cupcakes with them.

If you are into decorating the house for Halloween, get your child to help you.

Play games like hide and seek.

Get them to help in choosing a costume and making it.

See if there are children's books catered towards Halloween. That way they will be funny but still deal with 'scary' subjects if this makes sense? Read them dramatically to make your child interested and to make them laugh etc.

For a party or event try just their little friends, and bobbing for apples, and all that sort.

You probably would learn similar material as al-Azhar mostly focuses on the Ash'aree 'Aqeedah. And they teach other deviant beliefs without correcting them.

But in comparison to the Islaamic university of Madeenah or Umm al Quraa then there's no way any University in the west can compare.

Yes brother, there is a very clear verse.

O ye who believe! let not one people deride another people, haply they may be better than they, nor let one group of women deride other women, haply they may be better than they. And do not defame your people nor call one another by nick-names. It is an evil thing to be called by bad name after having believed; and those who repent not, such are the wrongdoers. (49:11

Hope that helps.  Allah bless you.

vulgar language and abusive behaviour are not clear terms, these are subjective terms. Quran is much more clear that what you expect.
 However, I have some here.

104:1 WOE unto every slanderer, fault-finder!
93:9 Therefore, the orphan shalt thou never wrong,



93:10 and him that seeks [thy] help shalt thou never chide
49:11 O ye who believe! Let not some men among you laugh at others: It may be that the (latter) are better than the (former): Nor let some women laugh at others: It may be that the (latter are better than the (former): Nor defame nor be sarcastic to each other, nor call each other by (offensive) nicknames: Ill-seeming is a name connoting wickedness, (to be used of one) after he has believed: And those who do not desist are (indeed) doing wrong. 
49:12 O ye who believe! Avoid suspicion as much (as possible): for suspicion in some cases is a sin: And spy not on each other behind their backs. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Nay, ye would abhor it...But fear Allah. For Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.
23:3 Who avoid vain talk; 
25:72 Those who witness no falsehood, and, if they pass by futility, they pass by it with honourable (avoidance); 
28:55 And when they hear vain talk, they turn away therefrom and say: "To us our deeds, and to you yours; peace be to you: we seek not the ignorant."



However, it is more important to know what exactly you mean by abusive behaviour and vlgar language. Why do you prefer ambiguity over clarity?

yes
[4:148] GOD does not like the utterance of bad language, unless one is treated with gross injustice. GOD is Hearer, Knower.



[31:18-19] "You shall not treat the people with arrogance, nor shall you roam the earth proudly. GOD does not like the arrogant showoffs. "Walk humbly and lower your voice - the ugliest voice is the donkey's voice." 
[ 73:10] And remain steadfast in the face of their utterances, and disregard them in a nice manner.



49:11] O you who believe, no people shall ridicule other people, for they may be better than they. Nor shall any women ridicule other women, for they may be better than they. Nor shall you mock one another, or make fun of your names. Evil indeed is the reversion to wickedness after attaining faith. Anyone who does not repent after this, these are the transgressors.



[14:24-25] Do you not see that GOD has cited the example of the good word as a good tree whose root is firmly fixed, and its branches are high in the sky? It produces its crop every season, as designed by its Lord. GOD thus cites the examples for the people, that they may take heed.



[14:26] And the example of the bad word is that of a bad tree chopped at the soil level; it has no roots to keep it standing.



[41:34] Not equal is the good response and the bad response. You shall resort to the nicest possible response. Thus, the one who used to be your enemy, may become your best friend.

Suppose there is no clear cut verse prohibiting the same, does it mean Muslims are allowed to use vulgar language and abusive  behavior? 
How literal and fanatic can u get?
There is such a thing as common sense(given by Allah).Some thing that many Muslims seem to lack. One does not need to go to University, do course in logic or  follow it ( c.sense) ONLY if mentioned in a holly book.
This is the reason why Muslims complain and wonder on Yahoo why many young Muslims shy away from religion. U cannot have intelligence and fanatic bigotry in the same brain.

Salam I dunno but common sense of Islam should help you figure that out, am I correct? IM sure in every religion abusive behavior and slander is considered forbidden-so Im guessing its especially forbidden in Islam. Also, Allah swt says that backbiting is like eating the flesh of your brother. So....I guess bad language and abusive behavior is really bad, too.



PS I have seen many verses that forbid it but I cannot remember..maybe they were hadiths?

Any ideas for a day out in london with my mother?



I'm a 15 year old girl ... with my mother nearing her forties, the obvious rift between us is  widening rapidly. Thus the suggestion of a mother-daughter bonding session... that's right.

I mean, she's a lovely person, but we're just not compatible. Last time i took her to Camden. That went down particularly well (mainly because i avoided the good shops with hippy junk).
My idea for the next one would be an art gallery or something. But apparently we've 'done' the tate; her idea of looking at art is a quick browse then coffee. Does anyyone now f a place in London i can take her that combines art galleries, charing cross manga shops and markets with coffee, shopping and salad?
thankyou!!



</question>



<additional details>



it's not an embarrassment thing- i LOVE my mother! I really hadn't thought of other markets to be perfectly honest. The thing is that she's rather weedy and pathetic; the idea of walking without a purpose would probably kill her! MY delicate 4 ft'9' mother needs pitt-stops!

I had a day out in London with my mum recently and had a really good time.

We went shopping in Oxford Street. The Topshop there is massive and you could spend so many hours (and pounds!) in there. There would be stuff for both of you. There is even a cafe.

We had lunch at Garfunkels, but there is also a really cool resteraunt called Bella Italia, somewhere around there which I have been to before and serves up some really delicious proper italian pizzas.

You could go and see a show! I would recommend Wicked (I saw it with my family and it went down a treat!) everyone loved it, its the best musical Ive seen (not cheasy!).

You could go to maddame tussauds! Its really fun to have funny photos with your arm around your fave celeb!

Another top idea would be to fly the eye (the London eye). I've done it and its rather cool, you realise how massive london really is!!!

The Islamic calendar or Muslim calendar (also called the Hijri calendar) is a lunar calendar used to date events in many predominantly Muslim countries, and used by Muslims everywhere to determine the proper day on which to celebrate Islamic holy days. It is a lunar calendar having 12 lunar months in a year of about 354 days. Because this lunar year is about 11 days shorter than the solar year.

Islamic years are also called Hijra years because the first year was the year during which the Hijra occurred—Islamic prophet Muhammad's emigration from Mecca to Medina.



The Islamic months are named as follows:

Muharram محرّم (or Muḥarram al Ḥaram) 
Safar صفر (or Ṣafar al Muzaffar) 
Rabi' al-awwal (Rabī' I) ربيع الأول 
Rabi' al-thani (or Rabī' al Thānī, or Rabī' al-Akhir) (Rabī' II) ربيع الآخر أو ربيع الثاني 
Jumada al-awwal (Jumādā I) جمادى الاولى 
Jumada al-thani (or Jumādā al-akhir) (Jumādā II) جمادى الآخر أو جمادى الثاني 
Rajab رجب (or Rajab al Murajab) 
Sha'aban شعبان (or Sha'abān al Moazam) 
Ramadan رمضان (or Ramdān, long form: Ramaḍān al Mubarak) 
Shawwal شوّال (or Shawwal al Mukarram) 
Dhu al-Qi'dah ذو القعدة 
Dhu al-Hijjah ذو الحجة

For a very rough conversion, multiply the Islamic year number by 0.97, and then add 622 to get the Gregorian year number. An Islamic year will be entirely within a Gregorian year of the same number in the year 20874. The Islamic calendar year of 1429 occurs entirely within the Gregorian calendar year of 2008. Such years occur once every 33 or 34 Islamic years (32 or 33 Gregorian years)......It's a purely lunar calendar.

It is a lunar calendar having 12 lunar months in a year of about 354 days. Because this lunar year is about 11 days shorter than the solar year, Islamic holy days, although celebrated on fixed dates in their own calendar, usually shift 11 days earlier each successive solar year, such as a year of the Gregorian calendar. Islamic years are also called Hijra years because the first year was the year during which the Hijra occurred—Islamic prophet Muhammad's emigration from Mecca to Medina. Thus each numbered year is designated either H or AH, the latter being the initials of the Latin anno Hegirae (in the year of the Hijra).[1]

When some Muslim people see me, they assume I'm one of them, and it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable?



I'm agnostic, but my parents are Muslim.  I'm an ethnic Bengali, so perhaps it'd be natural for some Muslims to assume I was one of them (or maybe Hindu).

Anyway, when they say things like "Salaam Walaikum" (the Islamic greeting) to me, how should I respond in kind?
If I say "Hi" in return wouldn't it be too obvious?
And if I say "Walaikum asalaam", wouldn't they assume I were Muslim?

and why cant you just say "Walaykum Salaam" back?
if you take the religion out of the words.. just think of them as arabic language.and someones saying to you "Peace be upon you"... I certainly no matter what faith, or lack of faith I have.. would welcome anyone on earth, wishing peace to me... Doesnt every single human want peace on earth?... its just words.. just so happend that in Islam, in Allahs infinate wise wisdom, he chose the perfect words/greeting that suits everyone, no matter what faith...
So you are agnostic, but dont you want someone to wish peace to you?.. just smile and wish them peace back!.....

i think you should open up you mind a little bit! no one cares what you are! Religion is personal! you know what you believe in?? you know what religion you are?? your beliefs are strong? if the answer if yes than thats all that matters!

I have used the same greeting before when speaking Arabic, despite being a Buddhist.  In my mind it is not necessary for a person to eschew the customs of a culture even if one is not part of it.  Replying in kind is a respectful gesture, which I encourage you to continue.  Religion is pretty much a private matter, so I would simply be polite, and if they ask about a religious matter, simply avoid the topic if you aren't comfortable discussing it.  You shouldn't feel ashamed or pressured into religious discussion.

It’s like the Arabic/Islamic way to say hi..Everyone says alsalam alaikum! Where i live, it is not offending and it is not like they cursed you or something! You know how to greet them back and i think it would be rude to reply by "HI"!
Alsalam Alaikum means: may peace be upon you. So i think it is nice if you replied by the usual greeting.
if they gestured that you are Muslim just say that you are not in a kind way..so you won’t offend them and make them feel like they made a HUGE mistake. :)

It depends on where you live, I guess. If you live in a predominantly Muslim country, it's best to say "wa alaikum as-salam" because that would be the common type of greeting that everyone uses, be he Muslim or not.

If you live in a different country, then just use the most common type of greeting.

P.S. While as-salamu a'alaikum is the proper way to greet in Islam, it is not forbidden to be used by anyone else and if any non Muslim uses it we must accept and answer him with it and not even mention that he/she is not Muslim. So basically, I don't think you have a real problem.

Also, Agnostics that were raised with other religions (such as Christians) don't have a problem with being "assumed" Christian; why should you?

Somehow I think you want to be agnostic not because you don't believe, rather because it's not cool to be Muslim these days.

walaikumsalam is 'may god bless you too'.

Assalamu Alaikum Warahama!

Means " peace mercy and blessing of Allah SWT (almighty God) be on you.

when ever some one say you mean its good for you.



In replay you have say Walakum Salaam Warahama!
which mean "peace, mercey and blessing of Allah SWT be on you too".

so it is an commandment of Allah SWT, you have to reply.



i thing this is an universal greeting for all the peoples, whatever may be the situation it suits.

ex: if a person have quarreled with his wife, when he goes to office then some body say GOOD MORNING, then he will think, What is good about the morning. he have quaralled with his wife.

and even compare the greeting of Jesus (PBUH) which is mentioned



Al-Qur'an 20:25-28
Greet you in the same manner as Jesus (pbuh) greeted in Hebrew Luke 24:36
‘Sholam alay kum’ 
or Islamic greeting in Arabic Assalaamu alai kum
both meaning ‘Peace be on you’.

I'M AGNOSTIC TOO :D anyway, my advice would be to say walaikum asalaam back, because it's simply a matter of being polite to them, and showing that you respect their culture and stuff.

Let's place this in a different context. If you know how to speak Spanish. And you looked extremely Hispanic. But you were not Spanish, and yet, a Hispanic person walks up to you and asks for directions in Spanish, like they think you're really Spanish, what would you do?

It happened to a relative of mine once, and he just replied in Spanish anyway. It wouldn't really make a difference, because you're either never going to see that person who thinks you're Muslim ever again. Or you'll get to know that person better, and that person will come to know that you aren't Muslim, and will appreciate you and respect you more for respecting their culture! :)

You're an Indian, right?  That's what a "Bengali" is?
Yea, in America they'd probably think the same of you.  Most likely they will assume you were a Hindu or a Muslim.  Humans are just biased by nature.
Yea, I guess if you say "Walaikum asalaam" they'd think you were Muslim but if you say "Hi" maybe they'd assume you were Hindu?  Who knows.  Do a social experiment saying both and record your results.  It could be interesting.

Just reply in kind. 
I am not a Muslim and I do not look  Muslim, I am West Indian and agnostic.  My office is across the road from a Muslim Association centre and they have prayers there every friday at lunchtime. Whenever the members of the community pass me on the street they greet me "Salaam Walaikum".  I do not reply with the same words because I am not sure what the reply should be but I reply politely by say good afternoon.  I think it would be patronizing to repeat the words back not as it is not in my culture nor do I understand it, but I did feel honoured to be greeted in that way, i think it shows respect and how respectful and loving (real) muslims are.
I now feel even more honoured now that through the answers to this question I know the translation and next time I will reply in English 'Peace and blessing to you brother".
With you Knowing what it means I think you could reply with the appropriate response.  It shows you are returning the respect and brotherhood show to you, show you are respectful and confident in yourself.  That would not detract from you being agnostic, after all, its just a greeting, be polite and show goodwill, I am sure you will feel better for it.

Ramadan - can people still attend appointments etc?



I work for the DWP and I've had a few clients this week telling me they can't attend their appointments because its Ramadan.  I understood that things are supposed to carry on as normal in Ramadan (I'm not Muslim though so I might be wrong).

Can people still attend appointments etc during Ramadan?



</question>



<additional details>



DWP = Department for Works and Pensions in UK - Government body which is in charge of Welfare/Benefit claims etc.



They wouldn't have to eat/drink anything etc, some would need a medical examination for an IB claim but its not like a really invasive exam.

Of course you can attend appointments, work etc.
These people are being ridiculous.

If the appointment was right on the time of breaking the fast (about 7.30pm right now) this would be a bit awkward as understandably they would wish to eat and pray then, otherwise they should get out of bed and go to the appointment.

Muslims all over the world go about their normal daily lives while fasting.
Medical exams, including invasive exams, do not break the fast unless you have to swallow something by mouth or take a nutritional injection.

I think your clients mean they don't want to, or they don't prefer to attend appointments.

Yes, things are supposed to be carried out as normal during Ramadan.  Although some people find fasting more difficult than others, maybe that's why they try to postpone doing things.

Here in Saudi Arabia, working hours for Muslims are shortened, especially for those in the government.  But still there are some who take vacation for some days or for the whole month of Ramadan.

Why not?  Muslims work and attend meetings all through Ramadan.  Your clients are making excuses, using religion to justify the cancellation and its pathetic that they would do that.  Nothing wrong with a medical exam as long as they don't have to ingest anything.  If it just giving samples of blood etc, then even that's ok.

my God is a is a merciful God, who loves us each no matter our faults, and he will forgive us all that we do, for he gave his son for us, how much more could he love us?

When I die, I believe I will forever be with those I love in a place of peace where there is no evil, no pain, no tears...I believe my God has many names the world over, but in the most simplest of he is simply God. I believe in living the best way i can and I believe my God knows my heart and soul...This is what i believe...

You have to choose what you believe in, just as your mother must choose whom and what she believes in...

No two people believe exactly the same, we are each too unique and different, have walked different paths to see things exactly the same.



In your heart of hearts, do you believe that your God would wipe away all that you love and leave you with strangers? Do you believe your God will send your mother to hell, no matter if she is a good person or not, because she is hindu??

I believe my God loves us too much to do that to us....but again it is what I believe

EDIT - *point up to where I wrote* I believe my God has many names the world over, but in the most simplest of he is simply God.......What I mean is that many people call him different names but to ME it's all the same God. And I say my God because it is the God i believe in....just as each one of you have your God, it's all the same except I believe my way, and you believe yours, and that is how i distinguish the differences of belief

According to the teachings/hadiths of Muhammad and Qur'an shirk(assicoationg partners with Allah) is the only unforgiveable sin. Once a person dies and they die not in the state of Islam being a believer they are doomed to hell, so praying for a kaffir after their death is hopeless.



This is what Islam says, but do you really and truly believe that God will condem a person to hell forever for following a different religion. If we are to be Moslems all we have left to guide us is a book? A book that Mohammed never saw and gave approval on a book that was compiled a long while after his death????

YOu will know who your parents are, but your paretns will not be concerend for you. On that day everyone will be only worried about themselves, and their affair with allah. Everyone will care about theirs sins and wheter they will go to jannah.  no one will care for one another not even a mother and dautghter/son, or brother and sister The people who go to jannah will be abel to ask for anything, even thier family and the good righteous people can bring 70 members of their family into jannah. SO if you are righteous and do good, and go tojannah you'll be able to ask for you family.

You say your mom is hindu? Keep making dua that she is guided, and that allah forgives her. Maybe he will listen to you esp. in Ramadan. SHe will go to hell if she does bad deeds on top of worshipping idols,however is she doesnt not do bad, but only worships idol which is shirk, then the only way for her is that she be guided.

praying will help
hav u tried guiding her? telling her?
tell her to atleast study the quran. i mean giv it a chance
every1 i knw who studied islam were facisnated at the fact tht it isnt at all what any1 thinks it is, its extraordinary .an converted not tht im sayin she wud ( i mean me myself havnt read the quran i need to read it in english to understand more...)
and u wnt remeber anything on the day of judgment
every1 will be too worried to think about anything but themselves, thts why no1 notices there own family, so u wont be thinking abt losing them or anything
p.s whos to say they stay in hell? u knw there are 7 levels of heaven they might be punished then put at the lowest of levels.. no1 knws except Allah so. we'll only find out on tht day

Nope thats impossible, like it says in various hadiths, every man and women will be for him/herself and would trade their whole family to enter Jannah. And by the way because their is more Women than men, if every man marries one women then there will be lots of unmarried women. Also muslim men can marry non-muslims because the child will usually follow his fathers religion, while on the other hand muslim women cant because the man will disapprove and the women is less stronger..

You can only obtain for your own soul.  But we shouldn't pray for unbelievers, because they had all thier life to know Islam and accept Islam. If your father is Muslim, his marriage is not valid in the eyes of ALLAH(Subhanna wa ta'ala) and under Shariah Law, as Muslim men aren't supposed to be marrying Kaafur women(including Christian and Jewish women today, because Christians worship Isa(Peace be upon him), Gabriel, and ALLAH(Subhanna wa ta'ala) as one God, and the Jews are just wrong in their faith and deny the truth of ALLAH(Subhanna wa ta'ala).  If your mother dies as a Hindu then she is going to Hell, because she died outside Islam, as a Kaafur.  There's no sense in praying for her.

Even if you look for your family at the judgment day, they will not pay any attention to you, either they are muslim or not.

so the best thing you can do to met in paradise, is to keep telling them about Islam, until they revert.
so Don't pray to God to forgive them, because Allah told us there is no use and it is not allowed, but keep praying that revert to Islam, this is your only hope.

btw, I read in one of the answers her on yahoo about a sister keep praying for her  family to revert, until she died then her family reverted.

so keep inviting them to islam and keep praying for them to revert.

yes, that is true. in Judgement Day, you won't even be able to think about anything else but how YOU will end up?

"That Day shall a man flee from his own brother, And from his mother and his father, And from his wife and his children.Each one of them, that Day, will have enough concern (of his own) to make him indifferent to the others. Some faces that Day will be beaming, Laughing, rejoicing. And other faces that Day will be dust-stained, Blackness will cover them: Such will be the Rejecters of Allah, the doers of iniquity."
Surah ‘Abasa (He Frowned!)

"And no friend will ask after a friend, Though they will be put in sight of each other,- the sinner's desire will be: Would that he could redeem himself from the Penalty of that Day by (sacrificing) his children, His wife and his brother, His kindred who sheltered him, And all, all that is on earth,- so it could deliver him: By no means! for it would be the Fire of Hell!- " Surah Al-Ma‘arij (The Ascending Stairways, Staircases Upward, Sckeptic)



Anyway, i'll tell you something. you can make Du'aa and pray to Allah every day and night that He guides your mom to the Right Path and opens her eyes to this beautiful religion.



Not only prayers, try to drag her attention to Islam through stories of the Prophet's (PBUH) life and the Sahaba. try to represent Islam to her from your point of view. also, tell your father (if he is Muslim) to help you through this.

Another thing you can do, is try to become the Best Muslim Ever! try to become the nicest person on earth. and be good to your mother and build up a great personality where the Prophet is your role model. maybe then, your mom will notice the change in you and become interested.

I believe it is your duty to represent Islam to your mother for what it really is, a religion of peace, love and understanding. i also believe that maybe Allah will ask you why you did not convey the message to your mom, maybe then she would've fallen in love with Islam and became a Muslim. but if she didn't then, you did your mission and you did your best WITHOUT forcing your beliefs on her.

So, anyway, the point is, make your goal in life to guide your mom (with love, respect and acceptance) and do not ever be unkind to her or rude (as you know it is against Islam's teachings) and try your best, because i know for sure you LOVE your mom, and you wanna be with her in Heaven In Shaa Allah, where the both of you would live happy till eternity remembering the day when your mom embraced Islam and thanked you for conveying the message

God Bless...  :)

As for your mother, Allah is the only one who can answer that question, who knows if she will change her religion or where she will be but God. I will pray for her in my prayers sister

Absolutely i don't no why people think it wrong to start early.things are cheaper now than in november/december and you can always get what you want without being pushed and shoved in the mad rush plus you don't have to get into extreme debt if you do little and often rather than maxing out your flexible friend 2 weeks before and them still paying it off till next year when everyone else is running around like headless chickens all we will have to worry about is what flavor stuffing to buy for our turkey LOL

yeah, i've got a big extended family so have to start early.
i usually get cards and wrapping paper in the january sales but i honestly can't remember if i did this year, i know theres a box of crackers in the loft but i'll have to see what else there is. 
its so much easier to shop early rather than squeezing it all into 3 days before christmas. my other half leaves everything to the last minute so we end up in town on christmas eve anyway :-)

Yea im done with majority of them too :) as bad as it is while I have the money here and there I go ahead and buy the "gift card" people their cards and put them up. You usually have like a year before they start deducting from them so I get them now. I hate when christmas time comes and you feel strapped down; meaning spending way over your budget already. So, I start now. Then on blackfriday I usually finish the kids and nefews and nieces as walmarts deals are unbelieveable. So, to answer the question lol yea I love being done before the holiday even starts :P

Most definitely! I hate waiting until the last minute, plus I love to have all the gifts under the Christmas tree... it just makes it look fulll... and great! And for me and my family is a good idea to start early, I have two kids under the age of 3, so basically when I go shopping during the year and I see something that anyone in my family or friends would like, I buy it save it... until it's time for Christmas!

it is too late, but you made up your prayers for Isha, so its ok.
Just ask your lord that your sorry, he's forgiving as long as you dont do it on purpose.

One should pray before 12 night Isha prayers, it is better, but according to my knowledge u can pray Isha prayers just before the timing of Fajr starts.And i think Isha prayers r not compelte till u offer Witr rikaat, ask it from Islamic scholars as well.

dear brother...lol..



i think the most important sunnah that seems to be gone is properly greeting other muslims. every time i leave the house, i see another muslimah, and every time, i get no salaam. black, white, arab, pakistani, it doesnt matter. no one offers the greeting..as if they dont know that we are rewarded for doing so. muslims always look the other way and pretend that they dont see another muslim (this is in the US, anyway) its really sad

I don't have a colour scheme as such.  All my decorations mean something to me - something special that people have given me, stuff made by kids, unusual things from all over the world and lots and lots of chocolate!!

To me, the christmas tree and christmas on the whole is a happy time for memories and fun - not a fashion excessory.  I would hate to have to lose any of my decorations because they did not fit into a 'theme'.

Last year one of my brothers got a fridge ornament and I got Jack Skellington as "Sandy Claws." We've also got a pickle, a bear flying an airplane, Santa playing pinball, angels, Winnie the Pooh, gingerbread men and women, the list goes on and on.

I love decorating for Christmas! I've done just blue with bright white lights which was lovely, and I've done tropical which looks good on a black tree but mine was green, and the colours were bold- pink, lime, purple and blue. It was lovely! Last year we went traditional, this year I'm thinking either just plain gold or cream and gold.

back when i was a single girl and lived on my own my tree was either red and gold or blue and silver, all very tasteful and co-ordinated with wrapping paper and bows and ribbons on gifts
fast forward a few years and now my tree is a riot of colour and styles of decoration, decorated by my step-children (i must confess i have been known to re-dress the tree to balance it a bit) the wrapping paper is now one type per child to make it easier when sorting gifts and nothing ever goes to plan.
its also a whole lot more fun than it used to be :-)

Well it would not be so bad if it was a cross not an X. But I don't like either since we forget and use the word as one and it never seems to say Christ's Mass. I do not believe Christ was born at that time of the year when you read the history of that time. But was just a replacement of a old worship festival of pagan gods. The Catholic church replaced this to try to stop the festival of hanging gifts on trees, So what do we do? But as long as we give God the glory of Christ's birth. I am sure He will not mind, it is what is in our heart that matters. We do worse things than give each other gifts in remembrance of His gift to us. look up the meaning of Mass in the Catholic or Orthodox . and I ask do you celebrate mass. I remember by celebrating the last super. but not all the singing and chanting and same words than mean nothing to the person repeating them. If Christ lives in us then He is a welcome guest and no where is hid, I feel Christmas is nothing to do with Christ any more in Britain or America. some other countries do celebrate Christ at this time but very Catholic but still very nicely done, I thank God I live in one of those countries, but the Commercial influence is still there:

<question>



Why did Aisha go to war with Imam Ali the fourth rightly guided KALIPHA (in the battle of the Jammal)? ?



</question>



<additional details>



Imam Ali (A.S.) wrote letters to Ummul Momeneen Ayesha, Talha and Zubayr, warning them against the unwise steps they had taken, but his words were ignored. Finally he marched to Basra at the head of 20,000 men.

Ummul Momeneen Ayesha's forces numbered 30,000 but they were mostly raw recruits, while Imam Ali's (A.S.) army was full of battle veterans.

In Basra, the sight of Imam Ali's (A.S.) men in battle formation filled Ummul Momeneen Ayesha and her comrades with terror. Imam Ali (A.S.) talked at length with Talha and Zubayr, negotiating for peace. He reminded them of the words of the Holy Prophet (S.A.W.) regarding his authority, which they both admitted they had heard. Zubayr was ashamed of his deeds and left the scene but Talha remained doubtful. Ummul Momeneen Ayesha was furious at the conduct of the two and ordered a raid at nighttime to end the chance of peace.



The next morning Ummul Momeneen Ayesha mounted her camel al-Askar and urged her troops to prepare for battle. Thus began the unfortunate Battle of Jamal (Camel), where Muslims fought each other for the first time. Although outnumbered, Imam Ali (A.S.) and his soldiers were too skilled to be defeated. Soon victory began to incline towards Imam Ali (A.S.). Talha was wounded and later died. Ummul Momeneen Ayesha's camel was brought down and Imam Ali (A.S.) ordered her brother Muhammad bin Abu Bakr to take care of Ummul Momeneen Ayesha.

After that, the battle was soon over, and Imam Ali (A.S.) declared a general amnesty for all the rebels.

Ummul Momeneen Ayesha's plans had come to nothing and 10,000 men lay dead as a result of her jealousy. In this battle Imam Ali (A.S.) restrained his men from taking any war booty and all property found on the battle ground was gathered in the mosque of Basra, from where the owners could claim their possessions.



So please explain to me WHY?

Even if somebody insists to call those 6 days, 24-hour periods, they can still be refuted by the fact that Qur'an mentions a day which is equal to 1000 years of what we count, and yet another day which is equivalent to 50,000 years of what we count, and hence, there is plenty of room to argue that those 6 days are not literal but rather 6 periods of a certain measure of time.

The Qur'an states that "Allah created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six days" (7:54). While on the surface this might seem similar to the account related in the Bible, there are some important distinctions.

The verses that mention "six days" use the Arabic word "youm" (day). This word appears several other times in the Qur'an, each denoting a different measurement of time. In one case, the measure of a day is equated with 50,000 years (70:4), whereas another verse states that "a day in the sight of your Lord is like 1,000 years of your reckoning" (22:47). The word "youm" is thus understood, within the Qur'an, to be a long period of time -- an era or eon. Therefore, Muslims interpret the description of a "six day" creation as six distinct periods or eons. The length of these periods is not precisely defined, nor are the specific developments that took place during each period.

After completing the Creation, the Qur'an describes that Allah "settled Himself upon the Throne" (57:4) to oversee His work. A distinct point is made to counter the Biblical idea of a day of rest: "We created the heavens and the earth adn all that is between them in six days, nor did any sense of weariness touch Us" (50:38).

Allah is never "done" with His work, because the process of creation is ongoing. Each new child who is born, every seed that sprouts into a sapling, every new species that appears on earth, is part of the ongoing process of Allah's creation. "He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then established Himself on the Throne. He knows what enters within the heart of the earth, and what comes forth out of it, what comes down from heaven, and what mounts up to it. And He is with you wherever you may be. And Allah sees well all that you do" (57:4).

The Qur'anic account of creation is in line with modern scientific thought about the development of the universe and life on earth. Muslims acknowledge that life developed over a long period of time, but see Allah's power behind it all. Descriptions of creation in the Qur'an are set in context to remind the readers of Allah's majesty and wisdom.

"What is the matter with you, that you are not conscious of Allah's majesty, seeing that it is He Who has created you in diverse stages? See you not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another, and made the moon a light in their midst, and made the sun as a (glorious) lamp? And Allah has produced you from the earth, growing (gradually)" (71:13-17).

the word for day in this wod is "Yaum" which also means period

to us, living on earth,  a day is 24hrs, the time it takes for the earth to make one rotation about it's axis.

now how can u measure a day during the time when there was no sun and not earth?, no day and no night?

here the meaning of day comes in the sense of "periods" or "stages", the universe was created in 6 stages or went through six stages of formation. and if you look up the big bang theory and the formation of the universe then ull see that people divide the formation of the universe into 5-6 stages.

The Quran in Surah 7:Verse 54, Surah 10: Verse 3, Surah 11: Verse 7, and Surah 25: Verse 59 clearly teaches us that God created "the heavens and the earth" in six days. The issue centres on the fact of whether these days are meant literally, or do they refer to God creating the universe over an indefinite period of time. Only God knows the expanse of time taken for His creation, bearing in mind time is highly relative, depending on the movements of the earth against the sun or even the moon.

From the prophet's tradition: God created the earth on Sunday and Monday. He created the mountains and the uses they possess on Tuesday. On Wednesday, He created trees, water, cities and the cultivated barren land. These are four (days). On Thursday, He created heaven. On Friday, He created the stars, the sun, the moon, and the angels, until three hours remained.



In the first of these three hours He created the terms (of human life), who would live and who would die. In the second, He cast harm upon everything that is useful for mankind. And in the third, (He created) Adam and had him dwell in Paradise. He commanded Iblis to prostrate himself before Adam, and He drove Adam out of Paradise at the end of the hour. The prophet's tradition not only states that the days of creation were literal, but that the heavens and the constellations were created after the earth!

So, it is anybody's guess as to the actual time taken as per our computation of time today, since the sun and the moon were created only on the 5th day that is Friday. As such how do you compute time without the sun and the moon? Wallahu'alam!

In the name of Allah, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,

In the situation where a Muslim female is in need of medical treatment, the endeavour should be that she is treated by a female medical doctor, preferably a Muslim. If a female practitioner is:

a) Easily available,

b) One is satisfied and content with her medical treatment,

c) There is no other valid legal (shar'i) excuse for not resorting to her treatment,

then in such a case, it would not be permissible to seek the medication of a male doctor, rather, the illness must be treated by a qualified female doctor.

It is stated in al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya, a renowned Hanafi Fiqh reference:

"If a woman has a wound in a part of the body that is impermissible for a male to look at (m, meaning other than the face, hands & feet, for they are absolutely part of awra), it will be impermissible for her receive treatment from a male doctor, rather a female should be instructed to treat her. If a female expert is not available, neither is there a female who can be instructed to treat her… then in such a case it would be permitted for a male doctor to treat her, provided there is a genuine need. It will be necessary for her to cover other than the effected area, and he must lower his gaze as much as possible." (al-Fatawa al-Hindiyya, 5/330).

However, if the need is only for consultation or the medication is related to a part of the body that is not part of Awra, then it would be permissible to seek the treatment of a male doctor, although the treatment of a female doctor will still be preferable.

If the above-mentioned (3) points are not found, in that a medical female expert is not easily available, or if she is available, one is not content with her medication, or there is some other valid legal excuse, then in such a indispensable situation, it will be permissible to resort to the treatment of a male doctor, provided the male doctor only looks at (and handles) the effected area. The rest of the body of the female must remain covered.

Imam al-Haskafi (Allah have mercy on him) states:

"In the situation of a male doctor treating a female, he should only look at the effected area (m, whenever reasonably possible), for cases of need are restricted to the actual need. And it is preferable that the male doctor teaches and instructs a female in order to treat her, for looking (and treating) someone from the same gender is the lesser of two evils (m, i.e. when looking at parts of Awra)."

Imam Ibn Abidin (Allah have mercy on him) explains in his Radd al-Muhtar that, if the treatment is related to the private parts, then only in extreme situations will it be permitted for her to seek treatment of a male doctor. He states:

"If the treatment is on her private parts, then it is necessary that a female is instructed to treat her. If this is not possible and it is feared that the woman may perish or undergo unbearable pains, only then will it be permissible for a male to treat her." (See: Radd al-Muhtar ala al-Durr al-Mukhtar, 6/371).

The same has been mentioned in other Hanafi Fiqh references. See: Ibn Nujaym, Bahr al-Ra'iq, 8/192, Qadhikhan in his Fatawa, 3/409 & Bada'i al-Sana'i, 5/124.

Also, a Muslim doctor would be preferred over a non-Muslim for obvious reasons. However, if (once again) the three points are not met, then it would be permissible to seek the treatment of a non-Muslim doctor. Therefore the order in seeking medical treatment would be:

a) Muslim female doctor

b) Non-Muslim female doctor

c) Muslim male doctor

d) Non-Muslim male doctor

And in moving from one stage to another, the above three points should be kept in mind. The preference of a non-Muslim female doctor over a Muslim male doctor is due to the fact that, looking at the awra of someone from the same sex (as mentioned in Durr al-Mukhtar) is lesser of an evil. Also, the covering of one's nakedness in front of a (non-Mahram) male has been given more importance than covering in front of a non-Muslim female.

And Allah Knows Best

Firstly I take it this is a religious question. Most of the people here are answering like its a open one.
It is not permissible in Islam (to the best of my knowledge) unless it is out of necessity. Since there are plenty of female gyno's about it would be best to see one of them.

It is allowed for medical reasons only if there is no female one present. If this happens, then it is better to have a nurse while the examination occurs. If you cannot even do that, then it is permissable to be examined by a male gynaecologis-although its embarrasing...0.o



I mean you cannot help it if something like that happens, and it is important to have a gynaecologist check you. If not,you might have a serious mediacl problem and not know it.

Absolutely it is okay. Medical care is a sensitive time in which a medical professional whether male or female is performing a necessary service for an individual and the community. It is a matter of health and not a matter of modesty in this case. Doctors will simply do what is necessary and nothing more...this is true for whether one is a male or female, muslim or not in the respective physician or patient role.

Our Prophet gave permission with his own mouth to Aslamia,the first female muslim physician to treat males and females alike...in battle or for whatever need. She also trained other females her trade.



To further the point, It is allowable for a female to even wash the body of a male if their is no male around to perform the task and vice versa at the time of death.

Well, when i just started college, i was planning on being a doctor....and the imam (we don't really like using the word imam, but yeah..) he tried his hardest to convince me to be a gynecologist....and if you haven't figured from my name...i'm a guy.



Anyways, most males that wanna be gynos don't do it for any sexual reason....(atleast in america, they're gonna end up seeing a lot of nasty stuff)......almost always, the best intentions are there.



Plus most gynos are ob/gyn......thats more convenient for pregnant women, and the idea of being responsible for the health of a newborn is appealing to many.......

But yes its allowed.

Obviously, you are in the minority.  Waiting until November to do any thinking or planning or shopping decreases your choices dramatically.  For example, one of our friends is Dutch.  If his wife wanted to have items shipped here from the Netherlands so he could begin to teach their young children about Dutch traditions, waiting until November to place the order could mean that the shipment wouldn't even arrive at their home until after Christmas.



A lot of us plan for Christmas all year simply because our budgets are limited.  We have to buy gifts throughout the year in order to be able to give the people we love just the right gift.



And many more of us simply love Christmas and enjoy talking about it and planning for it.  Why should we be forced to limit our love and enjoyment to only the 8 weeks that you think are appropriate?

One of my best friends is a Halloween junkie.  She plans ALL YEAR for her Halloween costume.  Maybe she shouldn't be allowed to talk about her costume or shop for her props and materials until October?

If it bothers you so very much that other people love Christmas and enjoy talking about it and planning for it all year, then don't wander into Christmas forums or Christmas shops.  Avoiding us is really pretty easy.  We're not trying to gain converts or force anyone into doing their own year-round Christmas; we just want to do our planning with other people who love the holiday year-round as much as we do.

A diploma (or rather degree) can be your ticket into the corporate rat race.  A good or bad thing, depending on what angle you look at that.

IT, that's a tricky field in America.  It depends on what you can do.  I know many computer jobs, especially programming and tech support, are outsourced to countries like India, since the labour there is really cheap.  An American company can hire around 15 Indians for the price of 1 American.

I don't know where you are living but I assume you want to know about job availability and stability.  You should check out the want ads to see if there are many listings for what you do.  If there is it can be indicative that there is a demand for what you do where you live.

Depends on who issued it and what the student did to earn it.  You could check with the government department of education, a government agency that administers that type of business (engineering, psychology, teaching, etc.), with an accredited university, or with prospective employers to get a good idea of the actual value a particular diploma has.  I would definitely do this before putting time, money, and effort into a diploma program.

Scarborough Council are the result of political correctness. This is the UK and we celebrate christmas and easter. Whilst I am not racist in any way I do think anybody from another country moving here must be expected to allow us to celebrate our own religious (or otherwise) holidays. Some needs to tell Scarb.

Scarborough Council have decided to do away with Rupert Murdoch, the Currant Bun, Fox International and Sky.  Did you really think they'd abolish their biggest money spinner?  People come from all over the world to Scarborough's Christmas markets and Christmas lights.  I'm sure your Kenyan wife thinks that the gullibility of the English is hilarious.

So they're going to change the names then?  Suits me.  The Christian feasts are the Nativity and the Resurrection.  Christmas is a name invented by English pagans to express their distaste at Christianity taking over their midwinter festival of overindulgence and Easter is the name of a pagan fertility goddess.

I just hate it when this backlash is supposedly made in the names of the non-Xians. It only creates animosity towards minority groups - as plainly seen here.



AS a non-Xian (Aussie with European background) I wish to declare that the Xmas celebrations (with all the non-Xian symbols) have never offended me (irritated sometime with Xmas carols starting in September)

I recognise the multi-faceted elements in each festival. Religions (the nativity), Traditional (Winter symbols), Secular (Aussie Xmas BBQ) & Commercial (Santa).



I've taught my daughter to respect to recognise these elements & respect other's Religious symbols.

They can ban them, rant and rave at them, but they will still be celebrated by Christians. If you are a true believer, than put up a banner, or a Star and tree, or a large Cross in your window, or in your garden. Buy cards to send, that have a Christian message on them, and wish everybody you meet a Holy and blessed Easter or Christmas. Above all, join with Christians all over the world in worship Sunday by Sunday, and not just at Easter and Christmas. Nobody can take away what you believe in your heart. Remember, Jesus is the reason for the Season(s).

Well clearly you'll have to celebrate 'Winter Solstice' and 'Spring Equinox' despite the wrath of Jul and Ēostre

I'm sorry to see the council turning its back on these great pagan celebrations that are so much a part of England's cultural history  )c:

My children's school (3 miles out of Leicester City centre) have banned the Nativity play, Easter activities & Harvest festival! ( yet they still have activities like lantern making for some of the Indian festivities). This sort of thing happens all the time & it is infuriating. Unfortunately though, some mindless idiots take it out on the ethnic groups (In Leicester they are no longer the minority). It isn't the fault of the ethnic groups. In fact many Asian & Black people are just as appalled at this kind of thing as we are. The blame lies at the door of our limp wristed, far left, idiotic Government. If there is uproar over this kind of thing, it isn't because we are racist, it is because we have simply had enough of being pushed into a corner in favour of ethnic groups by our own Government. Wanting to keep our faiths & traditions & asking that the government & some minorities of ethnic groups that do at times appear to push their beliefs in favour of ours, respect our own faith & tradition, is not being racist, it's trying to be patriotic & fair.

Every time some misguided council has decided to do something like this, everyone has said how ridiculous it is, including plenty of people from ethnic minorities who live in the area and from the rest of the country, I can't believe there is a council who still thinks this is a good idea, people like public celebrations, if they want to be inclusive of local minorities then they should ask weather they would like public recognition/celebration of some of their holidays as well, the council are just being cheap and outdated.
edit, to show how stupid this type of thinking is, look how mention of this has brought out the xenophobes:(

No i Would love to see Christmas & Easter canceled as they are now one big rip off. Christmas used to be something to look forward to and it was for most families the only time they had chicken. Just think how much the country could save by not cutting down trees and how much they cost to day, the amount of energy that could be saved by not putting all the lights up, the saving on council labour not having to put them up and take them down. What a hell of a saving on council tax. Look at all the left over food that gets bind. Easter is just a rip of now look at the cost of Easter cards and the cost of Easter eggs, look at how many bars of chocolate you can bye for the price of one egg. Both of them in the 50s & 60s used to be for a time of celebration family's got together on Christmas day open gifts played games watched a monochrome TV if you had one. Both of them have lost all of there meaning and spirit a times for forgiveness, its now just other days in the year. The problem is its not our country any more.

I enjoy the build up to Christmas,carols,putting up decorations,wrapping presents,the shops and streets with their decorations and lights;but Christmas Day doesn`t quite have the same magic now the kids are all grown up;they like to do their own thing at Christmas.I still put up the decorations and tree,it gives the cat a new game while it`s up...seeing how far he can get up it before it falls over..I have to tie it to the radiator(the tree not the cat!)Always do a great Christmas dinner with all the trimmings,just for the two of us,then we open the presents.It`s always very traditional.Although it`s different without the kids I still love it all,but at least without them we can put our feet up after dinner before we open the presents,we can zzz if we want,over indulge how much ,what and when we  like.The kids like doing their thing and now we can do ours.So,yes I enjoy Christmas,it`s a lot of work for just a few days,but worth it.I make handmade greeting cards as a hobby and have already made most of my Christmas cards and have several presents already stashed away. Can`t wait!And it`s even better if there`s a bit of snow for Christmas to set the scene.Can I be the first to wish you Happy Christmas!!

Well I am not I have not bothered with christmas since I was 8.
I am not of any religion either.
If you want to celebrate jesus's birthday then do it in October the month he was born.  As december 25th is the midwinter solstice it is a Pagen event which the religious people took as there own.  So therefore it had nothing to do with christ.  If you look at your history the time of Christ there were only 10 months of the calender not 12 as we have today hence jesus was born in October.

We decorate the tree and the house, and so does the whole neighborhood. Every evening between Thanksgiving and the New Year we take the kids for a walk to see all the lights. I make truffles and cookies and popcorn cake.

We go to my in-law's for Christmas Eve in the afternoon, and maybe later some friends will come for a gift exchange. Christmas day I make sweet rolls for breakfast and cook a huge meal for the whole family. We also do stockings Christmas morning - the family gives gifts to each other, but Santa brings us all treats in our stockings (my husband and I take turns sneaking downstairs to fill each other's).

Stay up late creating Christmas cards/gifts/decorations for every holiday occasion for the season. Its an incredibly feeling when November starts. Skip the feasting, and straight into the holiday/giving mood.

When November comes, I start making people things for Christmas, and start shopping.

Christmas comes, Presents are opened and given, trees are put up, lights and joy.



But the one thing I always do at Christmas is be with the woman I love.

Decorate the tree and put up lights and candles, bake lots of goodies, have a good fire burning.  Sometimes all the family come to us and more than 20 of us sit down to Christmas Dinner, I normally do a turkey crown and a leg of lamb or a ham, then after dinner we just get together and play silly games and watch Eastenders and the Corornation St Christmas day specials on the telly.  Sometimes we go to another relative's house and they do christmas dinner.  Just as long as we're all together it doesn't matter.

bergen in norway will be less likely to get snow as it is right on the coast and gets the warm waters from the gulf stream as we do.  The eastern part of Europe does not get affected by the warm seas and more often than not has snow around christmas time.......though neither is guarenteed, but if you want to chance it, then take the czech republic, it will be colder.

Well, my friends the situation of Pakistan is quite complicated and is not simple as it may appear.

When Pakistan got independence from Britain, India was already under a large influence of Russia. Pakistan was VERY VERY poor, and it was being said that perhaps the country will not survive beyond 5 or 6 MONTHS (not even years). Pakistan did not get its share of wealth and the arms as per agreement with the British.

Pakistan at that time had no option but to opt for whatever was available. With India being favored by Russia, Pakistan went to the other pole of USA.



Later Pakistan grew a bit stronger due to the good skills of people and the fighting spirit. However politically Pakistan has ALWAYS been a huge failure. Democracy is like a poison to Pakistan. It kills it without a sound. The war of 1965 was a huge blow to Pakistan. Although Pakistan won the war by inflicting very heavy punishment to the much larger foe (India). But it gave Pakistan a very bad lesson. The USA backed out of the war and instead demanded Pakistan, that they should not use any of the USA weapons in the war against the attacker (India). Pakistan did not have any other weapons. As a result the USA inflicted embargoes on Pakistan. Then in 1971 we had an even brutal lesson. The USA kept on showing the carrot to us that the US support will be arriving through the sea, but it NEVER arrived.



Pakistani forces had learned the hard lessons. But !!!! there was hardly any other alternative. The Afghan war brought the much needed upgrades to the military and the Airforce. But as soon as the war was over, we were again subject to embargoes. And this time we did not even have the spares to keep the weapons operational. This time the experts vowed, that despite depleting and very low financial reserves we must shift our paradigm. Because we are dealing with a filthy whore (USA), and not a partner at all. As a result, there was a marked emphasis on self reliance and shift to other sources.



You might be wondering WHY? the Pakistani forces did take such a long time to take such a decision. Well the answer lies in the technicalities. I have worked for both the Nuclear as well as the defense industries. The USA weaponry is quite cheaper to the French and the British. The ratio in many cases is more than 1 to 2. Now compare all this to the enemy we have to deal with. We have India as our major opponent. With its defense budget that is routinely 6 to 8 times the budget of Pakistani forces. India buys the Russian weaponry which is not only good but also cheaper.



The military studies show, that in order to win a war, the attacker has to have a might of 3 times the defender. The Pakistani forces based their doctrine on the principle that we will not let India achieve this ratio of 1 to 3. As a result, being a smaller country (5 times smaller to India) u can see that we maintain a force of 0.45 million compared to Indians of 1.1 million. Just because we are not to let them have the ratio of 1:3.

Now take the same case, with a throat squeezing budget of less than 5 times the opponet, we have been trying to keep the ratio less than 1:3. This is a HUGE achievement. And it comes at a COST.

By 1990, Pakistani forces had started shifting reliance to Chinese sources, following the tracks of Nuclear industry. Our Nuclear is largely indigenous. However, the defense industry is much more sophisticated than Nuclear. The defense cannot shift overnight. Therefore, Pakistan shifted slowly towards the Chinese. With the downfall of the soviet, USA has grown into a big unchecked devil. Pakistan has been consulting the affairs closely and under the table with the Chinese. And it follows the policy both through the advisory body of NSC and the Chinese advisory.



At the moment, the Chinese don't want an upfront confrontation with USA. But time is approaching when the Chinese will be soon in the position to be a key player in the politics of world. The USA has been trying hard to knit a web around China i.e. making move to promote business in Mongolia (1995), building up in Taiwan and South Korea, and now strengthening India.

But let us see, where the world goes.

Pakistan is not in a position to be in a direct confrontation. We have a war reserve of only 35 days. We can fight a fierce war for 3-4 weeks, but perhaps we cannot sustain it beyond that period, without necessary supplies. And the routes of our supplies are NOT very open. We don't have the good relations with Iran. Also the adjacent province of Baluchistan does not have the infrastructure to facilitate rapid transportation (it is a difficult terrain). The Afghans are useless. The border with China is a very thin one and the most DIFFICULT land route. The reliable supplies can reach us ONLY either through Air or sea. And a major confrontation, would quickly seal off both.

It is a difficult situation.

However, the people to be blamed are the Pakistani Muslims, not anyone else.

“By INVADING Pakistan in order to kill 1 Osama Bin Laden, this fool  OBAMA will create 100000 Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan and all around the Muslim world”.
First USA should give Pakistan the proper and latest equipment to seal its border with Afghanistan then criticize Pakistan, I wonder how Americans can only blame Pakistan for Taliban attacks? Since all 35 NATO nations are in Afghanistan with their latest equipments USA itself is there with the number one technology in the whole world, Afghanistan should care about its borders but yet the whole world and specially USA blame only only only PAKISTAN.
We all know that USA can't secure its easy border with Mexico with its world number one technology but they expect Pakistan to secure its Mountainous border with Afghanistan, i just wonder on the hypocrisy of Americans.
Securing Pakistan Afghanistan border is a joint joint joint responsibility of all NATO and specially AMERICA & Afghanistan & then PAKISTAN.
And Pakistan has lost more troops & civilians than USA or any other country for this so called war on terror.
USA and WEST first look at their deeds then point out their fingers on Pakistan, USA must must must give Pakistan the latest spying equipments otherwise they should not expect something from Pakistan which is not possible even from them.

& REMEMMBER THAT “PAKISTAN IS NOT AN COUNTRY SO USA OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY MAKE THEIR MOVE AND GET AWAY WITH IT”.

USA only like those democracy which supports its goals and objectives, they don't like truly elected democracy. Most current examples are Hamas (elected by people but rejected by USA), Iran's president (elected by people but rejected by USA).

USA supported the dictatorship of Musharraf and they still not saying to him to leave the president house, now tell me what’s that?

All USA has is just "double standards".

***What USA has done for Pakistan, in order to stop this, they must help Pakistan this is their duty, b/c if Pakistan leave USA in supporting in their so called fight against terrorism all suicidal attacks will start occurring in USA.?***

In comparisson to the U.S.A, Pakistan is a nice, sweet, mushy kitty cat.



Some people don't seem to realize that the U.S. up until now has bombed everyone except the real terrorists that pose a threat.  All those people who died are innocent civilians and they have nothing to do with terrorism.

The U.S. is responsible for most of the killings that is taking place in this world now and for the secretarian violences that broke out in some other parts of the world.

Before accusing pakistani's everyone needs to understand PAKISTAN HAS BEEN HELPING USA WITH WAR ON TERRORISM FOR HE PAST 6 YEARS THEY ALLOWED U.S SOLDIERS TO ENTER PAKISTAN AND USE IT'S LAND BUT IF THEY WILL KEEP ATTACKING PAKISANTI TERRIRTORY OFFCOURSE PAKISTAN WON'T TOLERATE THIS. 
IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE THAT WAR ON TERRORISM SHOULD BE FOUGHT BUT NOT BY ENTERING A FREE COUNTRY FOR THE REASON OF THEIR LACK OF SECURITY OF WAR AGAINST TERROISM. PAKISTAN IS AN INDEPENDANT COUNTRY WHO DID ALL THEY CAN AND NOW IF THE U.S IS NOT SATISFIED THEY ARE ATTACKING PAKISTAN . IF THE TERRORIST SPREAD ALL OVER PAKISTAN WILL U.S START ATTACKING OTHER PAKISTANI'S CITIES ASWELL? WHAT IF THEY SPREAD OVER INDIA? EVERYONE NEEDS TO STOP SAYING THAT THIS IS A WAR AGAINST TERRORISM AND EVERYTHING HAPPENING IS JUSTIFIED



THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS. THIS IS JUST GOING TO CREATE MORE TROUBLE AND U.S OBIVOUSLY IS NOT INTIMADATED BY PAKISTAN'S RETALIATION BUT



FOR ONCE EVERYONE NEEDS TO THINK THAT IF ANYONE ONE EVER ATTACKED U.S FOR THE SAME REASON LIKE PAKISTAN IS BEING ATTACKED

I DONT THINK U.S WOULD LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.

IT IS PAKISTAN'S DECENCY TO TOLERATE ALL THIS. BUT BELIEVE ME THE TOLERANCE WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER

IF ANYONE THINKS I'M TAKING SIDES I'M NOT I BELIEVE WAR ON TERRORISM IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT THE WAY U.S IS HANDLING IS SURELY NOT THE WAY TO DO THIS.

I think the pakistani officials are fine with it.

assalamo alikom
you are right we can not just wait for a miracle to happen we have to create the miracle.
[8.53] This is because Allah has never changed a favor which He has conferred upon a people until they change their own condition; and because Allah is Hearing, Knowing;

[13.11] ... surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition; and when Allah intends evil to a people, there is no averting it, and besides Him they have no protector.

so Allah is telling us that if we want a change in our life we have to do it our selves,we have to learn and to work and worship Allah ,and this is the only way to solve our problems.

He has a special permit and thus is never done for trespassing. He may have a special key, but usually his eyes twinkle merrily and doors or windows open, chimney and fire places get wider. More importantly family dogs don't bark, snarl or snap.



Father Christmas is I think the most appropriate term. I under stand the the name Santa or Santa Claus is a modern invention

The perfect Christmas holiday abroad?



My boyfriend and I have been discussing what to do for Christmas, and we would love to go away - either on a skiing holiday or sun!  We would go for a week from 26th/27th Dec, but skiing seems to be really expensive (more so than what it was a few years ago).

We have a decent enough budget, but don't want to miss out on having a good time, or settle for "budget" accommodation.



On the other hand, we would be happy to go for a week in the sun.

I just wondered what experiences people had had of Christmas/New Years holidays abroad?  What to look for when booking?  What to avoid, etc?  Any advice, recommendations or anything would be greatly appreciated!! Muchos gracias!!

Well I live in Austria and know what it costs to Ski here. then Switzerland is even more expensive. But there are ways to beat that.
But you would need more than a few pounds. but you could just visit Vienna stay in one of the hostels like Vienna city hostel. travel to Semmering or some where else near rent a car or car share. and ski for the day Semmering is 95 Kms from Vienna and has a great ski area  and great ski rental and not to expensive for the day.(even though it was the host of the World cup Ski 2006-07) the roads are good. and you also have Slovakia near with cheaper Ski areas. Vienna is lovely around Christmas with more to see than most cities, great Christmas markets better than any in Germany. I just live 2 minutes away from the Vienna city Hostel if you need information, but won't be here at Christmas will be in Germany with my wife's family. Unless they come to Vienna for a change. They love it here but one week is to short to see Vienna and ski. but Vienna at Christmas is an experience not to be missed, as is New year here transport is all night new year and free

If you want somewhere different and some skiing why not have a look at Turkey?  Not the coastal region but around Capadoccia (I know it's not spelt right but I'm near!)  It is a magical area with houses and hotels carved out of lava which looks like fairy chimneys and is beutiful. You could do a hot air balloon ride over the snowy scenary on Christmas morning - sunrise is beutiful.  Skiing is also supposed to be good around there but not quite so developed.

Well i think you need to save a bit more money as £20 for all of them is only £2.50 each!!

If you can save up for around £5 each for your friends and then £10 for your boyfriend you will be fine! With your friends i would suggest heading into like boots, superdrug, tesco or Lloyds pharmacy as near Christmas they do those 3 for 2 or 3 for £10 deals on christmas gifts and most of the stuff is really good!

With your boyfriend why not buy him something little with the £10 and then make him something....maybe a photo album / collage thing! Or even a burnt CD of all his favourite songs!

You dont need alot of money but you do need a fair bit sweetie! So if you get £45 you are laughing!

I've stopped bothering about christmas presents well christmas in general.

But, when someone gets me something it means I have to respond so I normally donate to charity. You can buy a gift for someone in the third world and you can choose what you give them. For example, you can buy them a packet of seeds for £2 etc etc. Everyone I've done this too was really really impressed and many didnt believe I cared so much about others...well...

Nasabies Can you explain Please?



Allah (swt) sent 124,000 Prophet's to guide mankind. Is there any proof that on the deaths of any one of these Prophet's his companions failed to attend his funeral preferring to participate in the selection of his successor? If no such precedent exists then why did the Prophet (saaws)'s companions follow this approach?
"the Sahaba viewed the appointment of the Imam as so important that they preferred it to attending the Prophet's funeral" - taken from Sharh Fiqa Akbar, by Mulla Ali Qari, p 175 (publishers Muhammad Saeed and son, Qur'an Muhall, Karachi).

Your religion is based on lies. This has been known for hundreds of years.

Imam Maalik was asked about the Raafidah and he said: Do not talk to them and do not narrate from them, because they tell lies.



Imam al-Shaafa’i said: I have never seen anyone who bears false witness more than the Raafidis.



The sahabas loved the prophet more than thier wives and children and mothers. I don't know why you ask this question. You are not going to believe any of the real muslims, or the sahih hadiths so there is really no point. May Allah Guide you from Shiaism to Islam. Ameen.



EDIT- I am a muslim that follows the quran and sunnah.

Ya shia ,ya rafidah how we can explain that these books r not salafis books 
I adviced you so many time that plz ,b4 posting a question ask some one who has a little knowledge of muslims book .

If your quotations is right even this has nothing to do with so called wahabis .

It shows u call all the muslims Nasabi.
isn't that ?

I wish this question stays ,so every one knows that you call hanafis ,as a nasabi

Edit : @Asker! Blocking doesn't make any difference to you ,you have many back doors (I mean fake accounts ) to enter my questions

ok, i don't really quite get it what kinda answer ur looking for. and i am not an islamic scholar, but i know that shiites do not follow the either the sunnah or acknowledge the hadith of the prophet.shiites cursed the sahabah, the prophets wives, with exception of khadija i assume. it seems like your prophet more to is Saiyyidina Ali rather than Mohamed SAW.since ur a shiite, i wanna ask u a question coz i posted this question days ago, but no satisfactory answers.i have a dozen of iranian shiite friends, and during this ramadan, none of them break fast(iftar), or go out from class for Maghreb prayer. aren't shiite muslims too? and aren't muslims are suppose to pray?sunni muslims are 90% majority in this world, doesn't that say something?

Salam for you my dear friend. I think Muawiyah was wrong because he waged war with Imam Ali as the legal fourth authority guided Khalipha.
Muawiyah was tempted by syaitan because he wanted the authority which was belonged by Imam Ali.

assalamo alikom
you are right we can not just wait for a miracle to happen we have to create the miracle.
[8.53] This is because Allah has never changed a favor which He has conferred upon a people until they change their own condition; and because Allah is Hearing, Knowing;

[13.11] ... surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition; and when Allah intends evil to a people, there is no averting it, and besides Him they have no protector.

so Allah is telling us that if we want a change in our life we have to do it our selves,we have to learn and to work and worship Allah ,and this is the only way to solve our problems.

One should pray before 12 night Isha prayers, it is better, but according to my knowledge u can pray Isha prayers just before the timing of Fajr starts.And i think Isha prayers r not compelte till u offer Witr rikaat, ask it from Islamic scholars as well.

With Isha, you must pray 3 witr, it's wajib and Wajib is pretty close to Fardh. Your Isha prayer is not complete without praying Fardh.



"It is Mustahab (preferable) to delay the Esha Salaah to one third of the night. Rasulullah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said “If I did not fear difficulty upon my Ummah, I would have commanded them to delay the Esha to one third of the night. It is Mubah (permissible) to delay Esha Salaah unto half of the night. To delay it to after half of the night is Makrooh (reprehensible) (Tahtaawi Page 184 Ilmiyya). "

How do you even know that all Muslim men read The Holy Quran at all? No I would not want to take any contraceptive pills to stop my periods. Allah has created my body to act in such a manner and it will continue to follow thru with it's its natural course until I'm old and bone crackling dry, or if he decides otherwise. I know of quite a few Muslim men who cant even tell you anything about what's in The Holy Quran yet they call themselves Muslims.

What for? When a person is used to doing some sort of Ibada regularly then he/she has to stop for a certain reason, he will still get the reward as if he/she never stopped. So, we will still be getting the rewards for our prayers although we don't pray during these days! Good for us.

Plus, we only refrain from a few things, we can still read you know so how can it have any affect on our "knowledge"?!!

There is no need for her to use these pills to help her worship Allaah, because the period which happens to her is something which Allaah has decreed for the daughters of Adam.



The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) entered upon ‘Aa’ishah when she was with him during the Farewell Pilgrimage. She had entered ihraam for ‘Umrah, then her period came before she reached Makkah. He entered upon her and found her weeping. He asked, “Why are you weeping?” and she told him that her period had come.  He told her, “This is something which Allaah has decreed for the daughters of Adam.”



So the period is not something which is under her control. let her accept what Allaah has decreed for her and not use these pills.If her period comes and she cannot pray or fast, this is beyond her control and is the decree of Allaah.

erm.. if im not mistaken,, didnt Allah create us women to have our cycles?... So if we allow something to happen naturally without unnatural interuption, then its also a sign of worship to accept what Allah bestows on us.. right?... So its a test of our patience, or faith to accept this.. I as a women, take this honor proudly.. and when Allah allows us a grace period for 7 days, it doesnt mean we are less accepted or in sin those 7 days.. in fact, I think of it as a test of faith and if we are patient, we receive more blessings...
Thank Allah for me being a women!... ^_^

God has graced us all different, you know, God really has blessed a Woman, the time of a menstrual cycle lets us know that everything is OK on the inside, God knows us best and knows to pray/fast and look after the home/kids or go to work/school would be so hard, you are physically and mentally drained when you are on your menses.

God allowed us to take a rest, although did not allow us to forget about God, we are allowed to recite the Qur'an (the bits that we know) but not touch the Qur'an.



God gave Women this gift, to give birth to a Child, that is so special.

To put that against our mental ability to know more about Islam is rubbish, we are all different. One persons intellect can be much stronger/quicker than the other. I know i pick things up much more quicker than my Husband, Women can Multi task better than men which means they can function more than one thing in their brain at any one time.

Why do certain religions not like pork?



I understand the idea that an animal that eats its own excrement is dirty--but chickens live in their waste --so much so that the urine burns in to the skin--however I have never heard of a religion saying to boycott KFC? Apart from Buddhism and Hinduism(vegetarians).



</question>



<additional details>



Thanks for all the answers , I find it staggering at the Muslim answers regarding people who eat Pork.
Think of the Chinese and other Asian people who survive on pork--are you saying they are inherently evil?
To discount 2 billion plus peoples way of life -due to something you read in a pulp novel(koran) that is shameful--something familiar with the vast majority of Islamic taliban.

Pork, that other white meat, has a bad biblical reputation. So are all of us pork-eating heathens on the express elevator to Hades or what?

Pork in the Bible/Torah/Koran has been condemned as unclean. Believers should not eat or even touch the carcass of a pig. Hence, the Target stores employees from Somalia requesting not to have to touch pork at the check out line. I am not going to berate anyone for his or her beliefs. This is a free country. Their qualms, caused me to think, why pork?

Pigs are omnivores meaning that they eat anything! They eat things many find disgusting and others find inconvenient. They eat, they survive and they live like pigs. Why do they live like pigs? Because they are treated as pigs. Pigs are actually clean and intelligent animals. A pig in a pigpen or sty chooses one corner of the pen for potty duties and the rest for the everyday things of pig life. It is up to the pig owner to clean out the poop if the sty is to be less sty-ish.

Pigs don't sweat, so they are into getting wet or hanging in the shade to cool down. Since few pigs can afford a swimming pool, they often have to opt for a mud bath. Elephants enjoy their mud baths if the pool is closed. So why are pigs picked on in religions?

Illness is the reason. Omnivores, especially outcast omnivores, eat things that can cause them to have parasites and other microscopic bugs that cause disease. Bears, horses, cats, dogs, and walruses can all contain parasites in their meat that can cause illness in the consumer that are in the same parasite groups as the pig. Okay cats, dogs and walruses are not omnivores, but they eat their entire prey. Think about it. Horses? That will have to be another discussion. Just about everything all critters that walk, fly or swim can have parasites harmful to humans.

Pork is known as a meat which has to be cooked carefully to avoid food poisoning, so it seems likely that in the days before refrigeration, in a warm climate like the Middle East, pork was a meat best avoided.

If people won't do this for their own good, what better way to get them to follow the advice by telling them it's God's / Allah's rules!

I believe it dates further back then that. LoL Chickens burning themselves with their waste is relatively new. (say the last few decades, whereas the pork thing dates back 100s of years). Chickens don't LAY in their own waste because they WANT TO. It's because the place in which their are housed doesn't have any other place...
If you lived in a box for 20 years, you'd be playing in your own waste too...

I believe the pork ban in religion came along not only as a "they're dirty animals" but also because people got sick from eating it. If you don't cook pork thoroughly you can get a parasite...
A lot of stuff in religion has a basis other then "do this bc god says so" Or maybe that's the reasoning given, but it has another application. 
EXAMPLE: The tribesmen of bababa (not a real place.. derrr) say not to go to the swamp because the ghost of ebuhemu will get into you and you will be possessed and die.
Will you really be possessed and die? no. But it is shown that mosquitoes live around swamps... and it is known that mosquitoes in that area carry malaria. Malaria is KNOWN to kill people..

because pigs are dirty, eat their own poop, fair enough if a chicken lives in urine and it burns into the feathers, the feathers are removed at the butchers. A pig takes the excrement and digests it into its very own digestive system which is part of the meat...for sale. Furthermore pigs mate with anyone and anything, they even get their partners to mate with others hehehe......bit like some humans i guess!

Those are a few reasons why some religions dont it is not because the religion says no, it is becasue the religion gives a logical n common sense type reason for the prohibition.



by the way chickens DO NOT CHOOSE TO BE IN THEIR OWN WASTE! the fast supermarket companies do this for their own greed to mass produce.

Non-Muslims and atheists will agree only if convinced through reason, logic and science. Eating of pork can cause no less than seventy different types of diseases. A person can have various helminthes like roundworm, pinworm, hookworm, etc. One of the most dangerous is Taenia Solium, which is in lay man’s terminology called tapeworm. It harbours in the intestine and is very long. Its ova i.e. eggs, enter the blood stream and can reach almost all the organs of the body. If it enters the brain it can cause memory loss. If it enters the heart it can cause heart attack, if it enters the eye it can cause blindness, if it enters the liver it can cause liver damage. It can damage almost all the organs of the body.



Another dangerous helminthes is Trichura Tichurasis. A common misconception about pork is that if it is cooked well, these ova die. In a research project undertaken in America, it was found that out of twenty-four people suffering from Trichura Tichurasis, twenty two had cooked the pork very well. This indicates that the ova present in the pork do not die under normal cooking temperature.



Pork has very little muscle building material and contains excess of fat. This fat gets deposited in the vessels and can cause hypertension and heart attack. It is not surprising that over 50% of Americans suffer from hypertension.



The Qur'an prohibits the consumption of pork in no less than 4 different places. Pork is also  prohibited in the Bible in the book of Deuteronomy and Leviticus.

In folklore terms, eating the meat of the pig is said to contribute to lack of morality and shame, plus greed for wealth, laziness, indulgence, dirtiness and gluttony. We insult a person by calling him or her a "Pig" when they demonstrate these characteristics. Muslims are forbidden by God to eat the meat of the pig (pork).



This is detailed in verses 2:173, 5:3, 6:145, and 16:115 of the Qur'an. An exemplary verse is quoted here: "He has only forbidden you dead meat, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and any (food) over which the name of other than Allah has been invoked. But if one is forced by necessity, without willful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, then Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

The Old testament advises against eating many types of animals - one of which is swine.



You can find it in Leviticus 11 and Deutoronomy 14.  It advises against eating the animals with a split or cloven hoof that do not chew the cud (including camels, horses, rats, skunks, dogs, cats, squirrels, and possums; they do not chew cud.)

Lev 11:7-8 says that swine are so unclean that we are warned not to touch the body, meat or carcasses of pigs.
Further, it says not to eat fish without scales: including smooth skinned species of fish and crustaceans.  Also, it says avoid eating birds which eat flesh.

Introduction
There  is a widespread misconception that  Muslims  obtains from  eating pork because pig is sacred and is worshipped as  God 
in  Islam.  It  is  inconceivable that  there  are  people  whose mentality could go down to such a dismal low as to entertain  or 
fabricate repulsive idea such as this. No intelligent, refined and self-respecting  person would ever imagine himself deifying  pig, an  animal  which  lives on offal  and  pigsty.  This  pernicious misconception  is the product either of the malicious  intent  to malign



Islam



and



the



Muslims



in



general;



abysmal ignorance;whimsical  intent; or utter disregard or  violation  of the Biblical prohibition. Muslims' abstention from pork eating is in adherence to the Qur'anic Law which states: " Forbidden to you for (food) are: dead meat, blood and the flesh of the swine and thatwhich hath been invoked the name other than Allah. "Holy Qur'an 5:4

Such prohibition is also found in the Bible. "The pig also because it is a splitter of the hoof but there is no cud. It is unclean for you. None of their flesh must you eat and carcass you must not touch. " Deuteronomy 14:8 ( Bible) Islam ( an  Arabic  word  which means submission to the  will of  the Almighty God) has laid down the foundation for  the  best approach  in keeping good health. In the  Holy



Qur'an (The  Last Testament ) God exhorts the believers to select the best food and to stay away from any harmful food to maintain good health: " Let him find out which is the best food ( to be had ) ... Eat of the best foods We have provided for you . " ( Holy Qur'an 18:19;7:160 ) The main purpose of a True Religion  must be to build an ideal community  in



this world ; a  religion  that  promotes  moral, political and economic well;social harmony and peace, as  well  as good health of its believers or followers.  Health  means the physical and mental well-being  and freedom from  diseases  and pain.There are several passages in the Bible, articulating  that because of sin ( a transgression of the law of God) God afflicted  human beings with  maladies  (Ps.103:3;Exodus 15:26  and Psalms 107:16-20).Islamic  instructions and  teachings espousing  health  consciousness have  scriptural  and  scientific support



MEDICAL ASPECT OF THE PROHIBITION
Abstention  from  eating pork is a



measure  to  safeguard health.  Of all the domestic animals, pig is the most avaricious, eating  anything  including human excreta. It  is  the cradle of harmful germs and parasites. Its meat is carrier of  diseases to man, thus making it unfit for human consumption.

CHARACTER OF PIG
All  types  of animals are lawful to be eaten  whether  those living on land or in the water except those animals  specifically forbidden  in the Holy Writings revealed by the  Almighty  Creator and  the  sayings  of the Prophet with  clear  and  well  defined injunctions. Pig  belong to the forbidden animals, and not allowed  to  be eaten  by the believers. Pig eats almost anything dirty and  they are very  lazy animals. It is the most avaricious of all domestic animals. Amongst all animals, pig is the cradle of harmful germs. It's meat serves as  carrier of diseases to mankind. It is this very reason that made it unfit for human consumption consumption.

DISEASES CAUSED BY PORK
The  following lists show germs or parasites that are  found in  pork and some diseases caused by them. Many of these  diseases  are contagious while some are proven fatal.This proves that the more  science  advances the more Islam is shown correct as a religion of God.

PARASITIC DISEASES



a)  TRICHINELLA  SPIRATIS  ( Trichina worms )



It is the most dangerous parasite to man ( Rheumatism and  muscular  pain). The infected persons shown no symptoms, recover
very slowly some die, some  reduced to permanent invalids. No one is immune from this disease and there is no cure.



b)  TAENIA SOLIUM  ( Pork tape worm )
The  worm  causes malnourishment of the person  leading to  anemia, diarrhea, extreme  depression  melancholia and digestive disturbances.  Cysticercosis  means that larva enter  the  blood  stream then settle down in one or more of the vital organs of the body, for example: brain, liver, lungs or spinal cord.  They  grow  and



encapsulate, inducing  pressure to the system around, resulting  in  dangerous  diseases (diarrhea, digestive disorder, anemia, chronic invalidation).



c)  ROUND WORMS

Examples: Ascaris, which



may  lead



to



digestive disturbances, appendicitis, obstructive jaundice.



d)  HOOK WORMS
Examples:Ancylostomiasis,  which



may



lead



to anemia, oedema, heart



failure



or retarded growth  ( mental  and  physical), tuberculosis, diarrhea and typhoid.



e)  SCHITOSOMA JAPONICUM



Bleeding, anemia  and  other  syndromes.  If ova are  settled in  the  brain  or spinal  cord, paralysis and death may occur.

I agree with what you say about the similarities of filthiness.  The bible also says in the OT that people were not to eat pork as well as other animals that are also mentioned in the quran.  Some Christians believe that since the old law was abolished when Jesus was born it means it is acceptable to eat.  I personally have eaten pork most of my life and like it.  It has done nothing to affect my health.  Pork is actually now considered to be a healthy, less fattening choice of meat to eat.

Well, we have to acknowledge that these livestock are just that -- live "stock."  This demonstates that a host of animals were taken from their native environs, then adapted with specific partiality for its domestic and business potentials and purposes, which is to say again that such was adapted as a medium through which monetary exchanges would occur.  There would be winners, there would be losers.



Someone above makes a good point -- if pigs are so filthy, then why not boycott KFC because of its Market in chickens?  And of course, there 'is' a case to be made as regards "domesticated" pigs, which should never have been made a staple in the first place...and so the varied scriptures were absolutely correct in that instance.



But none of the species of animals are in themselves the filth-ridden creatures in their native moorings and habitats; only is it so where Humankind has tampered with the natural balances of phenomena occurring in Nature. These beings live completely wild, otherwise clean, and vital lives, 'untouched' by the pestilential stench of greed as commonly akin to Western civilization.

'Domesticated' -- we should emphasize, 'domesticated' -- pigs were bred from out of a species of several types of family of swine.  There is nothing innately dark about the species of pig.  They are found in Africa and South America and Asia; the species the western world chose to domesticate and husband and therewith propogate are just one of a varied host, which has been extremely tampered with.  But none in the wild live in filth and whose intelligences are at a par with that of canines; some biologists say theirs are even more acute than that of canines'.



Oh they waddle in mud holes and that sort of thing, yes, but so do hippopatumuses, elephants, and rhinoceruses...  We simply never dare chose to market these species for eating and so never stigmatize them to be filthy creatures.  Moreover, they are too dangerous and powerful to dare domesticate for food purposes -- excepting "black markets," yes.  But that is a whole other matter, isn't it, which is a commentary on human beings, not pigs?

There 'are' species, of course, that are naturally prohibitive using -- whether for eating or otherwise -- because of their inherent natures.  These 'are' the vermin and vectors, which naturally are nature's own waste disposal species, salvagers, and re-cyclers...  Pigs 'can' be categorized in this light given the manner in which theirs has been tampered with.

Who does not know otherwise at least one of these types of species -- cockroaches, lice, countless forms of bacteria, buzzards, most but not all forms of mosquitoes, there are the rats -- even lobsters; that's right, lobsters! -- &c...&c...&c?



Lobsters, in fact, are quite a filthy creature that live to great ages, interestingly -- so important is their natural work upon the sea floors and oceans of the world to keep the waters and sea beds healthy.  They were never meant to be culled for dietary purposes.  Even native people only used and use them sparingly.  Same as to that of pigs.



But -- the Western world will have its ways: always are there the imbalances to be rent wherever the Western world comes to bear.  As to pigs, herein is the case that is so commonly focused upon: as regards the varied parasites and the like...direct result of tampering with the balances normally sustained in nature.



As to chickens, however, these are fowl native to Asia, and are not vectors or vermin, and are no different in their natures than are pheasant or turkey found anywhere.  They are foragers of vegetation and grains.  They are naturally a species that are spread out and do not cloister in cramped communities as we find in domesticated chicken farms and pig farms.

We need only view the conditions of certain sanitariums, nursing homes, and penitentiaries the world over to observe that when we put a cohort of any species of animals into cramped-up spaces, filth and disease are the result.



Many religions simply take in the habits of the pig based upon the artifices and conditions typically caused by haste and oversight of human beings and not those accorded these animals in and by nature.



Thus did a stigma form over time, and a mindset about pigs were established.  Second, the diets of olde were not healthy; and so, many of the leaders of the respective cultures and communities and religious groups thought it frugal to stigmatize pigs as a means to avert people from taking on imbalanced and unhealthy diets which practice includes the intake of too little diversity of grains, seeds, meats, vegetation, and assortments of varying proteins, without which balances starvation commences.



This is no different from that done in India many centuries ago: they made cows a sacred animal so that people would not slaughter these bovine creatures and cause certain imbalances in the environment, which in turn would cause an element of debauchery to take hold and express in the culture, for India's population had ever escalated over the ensuing decades and centuries.



As with too little of one thing and too much of another, poor nutrition would be a result of fixation upon some one thing, and thus an ineffective host of people, a weakened nation would ensue.

Oh my God this is so hard to choose there are so many good ones. My favourite cartoon christmas movie would have to be Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer followed closely by Santa Clause is Coming to Town followed by The Year Without a Santa Clause. My favourite christmas movie that is black and white screen is It's a wonderful life. My favourite recent christmas movie is Christmas With the Kranks Tim Allen is awsesome in that movie.

For me it's a tie between the Santa Clause movies, and The Polar Express. I didn't think it would be good because it's so different from the book, but it's really a wonderful movie.



Nick j is off the chain!/HBK HBK: I believe the movie you're thinking of is The Year Without a Santa Claus. Ice Miser and Heat Miser, but neither of them tried to take Christmas. Santa was sick and convinced that no one needed him.

Christmas Church Service Ideas?



i know its early but the church is planning now, i come from a small, poor baptist church. many of the choir members have left due to personal issues and now there are only 2 members left, therefor they cant do their christmas "act" now they would like the youth to participate , my piano teacher (also the oranist for the church) suggested i do a monologue, but i would also like to involve possibly



1-5 more people, could be a play or song (we have voice, piano, drums etc) or something more creative please help i am so lousy in the creative department

I also think it would be lovely if each of you held a lit white candle at the end of the skit or play to represent Jesus as The Light of the world.  Have someone turn off the lights in the church just before you do this. Sing Silent Night or O Holy Night while holding the candles.

get together anyone who can sing well and start a small church choir and have them sing a nice christmas song or two.  Also, you might want to have your pastor just read the Christmas story, or have him preach a small message about Christmas.  Or you might want your pianist to play a medley of Christmas songs as a special or something along those lines. My church is small as well, like 100 people, so we have to think of a lot of things on our own as well.

Good luck and God bless!

Allah (swt) tells us in the Holy Qur'an?



"And of the people of Madina are those who are bent on hypocrisy. You know them not, but we know them". (The Qur'an 9:101). The verse proves the existence of hypocrites during the lifetime of the Prophet (saaws). After the Prophet (saaws)'s death where did they go? Historians record the fact that two groups emerged following the Prophet (saaws)'s demise, Banu Hashim and their supporters, the State and their supporters. Which side did the hypocrites join?

Those hypocrites were Jews and Christians. That is why the Qibla had been changed to test the hypocrisy.

This does not mean that all of his companions were hypocrites.

According to Quran 59:10, 9:117, 4:100, 9:100 etc , we are not allowed to hate the companions of Prophet Mohammad PBUH.

59:10 And so, they who come after them pray: “O our Sustainer! Forgive us our sins, as well as those of our brethren who preceded us in faith, and let not our hearts entertain any unworthy thoughts or feelings against [any of] those who have attained to faith. O our Sustainer! Verily, Thou art compassionate, a dispenser of grace!”

9:117 Allah turned with favour to the Prophet, the MUHAJIRs, and the Ansar,- who followed him in a time of distress, after that the hearts of a part of them had nearly swerved (from duty); but He turned to them (also): for He is unto them Most Kind, Most Merciful.

I'd say right after halloween would be far more appropriate, but December 1 would be putting it off a bit longer than some would appreciate--including me.



Shops often put these things out because they have no place to keep them when they come in from suppliers. Equally, they hope some of us will start the run up to Christmas early. I saw some popping up round two weeks ago.



I love Christmas but too much too early seems socially inappropriate.

I can't work out why people would want to put up Christmas decs on the 1st, 3 weeks before the 1st day of Christmas! Seems silly to me, and not as special. If you're used to something for so long, you tend not to appreciate it as much.

I say even December 1st is wrong. I love Christmas! And I love decorating my tree and wrapping presents, my house is very festive at that time of year and I can't wait for it to come round again.

Traditionally the tree should go up on the 1st day of Christmas - Christmas Eve. I can't wait that long though, so it tends to go up a week before around the 17th, and I take it down on the 12th day - 5th January.

A lot of people put them up early because the weather is still nice.  They usually don't turn them on until closer to Christmas.  Also the people who decorate their whole house and yards start early so they can be done before December 1st.  If you don't like them up early then don't look at them and let the people who do enjoy them.  People like you are helping take our freedoms away.  Just because you don't like something doesn't' mean it should be banned.  How would you feel if they made a law that you can't do something you really liked?  Putting them up early doesn't hurt anyone and should NOT be banned!

Christmas is not just a day, it's a celebration of life and whenever a person chooses to start their festivities is their own discretion. Personally, I am a very big Christmas decorator and it takes to much time to put up for a month. I have five grand Christmas trees each year and my family loves it, I have traditional, themed and my daughter has her own tree. It's a feeling, not an act. I love what Christmas brings out in people and wish that same feeling would be year round. Enjoy, the season only come once a year.

I have already seen the first Christmas stuff for sale, before most of the Halloween stuff has gone on sale! It is getting ridiculous.

I think there should be some sort of controls over when Christmas decorations/lights are put up. September/October is way too early. By the time it is December, you are fed up with the sight of Christmas things. It really takes the sparkle out of the season.



Everyone knows Christmas is on December 25th, it happens every year, no-one suddenly decided to have a holiday or anything. Leave the decorations down till about 1st December at the earliest, preferably about 10th Dec.

i love the build up to it, only the other day i saw advent calendars in my local supermarket, fine it may still be september but it helps any one on a budget to spread the cost over a few months and my kids love the decorations no matter how early and to me xmas is mainly about my kids enjoyment and innocence at the belief of santa

At least until 1 December, in my humble opinion. Christmas is such a special festival, I don't have decorations up in our house until about two weeks before the date.

No one should be able to tell others when they can put up their own decorations. That would be like banning you from painting your house gray. It makes no sense and is not fair. Besides, 'round here if we waited until December first we wouldn't be able to put decorations up, it's too cold and there's snow all over everything. Let go of what isn't hurting you and stop being such a Grinch.

why shouldnt i be able to put christmas decorations up when i want to. i live in flippin Minnesota, putting up lights on my house is dangerous when its icy and cold outside. i could fall off the ladder and the ladder could also slip. there is nothing wrong with putting decorations up before December. i dont turn them on until december so why do you have such a problem with it. its a free country where im from. i have the right to put up decorations and if you dont like it then ignore them, grow up. there is nothing wrong with being in the Christmas spirit.

unfortunately we live in a world of pure unadulterated commercialism.  A bar in my town centre put up its christmas tree and decs the day after the August bank holiday.  How obscene, and don't forget that Harrods and Harvey Nicks had their christmas departments open at the beginning of August.



It does spoil things a lot as it just pushes and pushes and puts a lot of pressure on people unnecesarily.  That said, I think when it comes to home decorating that is purely your choice, I have friends who start decorating in the middle of November, I start in the 3rd week and have it completely ready for the start of advent.  After all, you put a lot of effort into decorations, why not make the most of them.....January can seem very drab in comparison when they are taken down.  (by the 5th btw)

If i was going to decorate outside for christmas. I would be putting them up in October or close to end of october but wouldn't be turning them on till Thanksgiving night or after. I would do put them up before it would get really cold outside. But I don't do it since I have a huge yard and last year decorations didn't turn out to good.

Ah i did 1 on my parents a few years ago. I had to wait until after 12am until they went to bed so it wasn't actually April Fools Day but it still worked like a charm! Wait until they go to bed and turn the lights out and the go into your parents room and tell them you don't feel so good and then just fall on the ground! They will think you have collapsed or fainted or something and freak out! When I did it my dad jumped straight out of bed and started shouting at my mum to turn the light on. When she did I just said "April Fools" and my dad was like "what?!" . I don't think he really understood what was happening for a few seconds! Aw I felt really bad after it though but it was still funny. My friend did it on her mum too. She walked into the kitchen and fell on the ground and her mum just told her to get up! Thats a caring mum for you!

Missing prayers question? ?



I went to school and the prayer room was locked (the teacher in charge went home). So i had to stay in school until iftaar.



And i missed three prayers duhr asr and mughrab, would i be punished? i managed to pray them all in one go and that made me about half an hour late for iftaar.

Allah will never punish you for things that you were not able to do.
I see you are a sister, then you cannot just pray anywhere.

if you can find a closed room,  or a room for girls only and ask another sister not to let boys in, maybe you can pray there next time

Allah does not hold us to account for things that we can't control.

You can plan for another time, though.  Could you get permission to pray in the library, or someone's office?  Could you ask for a key for the prayer room?

Here in the compound where I live, the door to the ladies' section of the masjid is often locked at prayer times.  My husband asked, and the imam let him make copies of the key, so I can let myself in if the imam forgets.

Even if I don't go to pray in the masjid, my husband checks every time he prays there to make sure other sisters can get in, so getting the key has helped other people, too.

Depends. Could you have avoided staying in school? Just for this one day? Would it have hugely affected you?

God is a loving God who wants the best possible life for you.  He wants you to return His love with all your heart.  Give Him space in your prayer time so you can receive from Him.

I was thinking about the thought that thought and thinking are mental forms and processes, respectively ("thought" is both.) Thinking allows beings to model the world and to deal with it effectively according to their objectives, plans, ends and desires. Words referring to similar concepts and processes include cognition, sentience, consciousness, idea, and imagination. Thinking involves the cerebral manipulation of information, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reason and make decisions. Thinking is a higher cognitive function and the analysis of thinking processes is part of cognitive psychologyThe basic mechanics of the human brain cells reflect a process of pattern matching or rather recognition. In a "moment of reflection", new situations and new experiences are judged against recalled ones and judgements are made. In order to make these judgements, the intellect maintains present experience and sorts relevant past experience. It does this while keeping present and past experience distinct and separate. The intellect can mix, match, merge, sift, and sort concepts, perceptions, and experience. This process is called reasoning. Logic is the science of reasoning. The awareness of this process of reasoning is access consciousness.

It's still 3 months away ( 2 for me, I start my season at the end of November cause I love it so much [: ) and I'm already excited.
the day school starts, I'm like BRING ON CHRISTMAS!
best time of year. I'm always in a good mood then, and I listen to Christmas tunes randomly throughout the year cause it makes me feel better.
I need some ideas for presents, so I can start! for all my siblings...I have 4 brothers, a sister, 3 sisters-in-law, and a brother-in-law. I have 5 nieces too but they're too young to appreciate homemade things.. =/
I started with bookmarks for the girls and..hmm..I think that's the year I made coasters out of playing cards for the guys. wish I would've gotten pictures of that! last year I made candles out of funky martini glasses for the girls and peanut brittle for the guys..[:

I love decorating so much, it gets me even more in the spirit.
and I LOVE wrapping presents! I don't know why, but I do.

I also love talking to people and telling them about my traditions.



yay Christmas!
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

None of them.  If you have ever worked in Woolworths at Christmas (as I did when I was a student), you will very, very quickly tire of hearing Christmas songs on repeat, especially Noddy Flaming Holder.

In the 70's to 80's:
John Lennon: So this is Christmas.

David Bowie and Bing Crosby Little Drummer Boy.  I think Bing passed away a few months after doing that.

In the 80's - 90's 
Bruce Springsteen - Santa Claus is coming to town.



And now since it's not played EVERY 15 minutes on the radio: Band Aid's  - Do they know it's Christmas.

But for modern. Brian Setzer.  Jingle All the Way.

No, you have the choice to do whatever you want.  Marriage is a ceremony for people to profess their love to one another in front of family and friends, and to promise to give one's whole life to that other person.  That is what marriage is supposed to be, and if you aren't in the position to make a commitment like that, than no, don't get married.

I think you can't live alone.
I think you will be lonely and die lonely.
I think marriage is an important sunnah if not obligatory.
I think marriage is half deen.
I think spending your life with a righteous servant of God is better than living alone.
I think having children and being a muslim mother gives you a chance to raise the next generation of little saliheen, who will follow the footsteps of Muhammad(saw) his companions, the tabi'oun and the salaf. A chance to contribute to the muslim ummah and leave behind righteous children who will pray for you when you die.

it depends a lot on peoples beliefs. for some people it goes against their religious beliefs or family values to 'live in sin.' i believe it is up to each individual person to whether they want to make that commitment or whether they are secure enough without making that step.
 and if one chooses to live their life alone that is also their own choice and nothing to do with anyone else

If you read the Quran in detail, you will learn it is Sunnah for both men and women to get married so they don't have a fear of falling into sin, zinna, etc. Surah Baqarah refers to husband and wife as a "protective cover." I'm not sure exactly which ayah this is in at the moment, but we studies this in my Quran class. Because your husband is protecting you from sin ei, sex outside of marriage. Also, it is a Sunnah to get married and there is extra reward in following the ways of the Prophet (SAW). We also learned that having kids is a Sadqah Jariyah. Whatever good deeds you teach your kids, they'll keep doing them even after you've passed on. That doesn't mean you HAVE to get married tomorrow! lol. But it is a likable act in Islam.

"Wedlock [nikah] is my tradition in religion; whoever does not apply my law has no part with me. Marry, because I will vie the nations in number by you. Whoever has the ability to marry, let him marry, and whoever has not the ability, let him resort to fasting; for fasting is as good as castration." Ibn Maja, Nikah. Kanz al-`ummal, 21:194.

Well marriage is half the deen (Hadith) so this shows the importance of getting married in Islam and that it is really paramount so according to the hadith you cannot 'choose' not to marry, you must try and find a good muslim to mary:) but I do not think you can make the choice unless you have like a really bad mental health issue but even then you should try find someone who accepts you for as you are:). So yeah I do think to choose not to get married, it's emphasised on for a good reason!

"If one chooses not to marry or is unable to get married”



Islam is a flexible religion but has its boundaries; its flexibility allows one to adopt it as a way of life and implement its teachings into every situation; whereas its boundaries restrict man from becoming too engrossed into certain acts and therefore becoming extreme in following their desires. Flexibility and boundaries set by Islam have created a perfect balance for man to achieve good both in this world and the hereafter, it is a balance that allows man to be successful in both the worlds.

Marriage also has boundaries and flexibilities; it is a matter which has been regarded as half of one’s Imaan (religion). Marriage is taken seriously in Islam as it allows people to live in a clean and moral society where desires are fulfilled in a human and shameful manner. It is an act that increases the number of believers and will cause our beloved Prophet صلي الله عليه و سلم to be proud by having the largest number of believers.

The Prophet of Allah صلي الله عليه و سلم has clearly forbidden people from celibacy:



“There is no celibacy in Islam”

[Sahih al-Bukhari]

However, in life it is not always possible to adopt the Sunnah act of marriage. There come in life situations that restrict that do not allow one to get married.

Therefore, it is necessary to mention the ruling of marriage; is it Mustahab (desired/recommended), Sunnah (way of the Prophet صلي الله عليه و سلم, therefore encouraged), Wajib/Fardh (obligatory).

Similarly, there will be times when marriage will be ruled as Makrooh (disliked) or Haraam (forbidden).

At this time we will deal with those rulings that concern that person who chooses not to marry or does not have the means to.

According to Imams Abu Hanifah marriage is Sunnah and recommendatory. It is an act of worship and one should strive in fulfilling this act. However, if one is in a position where he cannot control his desires then it is Wajib (necessary) for such a person to get married as he will not be able to save himself from sinning.

However, a person is excused from marrying, so much so that he should refrain from it, if he does not possess the means of supporting his wife or the capability of fulfilling her rights.

The question remains for that person who wishes to marry but does not possess the means, what should he do? Hadhrat ‘Abdullah رضي الله عنه narrates that:



“We were with the Prophet صلي الله عليه و سلم while we were young and had no wealth whatsoever. So Allah’s Apostle صلي الله عليه و سلم said, “O young people! Whoever amongst you can marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty, and whoever is not able to marry, should fast, as fasting is a shield for him (from desires).”



[Sahih al-Bukhari]



In this Hadeeth it is clearly mentioned that one who cannot marry should fast as the fasting will act as a shield for him from his desires. However, whilst doing this one should make an effort to resolve the matters that are stopping him from marrying.

As a final note, it should be remembered that not being financially able and being in a position to provide for one’s wife means the basic essentials that are necessary. Having an elegant and extravagant wedding and inviting people is not part of ‘essentials’ and is in actual fact totally discouraged and forbidden in Islam. However, in today’s society we see people going to the extent of taking out loans to organise a ‘wedding to remember.

wow thats great. you specifically asked for evidence and people still responded at least 1 out of every 2 with their own "i think"

hadith tells us that marriage is half of our religion, and also that imitation of the kufar is improper..and that can fall into 2 different things , imitating the western women in their masculine career woman attitude (NOT saying you are) and thinking that they dont need any man to survive, and even going as far as harvesting their eggs and having them artificially inseminated with donor sperm to have kids, and never getting married... and then also thinking that maybe its nearer to piety to devote youre life to islamic causes , thus copying the monk/priest type style, but once again that is still disliked in islam, we're here to marry to procreate and to raise more muslims and teach them the sirat al mustaqeem. that isnt my opinion, thats just islam.

Make them a family cookbook, with all of your family's favorite recipes. You can do this online  I started one for my son, who wants it for his future wife (whom he hasn't yet met).  :)



allrecipes.com 
Hardcover $34.99 or Softcover $24.99 When I didn't finish in a timely manner, the company sent me an offer at a reduced price-
$0.35/page for any additional pages.



That would be a great gift for couples! If you do this, inscribe it to them, & put brief family comments/memories on each page.  i.e.-"Joey loves this!"  or  "This was Aunt Ellen's recipe!"  They'll treasure it.



Click on Make-A-Cookbook on the left side of the page, toward the bottom.

If you like to cook, make that one special dish that only you make best!  Buy a new casserole dish to put it in for them to keep. Enclose the recipe in a Christmas card.  I make homemade strawberry jam in small jars for my loved ones.



If you have photos of your sisters, and his, that they may not have, make copies.  Childhood pictures would be great!  Put them in a new photo album.  When my mother passsed away 5 years ago in October, I made a copy of her engagement picture, framed it, & gave it to her sister for Christmas.  My mother looked so young and beautiful!



Get them an inexpensive, pretty basket.  Put a box of microwave popcorn, a gift certificate for movie rentals for the DVD in it. Toss in their favorite king-size candy bars, their favorite soft drinks, & maybe a copy of It's A Wondeful Life. http://www.amazon.com/Its-Wonderful-Life...

Since my husband and I are now retired I've put everyone (5 children with significant others and 5 grandchildren) on notice that we've on a fixed income and limiting each person to a $50 gift and to do the same with us. This isn't the extent of my gift giving, I have family in the UK and will be buying very lightweight gifts so that I'm not spending a fortune on postage. If the young couples are living together you can buy many things on sale for the kitchen or home throughout the year at greatly reduced prices at sales.

I buy presents that match the couple's needs. A couple of Christ masses ago when there was more money I bought a mate and his wife a nice stereo he was drooling over. And spent quite a load on others. Last Christmas was a bit less. As with many others, this year won't be completely skint, but I have to be careful.



My solution, buy only at knock off prices, and don't buy anything out of the price range I can afford and still buy for everyone.



About what to buy, I ask the people directly for hints of what they would like or really need. Failing that, vouchers.

Why does christmas cause so many family heart brakes?



Everyone seems to be talking about xmas but this year I am dreading it. What should be a happy family time is nothing but heart ache for my husband, we have been together five years. He split up with his ex 7 years ago and has two kids with her. She is more than happy to take his money, ring and turn up when there is a problem but he has never been able to see the kids over christmas as she always makes a big issue out of her family day. It seems that our part of it is to just deliver presents the week before so he doesn't see them being opened.
Last year we insisted on having them for a week in the new year and gave them the presents then, which seemed to cause more problems.
She remarried 2 years ago and it seems to me that she would prefer to have just her family and my husband to stay away. He is not a bad person in fact the split was due to her affair with another man.
Maybe I should book a weeks holiday somewhere this year for us both to get away but I know that my husband will still get hurt over the kids.



</question>



<additional details>



The kids are 11 & 13 but  go along with what the mum wants as she tends to be very controlling, hopefully in a few years they will feel that they can make up their own minds and spent some time with us.

Has anyone asked the children what they would like to do, I wonder. I'm not saying they should be put on the spot or made to choose between mum or dad or anything like that, but if they split up seven years ago then presumably the kids must be at least seven, and that is old enough for them to have an opinion and be given a right to voice it.

Maybe you should look into getting custody or at least get something done so he can see his kids. Your husband will be hurt for the rest of his life if he doesnt see them, a holiday wont make a difference

I think that christmas causes problems because everyone almost demands that it is perfect with perfect family and friends, perfect food and every "has" to be happy..........in a Perfect world that would be great, but we live in the real world.  I would suggest that you don't put demands on the holiday but enjoy it for what it is.  It is a difficult time for many people and it is because of the expectation and demand put on it........I always love it as I don't put pressure on myself to make it "perfect" so, when the bad things happen, which they invariably can, it won't seem as bad as things aren't Hyped up and pressured.

I hope you can both enjoy the season for everything it has to offer and just try to enjoy the sights, smells, sounds and colours with out putting the pressure on that seems to go with it.

Happy Christmas....

If he didn't make accommodations for seeing his children during holidays in the divorce agreement then I don't know what to say.  If he did and she just doesn't pay attention to the agreement then he should take it to court.

Another thing that he can do is not celebrate Christmas until the January 6th, the Epiphany and make arrangements to have them then.  It's celebrated in many places in the world that day so why not?  The kids will get 2 Christmases and your husband and you will have the kids on your special Christmas.

It's an obilgation upon all Muslim women and girls who have reached puberty to wear hijab and Abaya. It's probably your devil telling you not to wear it.  Don't listen to him.  Remember that we don't know when we are going to die. We could die today, tomorrow, in a week, or a year from now.  Using the execuse "I'm not ready" isn't going to cut it when you face ALLAH(Subhanna wa ta'ala).  Don't worry about what the Kaafur and Muslims in name only tell you.  Ignore them and wear hijab because you are doing so for ALLAH(Subhanna wa ta'ala) and because you realize it's an obligation to do so. You should also cover your face, and hands as well since as Muslim women, we should strive to be like the mothers of the believers(wives of Muhammad Salla Allahu Alahi Wa Salaam).  Remember Bukhari is the most authentic Hadith.  Read the following Suras for hijab:
Sura 24:60
Sura 33:55
Sura 24:31
Sura 33:59
Bukhari Haidths
Walaykumsalaam.

If you want to wear a Hijab because of your faith then go for it.  That is part of your right as an individual.  However wanting to cover up because of the way men look at you is slightly worrying.  They look at you because of the way you look and they like the way you look.  There is nothing wrong with that, and it is simply a part of life.



Please bare in mind that although the vast majority of people in this country won't say anything, you may find that you get more looks through wearing a Hijab.

If you want to wear it only because boys look at you then forget about it, Wearing hijab is a tough decision, but removing it is much worse, you have to really think well before going ahead.
Islam is not only hijab, do you pray on time , do you get up for your fajr salat?
do you fast? do you do your zakat, I think you should care for those first and then , you will feel the urge to wear hijab, you will want it so bad,



there is nothing worse than removing hijab, so think it over real well.

That was way before our time when racism was at its highest point. Today, we don't see it that much, although we can still see its remnants and effects in the society.



One example is our SAT test. You can still see the column "Race/Ethnicity." Although a lot of people say that column is not important, they use that column to see how smart each race is, and compare it.

No it's not ok.  There's always fitnah when you have non mahram men and non mahram women intermingling and interacting with each other outside of blood relations.  It's haraam for men to have female friends and women to have male friends.  You may start out being friends, but you'll develop feelings for each other and want something else down the line, even if you don't think you will.  It's haraam for men and women to interact with or mingle with each other outside of blood relationships.  They should always be seperated from each other.

No it isn't halal. In Prom, you get boys and girls mixing in UnIslamic ways with loud music, dancing and whatnot. Also, the clothes that are worn there are not very modest. I never went to my prom, I just stayed at home watching Chucklevision.



Why don't you stay at home and watch Monsters Inc. instead? There's a lil itty bit Monster porno in there but you can skip those bits. Hehe.

I guess not.



It's like walking into a bar with the intention of just being with friends & NOT drinking.



If she goes to a prom and doesn't dance her friends will try to make her dance. So there are chances she might succumb to peer pressure.



It's also better not to go cos u won't be that person who came to the prom and was the only one who did not dance.

no one here is a scholar, but theyve labeled plenty of us as extreme just for following islam as its supposed to be followed. that said, i am apparently one of those extremists.. so NO. . .islam is not according to "i think", we have to follow what quran and hadith tells is ok or not, and islamically, no you definately can't go to any sort of function like that where mixing between girls and boys, not to mention unmarried, is encouraged, music is playing (also haram) , and that is the main purpose of the event. it doesnt matter if you "dont appear" to do anything "unlawful" to the other kids there.. do you care what Allah thinks or do you care what the other little kids think? do you really want to go to just stand there modestly dressed and look at what the rest of them are doing? i really dont get it..and i hope your parents have more sense than to let you go to something like that

I came accross a hadith which can be summerised as



that one sahabi was sitting in masjid nabwi ,in deep thoughts that he didnt notice ,the other sahabi and ignored his salam ,
but when he is asked that why he didnt respond to his salam(greetings )



He said i was in deep thought of some fiqh issue and was sad that now prophet(SAW) is died,so how i will find solution for that ,as there is no more devine guidance.



it shows sahaba has a believe that there is no more devine  guidance

Naturally, it would have been a blow to anyone to see their most beloved person who acted as a leader and more than a father to the Muslims die. They were in doubt in who was going to lead them afterwards.



If we love the Prophet (pbuh), then they loved him more than us. We didn't even get to meet the Prophet (pbuh) but yet we love him more than we can ever imagine. Then, it must be true for the Companions as well, except that they had more.



The Prophet (pbuh) was dear to the Companions more than he is to us. They lived with him. Losing him is like losing your best friend, your own father, your own leader...



Such greatness was in our beloved Prophet....

Quran is not a story book. Such stories are not found in Quran.
Quran main focus is on Sharea, knowledge and wisdom.



Quran accepted all previous prophets of God. If you think Samson was a prophet then he is included in 124,000 prophets!

We do have some problems in the family could it be that that he is sad? I was upset about this dream and i missed him more because the look on the face he had stuck in my head.
Jazak'Allah gair for your kind answers.

May be he is not happy on something/decision/action being recently done by you or any of your family member.
You may know better what is that.

wa salaam. there is no doubt that the dead do not hear us (confirmed in hadith) and that they have no idea of what is going on in the world once they are in the grave. usually when people think theyve seen some sort of "ghost" when theyre awake or a person coming to them in their dreams, its definately more likely that theyve been thinking about that person lately, so when youre sleeping and your brain is still working, naturally the person is still lingering. ive had a similar dream about a friend who died, i saw her literally floating above me something like what you would see in a christian movie about an angel coming to someone, lots of light, and she looked so beautiful, but you cant let it get to you. your mind wants you to be at ease about the loss of the person, and thats about as far as it goes.

Maybee you misinterpreted what you saw. A sad man? A Healthy man. The question is WHY Sad, you state he was healthy but it seems it didnt really matter wether he was healthy. The sad was more prominent. I think you already know the answer but you are denying yourself that knowing. I think he was sad because you are.? Maybee.? Maybe since his death your deeply sad about him not being there anymore and you miss him etc. Maybee he was saying I Am That I Am, meaning he is what you are, now make the decision are you happy hes well or sad hes not with you.? Only you can answer your own dreams as the symbology is aimed at you and can only be interpreted by you. People always know the meaning of their dreams but they look outside for a rationalization of it, as if it should be solidified in order to be real and understandable, you know the answer.? I can tell

An Arab and a Paki Genie !!?



An Arab had spent many days crossing the desert without finding a source of water.He crawled through the sands, certain  when suddenly, he saw a shiny object sticking out of the sand several yards ahead of him.He crawled to the object, pulled it out of the sand, and discovered that he had a Manischewitz wine bottle. It appeared that there may be a drop or two left in the bottle, so he unscrewed the top, and out popped a genie.



"Vell kid," said the Paki  genie, "you know how it voiks. Ya got 3 vishe!!
"Okay, I wish I were in a lush oasis, with plentiful food and drink."



** * * * * * * P O O F * * * * * * * * *



The Arab found himself in the most beautiful oasis he had ever seen and he was surrounded with jugs of wine and platters of delicacies.



"Okee-dokee kiddo, vat's your second vish?"



"My second wish is that I were rich beyond my wildest dreams."



** * * * * * P O O F * * * * * * * * *



The Arab found himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with rare old coins and precious gem !!



"Okay kid, you got just vone more vish. Better should make it a good vone!"



After thinking for a few minutes, the Arab says, "I wish that no matter where I go, beautiful women will always need and want me!"



** * * * * * * * P O O F * * * * * *



He was turned into a tampon.
THE MORAL OF THE STORY:



If you're an Arab doing business with a Paki  genie, there's going to be a string attached.

Why are the most Hypocrites people of all time ?



besides the catholic church ofcourse!



why our women wear hijab then go to music concerts or strip on cam?
why our men put beard then listen to rap music and go to strip clubs?
why our imams are Hypocrites ?
if u wear hijab or have a beard then this is an indication that means u have enough faith to not do those little small sins(rap music etc) otherwise dont wear hijab or have a beard ...



look at this comedian what he said about his trip to Dubai and what he thinks of muslims..
dont say its only in Dubai he talks about muslims in generally.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3OhBlIvt...



this is really sad
every nation is laughing at us now
the whole world is laughin at us
what a joke are we !!!



</question>



<additional details>



and oh I forgot to say
those damn saudi women who take off their hijab outside and wear it inside saudi . those are really low !!



im saudi Arabian btw



Hope
dont be short-sighted ok .



wearing hijab then go dancing may not have its own fatwa but it shows that u cant fight against ur desires then itd be more sense if u take it offf then go partying all day along .
and please watch the video !!!!!11

Look ok, in Saudi Arabia it is the law for a woman to wear the hijab. So they all wear it whether they want to or not, so why blame some for taking it off when going abroad?



Also, I don't know any hijabis who go to music concerts or strip on cam. Ask Britney Spears or 50 cent how many hijabis go to their concerts. Most likely none.



Anyway, what's wrong with listening to rap music every once in a while? Just because one dresses like a Muslim, people expect them to be perfect and give them a hard time if they are caught enjoying a Stevie Wonder record every once in a while. People should give them a break.



EDIT:



I saw the video Lol. It was funny because its true but I think all Muslims should follow the rules, not just hijabis or men with beards.

Dear bro,



This happens when we believe in Allah & his prophet but this belief has passed nothing but our tounge, Eman bro has to enter our heart. today our parents give us Muslim names but 4get to put the seeds of Eman in our heart due to this reason we have weak eman &this make us  weak practising Muslims.



Rasulullah (S) did Dawah in Makkah 4 13 years to his people just to put the seed of Eman, Once this took a strong hold then Allah sent down his laws in Madina.
Today we need to work hard on building this Eman once again we are at point zero & this is what we should expect from others.
I pray 2 Allah to make us strong Eman Muslim.

I hear what you saying, it's quite sad....As most of us look up to those people.
But, one thing i learned,is EVERYTHING ISN'T WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE.
So i don't expect anybody to prove anything to me anymore, just because that person wears hijad, is an imam, or goes to hajj very year.They no less a sinner than me or someone who doesn't do all of those things, we all err.
So i'll do  my duty and remind the believers, that's as much as i can do.And i'll just try my best to practice what im doing.In other word you can't change people...just continue what you have to do.

<answer>



I'll just copy and paste from my previous answer:



I've been asked this question a million times. This verse in the Quran makes it clear that there have been verses that were abrogated or caused to be forgotten and are replaced with something better or similar to it. Verse 2:106 in the Quran explains:



ماننسخ من اية او ننسها نات بخير منها او مثلها الم تعلم ان الله على كل شئ قدير



"We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?"



So the answer is, the Quran is complete. It was Allah's will that there be verses which were caused to be "abrogated" OR "forgotten" and replaced with something better OR similar. So verses were not abrogated, rather substituted.

Ramadan Section : Is Quran Incomplete ?



Because omar and Aisha said that its incomplete ?



A missing verse on stoning?



Umar's saying that the current Qur'an is incomplete:



Has one-third of the Qur'an been lost?



In Sahih al Bukhari Volume 8, pages 209-210, we read this sermon delivered by Hadhrath Umar during his last Hajj as Khalifa:



Hadhrath Ayesha also testified to a 'missing' verse on stoning



"When the verses "Rajm" [Stoning] and ayah "Rezah Kabir" descended, they were written on a piece of paper and kept under my pillow. Following the demise of Prophet Muhammad (S) a goat ate the piece of paper while we were mourning.

If it is incomplete so Why your saying that its complete ?



</question>



<additional details>



And what the goat was doing inside Aisha's Room ?



Al-Muttaqi 'Ali bin Husam al-Din in his book "Mukhtasar Kanz al-'Ummal" printed on the margin of Imam Ahmad's Musnad, Volume 2, page 2, in his hadith about chapter 33, said that Ibn Mardawayh reported that Hudhayfah said:



'Umar said to me 'How many verses are contained in the chapter of al-Ahzab?' I said, '72 or 73 verses.' He said it was almost as long as the chapter of the Cow, which contains 287 verses, and in it there was the verse of stoning.



Suyuti narrates from Hadhrath Ayesha:



"During the life of the Prophet (s), Surah Ahzab was read with 200 verses, when Uthman collected the verses we only found that amount that is found in the current Qur'an".

I've been asked this question a million times. This verse in the Quran makes it clear that there have been verses that were abrogated or caused to be forgotten and are replaced with something better or similar to it. Verse 2:106 in the Quran explains:



ماننسخ من اية او ننسها نات بخير منها او مثلها الم تعلم ان الله على كل شئ قدير



"We do not abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten except that We bring forth [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah is over all things competent?"



So the answer is, the Quran is complete. It was Allah's will that there be verses which were caused to be "abrogated" OR "forgotten" and replaced with something better OR similar. So verses were not abrogated, rather substituted.



- This is from the Quran, you should know that verses have been abrogated (or caused to be forgotten) and substituted.



Asker:



Go get a Quran and look up the verse, and see the translation.



Asker:



They are not lying, I just gave you an answer. What's the matter? Stuck?



Asker:



Why the hell does it matter? Your question is why are there missing verses. Stop fooling around, you sound stupid!

Allah says in Quran the following statements:



"This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion". (Soorah Al-Maa'idah 5:3)



Allah would not have given death to Prophet Mohammad being His last Prophet and Messenger  before completing the Quran, if it was not yet complete.



You Christians keep coming with new objections on Quran because of the crookedness of your hearts. Such people are never looking for guidance of Allah but following the desires of Satan.



Mother of Momineen Hazrat Aesha and Omar bin Khattab Ameerul Momineen could never  have said what you are saying.  They both understaood Quran better  than all Christians combined  could ever understand the contents of Quran or statements of Prophet Mohammad or of his companions..



Allah deliberately did not reveal the command in Quran about



stoning to death to the married men and women for the sin of having sex with other than their spouses because Allah wanted to let Jews and Christians know and understand that Torah was also revealed by the same God who has revealed Quran and that Quran is continuation of previous revelations in Torah to Prophet Moses also being His past Messenger and Prophet of the same God.  Since both religions are from  Allah and Prophet Mohammad was supposed to follow the law in Torah becaus  Allah decided not to change the law for Muslims.



This is why a Muslim can't call himself Muslim unless he believes in all previous Prophets and all previous books sent by Allah God almighty and the Day of Judgment after the resurrection of all humans ever born and died on earth. This is the basic Must belief of all Muslims.



If Allah wanted to ammend the law in Torah, then  Allah would have revealed the ammended  or new law  to Prophet Mohammad SAW at the time when a married  woman came for the purification of her soul after comitting the sin of adultery with another man. .  Either Prophet Mohammad understood or Angel Gabriel told him that God is not giving you new law and you have to enforce the law in Torah for punishing the woman  Prophet Mohammad waited over two aned a half years for the revelation from God in this matter by telling the woman that she must deliver the baby she was carrying, and then told her again that she has to breast feed the baby for two years. He was hoping  for new law which God never sent.



After she died from stoning  Prophet Mohammad SAW said that this woman repented by offering her life for her sin.  Her this action is so great that she will enter in heaven because her soul got purified from all sins of her life.



May Allah guide us all to the right path of Allah.

Islamic Dream Interpreter out there....?



I don't know if i had this dream because i was thinking about something similar to it or if it was from my subconscious mind...? I'm not sure but here it goes...



Last night I had a dream that i was sitting in front of the Beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW)'s grave (it did not look like the actual grave site in Medinah but i knew in my dream that i was sitting before his grave). And i was sitting next to this man who i don't recall knowing. And we are holding either plain water or Zamzam to give to the Prophet (SAW). It was something along those lines.



it was very short but i was wondering if anyone knows what any part of that dream means?

The goat eating verse story had to be created by Christians and jews



being the enemies of Islam.



Quran was not saved only by writing the verses but all Muslims of the time were preserving every revelation of Quran in their memories and in their hearts.



Non-Muslims can make all the stories they want, but it won't hurt Islam one tiny bit. Clear hearted Christians seeking true guidance from God  will keep reverting to Islam and Islam haters will continue burning in jealousy until the end of this world and will finally  end up in hell fire on the Day of Judgment.

Its a time for family and friends. Everyone dresses up in new clothes and lots of jewellery. Then we have a big family dinner with all our extended family. Then the older members of the family give eid money to the younger members- so I get loads of my parents, uncles and aunties. Then I go to my best friends house and am usually forced to eat again! Then in the evening my other friends visit and I forcefeed them! We also go for a cruise in the car (usually hire a nice car). On 2nd day of eid the dinner is at my uncles house. You dress up again and normally go to cinema in evening. Not so different from Christmas really. Hope this helps.

An Arab had spent many days crossing the desert without finding a source of water.He crawled through the sands, certain  when suddenly, he saw a shiny object sticking out of the sand several yards ahead of him.He crawled to the object, pulled it out of the sand, and discovered that he had a Manischewitz wine bottle. It appeared that there may be a drop or two left in the bottle, so he unscrewed the top, and out popped a genie.



"Vell kid," said the Paki  genie, "you know how it voiks. Ya got 3 vishe!!
"Okay, I wish I were in a lush oasis, with plentiful food and drink."



** * * * * * * P O O F * * * * * * * * *



The Arab found himself in the most beautiful oasis he had ever seen and he was surrounded with jugs of wine and platters of delicacies.



"Okee-dokee kiddo, vat's your second vish?"



"My second wish is that I were rich beyond my wildest dreams."



** * * * * * P O O F * * * * * * * * *



The Arab found himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with rare old coins and precious gem !!



"Okay kid, you got just vone more vish. Better should make it a good vone!"



After thinking for a few minutes, the Arab says, "I wish that no matter where I go, beautiful women will always need and want me!"



** * * * * * * * P O O F * * * * * *



He was turned into a tampon.
THE MORAL OF THE STORY:



If you're an Arab doing business with a Paki  genie, there's going to be a string attached.

The Prophet(saw) wiped this companions forehead as he carried heavy rocks and said 'Alas Ibn ___ will be killed by the tyrant group"? Who was he?



Once This companion was getting a get a twig for the Prophet(saw) the Companions laughed when they saw his tiny skinny legs, he was thin and frail and the Prophet(saw) said you laugh at Ibn____ legs they are in the sight of Allaah heavier in scale than the mountain of Uhud?  Who was he?

</question from>



<question>



Sunnis, could you please read this about Shia'sm so that we will be as one?



1.You say we think Imams are higher than prophets:



Wrong. Prophets are higher than Imams, but due to their perfectness and innocence, both prophets and Imams are much higher than angles while they're only humans. Humans who cannot make a mistake because they are immune from making mistakes and are given this immunity from God so that they're reliable source to interpret vague points of Islam to us which are debatable.



2.You say we believe Imams have magical powers or do miracles?



Wrong. Except for prophets no other human can perform a miracle.



3.You say we say prayers 2 times a day:



Wrong: We say 17 Rak'ats which is 5 times a day.



4.You say we curse the wives of prophet Mohammad, Abu Bakr, Omar etc:



Actually I had never heard anyone curse any of them except for Yazid who killed Imam Hussein and massacred Muslims. Many of us don't even know that they should be cursed. That's what I heard in Ramadan section from you.



5.You say we don't like Sunnis:



Wrong: We believe than Islam is one and we should all be united. If you see Shi'a get angry and say something, it's because there are a few haters here who insult Shi'a faith and attribute lies to this faith. Otherwise, we should all respect each other, because we are all Muslims.



6.You say Shi'a and Sunni are very different:



Wrong: They're the same and the minor differences are because in every religion there are always different opinions about some things which can be debated. Usually both parties will bring evidence to prove their word, but in the end the truth is that they all follow one religion and worship one thing. Like a lot of sects in Christianity.



7.What you call innovations in religion, actually are rooted from strong faith. I know a lot of Sunnis who don't agree with some teachings of Sunnism and I know a lot of Shi'a who don't agree with some parts of Shi'sm. It's very difficult to disprove any of these things. They might be true after all and they might not be.



After all these, the fact remains that we should both respect each other the way God wants us. We should not fall into division. (I believe many of these are rooted from evil politics and misinformation that the two "group" have about each other.



Now, do you agree that we're all one and we should be as one and support each other? Because every time we disrespect each other, we cause a lot of people to avoid Islam. I now know that we should not do this after I saw this Iranian T.V show in Ramadan. It changed my whole opinion. I now think differently than before.



If you support our brotherhood star this question.



</question>



<additional details>



tupac: I say it's not even discussed and I haven't heard about it. If there was such a thing, I would have heard for sure. Just remember that, the son of Noah (Kan'an who refused to accept God) and the sons of prophet Yaghoob (Father of Joseph) who were all cursed by God. I don't curse anybody even Yazid, but I just want to say that being the relatives of a prophet or his friend, does not make you a good person.

you won't get an answer..
they believe that their Imams are more superior than prophets and angels...and has higher powers!
so what are their Imams?



as for what you said here s from their books..



“There’s nothing (impure) in the urine of the infallibles: their blood, urine and feces (are free of) any filth or dirtiness…nor there is any stink in their urine or feces, rather both are like the Musk. Nay, (in fact) whoever drinks and eat their urine, feces and blood, Allah forbids fire on him, and cause him to enter paradise…the urine and feces of the Imams doesn’t carry impurities or stench, but they are like musk, and whoever drank their urine and feces and their blood, Allah will make Hell fire Haram on them and their admission to Heaven becomes must.” (Anwaar al-Wilayah, p.440)



Abu Jafar said: “For the Imam there are 10 signs: He is born pure and circumcized….and if he farts the smell is of musk.” (Al-Kafi 1/319 Book of Hujja - Chapter on Birth of Imam)

Anwar Waliyah?  Are you kidding me?  Ahahahaha it doesn't say that.  Whatta loserrrr.



And thats haram to say, not only because its a stupid lie, but because the Prophets (saw) are the highest.  Our imams are their followers.



Now seriously, instead of being a reeeeeeally bad liar, go read a book or something.  'Cause the shia-hate site your going on is obviously not working.

I'm really in love with my boyfriend, i'm happy and feel like exploding just by hearing his voice.. and he loves me too...



the problem is that he was a friend of my sisters and when we met she catagorically told us to stay away from eachtoher... I fell in love and i couldn't help it.. they wer just friends, but he was her only friend away from home where she lives and maybe said it because she was afraid of losing him... but he is not talking to her anymore because she was rude to him and shouted it at him... none I have to do with...



now my parents are totally pissed off and angry at me and I still haven't told them we are together... and everytimw i bring him up to try to tell they they start shouting at me that i'm selfish and i ruined my sister's life... (don't go thinking she was in love with him because she has a fiance and they are marrying next year)



What should i do? i'm really happy with him, I haven't been so happy in years and never felt that nothing is missing when i'm with a person it's the first time...



how should i go about it? my parents are really pissed off at me and say i'm selfish but i can't see what' s wrong I took nothing from noone.

It is better to do immidaitely, since you haven't got any 1% to be alive next day, let alone next month..



And above that, the fast of 6 days in shawwaal is like he fasted for his whole life.... But fard has to be done before sunnah fast..

It can be done in any manner (not on Eid) as long as it is done before next Ramadan.
It is recommended that he hasten to make up that which he has missed during Ramadan so as to relieve himself of the responsibility. Likewise, it is recommended that he makes up for that which he missed by fasting consecutively because doing so is like having fasted as such during Ramadan.

It is better to make them up right away because you have trained yourself during Ramadan, plus shawwal is a holy month so you will be able to do the 6 day shawwal as well to rip the rewards before this month is finished.

I agree with sis Sarah.



It is best to make up the fasts immediately as possible, and then do the 6 fasts of shawwaal.  Due to make up fasts being obligatory, and 6 fasts of shawwaal not being obligatory, it is proper to do that which is obligatory first.



But it CAN be done throughout the next months, or consecutively, or any other ways.  Most scholars agree that it must be made up before the next Ramadan.

The age of innocence in a child is usually attributed to a child who is below the age of puberty (this can vary from between 9-12 years old). In Islam once a child has reached/attained the age of puberty, then he/she is already considered an adult.



Yes, generally children below the age of puberty (depending on his/her family background and/or education) will display various traits of innocence and display elements of truthfulness in their behaviour and responses. Therefore adults should display prudent behaviour in front of their children who have not reached the age of puberty.

No because we are not of the people from the old books. We are Muslims we have 99 Names for Allaah to call him upon according to the Qur'aan and the Sunnah. And since we muslims believe that the Qur'aan is a compilation of the Previous Books we follow the Qur'aan alone.

"Say: "Call upon Allah, or call upon Rahman: by whatever name ye call upon Him, (it is well): for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names." (17:110)



I don't think it should be sinful, since it's is really our intentions that matter. If we curse Him and call upon Him rudely, it is a sin. We are supposed to Praise Him. But if we call upon Him with either Asmaa-ul-Husna or our own name, as long as it's respectful and describes Him, it is fine.



Hope this answered your question. =)
--------------------------------------...
Sorry I'm hallucinating again, completely misread your question.
YHWH translates to 'He causes to be', I think, so if that's the case then it's fine, because Allah causes to be. It is simply a name that says what Allah does.
--------------------------------------...
Well then, as long as it translates to something that can be attributed to Allah, it's okay. Since the Jews believe in the same God, I doubt they'll have a derogatory name for Him.
--------------------------------------...
Is it? Then what you said answers your question. If YHWH is His holiest name, then I believe it's absolutely fine. =)
Like mentioned in the verse above,
"Say: "Call upon Allah, or call upon Rahman: by whatever name ye call upon Him, (it is well): for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names." (17:110)
it doesn't matter what we call Him, as long as 'it is well'.

First of All Allah SWT cannot be defaced harmed or interupeted.
Secondly Allah SWT made Islam muslims are not Islam they only follow such religion the best they can.
The best of them was Muhammed SAW, Abrahim A.s., Musa A.s., Isa A.s. and many others, they never did such things and never would they have asked for any such things done unto thee in any situation or caliaber.
Salam Alaikum



That was not Islam and nothing anyone can do can hurt Allah SWT, Islam or Muhammed SAW or the Quran Al Karim Al hamdoullah Rub Alemeen there is only One God and his name he called himself is Allah. Nothing can touch the absolute one everything will return to him.

All I know is those terrorists are all Sunni Muslims. I'm not saying all Sunnis are terrorists, many are peace-loving, but those people you mention are extremists.



Like al Qaeda, Taliban and extremists from Saudi Arabia who blow up innocent people. Suicide is a sin, but killing the innocent is unjustifiable. They do it because they only have the Quran and not any other sources to get their info from, so when they see some verses talk about "killing" they immediately think Islam says they should kill. That's why we need Imams and to see their life style to be peaceful.

Answer hidden due to its low rating



I think those terrorists were following the example of their Prophet Muhammed;



Here is historical evidence about Muhammed and the extermination of the Qurayza Jews.



Tabari VIII:29 "The Holy Prophet (peace be unto him) said, 'No one should pray the afternoon prayer until they are in the territory of the Qurayza because warfare against the Jews is incumbent upon Muslims.'"



Ishaq:461 "The Muslims had been totally occupied with warlike preparations. They refused to pray until they had come upon the Jews in accordance with Muhammad's order. Allah did not find fault with them (the muslims) in His Book, nor did the Messenger reprimand them for it (missing prayer)."



Ishaq:461/Tabari VIII:29 "Muhammad besieged them for twenty-five nights. When the siege became too severe, Allah terrorized them. Then they were told to submit to the judgment of Allah's Messenger."



Ishaq:461 "After the siege exhausted and terrorized them, the Jews felt certain that the Apostle would not leave them until he had exterminated them. So they decided to talk to Ka'b Asad. He said, 'People of the Jews, you see what has befallen you. I shall propose three alternatives. Take whichever one you please.' He said, 'Swear allegiance to this man and accept him; for, by Allah, it has become clear to you that he is a prophet sent from Allah. It is he that you used to find mentioned in your scripture book. Then you will be secure in your lives, your property, your children, and your wives.'"



Tabari VIII:35/Ishaq:464 "The Jews were made to come down, and Allah's Messenger imprisoned them. Then the Prophet went out into the marketplace of Medina (it is still its marketplace today), and he had trenches dug in it. He sent for the Jewish men and had them beheaded in those trenches. They were brought out to him in batches. They numbered 800 to 900 boys and men."



Tabari VIII:40 "The Messenger of God commanded that furrows should be dug in the ground for the Qurayza. Then he sat down. Ali and Zubayr began cutting off their heads in his presence."



Ishaq:465 "Then the Apostle divided the property, wives, and children of the Qurayza among the Muslims. Allah's Messenger took his fifth of the booty. He made known on that day the extra shares for horses and their riders - giving the horse two shares and the rider one. A Muslim without a horse got one share of the spoil. It was the first booty in which lots were cast."

Question For Muslims About The Kaaba and Idol Worship?



</question>



<additional details>



OK...First off...I am not here to insult Islam...So don't get offended by my question. All I want to do is just to clear my misonceptions. I have 3 questions:



1. What is inside the kaaba?



2. Islam is a religion that has shunned idol worshipping completely. My understanding is that idol worshipping is disrespectful to God because all matter has been created by God hence it is illogical to use matter for the purposes of worship.



Why then do Muslims face the kaaba for their prayers? I was told that that kaaba is not an object of worship but only constitutes a direction intended to unify Muslims so that they are all facing the same direction when praying. Why is the kaaba, then, referred to as "the lords house"? Clearly if the lord is formless, eternal and omnipotent how can he have a house? Also, if matter is not to be regarded as sacred, then what is the purpose of kissing and walking around the kaaba?



3. Finally, idol worship is also regarded as blashphemy because muslims regard it sinful to depict God in human/manlike images. However, at the same time Muslims refer to God as "Merciful, benevelolent and all-compassionate". Clearly these are nothing more than human emotions and characteristics......



Please only muslims answer. Thanks

1, there is nothing in Kaba as such, only few old glasses, and few utensils are there.
http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3163/2894...



2-you are right, it is to unify Muslims in order to pray in the right direction. Allah doesn't need any house, but we call it Allah's house because that is the center of unifying Muslims in their prayers.We mere human beings need it in order to be united.thus Allah has enabled us to have kaba. Therefore, muslims from all around the world, prays towards Kaba. ( 4 directions)



3- True that those are the emotions for the human being and Allah is free from such emotions BUT these words are been used to convince us to understand the attributes of Allah. We need them in order to understand how we should move about praying to Allah as He is the only forgiving and indeed merciful~!

LOL, good question looks like ur thinking,



1. nothing, prior to islam it held idols after mohammed (pbuh) entered mecca he and mola ali destroyed all the idols in the kabba



2.U've partly answered this urself, it was ordered on prophet abraham to build a house for god.



The kabba is like u said for all muslim to offer salat in one direction in complete unitiy otherwise they would be offering salat(prayers) in different direction ( so hence they are unified in direction of prayer) .



They kiss it to show their love for their prophet who has given thrm this religion.



You have to walk around it how else can u complete going around it.



3. Idol worship places another god beside god that is not allowed at all



our 1st kalma there is no other god but god .



Now for u to understand the merciful bit u have to have more understandingin islam , God is merciful and compassionate to all humans otherwise for any small crime he can easily punish us so he showing his mercy on us.



Sorry cant explain in any more detail

1 Nothing.



2 You where told correctly its a focal point for all muslims. We all face east and the Kaaba is the centre of the earth. Its referred to as the Lords house not because we think he resides there if that's what your implying. Who said the lord is formless? God tells us we will never come close to imagining what he looks like, our minds can never comprehend so don't even try. So who therefore would state He is formless? Emotion is why people kiss it, nothing else. Its not a requirement of Pilgrimage to kiss the Kaaba. Why do Catholics kiss the Popes hand or the foot of a statue of Jesus (pbuh)? Because we are humans with emotions and kissing is an expression of emotions.



As for walking around the Kaaba this is a requirement of Pilgrimage. It is done as a ritual called Tawaf and its seven times, we circumnavigate it anti clockwise. This is because Allah revealed this action for us to perform.



Ascribe nothing in worship with me, and sanctify MY HOUSE for those who circumnavigate it.



(All Hajj 22-26.27)



God tells us its his house and has told us to circle it. We as muslims are submitters to the will of God so why would we not call it GODS HOUSE and not circumnavigate it?



3.God tells us over and over He is "merciful, benevolent, all compassionate and most forgiving" its not emotions or characteristics we put on God this is what he tell us he is. Why would the creator of all in the Heavens and earth who if you believe made us and gave us emotions not posses them himself? Idol worship is worshiping another other than God, we muslims dont do that. We dont have images or statues of God we do not Idol worship, We dont pray or give thanks to some clay figure.



You say nothing more than human emotions that is not what God says, but your opinion.

1) There is nothing inside the Kaaba



2) The Kaaba is our Kiblah, oour direction to pray. In fact, the reason why we have this is to STOP idol worship we all have one direction, which means no superiority, unity and no rich men over poor men. See some people might say, I know, I am rich so I will pray to my gold statue becuase it is beuttiful whilst i pray. Kaaba promotes fairness equality between brothers and unity, we all pray the same direction no matter the colour, race, creed, culture....



Circumbulating the Kabaa is the ritual of the Hajj ( I don't know why I can find out though) and Kissing, I think people do this becuase it is the site where many Prophets and greats of Islam have been.



3)The 99 names of Allah are not just merciful, it is Most Merciful or Most Forgiving and that is comething which as humans we can never call ourself, i cant call myself most something then that would be blasphemy. Allah's names to me are a source of Hope, if he is Most-Merciful then I don't have to despair, even the most forgiving human has forgivness that isn't even comparable to that of Allah's. Allah names himself these things in the Quran, and he is always Most.

<answer>



First: Take this out of your head that Muslim worship Kaaba. There is NO such thing at all.



It is just a FOCAL point for TWO specific religious duties i.e. Daily prayers and the pilgrimage.



Just as you already have mentioned that the daily prayers with a focal point. The focal point is Kaaba. So u have in a way answered your question.



Lord's house:
God does NOT need a house. He has no human or creature needs. Why God appointed Kaaba as a focal point ? you will need to go back in history a little bit.



Ibrahim (Abraham) was a beloved servant / prophet of God. He stood up for Monotheism very firmly and he argued in favor of God. Thus God blessed him heavily. And GOD also Tested him thoroughly. He passed ALL his tests in flying colors and did not waver at all. Abraham ran into a problem between his two wives i.e. Hajra (Hager) and Sirai (Sarah).



Ultimately Abraham had to settle one wife (Hager) away from Sarah. At that point, God pointed out to him, the place where she and her child had to be settled. This was far away from Iraq, deep into the desert of Arabia, at the place of Kaaba. When Abraham settled them there, he prayed to God. There was NOTHING there. Not even a single plant, no water, no food. Abraham prayed to God there. And God took care of Hager and her son. Then God ordered Abraham to build a house of worship there as per his instructions (Kaaba). Abraham built it and again prayed that God may rush ALL the good things to this place. God promised that and thus we see that since Abraham 4500 years, the Kaaba continues a continuous flow of Muslims for pilgrimage (Hajj) and mini pilgrimage (Umrah). God blessed that land.



Thus God appointed it a sanctuary and a focal point to the billions of people who believe in him.



What is inside Kaaba:
There is hardly anything inside it. May be three or four wooden columns and a few other things.



It is also important to note that in the days of prophet Mohammad, God tested the believers in Mohammad, from a change in the focal point. Instead of facing the Kaaba, they were ordered to face Jerusalem for some time. That was to filter off those who would leave Mohammad out of Ego and not obey God's command.



Therefore, even for God, it is JUST a building and nothing more. However God has blessed the place in the sense that He has rushed every good thing to it. And God blesses people who visit it, by granting them their prayers and wishes.



--------
Kissing walking:
First there is NO religious rite of Kissing the black stone. There is no such requirement. This is something of a fabricated tradition and is being followed by many (not all) Muslims. It has no value.



Secondly: Walking:  This is what was prescribed since the days of Abraham and is followed the same way. During the walking and circumvation, the pilgrim Glorifies God and at the same time he may pray for ANYTHING he wants. God is simply glad to see the respect that the pilgrim gives to His "COMMAND" and "APPOINTED RITES".



God does not account for the physical movement. The real reward is for the OBEDIENCE to what He has decreed.



-----



The forms of feelings and qualities we have are a GRANT from God. Had he not made you kind hearted, you would have been a cruel person. Even the most kind hearted person cannot claim that it is his quality. "NO", it is a gift to him from God. All the goodness that we have is from God. And God himself is the MOST Merciful and Compassionate.



This worldly life and the Earth is a neutral zone for our test. There is an agreement between God and Satan. Because Satan claimed that he will take ALL of us away from the obedience of God. Under this agreement, God will not unviel himself to the people. And people will have to recognize him ONLY through the observation of signs etc.



Thus we see, that planet Earth contains everything to support life. It has stabilizers that balance out all that we do i.e. we produce CO2 and that gets consumed by plants. The water resource on Earth itself is a sign. The 24 hour rotation is sign. Earth has it and the nearest planetary satellite (Moon) does not have it. Earth has everything and Moon does not have those. The tilt of the axis of Earth and the revolution around sun, that gives it four seasons. This in itself is Unique to Earth. The Earth is just the right size and even the sun is JUST the right size. Had the sun been a little bigger, its spectrum would have been useless for plant life.



The punishing of evil and the rewarding of good, is also a manifest sign. You see the great empires of the past, where are they. As they turned evil, God wiped them out, even whent there seemed to be no possibility. The USSR is gone. Same will be the fate of USA and anyone who treads the path of evil.



These are ALL mercy of God. If he removes just any blessing from us, we cry on our knees, yet He provides us even if we do not knowingly thank Him. This is Compassion and Grace of God towards His creatures.

1) There is absolutely nothing in Kaaba.. When Muhammad came to Makkah he and the Muslims threw every single idol from the Kaaba and broke them.



2) Yesh, the kabha is only to unify Muslims in order to pray in the right direction. How would it be if u went to a mosque and u saw people in different directions, and this would lead to disunity as they wouldnt e praying together. The reason why Muslims say it is the House of Allah is because it is the center of unifying Muslims in their prayers.



Muslims also refer to every mosque as the House of Allah. in UK, India, America, whereever it is.



By the way, people circle the kabah becuase it shows the oneness of allah. Also, Abraham was told to do it aswell as Muhammad by Allah through the Angel Gabriel



3) Allah is free from such emotions BUT these words are been used to make us understand the attributes of Allah. When sum1 says he is most high, and most compassionate, it refers to something above any man or creation of God, it shows how High Allah is. Therefore,in order to understand how great and powerful God is, this is why God gave these attributes to himself.

<question>



Muslims...Do We Use Logic Before Faith or Faith and No Logic?



Before you even accept a friend in your life, do you not SIZE him/her up?  Yes, right?  But, are muslims sizing up Muhammad & allah before they even accept them?



For example to accept a person as a doctor, you must first check his/her credentials, and then see if the prescribed medication really works.  Right?



IN muhammad’s case, we must first check his prophethood status.  Is he really a prophet after the ancient prophets?  If yes, why must we reject the ancient texts as corrupted in order to accept Muhammad as a prophet?  If that is the case, is he still a prophet AFTER the ancient prophets???  Obviously not.  Can you say you are your father’s son but first categorically state that your father is not your real father but is corrupted BUT still you are the REAL son???



IN allah’s case, did allah really perform those things that it said it did?  How do we check if allah is really a god?  A god must be omnipotent, all powerful, trustworthy, reliable, truthful and never lies.  If a god does not have these attributes, then that god = demon.  Only demons can accept lies and are limited in their powers.  If really allah is really the same god that saved the people in the Exodus, why then did that God say ‘"Say this to the Israelites: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My Name forever; this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.”.  Obviously, allah is NOT the same as the God in the exodus.  So, who the hell really is allah???



Clearly then, Muhammad is NOT a prophet and Allah is NOT a god.

From what I can tell, someone can report you because he/she didn't agree with what you said, and then YA issues a violation report.  Then you appeal it, and they'll claim they investigated and the violation stands.  Frankly, I don't think they read anything but the initial report.

<question>



How can we convert MuhammadLustProphet to Islam?



Why don't these people convert easily like they started to do 1400 yrs ago?



So many christians and jews converted in them days, they just saw how true Islam was...they weren't even shown science in the Quran, becos the Kaffir Marice B was not alive to write that book then and sell it to make money from the Arabs(and not convert to islam himself)



What proofs were given to them christians, pagans that so many converted no questions asked?



</question>



<additional details>



ISLAM HATERS please do not start with wars that muslims had during Muhammad and after him to enforce this religion, becos there must be some true stuff in Islam that so many easily converted to islam, and only few convert to islam today...and others go back to other religions. These wars were holy battles, totally Halal. Even captives were given rights to live as slaves or freed if they converted etc.



albert a ...role models? do you remember what happened after the Death of our Prophet how Islam split in to pieces and muslims started to do each other...and these were the earliest 'Role models'.....and please don't say



'look at all them battles we had to convert people in masses, which are written in islamic books'



or you'll sound like a kaffir.



Esar...lol...i'm not good at converting...can I use my sword? the sunna of the Prophet?



Rumaitha....are you saying it's not easy to convert people? then how did 100% convert to Islam in them days? Can I use a sword if it will convince?
And please do advise how I may improve further! :)



Fajr .... thanx for your answer... but WHY still won't these todays christians, jews, pagans, atheists BELIEVE! let's be honest almost 100% of them christians, jews, pagans, arabs converted to Islam in Muhammads country...and then neighbouring countries....but now they just don't see the Miracle of the Quran??? and please do not say Abu bakr, Omar, sent out missionaries to other lands to convert others to Islam and had fights, which is true, but don't say it,or you will sound like a kaffir...trying to make us think Islam WAS spread by the sword. There must be some proof that we can show these non-muslims for an instant conversion overnight...I hope your proof works, many have tried before but these kaffir won't move from their beliefs.

I really wonder why any of us should answer his questions in the first place !!.



To answer your Q Omar , what proof was given to them to become Muslims ? I'll tell you . The proof is trust and logic  . The beauty and the truth in  the Quran can NEVER be from a human being . We even don't need prophets and messengers to tell us that a supreme being has created us , as you know we didn't create ourselves , the universe is soooo beautiful  and very well organized that there must be God created it and is taking care of it .  A supreme being who is above the law of physics .



Edit



Not all people can see the truth , that's why the messengers were always rejected , mocked at and sometimes killed .



There are many reasons why many Christians and Jews



will not and will never convert , some  of the reasons are their religious leaders and following the herd  but those who recognized the truth in their hearts and minds and then reject it  will be punished in the hereafter .

I dont think you can unless you personally meet him.
Do it this way:



Invite him to your place in a very nice and pleasent way. Tell him he's gonna have a very educational and 'nice' time!



Once he get there, make sure the doors are chained and locked. Electricity should be completely cut and telephone lines should be cut. Take him to a room filled with candles and Qurans in each corner of the room.
Now take out your sword and tell him "Now you say the Shahad loudly or off goes your head".
It always worked for me! And I got a lot of hasanat for it!



Ofcourse, if he still refuses, chop his head off! In that case, its a victory as we have got rid of a Kafir and evil!

Do i have to doa a lot to get a husband? i think i have no luck in finding a partner?



i'm already 27 and up to now there is not a single guy who is even attracted to me? - now people are are beginning to talk.. especially my other relatives. about me being on the shelves. even my younger cousins are married and have kids .. some friends thought that i might even be gay..



now i'm beginning to think that its "written" for me to stay single
i am not very religious (trying - but no ones perfect), but i dont smoke, dont drink, a virgin, wear hijab, very homely,  i do have a good job and educated. in terms of looks.. i think average and am trying to lose a lot of weight.



i'm not promoting myself. but then there are some others who the opposite of me but still they have alot of men chasing after them..



do i have to pray and solat alot to actually find a partner.. ??? but at times i just leave it to god whether or not i find someone..



what is wrong with me??



</question>



<additional details>



usually by 27 .. there should be at least a few men who would express their interest or something like that..



but really there's none at all..



Esra: For some reason, i am very shy / embarassed to attend any islamic gathering or sorts cause i know there will be lots of mothers, aunts hunting for potential daughter/son -in-laws.



i went to a similiar event once when i was younger  with a group of girl friends (they love attending these kind of events and all of them are married lol) . it scared the hell out of me when the older ladies were interested and asking who i was since they never seen me before..

These things are in the hands of God, He gives when He chooses and withhold if it is in our best interests.  There is nothing wrong with you.  You just have to find a man who loves you for who you are as a person and not for your outer shell.  Those men can be found at the mosque praying to God or at work places, earning for their families.  Inshallah, your life partner will come, just have some sabr.

yes, pray to Allah as much as you can and remember one thing. We do not know what may be good for us. What we may think is good for us may actually be bad for us and vice versa.



There are many people in this world who are unmarried and dies that way. but those who doesn't get a life partner here, they do get one in Jannah. This world is an examination hall... the other world is the real world.Therefore, never lose hope. Hold the rope of Allah tight. and try to be happy in any circumstances and be thankful to Allah always. for even whatever little you may have, be thankful to Allah.



this might sound difficult and tough but imagine about the fruits which are always sweet :) ~!



Allah Says : {… and it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allâh knows but you do not know.}[2:216].



Edit:
The Prophet used to supplicate with: "O The Living, O The Eternal One, I seek help in Your Grace. Set right all my affairs; give me not over to myself even for as little as a wink of an eye". [al-Nasaie and al-Bazzar as reported in Fath al-Bari]
The above-mentioned Dua' is strongly recommended for every Muslim, in all his/her affairs, since if one depends on Allah, He will be sufficient for him.

anyway .. prey that's the answer .. it may be written for you .. and the best choice and who know it may not .. you might find the right guy later on



nothing is wrong with you .. what can you do if they never came .. chase them?? that's not an option



you always can do these steps that could help:
1. go to islamic gathering to get to know the right people .. i'm not sure where you live but where i come from .. the sisters and mothers usually hunt girls down haha .. a respectfull and clever way though
2. go to the mosque and to other social events
3. prey and ask god for what you want



4. if you don't get married so what ..?! let the people say what they like .. they talk anyway



hope you the best future



EDIT: maybe you'll be afraid at first .. coz your so shy . then you might get used to them .. at least this could help .. and give extra time to your looks ;)

My dear sister salam for you. You must be optimistic for finding your partner in the future. A 27 years old lady is still young.Now there are many career women who got married more than 30 years old.
You must make a self evaluation or introspection why the young guys did not want to make friend with you. You are religious,do not smoke,do not drink,still maintain your virginity,wear hijab,very homely,have a good job and well educated are good condition of yours or positive aspect.But maybe you must lower your qualifications of your would be partner. You must be more intimate or familiar to the opposite sex.You must mingle with them in an organization or association or club. or islamic gathering..You must be simple and no conceit  and no shy.You must be talkative.
Allah will permit you to find your good partner if you obey to all of Allah's instructions and prohibitions including  mandatory praying on time and fasting..You must make a lot of sunnah praying at night after 3 or 4 AM and make a doa besides your hard effort to find him in the society.. A partner can not be chased but he should selected among your guy friends.
You must select one among guys who are interested to you.Someone who is not interested by your self(you hate him) maybe he is good for you as stated by Allah in the Qur'an.In every difficulty there is an easiness as stated in the surah Alam Nasrah in the Qur'an..Allah decided your partner in line with your effort.If you have no patner on this earth after you have done a hard effort,you will get the best one in heaven.Do not be despair because Allah hates desperation.
Insya Allah you will be succeed at last.

That is bad idea of yours to get humiliated being taken out of house with handcuffed behind your back. Do you want to be know as criminal in your neighborhood?  I don't think your parents nor husband (if you are married) will allow you to volunteer yourself for the practicals training of your freind.



Remember police officers are never friends of any one. If some one ever accuse you of some thing even if you are innocent, if this friend of yours is police woman, firs thing she will do is arrest you and handcuff you, then put you in her police car and then lock you up in police cells and then she will suggest you to call some one to get a lawyer for you as your legal right.  There will be no mercy for you being your friend.

Well since she's a student she isn't going to have access to a police car where she will come to your home and arrest you there.  More than likely you will arrive at the destination and from that point on the "arrest"  will take place.  As far as patting down, tell her your beliefs about men and women touching each other and ask her to limit it.  It's for a good cause that will help many disabled children and adults who suffering from this horrible disease.  Hope your either prepared to take money or have someone come to "bail you out".



I think it's great that you want to help a worthy charity.

What does it have to do with Palestine?!? It is right on the helm of Israel.



Try researching the Gaza Strip.  Understand that the Jews and the Palestinians (Arabs) have been fighting over this land since biblical times.  At present, the Palestinians are being driven out from the land and made to live in huts further and further away from Israeli citizens.  Their olive branches demolished to construct more living space for the Israelis.  In the conflict, fights have arisen between the Israeli soldiers and the Arabs.  So this is why the muslims (arabs) have a hate for the Jews.



Zionist are Jews that believe in making their home in Israel.  They are driven to provide education of the "homeland" and work dilligently to create change for Jews in Israel and abroad.  They are perceived to be militant and use a "by all means necessary" approach.  I do not agree with their methods, however, they believe that they are the "entitled" dwellers of this holy land.



You might be suprised because Jews and Arabs are very easy to confuse in Israel.  A lot of Jewish woman wear head coverings as well as muslim women.  The men, who aren't Orthodox, can be mistaken as well for muslim.  The conflict is that some fighting is erupting between people that have a common path in life.  It would be like killing a cousin.  They have occuppied this territory since biblical times and still cannot come to some sort of agreement. This land is Holy for others (not only Jews), yet Arabs feel alienated in their homeland.

<question>



Muslims...Do we use Logic before Faith or Faith and no Logic ?



Before you even accept a friend in your life, do you not SIZE him/her up? Yes, right? But, are muslims sizing up Muhammad & allah before they even accept them?



For example to accept a person as a doctor, you must first check his/her credentials, and then see if the prescribed medication really works. Right?



IN muhammad’s case, we must first check his prophethood status. Is he really a prophet after the ancient prophets? If yes, why must we reject the ancient texts as corrupted in order to accept Muhammad as a prophet? If that is the case, is he still a prophet AFTER the ancient prophets??? Obviously not. Can you say you are your father’s son but first categorically state that your father is not your real father but is corrupted BUT still you are the REAL son???



IN allah’s case, did allah really perform those things that it said it did? How do we check if allah is really a god? A god must be omnipotent, all powerful, trustworthy, reliable, truthful and never lies. If a god does not have these attributes, then that god = demon. Only demons can accept lies and are limited in their powers. If really allah is really the same god that saved the people in the Exodus, why then did that God say ‘"Say this to the Israelites: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My Name forever; this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.”. Obviously, allah is NOT the same as the God in the exodus. So, who the hell really is allah???



Clearly then, Muhammad is NOT a prophet and Allah is NOT a god.

And I'm really glad to have you in my life.
You the reminder to me next to Allah that things will be alright
You see the good in me even if I'm 99 percent bad

I already contributed to your poem.  Here:



With a dead father he came to earth,
A mother shrieked and knew he’s cursed
Thrown to Halima his adoption commenced
And men who joined him fought and rant
With fits and desires he knew not how
To satisfy his lusts and passions avow



So all alone in the cave he squat
Days on ends with flies and mud
In Hira cave he finally saw
A being so strange and made him fall
Recite recite, it forced him to
Verses claimed from god it spewed



A prophet made a meeting met
A devilish being man shall regret
For all he cursed, he killed and raped
Swearing, lying and all he takes



When final doom in poison he took
And allah can’t but all forsook
For man and devil they now must pay
A faith so vile as houris lay



Rotting now his company of maggots
Greatest prophet of men their rackets
Without end their strife resounds
Salvation lost and never found

How can we convert MuhammadLustProphet to Islam?



Why don't these people convert easily like they started to do 1400 yrs ago?



So many christians and jews converted in them days, they just saw how true Islam was...they weren't even shown science in the Quran, becos the Kaffir Marice B was not alive to write that book then and sell it to make money from the Arabs(and not convert to islam himself)



What proofs were given to them christians, pagans that so many converted no questions asked?



</question>



<additional details>



ISLAM HATERS please do not start with wars that muslims had during Muhammad and after him to enforce this religion, becos there must be some true stuff in Islam that so many easily converted to islam, and only few convert to islam today...and others go back to other religions. These wars were holy battles, totally Halal. Even captives were given rights to live as slaves or freed if they converted etc.



albert a ...role models? do you remember what happened after the Death of our Prophet how Islam split in to pieces and muslims started to do each other...and these were the earliest 'Role models'.....and please don't say



'look at all them battles we had to convert people in masses, which are written in islamic books'

Well, for your original question, he won't convert. He isn't even stable with his own religion and knows there are contradictions so he tries really hard to prove Islam wrong using the BIBLE (I know, weird logic) only to justify his. I've asked him many questions that he avoided and in the end just deletes his questions because he doesn't have an answer to my replies. I'm currently on this question:

In the U.S.....not sure if i've ever seen a 500 ml.



And prices will vary from store to store less than 2 minutes away from eachother...by foot.



I think the last 2 liter i saw was 2.29 and 1 liter was 1.29.



Sooo...if you wanna assume a base cost of 29 cents + $1 per liter.....thats 79 cents for 500 mL

Now thats a tradition in the west right. every boy and girl has an obligation to take a partner and go for the formal dance when they graduate from high school. Its a tradition mainly to teach/encourage young people to respect each other etc.

A question for you. Do you sincerely want to learn about Christianity when you paste so-called contradictions, errors, and others or try to make fun of it? Do you search the Bible yourself and research the answers first, or you just look into Anti-Christianity websites in the hope to just mock Christianity? Pls answer honestly!

<answer>



Personally, I don't look at anti-Christian websites; they are usually anti-Muslim too.



Do I sincerely want to learn about Christianity? Yes, I do; but that does not mean that I'm interested in becoming a Christian at all; do I want to use my information to mock Christianity? No, of course not; I too hate it when someone mocks Islam, but I like to keep the information handy just in case some missionary insisted on bugging me, or some anti-Muslim Christian showing me how "wrong" I am and how "right" he/she is. Do I research the answers? Yes, I need to know what the missionary is going to reply before he actually says it, it will help me prepare whatever evidence I need.



Some, of course act as Muslim missionaries too; others are just "strking" back at strikes made at Muslims.



I'm sure there are other people out there with other "missions" - not everyone that asks what seems to you like a "this type of question" does it with the same motive.

I have no idea but thats what happens when people stray from religion and follow their desires. They become obsessed with pride and nationalism. It's not even about shia vs sunni it goes deeper than that, when you adopt non islamic values and lust after this world you lose yourself but more importantly you lose your religion.None of them can base their ignorance and hate on religion in fact if they were both as religious as they claim they wouldnt be doing half the things they do. None of these islamic countries would be in the position they are in right now. They've lost true islam long ago.

Thank you. You're so open-minded I'm so proud of it, but please understand that not all Sunnis are open-minded. Many of them are Arabs and most Iranians are Shi'a. Arabs naturally hate Iranians. That's all. Sunnis else-where like American Sunnis, British, Malaysia and Indonesia love Iranians. We Iranians usually don't care about what Arabs think. I love Sunnis in all other non-Arab countries. Egyptians are exception to this rule. I totally love Egyptians. Also people from Turkey are cool. It's all a matter of Arab , Ajam. Sunnis, Shi'a doesn't exist. Besides, there is nothing wrong with loving Imams. If you don't believe in Imams, fine, but you can't say Shi'a are wrong for loving Imams. We Shi'a love them. Do you think loving is wrong? I don't think so. We don't have sects in Islam.

sister, i also would like to share with you that i heard a brother tell me he heard from a scholar that you should not call yourself a ninja, as a niqaab is considered a sunnah and the word ninja can be used as a joke, and the sunnah is not something to joke with or relate word with which can be considered a joke, as if one does, they come out of the folds of islam. Allahuallim, get it checked out insha'Allah. May Allah forgive me if i have said something wrong,Ameen

A good number of people here are Salafi/Wahhabis (not "wallahi"). And they always hide the fact that they are Salafi/Wahhabis, and compliment themselves. So you can't get a fair and unbiased view from Y/A Ramadan section.



I suggest "Dispatches - Undercover Musque" on YouTube.



In short, they are an extremist group with extremist interpretations of Islam. Many terrorists have turned out to be Wahhabi/Salafis.



I know I don't need to answer, I am just too generous with my knowledge.



[Edit]



Muhyi Al Din -



The asker did not ask about the meaning of the words, rather the groups who identify themselves as such. Taliban (in Afghanistan) are not "Students" (Taliban means Students), they are terrorists.



May I ask? Are you Wahhabi or Salafi? I bet you are.



[Edit 2]



For example "Jump" is a Wahhabi/Salafi. I knew they'd lie about their belief.



Here's Wahhabism/Salafism:

The phrase ‘As-Salaf as-Saalih’ (The Righteous Predecessors) is synonymous with Ahl us-Sunnah. Salafi applies to one who truly attaches himself to the Salaf



Other terms called to Ahl us-Sunnah are :-  ‘Ahl ul-Athar’ (The People of Narration) ,‘Ahl ul-Hadeeth (The People of Hadeeth) ,At-Taaifatul Mansoorah(The Aided Group), Al-Firqat un-Naajiyyah ( The Saved Sect) , Al-Jamaa’ah ,'Ahl ul-Ittibaa” (The People of Adherence and Imitation).

I have no idea but thats what happens when people stray from religion and follow their desires. They become obsessed with pride and nationalism. It's not even about shia vs sunni it goes deeper than that, when you adopt non islamic values and lust after this world you lose yourself but more importantly you lose your religion.None of them can base their ignorance and hate on religion in fact if they were both as religious as they claim they wouldnt be doing half the things they do. None of these islamic countries would be in the position they are in right now. They've lost true islam long ago.

Thank you. You're so open-minded I'm so proud of it, but please understand that not all Sunnis are open-minded. Many of them are Arabs and most Iranians are Shi'a. Arabs naturally hate Iranians. That's all. Sunnis else-where like American Sunnis, British, Malaysia and Indonesia love Iranians. We Iranians usually don't care about what Arabs think. I love Sunnis in all other non-Arab countries. Egyptians are exception to this rule. I totally love Egyptians. Also people from Turkey are cool. It's all a matter of Arab , Ajam. Sunni or Shi'a doesn't exist. We don't have sects in islam. Besides, there is nothing wrong with loving Imams. If you don't believe in Imams, fine, but you can't say Shi'a are wrong for loving Imams. We Shi'a love them. Do you think loving is wrong? I don't think so. We don't have sects in Islam.



Bronco face: I've heard numerous times Arabs have said it into my face that they hate us all because we're not Arab. Even once one of them was telling me he hated us because we fought Saddam Hussein~!!! It's not good. This is about racism or supporting people like Saddam.It's got nothing to do with  Shi'a Sunni. Also most Sunni Shi'a issue is political rather than religious. Most conflict among Sunni Shi'a is also American plot to make Islam weaker and weaker.

What is the difference between sunni and shia muslims?



Please help me, with answers of true sincerity.  I am a new muslim & reading the Quran and practising prayer.  Sometimes I go to the net to ask for advice/explanations i.e eid prayers etc, and have been told that the advice I have been given is incorrect because it is either sunni or shia.  Please can you advise with sincerity.  I have no muslim friends as yet.  I am a single mom who is trying to find her way to Islam with her son.  I am  trying to find my way myself.  But I donot understand this issue.  We are all muslims under Allah, so where does it differ and which is correct for me to follow?

I cant help you with the difference but I can recommend maybe google muslims chat rooms or something you might get better answers that way. Or find a place or worship for muslims (not sure if there is such a thing I am sorry I dont know much on the religion.) I do want to say stay strong not every one knows the difference between a terrorist and a muslim. and I want to say sorry for the nasty things people may say. I would look up the two online but I dont know if I would find the right source. Sorry again.

the differnce is that,the sunni is the different cast of muslims ,as you know that we(sunni)  have to offer prayer 5 times a day ,and have to bend our head only towards Allah, while on the other hand shia  offer the pray 2 times a day(mughraiban & zuhrain)and they bent(workship) towards a stone instead of Allah. they have different "kalima" .
so a a mulim i prefer you to follow sunni,and  is totally concerned to Quran(you can check out).

There r many differences in Muslim (sunnis ) & shias



Almost each and every thing is different



But the main cause which brought all the differences is shias self made concept of IMAMAT .



As muslims Believe there is no prophetafter  Prophet Mohammad  (Saw)



Sahaba companion of prophet (saw) was so upset when prophet (saw) died ,bcoz they knew that there is no more devine guidance .



And non of the sahaba even Ali (Ra) claimed that they received  guidance.



And Sahaba use to solve the issues raised after prophet Mohammad (Saw),in the light of quran and prophets saying



But when islam spread from east to west in first two caliphs reign



The enemy of islam were scared , and jealous .and tried to destroy islam by injecting their own concepts which were oposite than Islam



So they introduced the concept of Imamat ,(in other word prophet)



according to this concept imam has all the powers ,and he is superior to all the prophets (so its higher than prophet but called Imam instead of prophet ,to make it digestable for muslims)



Now the Real Problem started



Shias gave their imam the higher status than prophets



and believed in his devinity



and they took guidance from them instead quran 7 hadith



as they had written communication with him



And 12th imam went in Ocultation but his four agents had comunication with him



Now these four agent of imam were bringing the commands from imam,Who were those four agents ,what was their status (i dont know)
so this is how story went on and on



and shias and muslims were getting apart more and more till the day

There is no difference. We Shi'a believe that there are 12 Imams after prophet Mohammad and Sunnis believe in Khalife. Also, Shi'a believe Mahdi (the saviour) the the 12th Imam and is among us only he doesn't introduce himself to us. Sunnis believe Mahdi will be born later.



Other than that, some Sunnis say photography, drawing pictures, music, singing, birthday parties, etc are haram, but we Shi'a say they are all halal. See? No basic difference. Now you can choose which one you prefer.



Interestingly enough, we all know that religion is about faith. See which group suits you and fit yourself in one of them.



EDIT: Asker, omer and all Sunnis are telling you lies. They're haters. Don't believe them. All Muslims say prayers towards Mecca and we all say prayers 5 times. He says 2 times?!! Omer stop telling lies. You see asker? Sunnis will tell lies and Shi'a always respect them. You can choose if you want to be a liar or like us respect and say the truth.

Why do Sunnis have to tell lies just to drive people away from Shi'a?



Here's what a Sunni has said:



"the differnce is that,the sunni is the different cast of muslims ,as you know that we(sunni) have to offer prayer 5 times a day ,and have to bend our head only towards Allah, while on the other hand shia offer the pray 2 times a day(mughraiban & zuhrain)and they bent(workship) towards a stone instead of Allah. they have different "kalima" ."



What nonsense is this? we have prayers 5 times. What stone?!! It's Moher which is used to put forhead on a clean place.



Do you Sunnis know that lying is a sin? Or is it halal in Sunnism?

Thank you. You're so open-minded I'm so proud of it, but please understand that not all Sunnis are open-minded. Many of them are Arabs and most Iranians are Shi'a. Arabs naturally hate Iranians. That's all. Sunnis else-where like American Sunnis, British, Malaysia and Indonesia love Iranians. We Iranians usually don't care about what Arabs think. I love Sunnis in all other non-Arab countries. Egyptians are exception to this rule. I totally love Egyptians. Also people from Turkey are cool. It's all a matter of Arab , Ajam. Sunni or Shi'a doesn't exist. We don't have sects in islam. Besides, there is nothing wrong with loving Imams. If you don't believe in Imams, fine, but you can't say Shi'a are wrong for loving Imams. We Shi'a love them. Do you think loving is wrong? I don't think so. We don't have sects in Islam.



Bronco face: I've heard numerous times Arabs have said it into my face that they hate us all because we're not Arab. Even once one of them was telling me he hated us because we fought Saddam Hussein~!!! It's not good. This is about racism or supporting people like Saddam.It's got nothing to do with  Shi'a Sunni. Also most Sunni Shi'a issue is political rather than religious. Most conflict among Sunni Shi'a is also American plot to make Islam weaker and weaker.

I don't know. I don't totally reject that the ouija board is true. I actually believe that you can  communicate with jinns using the ouija board. Of course, I don't believe you can talk with the dead as many would say, because of course Islam teaches us that once a person is dead, they're dead! Jinns though.. quite possibly.

<question>



Muslims in Ramadan...Do we use Logic before Faith or Faith without any Logic...?



Before you even accept a friend in your life, do you not SIZE him/her up? Yes, right? But, are muslims sizing up Muhammad & allah before they even accept them?



For example to accept a person as a doctor, you must first check his/her credentials, and then see if the prescribed medication really works. Right?



IN muhammad’s case, we must first check his prophethood status. Is he really a prophet after the ancient prophets? If yes, why must we reject the ancient texts as corrupted in order to accept Muhammad as a prophet? If that is the case, is he still a prophet AFTER the ancient prophets??? Obviously not. Can you say you are your father’s son but first categorically state that your father is not your real father but is corrupted BUT still you are the REAL son???



IN allah’s case, did allah really perform those things that it said it did? How do we check if allah is really a god? A god must be omnipotent, all powerful, trustworthy, reliable, truthful and never lies. If a god does not have these attributes, then that god = demon. Only demons can accept lies and are limited in their powers. If really allah is really the same god that saved the people in the Exodus, why then did that God say ‘"Say this to the Israelites: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My Name forever; this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.”. Obviously, allah is NOT the same as the God in the exodus. So, who the hell really is allah???



Clearly then, Muhammad is NOT a prophet and Allah is NOT a god.

John 10:30
"I and my father are one" (KJV)



There is no reason to take this verse to mean that Jesus was saying that he and the Father make up “one God.” The phrase was a common one, and even today if someone used it, people would know exactly what he meant—he and his father are very much alike.



John 10:30 shows conclusively that Jesus was referring to the fact that he had the same purpose as God did. Jesus was speaking about his ability to keep the “sheep,” the believers, who came to him. He said that no one could take them out of his hand and that no one could take them out of his Father’s hand. Then he said that he and the Father were “one,” i.e., had one purpose, which was to keep and protect the sheep.



Edit: Pig huh? Nice way to insult... I'm speaking in a good manner & here you are insulting away & you EXPECT Muslims to convert to Christianity, with that attitude of yours..

Every Muslim has an important thing before he accepts God & Prophet, i.e, IMANN-E-BIL-GAIB. Which states that he/she believes in GOD, His angels, His Books, His Prophets and The END DAY.
So there seems no question to ascertain the credentials of God & Prophet before accepting them.

You know why I accepted Islam, and believe that Allah is the only God and that Muhammad is His Messenger?



The Quran does not debunk previous prophets such as Ibrahim, Musa, Harun, Yahya, Isa and many more. Instead, the Quran honors them and says that these men are in fact the Messengers of Allah.



Whereas other religious texts have gone far to even accuse these Messengers of doing atrocious crimes that normal men do.



Yes, we use logic before we accepted Islam. And our logic tells that Islam somehow makes the most sense out of all.



Source(s):



and for your information, "God of Abraham", "God of your fathers" would relate to us Muslims, because we also believe in Abraham.



So stop being possesive and thinking that Abraham is only important to you.

salam sister,



you just pointed out to one of the last day's signs,



قال رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم:
ستاتى على أمتى سنوات خداعات يكذب فيها الصادق و يصدق فيها الكاذب ويؤتمن الخائن و يخون فيها الامين وينطق فيها الرويبضه.
قيل: وما الرويبضه؟
قال: الرجل التافه السفيه يتكلم فى أمر العامة.



narrated that the prophet Muhammad salla Allahu Alaihi wa Sallam said:
"there will be misleading years come across my Ummah where the truthful person will be accused of lying,  and believe the lair , and trust the betrayer, and the trustworthy will be accused of betrayal, and the Ruaibidah  speak, "what is Ruaibidah?" they asked, he (saw) said: the silly, foolish man who discusses the populace matters"

I SO  agree with you!
I am seen as the one who is not to make faults, it really gets me annoyed since I am human and time to time I fall into error too!
I guess they see that the practising should know better, yes we actually try to refrain from wrong than others BUT we have weaknesses too.

<answer>



You can find many believers who will say, "The reason why scientific experiments fail to detect God is because God must remain hidden. He does not answer prayers if he knows that he will be detected."



In order to see the truth, you need to accept that this explanation is silly. If God must remain hidden, then he cannot answer any prayers. Any "answered prayer" would expose God.



The whole notion that "God" must remain "hidden" is a total cross-threading of religious doctrine. On the one hand, believers will say that "God wrote the Bible, God incarnated himself and died on the cross for us, and God answers millions of prayers on earth every day." Then in the next breath they will say, "God must remain hidden." God obviously cannot "remain hidden" and "incarnate himself." These two items are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the explanation that "God must remain hidden" is impossible. As soon as you accept how impossible it is, you can begin to see see that God is imaginary.



In order to see the truth, you need to accept the fact that the scientific evidence is accurate and irrefutable. We have scientifically proven that God does not answer any prayers on earth. Every single "answered prayer" is nothing more than a coincidence.



We can see reality by looking at a simple example. Imagine that the rate of remission for some particularly nasty type of cancer is 5%. That means that if 20 people get this type of cancer, it is almost always fatal. Only one in twenty of the people who get the disease will survive. Knowing this, you can see what happens if we actually analyze prayer:



20 believers contract the disease



All of them have read James 5:15, so all of them pray.



19 of them die



The one who lives proclaims, "I prayed to the Lord and the Lord answered my prayers! My disease is cured! It is a miracle! I KNEW God would answer my prayers!"



You never hear about the 19 who died. No one ever writes about them in a magazine. "Person prays, then dies" is not a great headline. And since they are dead, you will never hear from any of these people.



Therefore, if you don't look at all the facts around the "answered prayer," and you only hear about the one out of twenty prayers that succeed, it appears that prayer is successful.



The fact is, believers who pray die from this disease at exactly the same rate as people who do not.



We can see the reality of this situation simply by opening our eyes and looking at the data. But we do have to open our eyes -- We have to look at both the successes AND the failures of prayer to see the reality of our world. When we take a scientific approach and we do look at both sides, we see what is really happening.

Scene Queen for Halloween?



ok i'm going to be scene for halloween.



i've had my hair cut scene for a year or so so i thought i might put it to some use. lol



Here's what i was thinking:
-Teased hair, bangs to the side +bow
-makeup-super bright colors, fake lashes



but i'm confused on the shirt part because i was going to wear my paramore tshirt that i got from hottopic. but Scene is about bright colors so i was thinking about wear my american eagle polo [really bright turquoise] with a white and yellow striped sweater underneath +white tank and jeans.
the reason for layers is b/c its mostly an outdoor party with a bon fire so it'll be cold



or should i wear my black and white paramore shirt with a frilly black skirt with black leggings.



thanks so much for answers!!!

Halloween parties in St. Louis for someone under 21?



Well, tomorrow is Halloween and I really want to do something fun, but I'm not 21 and I'm having a difficult time finding something to do that I can actually get into.  I really don't want to be stuck at a little carnival for 3 year olds with face painting, but I also don't want to be stuck at home watching horror flicks.  Any ideas?

Shoe advice for Pebbles (Flintstones) costume for 21yr old?!?



I'm being Pebbles for Halloween, my mom made my costume. It's a one-shoulder, shorter dress with pieces cut out along the bottom in a leopardy/tiger type print (orange and black).



I don't know what kind of SHOES to wear! Not sure if I should do sandles with straps up the ankle, black tall UGG boots or heels with a legwarmer over the top?

For comfort and ease I'd say the Ugg boots will look great. If you want to spice it up a bit more and you aren't worried about slipping on ice, then a pair of stilletto pumps with matching colored leg warmers would look hot.

Like they said, the Flintstones were all barefoot (as shoes had not yet been invented in those fantasy prehistoric times, LOL) but I think whatever you have that you are comfortable in will work as long as it matches the dress. The UGG boots would be cute, sort of rugged, like a neanderthal would be, or if you want it to be sexier go for the heels & legwarmers. It's YOUR costume, make it your own and HAVE FUN!
HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!

I guess tell her that you will be there for her and that you'll take her out afterward or something like that its always good to coax her into going very gently or she probably won't go so i guess if you haven't suggested it yet you could give her a flower or a bouquet of flowers and ask her to go with you and make sure to tell her you won't laugh at her or abandon her the entire time and you will be her knight in shining armor now and forever.

Well, if sh's afraid to go, just let her know that you will be there to hold her hand and support her when she is frightened. If she really doesn't want to go, take a buddy with you and pick up your girl afterward and spend time with her to show her that you are not upset that she didn't go with you.



Hope this helps and hope you have fun! I'm too far away to go to the good haunted houses. :(

Is she just adverse to entering a haunted house or dead set against it?



If she's dead set against it I'd say go with friends and leave her out.  In the end all you'll have accomplished is to tick her off that you "forced" her to go.  It's not worth it in the long run, and you'll have more fun without her there (with friends at least) than if you "make" her go.  Then again if she dragged you to the Sex and the City movie earlier this year (or similar event in the recent past or near future) she owes you if you haven't already cashed in on that.  ;)



If she's on the fence or able to be convinced head out to the bar first and have a few rounds (if you're of legal age).  Those things are always a little more trippy and fun with a little buzz going (ah-hem! being responsible adults in this case).  Plus a little jolt of adrenalin helps spice up and add a kick to other late night activities a bit when you get home!  ha-ha!

Tell them "no, kids, it's too much hassle" then send them elsewhere (park or something with someone/dad/granny?) or even just to their room.
Get the party prepared then when they come in, the look on their little faces with be priceless.
They'll love it, it will be a blast :)
Take lots of pictures to show them :D

i believe that the surprise would be a lot better because it's always fun to scare your kids from time to time because one day they will scare you so you might as well scare them while you can before it's too late.

Tell your kids that you have to do something like go to store, work, and then send them to go somewhere with their dad or granparents to shop for something or if they refuse to leave give them some money to pick up a candy bar at the store or a small toy at the store. And then you should do it yourself so it'll be a surprize. Because the best thing is to suprize the kids.

There once was a boy called Johny. His mother asked him to go and buy some liver for dinner, and gave him some money.



Walking through town, he passed the toyshop and saw a toy boat that he had always wanted. And he could afford it...so he bought it. But now there was the problem of the liver. He walked around for a while, pondering...when he saw a strange creature asleep by the river. So Johny went over to it, got a sharp rock and gutted the creature, and pulled out the liver and took it home.



Later that night, he was in his room when he heard a voice:
"Johnyyyy, i'm coming to get you"
Frightened, he started looking around him room.
"Johnyyyy, i'm on the stairs"
and sure enough, he could hear creeking
"MUM!" johny cried! "MUM!"
"Just a minute dear, i'm a bit tied up at the moment..."she called back. she didn't understand.
"Johnyyyyy...I'm in the hallway"
Frantically, he started searching for something to use as a weapon. But there was nothing. Then, he saw the window, behind him.
"Johnyyy...i'm coming in"
The door started to creak open. there was no time for safety mats, ropes or second thoughts, he leapt out of the window...
"Johnyyyy...i'm underneath you!"



darkness.



"Johnyyyy...you're in my tummy!!!"

Is she pretty?  If she is, then heck yeah get her dressed up as a sexy nurse.  That way you get to show off for all your friends and people will be envious of you.



But if she's not pretty, then no.  Nobody wants to see that.

You could try the subtle approach and suggest something else. For example, "Hm..the sexy nurse idea is okay, but maybe too many people will be doing that. How about...?" And see what happens.

Only if you're a psycho control freak and are insecure about the fact that other people might find her attractive.  And if that's the case, go get yourself a fat ugly cow of a girlfriend so that no one will look at her.



You're messing up.  You should let her so that later on she'll play doctor with you.

Fold it to make a wide triangle, then measure round your daughter's head and tie at the nape of her head.  The rest of the triangle will fall down behind and cover the knot.  She may not want to wear it for long so I wouldn't go to great trouble about it - 2 year olds, being two years olds.

Be a bible thumper. Suit, tie, slacks, nice shoes-if you don't have that, just throw on some nice pants, a collared shirt, and shoes that aren't sandals/sneakers. Carry around a bible and condemn everyone to 'hell' because they're celebrating an 'evil' holiday.



Very easy, you already have everything around the house, and people won't be sure whether to take you seriously or not. It's great to screw with people's heads.

I can't speak to whether it's against your religion, since not only am I not RC, I'm not even Christian, but...
I once went to a couple of Halloween events as Jesus Christ. Crown of thorns, carrying a huge cross made of 4X4's, two strips of cloth for a loincloth, and my JC sandals. Offended a ton of people at one event, made a lot of friends at the second, where there were people dressed as: RC Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, Nuns, Monks, Greek Orthodox Bishop...you get the idea.
If you have the costume, which for the Pope is quite elegant, go for it!
(Just don't offer communion or any sacraments!)

Halloween costume help please?



For halloween I want to dress up as a sort of punky/gothic tinkerbell. I wanted to wear a green dress thats tinkerbell style and then wings, some sort of tights and black eye make up and glitter. I am fifteen and 5ft2 or 3 and a size 4 (us 0) or age 11-12. I don't want anything to babyish. Does anyone have any ideas? I don't have much money to spend and need it by tomorrow, or even a cheap green velvet dress I could cut? Thanks.

Need help with my graveyard cake for tomorrow.. please helppp?



for work tomorrow i am making a graveyard cake but would like some more ideas to add to the flavor of the cake or the decoration of the cake.. so far i have the recipe for the actual cake which is JELLO instant pudding mixed with cool whip and cookie crumbs and then the top is covered with crumbled oreos to make "dirt" i am using icing to write on milano cookies which are being stuck in the dirt to make tombstones, those mini candy pumpkins are being sprinkled around and little blobs of cool whip with icing faces are the ghosts.. what else can i add? ( either flavors to the cake or decorations on top)



anything creative i can write on the cookie tombstones? i work in a liquor store so i was thinking of writing the names of discontinued wines on them



any ideas?

Crush up extr dirt to make little mounds in front of the tombstones. I love gummy worms in the dirt and your idea for discontinued wines on the tombstones.



For homemade ghosts i dipped large marshmallows in melted white chocolate and painted little faces on them, they taste really good.

Daughter wants to stay home for Halloween. What to do?



My ex and I have been divorced since '99. We have a 10 year old daughter together. She began varsity sports this year and getting more heavily involved with friends, etc. She has started voicing her own opinions of when she wants to see her father and when she doesn't. We have a court order of shared parental rights with him having every other weekend visits Fri - Sun, some holidays, and 2 weeks in the summer. He is a game player and sometimes shows up, doesn't show up, misses her events, very irresponsible decisions, stuff like that. Honestly I could care less what he does as I'm no longer married to him BUT I feel bad for our daughter as she sees his behavior and is very unhappy. He often has our house into total chaos when his weekends come around. (Ie. wanting to break up the weekend, know where we are, what we're doing, meet him, he doesnt show up). We've had our weekends totally in upheaval for months now over his indecisiveness etc. He went on not taking her for 10 straight weeks (recently) and then popped in to say he wanted rights to go back to the way they were again according to the agreement. She's now dealing with his irresponsible behavior and after the last visit (he took off the whole weekend of the last visit with him after not seeing him for 10 weeks) she has decided she doesn't want to go for Halloween (his normally scheduled visit). She says she doesn't agree with how he treats me and doesn't like talking to him on the phone either.



To top it off, he will call, harass, leave nasty emails to me as if I am involved. (I am not. I have always tried to be very supportive of their relationship even though he's dragged me into court every year for the last 10 over his wanting to constantly change our agreements). Our daughter refuses to pick up the phone now as she's scared to talk to him but doesn't want to hurt his feelings about not going for Halloween but she doesnt really want to go. She wants to spend the weekend with her friend.



Should I stay out of this one or keep convincing her to go as I always have for the last 10 years? Believe me it hasn't done me any good to agree/not agree. My feelings about her father are separate from this but I can tell you that I empathize with every feeling she has right now and I can understand why she doesn't want to go or want to answer the phone. Everything is a hassle, chaotic, and at times even upsetting. Nothing is ever simple.



I never thought I'd be in these shoes but I should have seen them coming a long time ago. Is she really old enough to make these decisions for herself? What if I am taken back to court? I'd stand up for her any day of the week but I don't want to make things worse for us either.



And yes, we have been trying to convince her to at least talk to him and tell him how she's feeling on her own. She hasn't yet though.



Thanks to all replies.

I'm sorry you are going through this - it sounds like a terribly difficult situation.  I don't have an answer for you, but I might repost this in the "parenting" section because I think you may get a better response from adults going through something similar.  This section seems to have a lot of children and young adults.

looks like you haven't gonna to court over this so its your call. i wouldn't make her go anywhere since she is 10 and growing up its her choice if you have gone and done placements then you need to follow court orders but like i said if not in writing there no need to let her go.but i would make it too court cause the placements suck and you be there months before anything good comes of it.

well i wouldnt make her go with him for halloween. she probably wouldnt enjoy it, and she might be scared of what he'll say/do because she hasnt been talking to him or anything.



i'd let her stay with you on halloween on ONE condition. if she doesnt go with him for halloween, she has to call him and talk to him.
just make sure she tells him she didnt mean to hurt his feelings, but she is tired of him making plans and then not showing up.



maybe next halloween she could go spend it with him.



hope this helps & have a great halloween!!!!!!! :D

it might be because on halloween the girls can dress like sluts and get away with it. lol

All girls love to play dressup! Like the other answerer said, we can try on different styles and be sluttier. I'm more outgoing in costumes, I think a lot of people are. Girls like the attention that comes with a fun costume, and inwardly, I think we all like mixing and matching and playing with clothes!



As for guys, I think they find it easier if they do want to dressup. They go for funnier easier costumes.



Happy Halloween!

Trick-or-treating in NC ?



I'm looking for a place to take my kids (3 and 7) trick or treating in Rowan County NC or nearby. We usually go to the mall but that's getting pretty old. It's so small that you make your rounds within 15 minutes. We spend more time getting ready. Are any other malls having trick-or-treating? Or any other places? Please, nothing scary. If so where and what times? Any info will help. If you have a link to a web site that would be great too! Thanks!

Non-degrading costume ideas for a blonde?  (Preferably simple)?



It seems like the only option for a blonde 18-year-old female on Halloween is to dress like a ****, and that's really just not my style, so I'm looking for some costume ideas.



There are pictures of me on my myspace (myspace.com/ohitkills) if that helps at all.



I'm not looking for something frumpy.  Just something that doesn't resemble that of something a stripper would wear would be lovely.



I'll be choosing a best answer, by the way, so get to it.  :P

Halloween make up ideas for guys?



Well at school tomorrow a-lot of people are planing on doing something for Halloween, but we have a 'dress code' so no outfits are permitted. So the idea sprung to mind that I could possibly do something spooky with make-up? or any other ideas? I have had a browse around the web but there aren't many make up guides for Halloween for guys,so if you could suggest a few sites for reference that would be cool!



Thanks for any / all help!

That would be just wrong to give out vegetables for Halloween. You would wake up to find your house, car and yard toilet papered and your house egged and your dog pregnant. LOL



I try to stay away from candy and do something different, so I bought a big box of microwave popcorn in single serving bags at the discount super store (Sams) and that is what I am giving out for Halloween. I think there are 100 bags in there and when they are gone, I will turn off the lights.

Kids would HATE you.



There used to be this guy on my old street when I was a kid and he was SUPER rich....the kind of person you would expect to give everyone a king sized candy bar. The only problem was that he was also a dentist. So instead we all got healthy tooth packets with toothbrushes and dental floss and brushing guides LOL.



We all hated it because we wanted candy, but we all loved the guy and so every year we went back and got another toothbrush. He actually got so many regulars his wife started making personalized bags with our names on them, so that my brother could have a shark toothbrush and I could have the princess one.



So if you are well-liked in the neighborhood, you better have a lot of veggies because people will probably still return year after year.



I should probably add that I threw a few granola bars into our candy bowl this year. They were lying around, no one was eating them, so I'm hoping to unload them into unsuspecting treat bags.

Lol, vegetables would come off as preachy. I like the trick idea, but the little ones would probably be disappointed if you didn't follow up the routine with pulling something yummy out of the air for them. Another safe and healthy alternative would be Halloween themed goodies such as pencils, stickers, erasers, and those cheap little toys that are sold in the party sections of stores. Actually, I think that would be cheaper than splurging on candy.

Meh, I personally love vegetables, and have since I was young, so I wouldn't have a problem with it.
I'm assuming I'm not in the majority, however, so you might want to stick with candy, or just keep your lights off.

From what I know, you could say a lot of things. As a trick or treater as a kid, I've heard many responses from people; if you didn't buy candy, you can just say something like "sorry, I didn't buy/don't have candy". It really shouldn't be too big of a deal if you cannot provide candy. Trick or treaters should know so seeing as how going house to house in a place where they don't have Halloween.

I love Halloween.



It's super fun.



ADD: why am I getting thumbs down for expressing my opinion on how I like halloween? Its not like I'm forcing you to answer your door. I just choose to give out candy from my own house.



ADD: I agree with that other poster. Halloween is just children participating with the community. In my old neighborhood, people used to set up little spook alleys in their driveways. And it was SO fun. And then over time people just stopped trick or treating there altogether. Now my mom gets about 10. This is my first halloween in my new town, so I don't know what the trick or treating frequency is here, but there are kids EVERYWHERE so I am assuming it is quite high. We decorated our door with spider webs and spooky lights in an attempt to attract MORE kids, so we can get rid of all the candy (lord knows I don't need it).

LOVE it!! I love Halloween, and every year, kids (especially tweens/teens) come back with friends to show them my carved jack-o-lanterns.  Those that have already been to our house step aside & let the little ones up.  Maybe we live in an idyllic neighborhood.

halloween is a good tradition... joining in makes you part of the community... even the kids recognise that in their own way.. and its only for 1 night.. join in.. kids dont forget. and kids grow up too... ya dont want to be remembered as an old frump now do you?

I don't mind.  I'm in my sixties now and remember the more innocent times in which I was raised.  Going around carol singing, harvest festival and bonfire night were part of the joy of my childhood.  I love to see the little ones at my door all dressed up and share in their joy.  I am not too keen on older ones, who can feel quite threatening but I treat them well and they have never caused me any trouble.

Too old to trick or treat?



I'm in my teens and I still love to go out trick or treating. I've never had a problem with anyone yet about being "too old". I take a lot of time to dress up really cool, I'm very polite. I always say trick or treat, and thank-you. I go out with my cousin and sister and our parents even come out with us. And when there are little children we always let them go ahead of us. So...my question is...is that acceptable to you? If someone is in there teens but puts an actual effort into a costume and is polite, is that ok with you?

Is this costume too crazy for downtown austin?



I just turned 21 on tuesday, so this friday (Halloween) will be my first downtown experience in Austin. I hear that some girls tend to get really crazy with their costumes, and I definitely want to fit into that category. lol. I understand that the rules change a little bit on halloween and mardi gras, but I just want to make sure this is alright before I make it all happen:



Well I'm going as a candy corn. I have a witches hat that is black on the inside and underneath the brim, but on the brim and the rest of the way up, it is orange, yellow and white like a candy corn. lol. I won't be wearing a top persay, but I have a little shrug I can put on with it. but the COSTUME costume, i'll just have my nipples covered with orange and yellow pasties. then the bottoms are a yellow, orange and white thong with some cute lace ruffly stuff around the waist. then long orange and white (horizontal) striped stockings, and black platforms
The hat, stockings, and platforms are really the costume, and I would just wear those 3 things if I could (afterparty). basically the idea is I want to look/feel naked

Halloween and Army Combat Uniform?



Tomorrows Halloween as you all know.  We get to wear costumes at work tomorrow as well and I don't really have a theme but I want to wear my Army Combat Uniform (in a non disrespectful manner of course!)
I am indeed a Civilian who does Military Simulation, which is why I have the ACU's to begin with.



Will I get in trouble or anything of the sort for wearing it?



I've seen the law and it has many clauses.  I just want a straight answer, again I will not be disrespecting the army in any way. I do have long dreadlocks though. lol

Yes, sexy.  The dark angel part will have to come from attitude.  Or an inspiration for your costume.

LAST MINUTE! Good Halloween music for a huge Halloween display?



What I'm doing is making a .WMA file with Windows Movie Maker so that I can blend everything together and just let the one track play on repeat from an iPod for some ambient music around our very over-the-top Halloween display tomorrow evening. I'll put a list of the songs I already have in some details after I post this, but what are some suggestions?

Why so much Halloween activity before Halloween?



I understand Halloween parties and trick or treating on earlier days when the holiday falls on a Tuesday or something, but this year it's Friday.  Friday, the perfect day!  Everything here in my town seems to be going on tonight (Friday), but I'm seeing a lot of people talk about parties and trick or treating that's already happened.



Are you guys in an earlier time zone in Europe, or what?  There's really no excuse for celebrating a Friday Halloween before Friday.  It's ideal.

I have nothing to do on halloween, help?



I've always celebrated halloween before, and its always turned out to be so fun, thats why i love it so much..
my friend WAS going to have a great murder mystery party for halloween, but now its been called off at the last minute and i've been left with nothing to do.
i was going to maybe do something with 2 or 3 of my friends, and we might be going to a gig tonight where loads of people will probably be dressing up.. but i still think it won't have that "halloweeny" feel to it,
any ideas to what we could do before we go there?
or any suggestions at all?



thanks!

I am looking forsomething really easy that i don't need to go out and buy a bunch of stuff. I would prefer a female, but i'll take anything thats easy. Thanks so much!!

I'm pretty scary already. I wouldn't want to traumatize the poor kids by adding a costume. and, i usually give out freezies or drink boxes, so they get one. But occasionally, I give out small chocolate bars, then they get 3.

Don't dress up because that sometimes scares little kids, when I was little there was someone in an Ape mask that was handing out candy and I freaked! It is better when you get to pick because then you dont end up with a bunch of candy that you don't like or cant eat. let them pick a couple of pieces and they will be happy.



Good Luck

I get halloween baggies, put about 6 pieces of candy in them and give them each a bag.  I get my candy from the dollar store so it doesn't get too expensive.  I do dress up.  one year i sat in a chair on my porch dressed as a ragged witch with a cauldron in my lap and had a sign in the porch saying "candy here" , I would sit really still and when they would go to grab the candy i would scream :"That's not for you!"  LOL!  I sacred a lot of kiddies that way, it was fun!  (and of course i did give them the candy!)

We give treats out to the kids and teens. We don't dress up though because it is a waste of time and money. We take a few peaces of candy out like 4 or 5 pieces and ask them if they're allergic to anything or f they like peanut butter or carmel or if they are happy with those candy

definitley hand out mini chocolate bars, or if your really cool, give them whole ones. I would give them about 3, or more if you got the really big costco bags. If you do dress up, dont be really scary or weird (definitely not a clown or a princess).

Hmm a group of girls? Depends on your budget but here are my thoughts:



--Each of you pick a Disney princess (yellow dress for Belle, a dark-haired Snow White, etc)
--Each of you be an animal/bug (bees and ladybugs, or each of you find a diff animal print to be a zebra, tiger, panther, leopard, cheetah, etc)
--The Pussycat Dolls or celebs (a Britney, a Paris, P!NK, Jessica Simpson, Amy Winehouse if any of you have tattoos)
--Authority Figures (cops, navy officers, etc). Dress in all camoflauge for a quick easy costume.



Home remedy/DIY options:
--Witches
--Cheerleaders
--Prom Queens/Court
--Color crayons (each be a color)
--Hippies
--Cowgirls



Hope this helps, have fun!

<question>



Which choice would you make....a moral and ethical decision to be made inside...WARNING...maybe difficult?



So here it is....



(if your not married then we will assume for the sake of this scenario that you are) (Also we assume that pound and dollar are at the same rate, so one dollar = one pound)



Say, for whatever reason (dnt matter) your spouse (husband/wife) is stuck in a different country which is far away from you, your spouse has NO DIFFICULTIES living in that country, but your spouse wishes to be with you.



In order for YOU to bring your spouse to the country that you are living in you will have to have 3,000 pounds/dollars. If you give it within a time period of three months your spouse can come to you in the last month of the three (e.g. u get 1,000 pound/dollars in one month same the next month and same the month after that, so in the final month because you got the 3,000 figure you can get your spouse over that same day)



HOWEVER if you delay the payment AFTER three months then it will take a year for your spouse to get to where you are



So now we are going to assume that you are in your final day of your three month time period. You have your 3,000 pounds/dollars.



BUT something new has come up. A chance to invest 1,000 pounds/dollars.



If you invest this money you WILL NOT see your spouse for a WHOLE YEAR (play along with the scenario). BUT you will make profit on your investment and become RICH.



ALSO if you make the investment your spouse WILL begin to question your heart and loyalty and character and your spouse will hold a grudge for you for a LONG time period.



(There is no other choices in this scenario - which will you do



(1) make the investment - and make her wait a year.



(2) pay the 3,000 pounds/dollars - to get her over straight away



and EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER



</question>



<additional details>



@totometh NO you CANNOT VISIT HER



IF YOU INVEST:



YOU DO NOT SEE HER FOR A WHOLE YEAR



THAT IS THE SCENARIO!!!



@Maryam, i'm, unfortunately not privy to that information...i do not know :)

Invest, though money isnt everything, it will help out in the long run. Not to mention you could always visit during that year. Sounds like you want to invest anyway, because if you didnt you wouldnt even post this question. So deep down in your heart you want to invest, so follow that feeling.

Are faith and wisdom liquids ?!!?

Are faith and wisdom something tangible can be seen  and poured from a vessel ? What did he see ? How does it look like ?



The hadith is not a metaphoric because it says " he saw it and Gabriel poured the CONTENTS  "



------------------------------------
Bukhari (Book #8, Hadith #345)



Narrated Abu Dhar: Allah's Apostle said, "While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, opened my chest, and washed it with Zam-zam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it.

According to Quran, our deeds shall be weighed, does deeds have wieght?



Now, answer to you question is that. Yes, in some dimension which we can't understand now, intangibles are tangibles.
According to another hadith, when a person commit zina his faith shall come out of him and hang over him.
According to another hadith, on the day of judgement death shall be brought in the form of calf and shall be slaughtered. That will be death of death and no more deaths will be there.



I am not finding any trouble in believing this. Simply, we can't feel all the dimension of reality in this life, though sometime Allah may show us miraculously.

now with more complex situations.....the quote rings greater truth (do you see the irony...for if you believed the quote entirely , you have a discovered a truth and thus it should be doubted by the very essence for which the quote stands).....



EX. someone telling you he has learned the true beginings of man (though evolution or biblical....it doesn't matter) ..... I must be skeptical...especially since they have stopped searching.

I believe Andre Gide is a modern author...maybe post-modern who lived during WWI and WW2 i think. When we learned about him in english i think  he was all for "Honesty is the best policy" and truth and stuff like that. So him saying something like that is not surprising.



Do you want an answer in Islamic terms or generally?



Heres my take on it. Everyone is searching for some truth in there lives. As humans we're always talking about "whats our purpose in life" and alot of philosophical things like that. If we can't find it then we pass the task down to our progeny to help find the truth. And basically the reason we are so desperate to try to find this truth is to explain some circumstance in our life or try to better understand the world we live in. Eventually, we will find this truth.



But let's work backwards here. Let's start with "Doubt those who find it," first. People who have found the truth, or they claim to have found the truth, be it scientifical, theological, philosophical...etc, they have always had criticism from someone else. This critic does not have to be a competitor in search of the truth of the same subject, but can be someone completely alien. Therefore the person who found the truth, will be getting criticisms of all "shapes, sizes, and colors." In a way, we are all critics, because as humans we have preferences, and based of those preferences we judge. But unfortunately, our preferences either so narrow or so selective, that we end up believing this truth...lol and now i am digressing.



Now, "Believe those who are seeking the truth." As you probably know, the dawn of the twentieth century was taken with very little confidence and much doubt and uncertainty. People had little hope of easily transitioning their perfect Romantic vision of the world into Modern World. Hence, we have someone as controversial or 'rebellious' as Andre Gide, himself, who wrote such pieces of literature having to do with this search of truth. If we were to believe those who are seeking the truth, then we would only believe them up until the point they have found the truth. Then we will start doubting them. Every great thinker, philosopher, scientist, some point in time has been doubter-only later proven to be correct or in position of great popularity or appraisal in the eyes of others. But look at us today we ended up believing them. But like i said, we are not critics. Critics on the other hand, are still seeking for the 'real' or 'better' truth than the great mind had come up with. Or, it could be for the other completely sane reason that the critic believed the truth could be acquired, only to realize that after it was discovered it was completely flawed.



Bottom line, those who are seeking the truth will end up getting the same crap as those who have already 'been there, done that.'



My take on this statement is, no matter how long we take or what we ultimately come up with as the 'universal truth,' we will always be criticized for what we believe is the truth. So this statement just turns out to be this circular irony, where Andre Gide, unintentionally, wanted us to question our motives and purpose rather than blindly follow one another. Much like you are doing with this quote and this quote is doing upon itself and others like me in a very eloquent way.

being not married is not a method to earn any rewards.
some religion thinking sex is totally not good , but islam do not have such extreme view.
If you don't have sexual desire, why should you put into trouble . stay unmarried. that is a case different.
but you have normal sexual desire and ability why you should remain unmarried.

Mostly Afghans believes, that his body was tied on a Camel, and the Camel was freed and no one knew where the camel went, they say it came to Afghanistan, the people buried him in the Balkh!

emotional security....like the answerer above says, the comfort of motherly care.
men who preferred breast most of all are said to be "playboys", would tend to look for other "greener pastures " when time comes or take several relationships at a time. To gain their loyalty is to pamper them with lots of affections like a spoiled brat.
Women who use this alluring method may also manifest that they are the types that would look for guys who would pamper them the most. Thus, loyalty is not in their protocols.

religion is really a personal private matter.  if you gain peace, insight and guidance from it then what else is there to ask for.



people who have negative comments about religions, or anything for that matter, are voicing from there own perspective.  it has nothing to do with you or your reality, and it's best to let it go.



be grateful for what your religion has done to make you a better, happier person.  be at peace with others negativities in the knowing that you have gained benefit from which they probably know nothing about.

With patience!



I have a degree in Theology, and the vast majority of people I meet have opinions on religion, but very little, if any, training.



Consider:  You went to Sunday School.  If your parents went to church regularly, you were there a maximum of 52 weeks in the year. However, many Sunday Schools do not run in the summer, and there are the "big feasts" (Christmas, Easter, etc), where the kids are in church for the whole service.  So, from say age 5-12 or so, you have 7x52x.5=182 - a maximum of 182 hours of instruction.



However - the Lectionary most churches use is a 3 year cycle.  This covers 25% of the NT, and 10% of the old one.  So, you get the same lessons every 3 years.



3x52x.5= 78 hours, that covers only a portion of the Bible, assuming all Sunday School lessons are tied to the lectionary - which they often aren't.



Now, Grade 1 has kids in school learning about 5 hours a day.  At that rate, if you went to a full-time Sunday School, you would be completely done all your religious training in about 15-16 weeks.  Which covers only a portion of what your religion is.  And, this is a best case scenario!



Imagine going to school from September until about Christmas, and then leaving school, and trying to live with what you had learned.  You could barely read (if at all), count, do math, or anything. Yet, this is the knowledge that the average Christian has - if they had done very well.  Most do not even have that.



So, for most people, they really know nothing about religion (as some of the answers to this question show!).  How can we be insulted when the person speaking knows nothing about what they are talking about?



This does offer us an opportunity to preach, or educate, or discuss what we know or believe, which is what I do.  However, many will not want to listen.  The faithful may know the Good News and want to share it; sadly, many do not want to listen.  But, getting mad won't help - just use gentle patience.

I try to correct their misconception.  If they are quoting scripture and making a mockery of it then I will explain the true meaning behind the scripture.  I get offended at times, but I have to stop and look to see if the negative statement appears as if it is intentionally meant to offend or if it is simply made out of a lack of knowledge and understanding. I don't feel my religion needs to be defended and many see that as me not caring about my religion, Jesus or God, but it is simply that Jesus and God don't need to be defended.  They are both perfectly capable of handing the situation without my interference.  Neither of them chose me to be the defender of Christianity and if someone insults my religion God will deal with them as He sees fit.

It depends on the time and place.



If someone is insincere, like many of the others who answered your question, then it doesn't matter what you say to them; they have made up their mind already and due to some deep seeded insecurity or doubt about their own beliefs, some people feel the urge to argue.



Arguing is a waste of time.  If someone is simply uneducated and willing to listen then give them the correct information and leave the rest up to them.  If they're just some miscreant that was bullied too much in school and wants to debate without listening, then walk away.

The question has been deleted, but never mind. You know how I used to respond to Islam-bashers here on Answers when I was a Muslim? A person would say something really nasty about the Prophet and I would usually say:



Dear questioner,



Thank you for insulting my religion and the Prophet I follow. Feel free to continue to do so, because you're only making me exercise Jesus' (pbuh) example of turning the left cheek.



Thanks for the question, come again! :)

i ignore their ignorance. Since i am a pagan (i expect multiple thumbs down for this) i have been spat on and told im going to hell,i have been told im evil and that my beliefs are not to be respected because they arent real. A few years back my ex neighbours (fanatical christians) who didnt like the 'evil smell' coming from my house (which was incense)  killed my cat by putting asprin in her water bowl and then bragged about it.
it is against my beliefs to wish them harm but when i asked them why they killed my cat they said they would kill me for jesus if they knew they wouldnt go to jail cos i was evil. such cowards.



it makes me physically ill and very hard to maintain a peaceful countenance. but its my heart and soul and i wont taint it with hatred for anyone.

Ramadan: Not knowing the value of something/someone until they are gone?



I love my parents more than anything in the world and respect them so much! If anyone were to ever even make a joke about them I would flipping rearrange their faces. Though, I feel like I've failed being a daughter. I wish I was obeying them more, providing for them more, and just make them happy and proud of me. I never feel as if I have done anything for them, my mother taking care of me when I was a child for one day isn't ever going to be equal to what I do for her for the rest of my life. My father and mother gave me the best gift, the gift of being raised in an Islamic environment where everyone outside of my home is the opposite of. My thanks go to Allah before anyone, then to my parents. I haven't seen my dad for about a month now (He's out of town) and I have been having the worst feeling of being a failure. I'm almost 19 years old and I have never truly appreciated what my parents have done for me. I want to make him and my mother the proudest parents ever! I'm going to graduate with a Bachelors very soon, I've wasted about 5 years in college getting nowhere. I've wasted my entire youth not keeping up with memorizing the Quran. I've wasted my life not treating my parents they way they deserve to be, and that's never possible. There is a Cambodian saying that my mom used to tell us, "A mother can take care of 10 children till they grow old, but 10 children can never take care of one mother while she is old". And it's true. It sickens me to see idiots go off about their parents and call them names!!! Are you kidding me? Even if your mother or father beat the living crap out of you, never allow yourself to say anything negative about them! People like those make me want to make their life miserable. Remember having a bad father or a bad mother is better than not having either. How can people have the nerves to say something bad about their parents? Because they didn't let them wear skimpy clothes outside, didn't let them get a belly pierce, don't let them hang out with their friends who influence them negatively, for shouting at them to clean? Heck. You people make me sick!



Allah grant my parents Jannat Alfirdous! I am making a promise to myself, from this day I will appreciate everything before it's gone, not just through words, but through action. Allah bless all the parents out there and give them happy healthy long lives. People need to appreciate their parents and respect them. Report this for all I care. At least I got this message across. Peace.

some verses from Qura'an (Sorat Al Essra') position goodness to parents as a close second to worshiping no-one but Allah. It orders us, as our parents grow old, not to tell them any words of contempt or repel them but to tell them gracious words. It commands us to show humility out of mercifulness and to ask God to be merciful on them as they have raised brought us up when we were kids, No doubt we have to respect our parents at anytime and follow them unless they order us aginst Islam!!

I completely understand how you're feeling. My parents have done so many things for me that I really don't know how to thank them. I wasn't exactly the perfect daughter as a teenager and now, I realize all the mistakes that I have done. I regret them every day and ask God for forgiveness. I talk to my parents and tell them how sorry I am.



I'm practically obsessed with this... I keep asking my father how I can make him proud of me. I'm ready to do whatever he wants, whatever my mother wants. Even if they tell me to stop my studies and do something else, I'll do it for their sake.



And I completely understand how you feel when you talk about people who get angry at their parents for no reason, such as "I want a belly piercing" or "I wanna stay out tonight past 1 am". God forgive me, I used to be like this and I'm so thankful to my parents that they never said "Yes". They always kept me on the right track. They never "gave up" on me.



Even when I nagged over and over, they still didn't abandon me. And you can't imagine how thankful I am! I swear to God. I thank my mother for confiscating my phone when I was bad, for taking away my computer when I spent too much time on it, for screaming at me when my room wasn't tidy. All the things that I was thought were unfair, were maybe the best things they ever did for me.



My sister's best friend, who's nearly in her thirties, once told me: "I have the best advice for you. So listen to me... Your parents are always right". I was shocked, so I asked why. She repeated: "They are always right. They know what's good for you. Even when you think they're unfair, they're just right." And I was really shocked to see how wise this piece of advice was. They have much more experience than me, and I should listen to them if I want to make it in this world.

i Knowwww sister...i know exactly what you mean. And truly speaking there probably isn't there anything...not one thing that we can do to make it up to them...We are indebt to them foreverrr. Thats why, personally



1. We need Sadqa Jariya, because the reward is soo great.
2. (for guys) Have extremeee respect for their ladiez/girls/sister/women and Mothers because what we do might be so littlee but it will go a longg way.



That feeling of losing one's loved ones, especially parents is just soo frustrating? Look at us in the 21st century how dependent we are on them...What would we do without them or without their guidance, regardless if we see them on a daily basis or not it gives us comfort that they exist in some corner in this world.

Most people never go through the realization that you have until they lose a parent. I know how you feel, I haven't seen my father in over a year because he is waiting for a liver transplant in another state. When I found out I felt absolutely horrible and I started thinking about how bad of a daughter I was, even though he tells me I was the best. I regret every time I rolled my eyes at him, every time I made that noise with my lips when he would say no to me. But I have asked for his forgiveness for every time I made him angry and I always tell him how much I love him. My grandmother told me that most people don't realize the importance of their father until he is gone. I find that to be so true.



I admire my father so much, he has been given trial after trial and his faith has never waivered. He has been in a wheelchair for the last 18 years, suffered from seizures, liver problems, and constant pain and I swear I have never seen him miss a single prayer, I have never heard him ask why all these things were happening to him. He never stopped warning us about not praying, and always told us to fear Allah. I finally recognized the importance of his words and I started practicing and when I told him he was so happy I will never forget that day. May Allah grant him Jannah for his patience and unwaivering faith. Ameen

When I read the last paragraph, it just occurred to me that while you appreciate parenthood so much you are fine with good non-Muslim parents going to hell. Anyway.



I think the most rewarding thing you can do for your parents is your own success.  That's what most parents want and what makes them truly happy. It's what they live for.

Those, who spend in prosperity and adversity, and those who suppress anger, and pardon men; and Allah loves those who do good; (3:134)



The Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw) said: "The best Jihad is self-control."



The Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw) said: "He is not strong and powerful, who throws people down, but he is strong who withholds himself from anger."



The Holy Prophet Muhammad (saw) said: "Whoever suppresses his anger, when he has in his power to show it, Allah (SWT) will give him a great reward."



Amirul Muminin, Imam Ali (as) said: "The most powerful person is the one who is victorious over his anger with his forbearance."



Amirul Muminin, Imam Ali (as) said: "When a person gets angry, if he is standing, he should immediately lie down (sit down) on earth for a while as this removes the filth of Shaitan (Satan) from him at that time."

Rush towards the forgiveness from your Rabb to a Paradise as vast as the Heavens and the earth which is prepared for the righteous people;



'they are those who spend generously in the way of Allah, whether they are in prosperity or in adversity, who control their anger and forgive other people for Allah loves such charitable people,



who, if they commit an indecency or wrong their own souls, earnestly remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins; for no one can forgive sins except Allah, and those who do not knowingly persist in something wrong which they have done.



Such people will be rewarded with forgiveness from their Rabb plus gardens beneath which the rivers flow, to live therein forever. How excellent is the reward for such laborers!

I'm a kind of person who doesn't show his anger. It has happened rarely maybe 5 times in all my life. I usually leave the person and the place that makes me angry and I don't answer back if he insults. It happened to me today.



God says if you cool your anger, I will cool my anger on you on the Judgment Day.

Anger is your enemy and that's why its HARAM. I heard that when you get angry you should read bismillah and are standing then you should sit down , and if you are sitting then you should lay down in bed.
Remember if you dint control your anger you might end up doing some thing which you might regret later for rest of your life. So its better to be safe than sorry.

Muslims...Why is there such a BIG difference in morality?



"Keep your wife and reverence allah," and you hid inside yourself what allah wished to proclaim. Thus, you feared the people, when you were supposed to fear only allah. When Zeid was completely through with his wife, we had you marry her, in order to establish the precedent that a man may marry the divorced wife of his adopted son. Allah's commands shall be done. - Surah 33:37



Deuteronomy 24:4 her first husband, who divorced her, is not allowed to marry her again for she has been defiled. That would be detestable in the eyes of the LORD. Do not bring sin upon the land the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance.  Leviticus 21:7 " 'They must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands, because priests are holy to their God.

Yes, there is a big difference in morality.



Quran is practical for humans..



and OT seems to be only for angels. That's why paul got ride of "The Law"..



According to paul death is unltimate substitute for Law. Is that really morality?



BTW, here is a good example of rape morality..
(Deuteronomy 22:28-29 NLT)
If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father.  Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her.



Another one..



Death to the Rape Victim



(Deuteronomy 22:23-24 NAB)
If within the city a man comes upon a maiden who is betrothed, and has relations with her, you shall bring them both out of the gate of the city and there stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry out for help though she was in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbors wife.

You're right. There is such a big difference in morality between these two verses.



The Bible calls divorced women ''defiled'' and puts them in the same line with prostitutes. How cruel!



EDIT: Do you honestly want me to explain that Qur'anic verse to you? I will gladly, it's just that you don't seem to be really interested in answers.

Invite people round and get merry... if it's not your house and you're still living with your parents, think carefully about doing It without their permission. I had a house party at 16, and unfortunately friends of friends of friends turned up and before I knew it, the whole house was trashed, covered in vomit and makeup smeared all over the walls, and my parents bedroom ransacked. On the other hand, my best friend had a house party around the same time, got permission from her mum who agreed to be home at 2am, we had a couple of lads watching the door and a group of us started throwing people out and cleaning up at 1am, no problems.

The word "harmless" usually depends if you are do it, or it is done to you.



I'd say you stick with the basics, . . . "Trick or Treat!"



Egging a house is not harmless, just so you know, . . the enzymes in the egg are hell on paint of any kind.

I dont see why you would think it was a bad idea.
Witch costumes are a classic! And its always nice to put your own touches to it.
Being a classic is totaly different in my eyes than being something that is Overdone that year..... Like being a pirate or Hannah Montannah.

Hi Kristina B..



Music..music..music.



Not song music but sounds..
Foot-steps really do the trick if done right..



Creaky doors sounds, voices (muffled)..  This is my kind of fun..  I have a PA speaker for my truck and can make eerie sounds using my CB/PA together..



If you have or can get a tape player and a tape with eerie sounds on it, that would do it honey..  Good Luck, I hope it's not too late..?!

write the date on a paper on the wall that says like october 3, 2008 and then like turn off the lights, open all the windows, and leave them stranded. Have an alarm clock wake them up and lock the doors so they can't get out and i guarantee they will pee their pants! and don't leave your stuff their, maybe you could even rearange the room to the last time it looked like.

ha thats kinda tough.
if your house is somewhat creepy, that would be cool.
like make little noises seem scary.
or make up like something scary that happened at your house.
as for pranks...you could use powder and put it on their face.
just be creative.
pretty much anything will be funny.

Go On A Scavenger Hunt for Embarrassing things- It'll be funny listening to each others stories about who you had to ask for these items and how you got them. Put things on the list like KY Jelly, wet floor signs, flourescent light bulbs, numbers off of a sign, a dog collar, a half eaten sandwich, a pager from a restaurant, etc



As far as pranks go- shave an eyebrow, put make up on them and take pictures to post on myspace, use a permanent marker and draw a penis on their face, put an embarrassing bumper sticker on their car, put a fish stick under the drivers seat in the car- within a few days it'll stink to high heaven!

Halloween is a very strange night. People can sometimes act differently and do things that are weird or not normal. I think you're old enough, however, I would definitly advise you to go with a group of friends. NOT ALONE! More people who are crazy go for people who are alone, not with a bunch of people! Happy Halloween! =D

Last year I was a bag of jelly beans. It's easy and fast to make! You just get a dry cleaner bag you know the plastic bag thing that's over your clothes when you get them back. Then you cut out head and arm holes. Next you get a bunch of balloons and blow them up with air. then you put the bag on and stuff it full of the balloons. After that you tie up the bottom. Then make a sign that says jellybeans 25 cents and tape it to the front of your costume. Note: You will probably need to get someone to help you stuff and tie the bag. It's a really fun homemade costume!

Here are some ideas:



* Grab an old bed sheet nobody in your house cares about; cut eyeholes in it; and go as a ghost.



* Look through any old trunks and other clothing storage boxes you might have lying around your house. You might very well find some old clothes in there that you could use to make a decent Halloween costume.



* Check out your local thrift store. You should be able to find some good costumes for sale there for no more than a few dollars.

I was thinking about being Super Bowl! (you wear a cape and put a big bowl on your head). I was also thinking about being a giant Hershey bar, (you get a big black trash bag and tape, and write with the tape HERSHEYS on the bag and make arm holes and a head hole). I was a long time ago thinking about being a black eye pea but but i kind of changed my mind, but if a was going to be a black eye pea then i need suggestions on how to make it. So do you like those costumes?

You should wear the cloak and the witches hat. You should then wear a cute black mini dress under the cloak, and some cute black heels, with crazy eye makeup and crazy curly hair. Now you're a classy sexy witch!!!

There are lots of things you can do with that! First, you could make your make-up very seductive with dark eyes. Then wear just any red shirt and black pants or skirt. Wear the cloak along with the horns and prongs. You could also be a witch and wear black tights/pantyhose (fishnets are great if you have them) black shoes, crazy socks, and whatever kind of outfit you want. Then put on the cloak and the witches hat. It'd be really awesome if you could paint your face green or wear green eyeshadow. Another option would be to wear the scary mask and dress all in black. You could also make it funny and dress up all girly, then put on the mask. Last, you could do something without all that stuff. You could put on a dress and heels and be a prom queen. Use a red marker or face paint on your face with dark makeup under your eyes and you can turn it into a dead prom queen.  You could dress in all white and be an angel or a ghost. You could even put on all sorts of mismatched clothes. Basically you can get away with almost anything! I hope that helped! And have a great Halloween!

No nothing happened to Jesus on Halloween, it wasn't Halloween back then but Samhain...the Celtic New Year. The celts honored those who had passed on before them, how would that relate to Jesus. Jesus wasn't even alleged to be near the Celts during that time anyway.



I have heard that there were Christians persecuted on Halloween and that is why some choose to not celebrate the holiday. I have never found anything to prove that so I am not sure that its true. However if that is the basis for her not celebrating then she shouldn't celebrate Valentines Day either. During the Black Plague the church had burned an amazing amount of Christians because the church beleived they had sinned so bad that god had brought the plague upon them.

My boyfriend and I are going to dinner and to see Saw V (and I will be dressing in my usual "angsty goth teenager" outfit).  What are your plans for tonight?  Handing out candy?  Taking the kids trick-or-treating?  Frightening the neighbors?  :)

mediumship is not something you just pick up overnight. its an inborn talent, a gift. Unless you have some strong sensistive or psychic ability already, it would be hard for you.



You need to examine your motives. Do you really want to contact a spirit just for kicks? that just seems kind of juvenile to me. What if you really got on the same level with some nasty non-human entities? you would have more than just the problem of being bored and wanting  athrill.



divination however is a lot safer , and is even an ancient Halloween tradition.Samhain was the best time in the year to ask questions by divination and recieve accurate answers. there are many means of divination such as scrying, tarot cards, reading runes, coca leaves, tea leaves ect. you can find out more by doing a quick search on these things.a big chain bookstore should have tarot cards, runes, and other divination cards.

And the crown it came with is a bit odd. It's made predominantly of sequins, and it connects at the back with velcro. As you can imagine, it sure doesn't fit -around- my head, and so I imagine I have to weave my hair around it or use bobby pins or something... but I'm not sure exactly what to do or how. So I decided to turn to the wonderful people of yahoo! answers and see if you've got any ideas.

<answer>



Halloween is a time of mystery and fun. However, the nature of "Trick or Treating" requires parents and children to take extra precautions. Here are a few Halloween safety tips to help keep Halloween enjoyable and safe for everyone!



Children



Limit your trick-or-treating to your own neighborhood. Know where the unseen dangers are and avoid them.



Travel in groups. You will have more fun and there is safety in numbers.



Carry a flashlight with you if you plan to stay out after dark. Before you leave make sure the flashlight is in good working order.



Limit your visits to homes with the outside light on.



Never enter cars or homes of strangers -- even if they invite you in to get a treat.



Take your treats home and have a parent or responsible adult inspect them. Don't eat anything that looks suspicious or tampered with.



Costumes



Be highly visible to motorists. Wear light colored costumes that reflect light, or add reflective tape.



If you plan to wear a mask, cut the eye holes extra large to maximize vision, or better yet, wear stage make-up.



Be fire safe. Make certain your costume is flame resistant, and don't use lighted candles in your jack-o-lantern.



Trim your costume short enough to prevent tripping.



Don't carry sharp or pointed objects, even if they go well with your costume. You may injure yourself or another child.



Bags for collecting treats should be small enough to prevent tripping or obstructing vision.



Use comfortable shoes that fit properly. High heels or costume shoes that do not fit properly may injure you.



Parents



Have a pre-planned, well lit trick-or-treat route for your children to follow.



Escort your children or designate a responsible older child to accompany them while trick-or-treating.



Driving



Watch for children who may be distracted by Halloween festivities.



Turn on your headlights early and drive well below the posted speed limit.



Passing out treats



Give only commercially wrapped treats, coupons, gift certificates, or coins.



Leave your porch light on if you plan to participate in the festivities.



Prepare your children



Talk to your children about the safety rules they should always follow. Make sure you discuss what to do if they're approached by older children who want to harm them, about not talking to strangers, and where to use the restroom.



Remind children to:



* Never enter cars or homes of strangers -- even if they're invited in to receive a treat.



* Use the crosswalks when crossing the street.



* Wait for the proper signal.



* Look both ways before crossing.



* Watch out for cars turning at intersections or leaving and entering driveways.



* Never walk into the road between parked cars.



* Stay on the sidewalk.



Insist that treats be brought home for inspection. Separate suspicious items such as candies with loose or torn wrappings, unpackaged items, and items obviously tampered with. Any dangerous items discovered in the treats (razor blades, pins, etc.) Should be reported immediately to the police and kept for evidence.



After it's over



Calm you children down when the evening is over. Help them remove costumes and make-up. Sit down quietly and talk about the activities over a cup of cocoa or warm milk. If your child is frightened when going to bed, a lot of reassurance and a little night light goes a long way.



Alternatives



Look for advertised Halloween events and activities in the community as a possible alternative to going door to door.



Happy Halloween!

well where i live they have a certain time for the younger kids to go trick or treating. its around 5:30-7 when it's still kind of light out lol, there's a bunch of kids and a certain area where they all go. is there anything like that where you live? if not then just go early dont wait till dark and go in a group hold your babys hand =]. bring a flash light and if you hear people scream lol dont go near there cause it might be something that may scare your baby. hope you have fun.

So that is when Halloween is for me.  Today my kids have a Halloween party at school, but we won't be doing anything tonight.

Hi there,
Well you want to make the evening spooky the only things which I can suggest are to watch movies like you are and maybe to get some real life stories off the Internet and tell them to each other. This will create a spooky atmosphere, and may even have a big impact depending if you tell them at a late time.



* Pranks- These definitely bring the halloween spirt
How much do you love your brother lol?
You could also kid your friend on how your house is haunted and the strange things which happen in the night.



If you are thinking this is cruel, maybe your brother could pull some pranks on your friend???
Im sure that would be cheap.
All the best, have fun with your halloween sleep over.

go to the wedding aisle at walmart and buy an inexpensive tiara.  also, get a yard or two of wide satin ribbon and a black fabric marker.  make a sash with some hokey pageant queen theme-- "lamb princess" "pork queen" "miss antarctica"...and be a winner for halloween! :)

Use a wire hanger and black pantyhose or tights.  Just mold the hanger into the shape you need and pull the legs of the pantyhose over the hanger.  Secure the wings to your costume.

How can I attach this crown to my head?



I recently purchased this costume:



http://www.yandy.com/Images/Products/Del...



And the crown it came with is a bit odd. It's made predominantly of sequins, and it connects at the back with velcro. As you can imagine, it sure doesn't fit -around- my head, and so I imagine I have to weave my hair around it or use bobby pins or something... but I'm not sure exactly what to do or how. So I decided to turn to the wonderful people of yahoo! answers and see if you've got any ideas.

I would assume using bobby pins. If you look at the miss american pageants the crown sits on their head and they use bobby pins to secure it on their head. I'm assuming that would be the best way to do it. You could always buy a small clip to clip it on both sides.However if you want t he crown to go all the way around ur head, buy some elastic (strip of it), attach each end to the crown (u can sew it to the other elastic pieces) then u can put it on ur head.

Notice how the girl in the picture looks like she's standing really really still....wonder if the crown fell off when she breathed?



Personally I would head out to the store a pick up a cheap headband. Then use tape or hot glue and attach the crown to the headband (heck you could use another headband to go around the inside of the crown to give it form as well). Another option would be to buy a cheap tiara from a thrift store or some place like Claire's, attach the crown to is and that way you can use it to keep the shape of the crown and use the combs of the tiara to keep in on your head. Also, if you're hair is long enough, you might want to put your hair up in a bun on top of your head and put the crown around it, then any way that you attach it will be concealed by your hair style.

put a few sections of hair over it at the back and secure down with bobby pins, you wont really be able to tell if you have your hair backcombed and i dont realy think people will be looking at the back of your head because your costume will have all the attention its gorgeous =]

Im not sure but try getting a little bit of your hair (if your hair is going to be down or curled) and run it through the crown tha velcrob together. just run them threw. Then bobby pin the sides and bobby pin the hair that went through so it would hold.
I ur gonna have it up, its earier. You are sitll running half your hair through and putting up your hair into a sweeped bun. you still need the pins. Large ones. The other half that isnt in the crowm still goes up so that the crown run throught the bun you know?
That my guess on who you might be able to hpld it up.

me and my boyfriend are trying to find a party, but not having much luck. we both have costumes, and are trying to figure out what to do. some of our friends are going to a party, but not dressing up. a few others have to work all night. any ideas of where to go and be able to dress up slightly skanky? I'm 18, and he's 20, so we can't go to bars. we're not much of a club type couple, but if it comes down to it, we might.

No I think a long angel costume will look prettier than a short one. Short costumes are slutty and played out. Besides you'll be comfortable and able to have fun instead of with a short one trying to pull it down and cover all night.

I think it fine but some people will think you are ruining it and the holiday is for younger kids.  More acceptable would be to go to a party not TOTing.



Personally you grow old because you quit playing so go have fun.  Don't let the fuddies tell you you can't have one night of fun.

I'd bring along some younger kids with you if possible.
Otherwise, it seems like you're taking the fun away from the other kids who go trick-or-treating in your neighborhood. People may think you're up to no good--you know the bad reputation some adults and teens can get for acting on halloween.
If you want to, then sure, who's stopping you? Just be respectful enough to not go up to houses with the porch lights off, and don't try and harass somebody to give you candy if they really don't want to.

Me, I think that if you're dressed up in a Halloween Costume, nobody can tell how old you are anyways.  :)



People don't get too old to open Christmas presents, do they?  People aren't too old to blow out birthday candles, are they?  Then I say...get out there and have some fun!  There's no age limit on fun.  If you come knocking on my door and you're dressed up, it's all part of the celebration.  I'll give you some candy.  It's an honest price to see the results of how much time it took someone to get dressed up.  I love it.



The real old fogies are the ones who say that people get too old to go out trick-or-treating.  Lighten up...it's a holiday!  You gonna card everybody before handing out treats?  That's ridiculous. ;)

I personally think that the (unofficial) cut-off for trick-or-treating should be the 8th grade.  Once they're in high school they should be going to Halloween parties.



That said, most teens don't seem to agree.  Every year I get teens of all ages.  At what point/age does it go from being harmless fun to just blatant pan-handling?

It looks great as it is!
But, if you would really like to improve i have some ideas.
Make an eyepatch, very piratey!
More necklaces, maybe gold or chain.
Some stripey stockings, bright colours mixed with black always look great with pirate outfits!
Lots of big chunky rings. Silver, diamond, skulls etc.
Some kind of boot covers. Maybe make something up yourself if you have time.



Thats about all i can think of!
Have fun, you are going to look great!

People who dress up as witches for Halloween don't look like real witches.  They look like characters in movies and books. You can't tell a real witch from anyone else more than you can tell a Buddhist, Atheist, Agnostic, or a Christian.  There is no way to identify a person's belief system and spirituality by looking at them.



There is no rational reason for anyone to mistrust a real witch:

Someone dressed up will be asking for candy, saying boo, and carrying a broom.



A REAL witch will be at home, or with some friends, holding a ritual for Samhain, maybe giving out candy when trick-or-treaters come and snicker to herself when she sees all the 'witches' dressed up.



Real witches are just like everyone else, just most of them follow the Wiccan religon so people think they are 'different.'



Have a nice day!!

every time you open the door to a witch, give them some real eyeballs, if they tell you there phoning the police, theyre not real. if they take the eyes, and fly of on a broom stick laughing, theyre real :) hope this helps :)

Throw them in a river.



If they drown they're obviously toy witches. Emus, or Goffs, or Whickers, or Pageants or whatever they call themselves these days.



If they float they're obviously the real thing and you can burn them at the stake for their ungodly and ways and indulgence in heresy.

just wear all black and cover your clothes accordingly with White tape to make the image that is shown in the picture above.. for the park that comes out of the man, use poster board or styrofoam and spray paint it gold

<question>



I'm baking my usual pumpkin-shaped cake for a Halloweeen costume party and ...?



I was wondering if anyone had any creative ideas on what I can do to the middle of the cake to make it "scary". I've thought of using a red velvet cake for a "blood" look but would like to get a little more creative than that. The outside will have orange frosting, black lines piped on to accentuate the ridges of the pumpkin, and a cone spread with green frosting in the middle of the bundt cake for a stem.



</question>



<additional details>



I'm a 32 year-old woman ... haven't had a report card in awhile. LOL. But seriously, any ideas on the "middle" section of the cake would be great.

How about buying bags of "Gummy Body Parts" that I see at Wal-Mart and putting those under the cake and if the cake has layers then also between the layers? I don't know if they make full-size gummy hands but I picture one of those sitting on top with "blood" oozing out the wrist.

Normally at this time of year my neighbourhood have decorated the front of there houses all hallo-weeny, and i have not seen one house.

Halloween had never been a big event in Britain, just trick or treating. Lately the American idea's of dressing up and having parties had descended upon us maybe it is the credit crunch but there was never much Halloween spirit in the first place.

When I was growing up in the 1950s there was no such thing as Halloween, I guess it's an American import, made more popular by the horror film.
Neither the word Halloween or the date 31 October are mentioned in any Anglo-Saxon text indicating that it was just an ordinary day a thousand years ago.



From the Medieval period (1066 - 1485) through to the 19th century, there is no evidence that 31 October was anything else other than the eve of All Saints Day.



From the 19th Century to the present day, 31st October has increasingly acquired a reputation as a night on which ghost, witches, and fairies, are especially active.
In the year 835 AD the Roman Catholic Church made 1st November a church holiday to honour all the saints. Although it was a joyous holiday it was also the eve of All Souls Day, so in Medieval times it became customary to pray for the dead on this date.

You could go as...



- A ZOMBIE - just use old, slightly frayed, baggy clothes, strips of material and lots of makeup!
- A WITCH - all you need is a black outfit, a cape (can be a trash-can liner!) and a hat (available from pretty much every store right now, or you might just have one lying around the house already!)
- BARBIE - tease your hair into a poofy style, wear lots of makeup and wear pink and white. Move stiffly as if you're made of plastic!
- A CELEBRITY - look through magazines and find a famous celebrity. Then, use your own makeup and clothes to mimic their style. (You might want to write their name on your shirt with fabric paint, to make sure everyone knows who you're meant to be!)
- A CHEERLEADER - easy: wear lots of makeup, a sports shirt, a short skirt, lots of makeup and your hair in pigtails. Carry pompoms! (You can easily make these, using strips of paper and an elastic band)

Frizz out your hair like Kramer from Seinfeld. Smudge eyeliner pencil under your eyes to make dark circles. Walk around with a remote hanging out of every pocket, and tell people you're a "control freak." :)



Get a white trash bag big enough to cut out arm and leg holes. Knot the draw strings off at collar level, so you can't get caught up and choke yourself, okay? :) Fill the bag with enough wads of bubble wrap or newspaper to make it poofy. Tape or staple a few trash items sticking out the top: a soda lid with straw, wrapper from a burger, a couple of sales receipts, etc. Tell people you came as "white trash." :)



Wear some old, holey sweatpants or jeans, and a nice button-up shirt. Button the first button of one side to the second button hole of the other side, or the third, if you can. Straight pin a couple of used dyer sheets, several wads of dyer lint, a few mismatched socks, and a washcloth randomly around on your clothes, and tell people you came as "static cling." :)

The rock star one works. My brother once went as a punk. We found some old pants in his closet and I ripped them at the knees and places and safety-pinned them together. Then he put on a black T-shirt and old leather jacket and we dyed some streaks in his hair and then I used gel to spike it up.



Or you can be a barbie and just wear a dress and heals and fake-looking makeup.



Or a surfer. Hula dancer. Prom queen.



you could literally just throw on any old thing and paint your face whitish with black under your eyes and be "dead". (like dead cheerleader, dead prom queen, dead rocker, dead surfer...etc)

A quick and easy costume is a hospital patient. All you need is  a nightgown or even a sheet with a head hole cut out will do. Put on some pale make-up or put talcum powder on your face to make you look white. Tease your hair so it's wild and crazy. Now, use make-up, and anything else around the house to make blood and give yourself cuts and bruises everywhere. Tada! You have a quick and easy costume.

So far I am thinking "Freaks" "Braindead" "Evil Dead" or "Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers" although that last one might be too racy. It is a college party btw

I did this several times - you've gotta have your hair up - off your neck, and have someone draw (an eyeliner pencil works fine ~ hairspray to set) the Matel trademark: an M in a circle on the back of your neck.  Black tights or leggings, and striped top.  Lots of eyeliner & lip liner.

Isn't Halloween supposed to be about ghosts?



and spooks and haunting,  when the dead rise from their graves?



So whats all this about them looking  like car crash victims, all blood and gore.



In a local shop window there was a display of what looked like a murder with the ghoul brandishing a knife over a women covered in blood.



Not a good idea in this present climate but also way off the beam for halloween I'd have thought.
Then theres masks with blood running down the face, its horrible.  Its meant to be about ghosts not gore

It isn't a holiday..just ingore it. Adults like to play dress up and kids do to. Kids mostly want the candy and it gives them some thing to get excited about. There are however evil forces in the world that love halloween. HAHAHAHAHA

You are correct that the idea was originally ghosts, skeletons, ghouls, devils and such, but people have evolved the holiday into any costume.
I saw some guy dressed up as Barack Obama with tentacle arms at work today.



I imagine we'll see everything from the uncreative zombie guy (Black face paint applied to face for free candy) to John McCain with a Zebra body (Real costume...possibly the creepiest.)



Common costumes:
Sexy nurse
Sexy cop
Sexy hula dancer
Sexy zombie
Sexy devil
Sexy &lt;Insert potentially provocative costume here&gt;
Vampire
Zombie
Barack Obama with tentacle arms
John McCain with a zebra body

i dont think anyone wants to dress up as a carcrash victim
but some people have parties and want something different.



and about the masks with blood

Hey!! Add some "spice" to this costume please!!! ?



Hey, so my bf is so last minute and like always doesnt have money for a costume, and well he's a guy so not much to work with.



I said i could pitch in a few bucks, so he decided to dress in all black and get fangs to be a vampire.



( Easy right?) NO.



We went to the store to buy his fangs and he ends up wanting METAL fangs that cost 31.99



I was like bull. sh**



So anyways,
I told him to be a dead gangster, ( since he already has the baggy pants and tee shirts )



We thought we should put bullet holes and blood stains like he "got shot",



What else could we add to make it more... "official?"



Like.... what more could there be to that?

Is this costume too crazy for downtown austin?



I just turned 21 on tuesday, so this friday (Halloween) will be my first downtown experience in Austin. I hear that some girls tend to get really crazy with their costumes, and I definitely want to fit into that category. lol. I understand that the rules change a little bit on halloween and mardi gras, but I just want to make sure this is alright before I make it all happen:



Well I'm going as a candy corn. I have a witches hat that is black on the inside and underneath the brim, but on the brim and the rest of the way up, it is orange, yellow and white like a candy corn. lol. I won't be wearing a top persay, but I have a little shrug I can put on with it. but the COSTUME costume, i'll just have my nipples covered with orange and yellow pasties. then the bottoms are a yellow, orange and white thong with some cute lace ruffly stuff around the waist. then long orange and white (horizontal) striped stockings, and black platforms
The hat, stockings, and platforms are really the costume, and I would just wear those 3 things if I could (afterparty). basically the idea is I want to look/feel naked

The guys out on Halloween will love your idea. It's not really a costume, it's lingerie with a few accessories added to it. Have you also given any thought to how it could affect you later when/if your pic ends up on a few myspace pages?

Heh, well, the first question you want to ask yourself is if you *really* want that kind of attention, because guys, and I'm a guy so I can speak on this topic, may get the wrong idea about you. Unless it's the right idea, then you have another thing to consider:



Legality. I don't know how lax the cops are in Austin, but if you are planning to walk the streets like that, you could get canned for indecent exposure. Imagine getting dragged down to central booking for that, dressed like that, and some big ugly hairy guys with face tatoos oogling you for that.

Wat is the great costume in hallowen party?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



if you have the time a resources there are many great ideas. The key is to be unique. My friends are going to our halloween party as fredi and jason. You could try going as jigsaw out of saw. all you need is a black suit with a red tie then paint your face white with black around your eyes and red spirals on each cheek and red lips. I doubt that any one would have that. Also check up on the internet for the classic scary movie characters such as the joker from batman etc. the ones everyone have forgotten about. Hope i have helped.

I've heard that when you go trick or treating In the US that sometimes you get to the door and they play a trick on you as soon as the door opens. What sort of tricks do they play? Is it a worry that this sort of thing happens or part of the fun?

Well, why dont you your mum, dad friends and her sister all go together round rawcliffe bridge if thats okay with your friends mum. That way, it will look like ur mum and dad are looking after your friends sis so its wont be embarassing for you.



Or, you could just ask ur mum and dad to lt you go and if the say no, decide whether you want to go with them or not.

Carry around a pink bass guitar.... haha

Travis would be easier...fake tattoos, fake piercing, hat...

Well, it's currently 7:38 am here in Halifax (NS, Canada). I'm going to university for 8:30 until 14:30. Then I'm coming home, having supper, getting ready for about an hour or hour-and-a-half, maybe go trick-or-treating for a bit (if I have time), and then to a Halloween party! I'm planning to look like a sexy pirate, btw. Sort of like Anna from Van Helsing: http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v14/kh... but as a pirate.

Try and get bright blue (if not black) eyeliner and mascara. And put a LOAD of it on. Neon nail varnish, 1 grey leg warmer and 1 black leg warmer. Rip them a little bit/ That's all I can think of for now

1. Make some popcorn and watch totally scary movies in the dark or with candles.



2. Buy or Make an Ouija board and try to contact the dead.



3. Get a scary book or ghost stories online and tell them to your friend, in the candle light!



4. Find some magic spells online, take some candles and your spiritual powers and try to cast some magic.



5. Make some cupcakes and decorate them with orange icing and gummy worms (not spooky, just yummy).



6. Take a walk through a graveyard at night or any haunted places around your town.



7. Take a needle and thread, thread the needle and hold the thread over a piece of paper, that says Yes and No. Let the needle dangle, so it can circle or sway around. Then ask for spirits to guide it and ask questions. The needle should go to the yes or the no. Or... usually if it swings up and down thats a yes and if it swings in a circle, thats a no.

My wife and I are taking our girls 7, 9, 15 out trick or treating and to a not so scary "haunted" gold mine. Lucked out with my teenager, her friends have to go trick or treating with family so she is stuck with us.  I feel like it's safer anyway. I'm glad she doesn't mind her old man and mom dressing up also. Wife and I are dressing up as a witch and wizard couple. No tricks unless someone gives out tooth brushes instead of candy. JK.  Happy Halloween!

Happy Halloween everyone!!! Need some quick advice...don't have much time left, Please read ASAP!?



So I'm going to a few Halloween partys tonight and maybe the bar too....This is what I have for a costume (just the dress and a badge) I have thigh high fishnets and little black heels. I just think that I look like a stripper cuz it's very slutty and short on me..so Im kinda having second thoughts...... (I'm very tall 5'10)
What are some other accesories I could add, how should I do my hair and makeup?? (Im not wearing a helmet with it)

Maybe if you add a matching bag it would draw the eye away from the short skirt. This is a hard dilemma, but a lot of females dress as sluts on halloween, so no worries. This is the one day you can get away with dressing like that so enjoy it.

Hey :)
I think the costume is really nice, i think you should wear the helmet with it lol,, i think it wouldreally pull the costume off! Hmmm i think you should straighten your hair with a few random curls..Black eyeshadow, liquid eyeliner, would look nice but not essential, and mascara. A nice bit of lipgloss, maybe clear, would loo great. :)
Have a nice time at your party!
And Happy Halloween ! xx

I love your costume. Being completely honest i don't think people would care how slutty it is as this is one holiday that girls can dress slutty and other girls can't be bitchy. LOL!



I think you should have your hair slighty wavy, but not over curly.



With the make-up i think you should have smokey eyes - so use grey's, blacks and silvers/whites. Use eyeliner and mascara :)
I think maybe you should make your face slightly dirty - you could use coal if you have any or even eyeshadow would do - so it looks like the just come out of the fire look



Hope this helps! and hope you have fun tonight! :) x

I believe in ghosts because I have no proof that they are not real and I have no proof that they are real; and I believe that it is better to be prepared for the unexpected, and it instills a sense of wonder. So I believe, despite the fact I have nothing to prove it.

I don't know if you could call them ghosts. They are a phenomenon. Strange stories to tell of voices yelling in a house or other building. Of forces pushing and pulling. Of dimensions not our own. You are not crazy, ok? I have a few strange stories of my own to tell or sell.

It's just part of the fun, but every once in awhile there is a screamer.  Some adults answer wearing costumes which can scare the littlest kids.  Mostly, it's just making the yard look scary, which the kids have to pass through before getting to the door for candy.  The kids say, trick OR treat, but they always get the treat.

oh, this ones easy! :) I live in Japan so I know what your talking about.
Wear LOTS of bright colors, lots of fun jewelry. Like big brightly colored, thick bangles and stuff. Lots of bright makeup, accessories. Basically bright colors. And clothes don't necessarily have to match..

Is "Mischief Night" nearly as big as it used to be?



I remember when I was growing up in the late 80's early 90's, we used to look more forward to Mischief Night (Halloween Eve) than Halloween itself. TP'ing houses, throwing eggs.  Remember?  Around my neighborhood, it looks as if things have changed.

I'm guessing not so, I remember when I was a kid my best friends street used to get hit REAL hard, toilet paper everywhere peoples houses egged etc. Nobody ever went on my street because it's pretty busy so even during dead hours of the night there's still a risk that people would come by. But, anyway, now when I go visit her there's barely any toilet paper or eggs anywhere.
