q = V/(2^N - 1) where V is max voltage range and N is number of digital bits, so q would be 5/(256-1) = 1.96 mV.

It goes to the right page . but that has no data because for one thing in the form you are posting you have not included YOUR ref info

e.g.
&lt;input type="hidden" name="item_number" value="xxx-xxxx"&gt; 
There may be more missing,(e.g. price hidden field) it depends on other set-up params, better check fully on the help page

Yes, It worked for me, too. Paypal is in good condition.

But I know what you mean, sometimes when I click some links, the same problem occurs. You have to refresh it. If it still did not work, delete its cookie and reload the page again. To remove cookies, go to the Internet options, then privacy, and delete cookies.

How to resolve this error: Internet Server Error: Module/ Object not found??



There is one site whose database is kept on other domain and it's basically using the database for retrieving the data from the database for its pages. The connecting string which I have used to do the same is:

string Conn = @"Provider=MS Remote;Remote Server=http://www.xxx.com;Remote Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=Access_DB/xyz.mdb;Persist Security Info=False";

this is done on a Asp.net website after doing this the connection is begin created with the server but when the query is executed, it gives the error.

How to get through this problem.

that means the hosting company would need to pay the fees for the domain name being registered with icaan lists etc.. you can buy a domain name for a few quid, and host it from your pc but i wouldnt advise this unless u know how to do IIS and firewall security.



you can google for how to host a website.

One of the best free tutorials for After Affects are these:

Where can I get documentation for the Microsoft C 5.0 libraries?  I know, I know, who uses C anymore.....
If that cannot happen, what is the function to find the first file in a directory?



ffind? findfirst?

Many, many people still use C.  Most programs on Linux (in fact, Linux itself) are written in C.  Though Microsoft C 5.0 is rather old, C itself is still alive and kicking.

There have been several variation on the directory search functions, but I believe that Microsoft C 5 used "_dos_findfirst()" and "_dos_findnext()".

A sample program using them is in the link under "sources" below.

No. IE6 is notoriously bad at PNG's. A fix would require every IE6 user in the world to download it.
If IE6 users are that important don't use PNG's.

I am certain you mean the color of the png background never matching foreground elements?

You can use pngcrush (dos based command line utility) to remove the "gamma" segment from a PNG; which is not needed, but does confuse the IE6 web browser.

Annoying Image & Word Wrapping Issue



I have a frustrating problem, that I just dont understand...

No matter what I do, in whatever program, I just can not get text to wrap around my images. It wont do it in word, my JShop site, my wordpress blog, nothing. Despite them being set to 'word wrap'.



My site designer told me to align the image left or right, and it will work- and even did one himself on his computer to proove it- but it wont work for me. The text line automaticall sits at the bottom of the image, and if I hit backspace it just deletes the image.

Why is it doing this, and how do I wrap around the images?! Its especially frustrating on my blog, as I love text wrapped images, but I just cant do it :(

Tabulating the binary representation of the decimal numbers 0 to 15. ?



could someone help me with the following question

Tabulate the binary representation of the decimal numbers 0 to 15. If this binary representation is then “shifted” (i.e., AC coupled) so that 0 represents –Vdd/2 and 15 represents +Vdd/2, again, identify the “sign bit” and the most significant bit.

Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

0000 +8 * LSB value

0010  +6 * LSB value
0011
0100 +4 * LSB value
0101 
0110 +2 * LSB value
0111 +1 * LSB value
1000  -1 * LSB value
1001  -2 * LSB value
1010  - 
1011  -4
1100  -
1101  -6
1110  - 
1111  -8 * LSB value

Bit 3 (the left most bit) is the sign bit, bit 2 is the MSB and of course bit 0 (the right most bit) is the LSB.

The LSB value would be Vdd / 8, because you only have three bits to express the full range of voltage.

Don't start with Visual Basic; it will create bad habits.  I started with HTML and Python.  I then moved on to JavaScript.  Next, I'm going for Perl and C#.
The more the merrier!

Hope this helped!

At my school, they taught us to use Visual Basic to begin with.  Any good object-oriented language that you can get packaged in a "studio" application will work.  It will be easy to learn and will teach you the basic building blocks that you need to know to start expanding your knowledge into more complicated coding projects.  Of course, unless you are attending a course that provides the software package for free, you will want to go with free, open-source, like some of the ones you mentioned, or Java.  Go get a book on your chosen language and it will start you will the basics and then build up from there.  It will take some time and dedication to actually learn sophisticated programming skills though.  Good luck.

That means the object  $conn is invalid. Better check if the connection is working by adding a line of code "var_dump($conn);" too see if the variable $conn returns as an object or false.

If the $conn returns as an object, there is something wrong with the code, if the $conn returns false, then there is a problem on MySQL (I presume) connection.

You can add a line "echo mysql_conn_error($conn)" after object declaration to check what kind of error you encountered.

Since you are using MySQL PDO, do the following code:

$dsn = 'mysql:dbname=testdb;host=127.0.0.1';
$user = 'dbuser';
$password = 'dbpass';

try {



$dbh = new PDO($dsn, $user, $password);
} catch (PDOException $e) {



echo 'Connection failed: ' . $e-&gt;getMessage();
}

First, I would make the section titles (e.g. OLYMPICS, TECHNOLOGY) larger because they look like they're just floating there.  They should at least be bigger than the headlines so they catch the viewer's attention first... that way the larger, abstract text leads eyes to read the smaller text of the details if they are interested.

I would definitely add more color.  In order to make it optimally visually appealing, I would use a color scheme generator (here's one... http://www.wellstyled.com/tools/colorsch... to pick colors.

I think if you slightly change the background color for each section, it would help a lot.  Maybe even change some text color too.

Also, I think you centered too many elements -- it really brings out a lot of white-space, which gives a "simple" look.  If certain text is important, I would maybe change the color, bold it, make it larger.

If you listen to any of my suggestions, I think the most important thing to do is to minimize white-space.

Otherwise, I have to say, this isn't even close to being the worst I've seen, it's actually rather decent to say the least.

I NEED HELPIN MY FINIALYEAR PROJECT.........please helpme?



I am a FINAL YEAR STUDENT OF ENGINEERING, sir I have a QUERY regarding some technology, actually sir I am making a project and it required for that particular purpose.
Now a days 1 technology is very much common with every TV channel,i.e, “INFORMATION ON CELLPHONE ON REQUEST THROUGH SMS”. Example if I want to have a cricket score than I have to send a request “CRIC ” to 58888 and in reply service provider provides the requested INFORMATION. I want to about this technology, actually I want to configure  this technology in my WEB APPLICATION ie in my project.
Regarding this I have following doubts,
1)what is the name of this technology and how it works.
2)what is the source of this technology, from he where I can have this technology.
3)When a client sends a requests for a INFORMATION,he has to pay a certain amount of money for the service,can you tell me how server used to get the money for that service.

<answer>



I have to venture a guess here:

This is a project aimed towards understanding how the SMS services use their particular services to provide certain information.

If that is correct, then I have to say a couple things in regard to that:

SMS is a form of communication where information is sent via telephone; however, at some point it does go through a computer.  It is a connection to AN internet of cellular phones.

Now with most automated response tools, there is a server of information that is ready at your fingertips, literally!  You send in a query for information using your SMS in the form of the word "CRICKET" to a certain address 58888.  This message is then sent out through a connection via AN internet connection (notice the stress on AN.  There are more than one internets, covering many different mediums).

All this connection is doing is querying a server using some kind of Query Language, the most common now is SQL.  The SQL command searches the through its database and sends replies based upon what it finds for you in the database, at a cost.  Now inside the tables are many different columns, and when you query this database, you get your own little table.  This table will create a new row everytime you query the database.  This information is sent to your service provider as a bill, which is billed to you through your service provider.

This may not be the most exact way it is done, but it is a good idea on how it could be accomplished.  I really hope this helps.  Just remember, a phone is just a simple computer with a speaker, a microphone and a small harddrive.  Treat it like a computer and it makes a lot more sense.

Best of luck,

This is a very generic problem that requires you  to follow the same troubleshooting steps as every other problem. First, make sure it's not a hardware problem. Make sure fans are spinning. Clean out dust. Use memtest86+ to check your memory.

Then, work it as a software problem. Check for viruses and malware. Consider reverting to a backup from before the problem first appeared. Consider an in-place repair install of your OS.

I don't think you've given enough details for someone to give a precise solution to your exact problem.

PHP script runs but the nothing changes in the MySQL database



I have a script which retrieves the details of a record and uses those details to populate a form for users to amend their details.

The following PHP script is intended to accept the details of the form (assuming some but not necessarily all fields will contain amended data) and then direct users to a success notification page.

$conn = dbConnect('admin');



//create SQL



$sql = 'UPDATE gallery_item SET price = ?, short_desc = ?, height = ?, width = ?, type = ?, long_desc = ? WHERE gallery_id = ?';

The script runs without any errors and does in fact direct to a new page.
But when I check the record in the database, nothing has been updated.

I am wondering whether I need to closeCursor() before creating a new PDO object to update the record. Naturally, a database resource was previously created to retrieve the record in the first place.

But where ever I insert $result-&gt;closeCursor() it generates a fatal error.
Fatal error: Call to a member function closeCursor() on a non-object.

<answer>



1. You use a class where it is not necessary (the danger of using classes without knowing what's inside!!)
2. $sql = 'UPDATE gallery_item SET price = ?, short_desc = ?, height = ?, width = ?, type = ?, long_desc = ? WHERE gallery_id = ?';
This query is badly written:
2a. -&gt; set ` price ` = ' " . $phpval . " ' is a sample.  Note the `, ", and ' .
/spaces for clarity.
Writing set "field = ?" has no meaning, unless you want ? to be a string, hence -&gt; "?".
2b. WHERE `gallery_id` = ? is the same thing.  If "?" means "any", use "where 1", if you want a given gallery, use where `galley_id`='".$galleryid."'
2c. You have no limit: this could update every single record in your DB!
2d. Your query ACTUALLY does not run (you do not know what error handling are in the class - IF there are any).

3. Since you have made your $sql (well, after corrections), just make a plain call!
mysql_query ($sql) or die ("My Mistake: " . mysql_error() );
This will show you that you failed to make your query.

4. Finally, you could have written your query:
$sql = "update `gallery_item` set `price`= ' " . $_POST [ ' price ' ] . " ' , ... , where `gallery_id` = ' " . $item . " ' limit 1 ";
mysql_query ($sql) or die...
TWO lines instead of a 100 and a totally useless class...

5.  error here as well:
execute(array($_POST['price'], ...
the expression "array ($_POST" means that "price" is an array... which is not the case (I assume!))

If it's just a certain link on a page you want to specify an exception for, just add an inline style in your HTML code:

&lt;a style="color: #fff;" href="somewhere"&gt;white link&lt;/a&gt;

Inline styles always take first priority in determining the cascading order (followed by embedded style sheets and external style sheets), so it will be exempted from your gray links rule/property.

Hope this helps.

or you can use more general approach and specify a reusable css class:

in the css file:
.my_special_link {



color:#00ff00; /* whatever you need*/
}

.colorized {



color: grey;
}
in the html code:
&lt;a href="..." class="my_special_link"&gt;some link&lt;/a&gt;

you can also overlay different classes in the same html element (same  properties will be overwritten from left to right)

&lt;a href="..." class="my_special_link colorized"&gt;some link&lt;/a&gt;
in this example text color "grey" "wins"

VB.Net: How to Prompt a user to open an excel file from a file browser?



Alright, so this is the last function I need to add to my program...

I need to be able to get the user to open an excel file by opening a file browser window, then set that file as the active workbook. I can open a static file name using:

[CODE]



Private Sub btnLoadFile_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnLoadFile.Click



myExcel.Workbooks.Open("C:\Documents and Settings\TAP\Desktop\Post\Test.xls")



myExcel.Visible = True



End Sub
[/CODE]

I need the user to be able to choose a file though... How do I do that? Thanks alot.

To design flash you need to use Macromedia Flash which has now been purchased by Adobe and is packaged with Adobe CS2 or CS3. Its preety expesnive to do, what I do is use sites like http://www.actionscript.org/movies-categ... it has free flash animations that you can edit. Frontpage is only to insert flash it doesnt actually create the flash for you!

If you just want directories, you can do:

If you want files too, use:

To redirect to a file, just put '&gt; filename.txt' on the end.

Here is the simplest code.

The HTML:



&lt;div class="Button"&gt;&lt;a href="link.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The CSS:



.Button {
width: 120px;
height: 120px;
}

.Button a {
display: block;
width: 120px;
height: 120px;
background: url(images/button.gif) no-repeat top left;
}

.Button a:hover {
background-position: bottom left;
}



make your image of 120 by 240 pixels

the top with one colour and the bottom with a different colour so that you have a perfect 120 by 120 image.

You can do it with a link tag :

&lt;a href="home.html" class="home-button"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;

And the Css :

.home-button:link {



height: 35px;



width: 70px;



background-image: url(home-off.gif);
}

.home-button:hover {



height: 35px;



width: 70px;



background-image: url(home-on.gif);
}

That should do it, but just remember to set the height and width to the size of the image you are using. There is a more detailed tutorial here - http://www.elated.com/articles/css-rollo...

You will find tons of cheap web hosts everywhere! Just search yahoo or google for free web hosting.

If you want free hosting there will most likely be a catch. For example instead of "www.domain.com" you might get "www.domain.************" or something of that sorts. 
The best free domain hosts can be found here http://www.free-webhosts.com/free-domain...
just pick the one that fits your needs.

Other wise search for a cheap host via a search engine.



If you want really good service and great uptime on your website I suggest going to godaddy.com because they are relatively cheap and worth it!

If you plan to do any marketing, avoid Godaddy like the plague. They will suspend your site if there is one spam complaint whether you are guilty or not and they take weeks to sort it out!

There are dozens of cheap hosts. Hostgator is $9.99 a month and if you google Hostgator promo coupon you can usually get a discount on your first month.

Virtually every host has some sort of site building software included in the package.

any hex editor will do the job.

to make an executable from scratch would require an IDE (Intergraded Development Environment) such as Visual BASIC.
Edit, compile, link and execute!!

Exe files from scratch with an editor? You are totally missing the point of what EXE files are about.

Ok, to produce EXE files from scratch people use compilers with IDE, to name a few: MS Visual Studio, Delphi or C++ Builder. And wait, you also need to know at least one programming language. It looks like English but is slightly different.

The second thing you need to know is not all EXE files are all the same. There are 16-bit DOS EXE files, 16-bit NE files, 32-bit PE files and finally 64-bit EXE files. That means you will hardly find an editor that would edit ANY type of executable files (unless it's a hex editor).

Third - an EXE file is a complex structure. There are so many things that could be edited. For instance, Reshacker edits the resource part, and yet there are a dozen of parts left that could also be edited: sections, relocations, import/export, checksums, headers, etc. What exactly do you want to edit in EXE files? With ease?

Fourth - EXE files happen to be compressed with packers and protectors. Packed files cannot be edited directly. Even with the best executable editor ever.

PE Explorer at http://www.heaventools.com is definitely the best one.

You cannot edit an EXE program without access to the source.
Changing 1 hex character anywhere in the file will invalidate header info and will either prevent the file loading or if it does load it will probably crash when it tries to execute the altered hex.

Because 'x' is a static variable so it's common for all objects of your class.

For example:

class MyClass {



public static int a = 7; 
}

public class Main {



public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("MyClass.a = " + MyClass.a);



MyClass x = new MyClass();
x.a = 6;
System.out.println("x.a = " + x.a);
MyClass y = new MyClass();
System.out.println("y.a = " + y.a);
x.a = 5;
System.out.println("y.a = " + y.a);
}
}

output:

MyClass.a = 7
x.a = 6
y.a = 6
y.a = 5

this output is possible only if x is a static variable. But in that case you cannot call it with any object (a or b) you have to use class name to access static variable.



example dentifyMyParts.x = 5;

so the only possible explanation can be typo error.

I purchased an online tutorial from ebay, which I thought would be a video package sent by e-mail. But unfortunately it was only documents, digitally sent, that I could have easly recieved free from google search. The seller did say that it was a PDF document but I did not know that he was going to send me bogus website's that I could have accessed for free. What should I do? Also if I want a refund what should I tell him? Thank You in advance!

You should read listings more carefully.

Paypal specifically exempts downloads / digital media from its buyer protection rules.

eBay's Fraud department does not allow you to protest a sale if you received what was advertised.

You can try filing an Item Not As Described complaint. Click on the Help link in My eBay, then search for "item not as described," which will take you to the relevant form. Be advised that filing such cases frivolously will get you kicked off of eBay.

However, your best recourse is to leave negative feedback. Lots of negative feedback or some in a very short span gets a seller kicked off of eBay.

It seems like your dad's friend is just using a template, using this hosting service:  http://www.trellixsitebuilder.com/

If you REALLY like your dad's friend's layout, the easiest way would be to save the source, and edit the HTML to add your own text and pictures.



If you actually want to learn how to create layouts for web pages, the way to do it is with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

This basically lets you arrange and format HTML elements.

For example, using CSS, you can make it so that all bold text (text contained in &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; tags) on your page are displayed green, without editing the HTML tags.

You can also arrange HTML elements, such as make all tables centered.

This way, you can apply your style sheet to any web page you make, so they look different, without changing the HTML at all, thus a "layout."

Google for CSS tutorials or go to this one:  http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp to learn more.

It is not much use having a domain name unless you have a web site. It is no good having a web site if nobody can find it. The url settings are to tell the registrars DNS servers where your web site is hosted. It will also need to know where your mail servers are.

Are you asking about the Domain Name Server(s) (DNS) settings? They are URLs that connect your domain name to a web site, which may be one you own or for some registrars, a free web site.

If you have web hosting, there should be documentation provided as to what URLs to use for your DNS with your domain name registrar.

Some domain registrars provide additional services. Most of them have online documentation, but if you have questions or are having problems, contact your domain registrar or web hosting support. This might be by email, a form on their web sites, or some provide phone support.

On DOS Prompt -convert a text file in UNIX format to PC Format ?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Gosh.  I'm not really sure how you do it from the DOS prompt.  I used to just use the text editor:

The major differences between UNIX format text files and M$ format are these: DOS and Windoze files use ^z as an end of file marker, while UNIX and GNU Linux use ^d.  Thus, since you use linux in your ID you should just try holding down the control key and pressing d at a terminal window.  It will vanish immediately as you just told it to close.  The other thing is this: Windows programs will generally insert carriage return line feed between lines (^l ^m) while *nix will just inse rt carriage returns.  That's generally why I would just open things in a text editor and save them from there -- let it handle the conversions.  You have to replace ^d with ^z and insert a ^l before each ^m.  I'm not aware of any DOS sed except for djgpp's but if you have one -- I''m certainly no sed master but it would be possible to do it from the command prompt.

var clock as system.clock

----&gt; clock.SetTime = "/11/:24/AM"

That is an object reference, since clock.whatever references to the object system.clock.

clock.SetTime = "/11/:24/AM" &lt;--- the time is the object variable.

You don't need both -- "or" covers the same case as "and" in mysql.  So 
select * from users where first_name like '%Clark%' or last_name like '%Clark%' will return 
Clark Smith
Sandy Clark
Clark Clarkston

Three ways I can think of to search a whole table -- you could do
select * from users where locate('Clark',concat(first_name,last_na... field))
but that's incredibly inefficient, and you have to write all those columns anyway, so you might as well do it like above.

You  could create a view that concatenates all the fields, and search on the view instead.

The other way would be to write some PHP to dynamically generate the query using the information_schema tables.  But that may be more trouble than its worth, depending on what you are trying to do.

in main i have char name[20];

then i have a function which passes ..........int data ,char name)
into a fuction.

my question is i need to copy the string char name into the original struct. i got the data to work but i dont know why mines is not working.  im guessing it would be something like



int strcpy(temp-&gt;make, make);

So presumably you've got a struct like so:

struct foo {



int data;



char name[20];



struct foo *next;
};

then you've got a function like so:

int my_function(struct foo *ptr, int data, char *name)
{



....



ptr-&gt;data = data;



strncpy(ptr-&gt;name, name, 20);



....
}

That's all there is to it.

No, not in general. I know a lot of programmers that have been programming for more the 10 years, although any single programming job will probably last well less then 10 years.



Of course the tools, technologies and languages a programmer uses would go obsolete about every 10 years (if not less), so you have to constantly be learning.

Any career is about 10 years in average and some even less. There's no lifetime career anymore unless your the Pope in the Catholic church.

10 years seems reasonable for a programmer, but that's only average. A programmer can last 20-30-40 years there's no career age limit until his body or mind starts to let go.

The basic purpose of the software is to provide an interface to MIDI devices.  It can send a series of MIDI commands to a keyboard or the general MIDI interface in your computer.  {keyboard here means a synthesizer/piano}  It can also receive MIDI events from a device (most likely a keyboard).  This is probably obvious since you've seen it in action.

Logic can create and edit MIDI files. A MIDI file is just a sequence of events.  Generally each event has channel, note, duration and volume information or some type of meta information specific to the device.  Logic lets you view each channel's events in various formats.

If you connect to a multi-timberal keyboard the various channels can be set to different voices or sounds so one can have, say, a piano on one channel and a bass on another.  Often drums or other percussion is available but you need to know how the notes correspond to the sounds through either a manual or trial and error.

Logic will also allow one to play a set of channels while recording the keys pressed on a keyboard allowing one to create a full song one instrument at a time.

When I played with Logic several year ago I found that some features are very difficult to use without checking with the manual.  The interface is not always intuitive and there are a lot of (computer) keyboard shortcuts.  Just remember that the majority of the views are just different ways of looking at the same sequence of MIDI events.



It sounds like everyone's already been using Logic and you're playing catch up.  I'm envious though:  I never had enough time to really learn how to use it.

Poisoned



It connects to a lot of different P2P servers and they usually have over 600,000 users daily with about billion files online and no ads. Very fast.

Or you can use this
http://mp3google.cn/



Won't have to download any program just type what you want and It goes straight into a media index full of the things you are looking for.

After you have listen to and watch whatever go back to the media index and right click, press "save link as" to your computer and it downloads to your computer. Its a very easy way to get what you want.

Best thing about this is you get to listen or watch before downloading it to your computer.

Its simple. I have been able to download more stuff using this.

I need help with the Excel IF function - can anyone help?



I have a spreadsheet, when a user would type in a number in the cell C2, from 1 to 4 (Through a Data Validation List).



I would like the cell beneath (C3) to change, varying on the number (E.G. If I typed 1 in the cell, the cell beneath would say a number, and if I typed in 2, it would say another number, etc)



Does anyone know how this is achievable?



Thanks in advance :) !

<answer>



The best way is to not use an IF function.  Do this.  On Sheet2, put this in A1:B4
A  B
1 (what you want 1 to map to)
2 (what you want 2 to map to)
3 (what you want 3 to map to)
4 (what you want 4 to map to)



Then go back to sheet1, and put this formula in Sheet1:C3
=LOOKUP(C2,Sheet2!A1:B4)



-- after "want it to display a specfic cell" update --
I would then make the "B" column on Sheet2 point to that specific cell for example:
=Sheet1!D1
Or do what the other poster said with the big, long IF, and replace the text with the cell you want to display (assuming its the D column here



=IF(C2=1,D1, IF(C2=2, D2, IF(C2=3, D3, IF(C2=4, D4, "NO MATCH FOUND" ))))

Because your user input comprises small integers you can do this even more simply using the user input as an index, the formula in Sheet1:C3 becomes

Javascript form processing?



When I submit a form using the get method and it takes to the next html page. how do I access values from the previous page ?



Here's my form from the first page:



&lt;form action="searchResults.html" method="get"&gt;
Search for the database:
&lt;input type="text" name="query" /&gt;
&lt;input type="submit" alue="Go" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;



On the second page, the URL looks kind of like this if I entered 'xyz' into the input box:
file:///E:/Project/searchResults.html?...



How do I access whatever the user entered in the input box?

How do i get a publisher created website to make an external link open in a new window?



I am creating a website using publisher (not the best, I know) but am having trouble getting the links for external sites to open in a new window. I have read the article from windows about how to do it, but it just keeps inserting my own web address at the beginning of the link and, therefore, it doesn't work! This is when I add the HTML code to the Hyperlink, but if I enter it in a HTML code fragment, it doesn't appear on my site



Basically, I have the text 'website' that I want people to be able to click on and it will open a new window with the external website.

I'm aware that there are many websites out there that offer free javascript files which can be inserted into a website to carry out a certain function.



I'm looking for a script that will convert text that is entered into a field. It needs to change certain words, which are specified in the script those words that are not specified should be have specified generic words place n front and behind.



Does anyone know of a good website where I can find a script that would help with the above?

There is no one program for making websites. You need a good editor, a graphics application if you want to create or modify your own images, development tools for Flash if you want to make Flash animations.



I know people who create websites using nothing but notepad on Windows or the vi editor on Unix/Linux. I tend to use a variety of more complex apps. In the end, however, you need to find the tools that best suit your skills and needs.

It depends on several factors, such as your level of knowledge and how far you want to take this. A large portion of web programmers use notepad to program using code, however a lot also use web developing programs to automatically generate large portions of code.



A pretty amateurish and widely used program would be "Frontpage", a far more professional one - "Adobe Dreamweaver".

Adobe Dreamweaver. But personally I prefer building my websites using Photoshop for the images and notepad for the codings. Because when you use web page editors, the codes tend get mixed up and it's quite difficult to debug. But that's just me.



Anyway if you're looking for a great web page editor, then go with Dreamweaver.

If you have no idea how to code HTML/CSS/PHP or equivalent, then you would be better off using a Content Management System (CMS):



Pligg - http://www.pligg.com/
OpensourceCMS - http://opensourcecms.com/



Even a Visual Editor is not going to help you to set up a business web site without knowing how to set up Credit Card secure pages, PayPal accounts, databases, etc..

Is it "sales consultant" job application form that you are applying for?
Then the first question is about how someone with the same job helped you before - so the employer can see that you understand what the job requires.
Second question depends on content that is NOT included here...

I'll try to make it logical...



Imagine your computer is a machine that responds to commands. If you tell it to display a blue box, it will, but you have to make sure you are telling it the right thing. The process in telling the computer commands, and getting the pc to interpret these commands, is called computer programming. There are many different programming languages (HTML, C++, JAVA, JAVASCRIPT) etc.



You write the commands in a word processor (Notepad, Notepad+, Word) etc, using different codes. The many different codes need to be studied and understood before they can be used. Everything is programming when it comes to computing!

I'll break it down even simpler:
A computer is basically a set of electronic switches. When you program your computer, you tell it which switches to flip and when to make it do what you want it to do.
