Should i get braces?



I'm 16 almost 17, female.
I dont desperately need them like my top teeth are fine except for one slighlty prominent 'fang', and only some of my bottom teeth are slighlty crooked.
I'm not a very confident person and i am going to uni feb 2008.
I dont know whether to get them out of the way an done with now cos i myt regret it later, but do you think i'm too old to get them?

I got braces at 21 and I really wish I'd done it earlier!  Everyone notices great teeth - and unfortunately they notice crooked ones too. It was such a boost to my confidence having my teeth straightened, I say go for it!

You're definitely not too old! It doesn't sound like your teeth are too bad, but if they bother you, then get braces sooner rather than later. If you leave it, you might be sitting there a couple of years down the line thinking 'I could have had straight teeth by now...'.

But since you've only got a slight misalignment, weigh up the options - if you get braces, you'll have a lot of metal in your mouth for a couple of years before having your nice straight teeth - is it worth it for such a slight change? It's completely up to you, as it depends on how self-conscious you are about your smile. The best thing to do would be to go to an orthodontist for a consultation - you can see what the treatment options are before making a decision.

All the best with whatever you choose!

IF YOU ARE REALY CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING BRACES ASK YOUR DENTIST TO BOOK YOU AND ORTHADONTISTS APPOINTMENT AND THEY CAN HELP YOU OUT. IF YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO NOTICE YOUR BRACES AS MUCH YOU CAN ASK FOR CLEAR METAL AND CLEAR COLOURS. IF  IT IS REALY BUGGING YOU THAT MUCH I SUGGEST YOU GO TO GET SOME PROFESIONAL HELP.

GOOD LUCK :D

It is better if you can get braces done as early as possible. 
Based on your situation, if you do not like the metal braces on your teeth, there is one alternate solution: Invisalign®. It is a kind of invisible braces. More information can be found here: http://www.todaysdental.net.au/service_i...

Toothache problems help me



I have a toothache at the moment and I just took some paracedamol, how do I make it go away. I sometimes get toothaches and the one I have at the moment is effecting the right side of my mouth, like multiple teeth hurt, a tooth of mine fell out a while ago it was one of the back ones, I dont think it was a molar, the one above it though what should I do?

See a dentist for sure.
Erm the only advice I can give is go see an emergancy doctor or try using hot water bottles, alcohols supposed to help like gargling it in you're mouth - I think its whiskey or.. once my toothache got so bad I put bongela on the tooths gum (babys teething gel) so that it numbed it a little........

to be honest theres not alot you can do until u see a dentist try and get in asap on an emergency appoinment or my doctor when i went emergency drs recomended i took one paracetomol & one ibruprophen at a time instead of 2 of each....that helped!!

Good luck and get well soon, toothaches like the worst thing ever!!!!

It depends. They might put in spacers which separate your teeth so the braces will fit in. You'll have to wear the spacers for about maybe 2 weeks a month at the most. I think they would put the braces on when you get your spacers out.

You'll go for your consult and then it will be between 2-4 weeks before you get them on. You have the consult and work out a financial plan...etc. Then on some occasions you MAY need spacers which will require you to wait even longer before getting the braces actually PUT on.

I have braces right now! they come off in Jan 08! i had my consult in Dec 05 and got them on in Jan 06!! i had to wear spacers to add space to my back molars...so i got those and wore them for 2 weeks PRIOR to getting the braces on :) good luck!

Because you also need to take over consultations for your molds of your teeth and/or your spacers put it.
