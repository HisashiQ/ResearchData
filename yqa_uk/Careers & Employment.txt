The UK is in a very bad situation right now and the last place you should come is here.



All around the world people seem to think this country is the answer to their problems and yet, hundreds of people leave every single day.



For example:Thousands of Polish who have come here over the last few years to work are now leaving because the economy is better in Poland!
You will also find there is a growing number of Brits who will give you a hard time, immigration is seen as a huge problem and some of the answers you'll get on here will give you a feeling for it, expect worse when you get here.



You should seriously look elsewhere.

After 4 years of trial and error, I finally created an income of over 20k per month. Funny thing, it was pretty simple, I just didn't start the right business or have the right information or support. Making money is fun when you know what to do. It is very frustrating when you do not. , if you are serious about making this kind of money I suggest to really go over this resource site. http://homebiznuss.50webs.com

Ive been working for Safeway/Vons for 7 years. I work in the meat/seafood dept. I like what I do, but the grocery business is not like it used to be. I came in just in time but in recent years and contract negotiations, new employees do not get very much. Yeah, you can qualify for benefits which can make a big difference. But the company is not about taking care of you, regardless of the fact that it is a Fortune 500 multi billion dollar company. You still start out at just minimum wage as a courtesy clerk and have to pay Union dues, along with the initiation fee of about $200 (not to be paid all at once). They have what they call "World class service" meaning they have a program where the store gets mystery shopped on average twice a month and you get your own service scores. You have several attributes that you must do and if you miss just one, you missed the shop. You have to greet every customer (whether they are looking at you or not), you must anticipate, meaning you have to ask if they need help, you have to offer to take to an item (you cannot just say "its on aisle 10" and leave it at that). You also must give a parting comment. You cannot just say 'thank you' but you must add something like 'have a nice day'. As a courtesy clerk, you have to offer to take them to their car and thank them by name (this is supposed to be helped out by the checker who sees the customers name on a check or credit card but is not always followed through).  Its all about having to do some serious as* kissing to every customer since you have no idea where or when a mystery shopper rolls in.

I don't see that your personal education should be a factor when looking at selling to students. I would concentrate on how the higher degrees will benefit the students. Focus your attention on the student and benefits of having a higher degree. Some careers only need an associates degree. Most companies look to those with bachelors or masters degrees when they look for those for advancement. In your situation, you can always get a BS. If nothing else it could help your confidence level when talking with these people.

What to do with my job?



I am so indecisive about leaving or not my job. Now i try to explain the situation: I work in the office and a 'm specialist of public relation. I found it very difficult because all the day in my office came so many people and all of them are angry. I have to inform them, explain, justify, help and calm down. I have to work 8 hours a day and than when i go home my little boy is waiting for me. He has his desires, wants me to do almost everything for him. This is normal and i love spending time with him. But i'm so tired (more mental than physically). I don't want to be nervous while i stay near him. In the same time i need my work. We are a family and we need money ( the life with a baby is more expensive then the time i was only with my man). There 4 years that i am doing this job. Do i have to wait and be more patients?!

There will always be stress associated with any job. If the stress becomes so great then perhaps you need to consider making a change. From your post I gather that you are a single mom and need to work to provide for your child. It is difficult taking care of a child while earning a living. I would not leave your job without having another job to go to. If you enjoy your job then you may just consider it a bump and will get better. Perhaps you could give yourself time before going home to get yourself together and relax. You don't want to take the stress of your job home to your family. That can be difficult. Maybe you could stop somewhere and get a cup of coffee or take a walk to relax and unwind before going home. Anything to diffuse the stress would be good.

Should my friend quit her job?



My friend lives and works far away from London and she is not happy about what she is doing and her living conditions or working conditions.



She is also very indecisive about what she wants to do. The nature of her job is a pre-registation qualification year of work after which she will be qualified however she doesnt know if she wants to quit and start again in London or if she should stay on for the year after which she can move is she wants to.



She says she finds it tough and cannot cope with being so far from her social scene in London and she claims she is getting depressed and hates work and home.



What should she do??



</question>



<additional details>



please also take into consideration the current recession. Her industry is not too badly affected by the current trend of job-cuts so there are jobs available if she is flexible

She should stick with it and transfer to another place when she is eligible to move to another location within the company. Coz if she is a good worker and unhappy, maybe there is more to it than she tells you. Maybe the coworkers are part of the reason, maybe the lack of on the job training, maybe she sees she is going to be left out of any chances for growth there. And is embarrassed/afraid to tell you. Surely she went to a lot of trouble to get there and wouldn't want to throw it away.

I think this is nature's test for her to see how badly she wants to be qualified for her job, and how much she really wants to do this.



Right now she's focused on the short-term inconvenience, which of course is very easy to do - since that is what is directly effecting her life right now.



But I think she needs to take some serious time (like at least 3 weeks) to think about this long-term.  I think it'd be worse for her to drop out and then regret it on down the road, and one day say (say 5 years down the road), "Oh I was SO close, I should've finished."



A year is not forever.  It's not long at all.  I went on vacation in September 2007 across country and I can't BELIEVE it's been that long.  It doesn't seem like a year whatsoever.



Like I said, I think she needs to fairly weigh both the short-term and long-term pros and cons.  She's already been dwelling on the short-term.  She needs to take a few weeks to focus on what she wants for herself in the future.



(My two cents:  It would not be worth it for her to invest this much time and effort, only to quit now... esp. not with the economy as it is.)

I have always been a firm believer that our job should be our avocation. In other words I think we should find a job that we can enjoy. After all, we will spend at least 1/3 of our life doing it. On the other hand I don't know your friend or what she enjoys. No one but your friend can decide what is best for her. Since she is having such a difficult time making a decision I will suggest something that might help. Tell her to get a piece of paper and draw a line down the middle. On one side write the pros of staying where she is. On the other side write the cons of staying. Write down everything you can think of in each column. The column with the most reasons makes your decision. You can use this method for any major decision you need to make if you have difficulty deciding what you need to do.

A cover letter is simply a way to briefly introduce yourself to a prospective employer. You summarize your experience and how that may be of value to the employer. You don't need to write a book. All you want is to get an interview. It should not be any longer than 3 paragraphs. Approach it much the same way you would when doing an outline for a paper. Sentences should be short and concise. You need to address the position for which you are applying, your experience and education as it relates to the position. You need to express your interest and ask for an interview. The cover letter should not sound arrogant nor should it sound desperate. State your qualifications, interest in the position and why it would be to the benefit of the company for them to hire you.

Writing application letter:
There are some general rules you should follow when applying for a job and writing application letter, if you follow them you may find yourself in a new job sooner than you think:



1- Research and investigation: try to read between the lines and get a feeling about the person who wrote the ad and the company way of thinking.
2- Language and style: your letter serve only one purpose: to get you invited for a job interview, hence, avoid hackneyed phrases and cliches. you language should be alive and vivid and should attract the reader's attention, spelling mistakes and grammatical or syntax errors and cardinal sins and will almost certainly cause your application to end up in the rubbish bin.
3- Presentation: Give your application a nice look, use only top quality paper, print it out on a laser printer or good quality inkjet, be conservative with colours, when you mail it don't fold it or staple it.
4- Follow up: when you send your job application to a prospective employer, make a note in your diary and keep photocopies of all correspondence, after a week or so, telephone the employer just to confirm that they received your application.
5- The method: there are few basic methods you can use to get your application into the hand of a prospective employer,, E-mail, Fax or by normal mail.
Remember, applying foe a job is like a seduction. Would you fax a love poem to your sweetheart, or would you present it in person? so I suggest to take it by hand, if delivering you application in person is not practical or would be too expensive, consider using a courier service.
All the best, I hope you get the job.

Do states require permission for an employer to run a background check on a minor?



If someone is seventeen does the company have to gain permission? Sixteen? This is if the person already works for the company. The state (if it matters) is Kansas

ALL background checks are covered by federal law,



the "Fair Credit Reporting Act".
the information contained in a background check is gathered by using public information.



a release must be signed for the check to be done and a minor may sign the release, a parent or guardians signature is not required.
however..........very limited information is obtainable for minors.
a release is required for pre-employment or for a current employee.

In general, an employer must gain your consent to do a background check. This can be done a number of ways - including having you sign an application that gives them the right to do a check.  I looked at the KS state site and I did not find anything that spoke directly to this.  However, the state of KS has very liberal laws regarding the availability of background information to most anyone.  I'd check with the KS Department of Labor for the specific answer.

I've been sick off work due to diarrhea, headaches, nauseousness, dizziness and blurred vision. I was signed off work by a doctor for the last 10 days.



I'm suppose to go back to work tonight. (I work nights) And my stomach is still going crazy. I went out yesterday for only 2 hours, and I got 10 times worse. When I got home I burst out crying cause I felt so awful.



My stomach isn't right. Do I take the risk and go in? Or if I still feel the same, should I not go in?

this probably isn't the answer you want to hear (and I'm sorry) but if I were you I would go into work. If you start feeling even worse, people will probably see it when they look at you that you shouldn't be at work, and maybe your boss will send you home, which would be better than yoiu just skipping and he thinking you could maybe not really be sick.

Go for the interview.  Don't call.  It's very easy for them to say "No" over the phone.  They're going to ask you questions, like, "Why should I hire you?"  "What are your best traits?  your worst?"  "Do you like to clean toilets?"  (That's a trick question to see if you are honest.)  Be honest!  Good Luck!

Depending on the position and your age, I would go back about 10 years. If it is an executive position then you may want to go back further. The most important are the last 3 years with most companies. That doesn't mean that going back further isn't important, but they will usually put more emphasis on recent experience.

I ask for information but also for insight since I know that usually there are a lot of intricacies that people dont think about like for instance when people enroll in the military and dont know what they have gotten themselves into. I am interested in social work and criminology. I dont think I would want to be a traffic cop or a paper work cop or maybe not even a jail cop. I would like to work in the community.

Employers put employees where they are needed. You can request a specific job but may not get it due to the needs of the department. You may need to start in a position that you may not really want and then have to request a change as one develops. Requirements vary from one county or city to another. Some require a degree, others do not. You will likely need to go to their police academy for training regardless of your academic background.

If your pay includes reporting tips they don't. If your reported tips and your base wage combined do not equal minimum wage then they will have to allocate funds to compensate for the difference. There should be a federal and state labor law poster somewhere at your workplace that would have all of the information you need.

I'm sure different states have different rules, but I believe in addition to assuming you'll earn tips, an eating establishment can reduce your pay to compensate them for food you're allowed to eat. In other words, a meal at work is part of your pay.

The US minimum wage just became $6.55 an hour this past July. Are local rates actually mandatory...or advisory?



Even so, I grew up in Texas and I didn't start making the actual federal minimum wage until about 8 years or so after I started working and my employers wouldn't have cared a bit who I reported it to; they would have just fired me.



It's probably the same way now in areas where there are plenty of others who are unemployed available.



What's really ouchy is when they tell you that you will be paid one thing, then you get paid a lot less after the job is done. That still happens here in Austin by employers big and small. Gripe and you won't even get those types of jobs.

If you said what role you were being interviewed for it would be easier to advise you. It is likely the questions will not have a right or wrong answer. Your attitude as expressed in your responses will be what influences them most.

Is asking to be fired completely inappropriate....?



... my being at my place of employment is completely pointless... I do nothing all day, and numerous times have asked everyone in the office if I can help them and if there is more that I can be responsible for. This is a small family company, and there is simply not enough for me to do. I am seeking employment elsewhere, but have not gotten an offer. I do not want to quit without another job lined up, however my being here is absolutely pointless.. I do nothing all day. Would it be totally out of line for me to ask him to fire me so I can collect until I do find another job? I can honestly say I do not earn the paycheck I bring home every week... for an employer, what's more worth it.. having someone in office who does nothing and paying them from payroll, or paying out to unemployment?

You are more attractive to potential employers if you are working so beware.  And if you have little to do, you should have time to plan your strategy and think about your next move.



But better still, consider if there are ways to make your existing employment more productive.  You are lucky to have a job!



What about looking for things to do like sorting old files?  That storage room?  You could label and reorganise that.  People aren't going to suggest these things but you can find them for yourself.



Or what about taking evening classes to learn something new, perhaps something that will help you improve your position where you are working?  A new skill or a higher qualification.  It is always easier to upgrade with the firm you are with than to convince a new employer that you are worth taking a risk over.  And a job that demands little from you is an ideal place to be when you are studying as it will be less tiring.



Look at the big picture and take advantage of what you have!

If you get fired, it is very unlikely anyone else would want to employ you. So stay where you are and try to see if there is anything more you can do. Ask your boss, they may not be aware you feel like this. In the meantime, look for other work.

Hi, yes nowadays economics become worse each day, it happen all around the world.



Meanwhile you are looking for another job, perhaps you could try doing home based business, I see lot of people can even make a living from there.



At least it's better doing something while you are waiting, right?

Hi, my boyfriend is a plumber.A lot of his work comes from mates in other trades,they will recommend each other to their customers.
Also happy customers will recommend his services to their friends,and so on.Recommendations have proved more profitable than advertising.
Guess you know that already.
So my feeble suggestion would be ,going back to your satisfied customers,and ask them if they or anyone they know needs any work done.And maybe reward them £50 for every successful recommendation.
Any how I wish you and your mate the best of luck.

Take a tip from all those itinerant people who somehow make a living going from place to place. get yourself some flyers printed up (do your own if you have the computer skills) - make sure you put on your leaflet the skills you have,  a few testimonials from former clients and your address and landline phone number. Decide by walking around your own locality what small building jobs you can easily identify and start calling at people at home. Say you have been doing similar work around the corner and noticed they also have x-issue. Have a ready calculated quote available. It's a start and could lead to other things.

Im Dan Im serving in Iraq right now so I feel your pain on being over worked and under paid. I mean I work 12 hours a day and its usualy high speed all day kinda stuff. But I suggest you try an alternative route, I started this thing like two weeks ago, and I'm already making money. The best part is I dont even have that much time to work at it and its still doing good. You should give this a look.

There is no law which requires an employer to give an employee any certain amount of time off from their job. However, it would be a good idea to have some time off every now and then. The way the economy is right now, I would be happy to have so much work. If you need some time off you should speak with your employer. Most will allow you time off if needed.

Employer says they will not hire a relative. Is that legal?



My brother-in-law would like to apply for the same company that I work for. He's situation is unique as he is military and would have to interview in a place other than which he wishes to relocate to. That being said I asked the question as I posted above and through the chain of e-mails I was then told by HR that we are not longer hiring relatives. Now I feel that I have inadvertently gotten him black listed as even if he applies now they will know who he is. Is this legal? Is this discriminatory?

This is a common situation for many businesses.  Having relatives working together can cause problems, petty jealousies, and feelings of favoritism.  They prevent all this by not hiring relatives.  Being a relative is not a protected class, so it's legal and not discrimination.

Absolutely legal.  And I don't think you fully understand "discriminatory".  Discrimination, in the legal sense, is treating someone differently because of something prohibited by law, like their gender, race, religion or national origin.  There is no law about hiring or not hiring relatives of current employees.

Before you can become an ob nurse, you have to go through the general Registered Nursing Program. OB is a type of nursing. Once you have gone through your general nursing, there are courses that you can take that will allow you to get specialized nursing.  Look for a good school that offers nursing, and then take your general nursing, and then go through the rotations, and that will give you an idea of some of the branches of nursing.

I have been trying to finish college since I got out of high school 4 years ago. I have been to 4 different school in 3 years! I have been to a 40,000 private university (very much regret that) I have been to a 4,000 a semester state school, a 500 dollar community college, and on a free ride to another university. Each on very different from the other stereotypically. I have been trying to get my RN but I have moved around so much due to my husband in the military. Our next duty station is 3 years non deployable and I am SOOO excited I will be able to finish school! I have decided that I will go either go for my LPN or an RN with an assosiates degree (they take less time and I dont want to be dissapointed if I am not able to finish a 4 year). This time I will most likely be going to a community college again to do it. There are options at technical college that you can look into. The bottom line is there isn't a college better than another (I dont care what anyone says) The bottom line is that you are LEARNING! And you WILL learn at any educational institution. Don't do what I did and put yourself in debt at an expensive college! I was told that the money part was not important, that I will make it work, that everyone in college comes out with massive debt,  that my dream was more important...that it will be ok. WELL, no...its not ok if you cant pay off that debt! Its not ok...trust me. Dreams are important to follow, but they do not have to be done carelessly. And yes, you can get a job with any nursing diploma, or level of degree. Consider talking to an adviser from any nursing dept. at a college.

it doesnt matter what program you choose, its what fits your life best that is important. Undergraduates are those that are  freshman-senior. Graduate degree / graduate students is what you get after your 4 year degree, like a specialty or any other continuing ED.



something you can do while in high school is get your CNA license. You can get a job with it. Also, if you do decide to do something like a technical or community college program/2 year degree, they often require you to have you CNA before you begin. You could wait, but you can also get that out of the way now! And even if you go to a 4 year college, where thye dont require you to have it most of the time, getting a job as a CNA could set you up with great references and job experience. Also, if you are a CNA and work as one, MANNNNY times the agency or nursing home you work for has a tuition program where they will send you to college for free to become an LPN, or RN. Many have requirements that you work for them at least 6 months or a year before they will assist you. Its all part of the plan to keep nurses and create more in the field due to the shortage.

You need to be in the RN Program of an accredited school, either community or private. Of course with the community college, you pay less money but more time consuming and patience since it's full time. If you go to a private school, you get weekend studies as short as 18 months but you have to pay more, about $20,000-25,000 for the whole course. After graduating and passing the RN board exam you need to be employed in an acute hospital in their Medical-Surgical floor (MEd-Surg for short) for a year or two before you can be transferred to their specialized floors which are the following: OB, Cardiac Step-down, Ambulatory Care Unit, ER, ICU, etc. There are instances that if you know somebody inside the company, he/she can help you go through the specialty areas faster. Remember, an RN is a 2-year course. A BSN is a 4-year course. Either an RN or BSN can work in the same hospital. Any college that is accredited by the Board of Education is fine. The most important thing to remember is YOU NEED TO PASS THE BOARD EXAM! With an RN degree, you can pretty much work in any hospital and any nursing field you want. With the BSN, it's more of administration and advance managerial positions. With RNs, it's possible also to be the director of nurses in a convalescent or home health companies if you have enough experience in managing staff nurses. I suggest you start as an RN and walk your way up. The lower you start, the more you understand the profession and your accountability and responsibility to the people who are in need of your care.

I too was in your same situation for several months after being made redundant. I tried all the usual internet sites/newspapers and had the same problems finding a job.



What worked for me was actually joining a recruitment agency in my local area, as they work hard to find you a good position (they get paid for it by the company hiring).

You might be trying to go for too higher a position to start of with and you will in turn find that you are one of many trying for the same jobs.



Don't be so proud and try thinking along the lines of any job is better than no job.



The agencies can be a good help as long as you use them in the way that benefits yourself.  Try going for Temp jobs along the lines of what you are used to because this can also help you to get your foot into the door.  I have on many occasions been asked if I wish to be taken on full time.



Things will only get worse if you want to let them get that way.  Therefore don't give up and keep trying.  You will get something soon.

Have you been to the One Stop Center aka Career Center? They have branched all over the US.  All of their services are free; workshops, resumes, fax, copies, job bulletins from all over the US.



Employers sign up with them and they know what type of person that they are looking for. I took an Accounting Class through them, and I had to go to school five days a week full time. All the people in the class are unemployed, and you draw your unemployment benefits.  They send you out on job interviews and the employer knows your true job skills.



I know the feeling of when you are desperate, it shows on your face. Some companies take advantage of people and want to start for less money.

I need some job advice QUICKLY!?



Okay, so I just got hired at this local restaurant on Friday and my first day was yesterday. However, I recieved a phone call last night about a better job offer...a MUCH better job offer. I am making a crappy amount of money right now, but if I take this job that is kindly being given to me (connections, if I don't start immediately it will be passed on to someone else) I will not only recieve a much better pay but benefits as well.



The new job wants me to start tomorrow and I have to work today! Do I just call and tell them, even though I've only worked one day? It's better than them wasting time training me still, right?

If I were you, I would call them in a couple of days to make sure that they did in fact receive your application.  If you get back with them, then they know that you are really interested.  If they do call you, they will more than likely set up an interview with you because they like to meet with prespective employees in person.  When you go in for your interview, try not to be nervous and answer the questions they ask as honestly as possible.  McDonald's should be a pretty easy place to get hired at because they are one of the few jobs that will hire people who haven't been employed anywhere before.  Best of luck and I hope this helps.

CRNA training is very extensive, but once you graduate you are in a pretty narrow setting which is very controlled i.e. monitors, drugs at hand, etc (the OR or similar, giving anesthesia)--while this can be harrowing at times, you are well trained.  Depending on their practice; a PA can be responsible for taking care of and diagnosing a hundred different patients a day with no idea what's going on, doing minor surgery, running code blues etc.  In my book, that can really be scary as well.  So it just depends on what you consider difficult!

From my experience Nurse Anesthetist training is more difficult to get into and more thorough.  Which is harder depends on the setting where you practice.  Many PAs work in rural settings with limited Physician backup.  I believe that this is a very difficult situation for a Physician Assistant to work in, especially fresh out of training.

Probably a Nurse Anesthetist is more difficult. With the wrong amount of anesthesia, you could kill a person.

Getting paid overtime ?



I have a friend that got 14 hours OT on her check and because it was not authorized she is not going to get paid for it can they do that or not. Our work is giving her 14 hours of comp time but we cant use them whenever we want they also have to be authorized.

Yes, they can do that. If she's been told that OT has to be authorized and she went ahead and worked without permission, they have every right to deny her that pay. Otherwise you'd have people showing up randomly every time they wanted a few extra dollars, and the company wouldn't be able to manage their payroll properly.

Did she work late on her own, or did her boss ask her to work late? If so, then it was "authorized". It does not matter if big boss likes it or not. Their issue is with manager who authorized it.



Call State labor board, Totally illegal to not pay her. Often one documented complaint and they will audit employer going back a couple of years.Tell her to keep her pay stub showingthe overtime payment, and then the next one taking it back.

In general, the comp time must equal 1 1/2 times the overtime worked.  For example, if the 14 hours you listed was how much your friend worked, your company must give her 21 hours of comp time.



The Office of Wage and Hour at the US Department of Labor is the agency that oversees pay and overtime.  Check at http://www.dol.gov/esa for more info.

All over time has to be pre-approved by your supervisor. Who authorized her to work these extra hours??



Some companies have a policy that they do not pay $$ for overtime, but they give compensation time off. The benefits have to be based on time and a half off from work.  If she actually worked  10 hours of overtime, then the comp time would be 15 hours off.



Again, it is up to the company went she can use this time. Most companies want you to use the time before the year is over.



I had overtime accurate one time that I took four Fridays off in a row.  The company was low on funds, and the business was beginning to pick up again. We were told in advance  that we would not be paid money, but time off at the same rate(time and a half).

Why do they keep letting you go or you quiting on your own?



I would not be bragging, I would try to find out what behavior is causing this results.



Are you picking a job because of the salary and not how you fit into the job? Money is not everything in life, and when you go home you still have to live with your thoughts.



I know me, and I would never accepted a job working in a small office.  I am a very private person, and I go to work to work and not sit around and talk about my personal life.



I read an excellent book many years ago, and it was called 'How to find yourself and a new job'.  What the message was not everybody can work in the same environment. It listed a series of questions for you to ask yourself honestly.



My personality calls for a job where I can use  my imagination and be creative. I could never be satisfied working on an assemble line. I would be so bored that I probably would fall to sleep standing up working.

I am DEAF myself. I know that many people say that deaf can't do some jobs that hearing people can.



One or two answers were good. the others were off the point, I'm afraid.



I am merely trying to find out jobs that deaf can do that hearing cannot do.



Hearing people can learn sign language and hence work as interpreters.



Working in a 5000 decibel factory, smile, good one.



Any other ideas?

Perhaps.



Typically the loss of a sense, heightens the other senses.



So, conceptually, a deaf person should have (on average) better eyesight, sense of touch, taste and smell.



I'm no expert on what occupations require those assets but a job accentuating those senses would be an example.

I think working in a very loud environment would not bother you like it would bother me.



Sometimes companies turn down people with physical  limitations, but they can't tell you that. You just don't get the job and you feel sorry for yourself.



My ex-father-in-law lost his sight in a train accident.  He said at first he felt sorry for himself, and he would sit around the house all day. Someone told him about the Braille Institute job training program. He learned how to take a bus, go to a job site, go to the department stores, go visit friends in the hospital; all my himself.



The message is we all can do anything if we try and not set limits on ourselves.  Don't let your lack of hearing block you from being the best that you can be.  My ex-boss was 70% deaf and he became an attorney.  NON-HEARNING DOES NOT BLOCK YOUR BRAIN!

I have a coworker problem?



My coworker is off I feel.  When ever she does some thing wrong she point the finger at me.  She makes a mess and said I did it.  She messes up the register and said I did it.  I have proof she did it in all cases so I am covered not to mention the frequency she blames me my supervisor told me not to worry any more.  The other day she began smacking me on my hand and wrist. I asked her why at first she said she was trying to make me bruise ( I bruise easily).  I tried ignoring her.  Then got frustrated and shouted at her Cut it out you are annoying me!  She is now getting written up for that.  She has been told in the past I found out to keep her hands to herself.  I am now a little worried because I she is told one more time and she is fired.  I am also worried because I just bought a new car and don't want anything to happen to it.  There are no cameras where I work and we typically get out of work around 1 am so no witnesses.

Two days ago i applied for a job at McDonalds, i know.. thats about my only choice right now because Im only 15 (yes its legal where i live). This will also be my first real job.



Yesterday i went in the actual McDonalds and asked if they recieved my application, they said they hadn't, so i filled out another application on paper, he said he would give it to his manager the next day when he comes in to work. He also mentioned they just hired a few people, but they will probably be looking for more in a couple weeks.



I really need this job, what do you think my chances are??

I think that you have a pretty good chance. McDonalds hires a lot of people as their first job, so that shouldn't be an issue. You already did a great job by checking in with them. The only thing I would tell you is to check back in a week or so, and see of you can speak with the hiring manager. Make sure you check back at least once a week, so that when they do have a job available, they'll think of you.

The job market is always unpredictable, especially when approaching the concern of an individual (likely inexperience).  I would hope your odds of being hired were as good as anyone else but I would imagine that there may be more out there who are older (one thing employers look at) more experienced (another thing they look at) and maybe even more lucky.  If you need a job I suggest you apply at more than one place.  Don't be afraid to ride your bicycle or walk a distance.  I used to ride my bicycle rain, shine or snow for an hour and a half each way every day to a job.  Good luck!

How Much Does A RN make in California?



Any part of california just want to know the average salary of a registered nurse in california?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It varies, depending on the nursing area and/or years of experience in a particular nursing field. You can earn from $35,000 to 150,000 or more. You can start as a staff nurse in a convalescent or rotating nurse in an acute hospital into a public health nurse, nursing professor or nursing director of a nursing or medical facility. It's basically up to the person how much work he/she can handle to reach your financial goal.

GP= General Practitioner Pediatrician involves working with children



The GP would be easier to get as it is just your regular MD degree. Pediatrician involves getting your general MD first, and then specializing in children.

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



There are 2 different symbols with different meanings dating back to the ancient Greeks.



The rod of Asclepius symbolizes the healing arts by combining the serpent, which in shedding its skin is a symbol of rebirth and fertility, with the staff, a symbol of authority befitting the god of Medicine.



The rod of Asclepius has one snake coiled around a rod.



The rod of Caduceus is more ornate and has 2 snakes coiled around a rod topped with wings.  This more ornate rod is associated with Hermes the messenger, and has association with Trade and Communications.



Sometimes some in and around the Medical community may have mistaken the 2 symbols, and inappropriately use the one with 2 snakes and wings as a Medical symbol, when this is not its original intended meaning.

It is called a "caduceus," or a "winged caduceus."



It is a sign of the god Hermes (Mercury), who is the patron of, and revealer of the hidden (hermetic) sciences. These sciences are for the benefit of all and include the healing arts. This is why they are used as a symbol for medicine.



Another alternate provenance is from the book of Numbers in the bible (chapter 21, verse 8). Here it says to set up an image of a serpent on a pole. Anyone who looks at this serpent on a pole would be spared from the deadly snake bites that were afflicting the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness.

Texas has it correct.  The Two-winged staff is incorrect (and is the symbol of winged Apollo--when you see him he has wings on his feet & carries the staff); and the wooden staff with the single serpent is correct.  It is the symbol of Aesculapius; a very famous Greek physician who was deified.  His daughters were Hygiea (hygiene) and Panacea (also means a cure for all).  His temple is in the Tiber River and it was felt that leaving someone overnight in it would cure them (and snakes lived in the temple as they could not get off the island). You can google both Apollo & Aesculapius for much more info--its pretty interesting.

Misunderstanding from a higher up at work?



There was a technical problem that we need to fix in coordination with an external company.



A higher up said in an email sent to my manger that the external company advised me of the problem (not true), and we need to upgrade from current version to new version of software to fix the problem (not true).
This has made me angry and caused me stress.  I called the higher up on the phone, and explained/clarified the situation to my best ability, but I'm not convinced that he was misinformed.
Tomorrow, I intend to continue working on this to fix the problem, but I'm pretty sure the problem lies with external company.  It will be a challenge to convince the external company that they are at fault.



I'm angry for this misinforming to my higher up that put me in bad light.  Your thoughts/comments/advice?

What Job Should I Take?



As of now I work for my Dad's company. He has always wanted my brother or me to take it over one day, but my brother decided he did not want to work here. So right after college I started to work here, because I could not find any other work at the time. I have now worked here for 5 years. I like the work, even though it can be very stressful. Well, I got another job offer that pays $10,000 more a year...with less stress. I am debating wither or not to take the other job.



My dilemma is that I would like the other job, but do not want to disappoint my Dad since my brother already decided he does not want to take over the company. In the future at my Dad's company I know I will be able to travel more, which I really like to do. I just can't decide between my Dad's company (getting to travel in the future and keeping him happy) or the other company (getting paid more with less stress). Any suggestion would be great?

Can you talk to him about it?  Now that you know how company works, it is very reasonable to go get experience and life somewhere else. If he suddenly got sick, you could come back and step in since you know everything. And someday in the future it may be best for both of you that you take over so he can retire. But he should not expect you to stay there for another 20-30 years just to take over later. Go have a life and come back in the future.



Just talk to him about all this, if he loves you he should understand. And don't make it just about more money, but about the experiences you will get (travel, new ideas about how to run a business, etc).



FWIW, I have never seen more money and less stress, but family issues can sway the balance. Its hard to work for dad, and the stress may be just that you don't know how bad it can be working for someone else (since you joined him right after college). Every job has stress, often different types. The grass always looks greener across the street.

Your temp agency should be trying to find you a new assignment.



In the meantime, see if you qualify for unemployment.  If you liked the job, make sure your boss knows you would like to come back if/when the position re-opens....they may be able to hire you back as a permanent employee.

Yes you can seek unemployment.  Ask your agency to find you another assignment.  If they ask you to not work and wait for the hospital to be ready to take you back, that is wrong. If they don't seem to want to work with you, go to another agency!

Should I stay where I am or move on?



I'm 24, a soon to be MBA graduate (May of 09 I walk) and am on my 2nd job out of college.  I worked 4 and a half years with one company all through my undergraduate which gave me great experience, worked for a marketing firm in NJ (where I live) and was there for a little less than a year (it just wasn't working out, but I did gain great experience and traveled some in my position).  Now I'm with a construction firm in Manhattan and there is an excellent chance of getting laid off come the end of January of 2009.  I really love the company and don't want to leave, but I know if there is an excellent chance that I should start looking for a new job.



I guess what i'm really looking for here are opinions.  If I get hired with a new company before the end of January, should I take the job simply because I'm afraid of getting laid off from my current one?  I would think (especially if the pay is more at the new places hiring me) that I should make the move regardless, but at the same time I am still on the young side and while 4 years at one company, 8-9 months at the next, and now 2 years at my current job isn't necessarily a bad thing, I don't want other employers to think that I can't hold onto a job for a long period of time.  That is not at all my case...I want a career badly and work very, very hard (as all my references would say!)  However, the economy is on nobodies side right now.



Am I just overly worried?  Should I make the move if given the chance?  Any advice is appreciated!  Thanks.

You can be held accountable for any agreement you signed. You should contact the new employer and tell them the circumstances and your agreement with your current employer. They may be willing to wait until you can fulfill your agreement. You should never sign an agreement that you are unwilling to fulfill. They could sue you and possibly your new employer as well if you fail to honor your contract with them.

Yes, they can sue you.  But all they can really sue you for is any costs that you have forced them to incur.  So, for example, if they were to hire a temp to do your job, then they could sue you for the cost of this (and that would be more than your salary, once agency costs are added in).



Would they sue you?  Well, probably not ... if you think about how much their legal expenses would be if they tried to sue you, and how much effort it would be, then it really wouldn't be worth it.



However, it largely depends on which company you're leaving your employer for.  If it's a close competitor, it's likely that they don't want you joining this company while you have so much intellectual property related to them and the industry.  So if this were the case then they'd be more likely to sue you.



Aside from being sued, you also want to think about:
- References - it's likely that they will tell any future employer that you breached your contractual notice period
- Burning bridges - you don't know when you're going to need people in the future.  You may not have any intention of ever returning to that company, but you don't know when you are going to run in certain individuals again

My coworker is off I feel.  When ever she does some thing wrong she point the finger at me.  She makes a mess and said I did it.  She messes up the register and said I did it.  I have proof she did it in all cases so I am covered not to mention the frequency she blames me my supervisor told me not to worry any more.  The other day she began smacking me on my hand and wrist. I asked her why at first she said she was trying to make me bruise ( I bruise easily).  I tried ignoring her.  Then got frustrated and shouted at her Cut it out you are annoying me!  She is now getting written up for that.  She has been told in the past I found out to keep her hands to herself.  I am now a little worried because I she is told one more time and she is fired.  I am also worried because I just bought a new car and don't want anything to happen to it.  There are no cameras where I work and we typically get out of work around 1 am so no witnesses.

Sounds like she might be insecure and behaving in an immature manner.  Use a little psychology despite the problems you hav e encountered with her.  Have a private word, acknowledge the problems you've had but offer to help her if she has a problem and invite her to ask questions when she is unsure of her job.  This might do two things.  Firstly, she may feel less threatened by you and secondly she may begin to see you as a mentor.

The company doesn't set the minimum wage, the federal government does.  It's currently $6.55 per hour.
However, some states do set a minimum wage standards for their states and in the event that the state wage is higher, employees in that state must be paid the higher of the two.
You can check with the Illinois Labor Board.  It should be listed in the state government section of your telephone book.

The national minimum wage is $6.55 I believe.  If people say a restaurant is a great job, they probably make $8.00.



Servers can be paid a LOT lower since they make tips.  I think in Indiana it's $2.13 lol.

it means determining how much credit you should give a customer based on their size and how quikcly they pay their invoices. i suppose you would need to make sure they pay on time, send reminders, try to make the payment terms as low as possible so your company gets their money quicker

<question>



Should I stay where I am or move on?



I'm 24, a soon to be MBA graduate (May of 09 I walk) and am on my 2nd job out of college.  I worked 4 and a half years with one company all through my undergraduate which gave me great experience, worked for a marketing firm in NJ (where I live) and was there for a little less than a year (it just wasn't working out, but I did gain great experience and traveled some in my position).  Now I'm with a construction firm in Manhattan and there is an excellent chance of getting laid off come the end of January of 2009.  I really love the company and don't want to leave, but I know if there is an excellent chance that I should start looking for a new job.



I guess what i'm really looking for here are opinions.  If I get hired with a new company before the end of January, should I take the job simply because I'm afraid of getting laid off from my current one?  I would think (especially if the pay is more at the new places hiring me) that I should make the move regardless, but at the same time I am still on the young side and while 4 years at one company, 8-9 months at the next, and now 2 years at my current job isn't necessarily a bad thing, I don't want other employers to think that I can't hold onto a job for a long period of time.  That is not at all my case...I want a career badly and work very, very hard (as all my references would say!)  However, the economy is on nobodies side right now.



Am I just overly worried?  Should I make the move if given the chance?  Any advice is appreciated!  Thanks.

<additional details>



I work full time (Monday - Friday, up at the crack of dawn, etc.) and go to school (depending on when classes are offered) either at night after work or some of them are accelerated Saturday morning courses that are 4 and a half hours long, and run for 7 weeks total.  I just finished up my 2nd to last one that was a Saturday course 3 weekends ago.  All I have left is my capstone course which starts Tuesday nights at the end of January.

You don't know for sure if you are going to be laid off- yet.  Try to find out if you can if you are going to be laid off.  If the opportunity comes up for a new position, most employers will understand that you want to try and finish out your term at the place you are at.  If they say they can't wait, and you really want the new job, then take it.  But if you love the job you are at, be sure you'll be laid off.  You don't want to leave a job you love for a different one if you don't have to.  More pay is nice but personally, I find job satisfaction to be worth more.  Ultimately you have to decide which is worth more to you.  You are right- the economy is on no one's side right now.  There's no guarantee that a job at the new place will be any better.  Best to find out what will happen with the current one first and go from there.

You are right to be looking for options but you are also worrying yourself too much.  You should always have a plan "B" but don't jump the gun by trying to second guess what may or may not happen.



You are young and will recover from whatever happens in our economy because you have time on your side.  It was the young business men that came out of the depression and made their millions and with your education and drive you will be just fine.



Hang in there and don't worry about what "may" happen.  Take it a day at a time and enjoy life a little while you are able to.



I am old now and I worried myself all through my life and I didn't have a chance to appreciate little things and I didn't even recognize my accomplishments because I was too busy worrying about what might happen and what would I do and so forth.



It is good to be alert but also live in the day you are in and pat yourself on the back and enjoy what you have done and what you are doing also.



Your sound like you have good judgement so go with your gut feelings and always move forward, never looking back at what might have been.  The "if onlys" will drive you crazy.

I presume from what you say that you are doing your MBA at night school?  And that your present employer is not covering the cost or else you would not be free to leave.



If I were in your shoes I would sit tight.  Why?  Because one of two things will happen



1.  The firm you are working for will lay you off.  You will receive help with outplacement and redundancy money from them and your school will put you in touch with new employers.  Employers always take at least a few new graduates to keep their spots on the milk run.



2.  The firm you are working for will keep you on and you will be in a great position to make a good decision as a new graduate in May.



The only risk for you is that the economy deteriorates further and you have a harder time getting work but I think that employers are already factoring in a very slow year next year.



And I think you sound highly employable, stop stressing and have fun!

What career path should I choose?



Here's the scenerio. I had much experience in construction, customer service, managing, and the food industry. Right now I'm my own boss as a sub contractor for construction work cause it pays the best. The economy has slowed the construction business so now I'm hurting for money. I got a family to provide for and need some advice with what direction to go. I got a diploma and was thinking about taking a class in a local college because they got a placement guarentee with a very large airline company around here, but I'd have to get some sort of low paying student job like serving until it's over. Any help anyone?

That means that if you work for the company only 5 months, you'd need to pay them 7/12ths of the cost of the move.  If you work for them for 10 months, you'd pay them for 2/12ths of the move.  That is what 'prorated basis' means.

The information included in a criminal record varies between countries and even between jurisdictions within a country. In most cases it lists all non-expunged criminal offenses and may also include traffic offenses such as speeding and drunk-driving. In some countries the record is limited to actual convictions (where the individual has pleaded guilty or been proven guilty in court of law), while in others it also includes arrests, charges dismissed, charges pending, and even charges of which the subject has been acquitted. The latter policy is often argued to be a human rights violation, since it works against the presumption of innocence (in the sense that it exposes people against whom there is no positive proof of guilt to possible discrimination for their alleged crimes).

Does anyone work for 99 restaurant?  Is it still as bad as when I was there?



I got hired as a manager trainee and ended up quitting after they brought in some trainers from another store.  These 25 yo kids were yelling at everyone and I came close to walking off the line a few times.  The kitchen manager finally got them booted out, but when I saw what the company thought was a "good" cook, I got fed up and found another job.  I was also appalled at how they dumped flour into the fryers all day which made everything from the fryer taste burnt.  Then they would cross contaminate the cutting board in the deli section with raw fish and then cut a sandwich on the same board.



But the thing that was the worst was some of the dumb safety rules, especially having to wear a knife guard just to use a can opener.



The kitchen manager I worked with wasn't bad, but the FOH manager/GM was terrible.  About a month after I quit, the kitchen manager walked off the line even though he was pulling in over $800/week.

Which is a better career, midwife or sonographer?



I am planning to start university in Sept 2009 but I am torn between which course to do. Either midwifery (with the goal to then train as a Health Visitor after a few years as a midwife) OR to train as a radiologist and then branch into being a sonographer ideally to specialise in pregnancy scans and maybe even 4d scans.



I would like to know which one would have the best career opportunities for example, which pays better, better job satisfaction, job availability etc



Thanks in a advance for your help.

Great choices that are more about what you have passion doing.



Midwife/Health Visitor would be great for a person who really cares about others and helping others.



This could lead to Management in a Health Clinic or Hospital.



Radiologist/sonographer are great positions that will help to advance your technical skills but I don't know if you would be rewarded as it is different from the caring and nurturing aspects of midwife/health visitor.



I think you are great to enter into this field, both are okay paying positions but they should be paid more than what they are these days and that is a bit sad.



If your goal is to make more money then health industry is not a good choice unless you are going to be a doctor or surgeon.

Why not take this one step at a time?



If you do not have an undergraduate degree, get one at night school.  That way you don't run up any debts.



Having done that, take a hard look at what Masters programmes that are attractive to you would get you a better job and do the maths before you enroll.



Then you will know whether taking a Masters as well makes sense.  It does not always.

Hi ! With that kind of money coming in on a regular basis you must be living fairly comfortably. My advice would be to stick with it for a while and find some form of spare time home study at very low cost. the distraction of taking the course will make the job you have less tedious. Think it over.

See if your current employer offer tuition reimbursement.  If they do you can go back to school on their dime.  Once they are done paying for your education, you can go find another job that you will enjoy more than your current one.



If your current employer doesn't offer any tuition reimbursement, then you'll have a tough decision to make.  You can either quit your job and apply for financial aid to pay for your education.  Or, you can stick it out with your current employer and make the best of a bad situation and maybe take some night classes on your own dime.



As an aside:  Whatever reason(s) it is you're unhappy with your current employer, you should try to find a way to make it better.  Talk to your boss to see if there's something else you could within the organization that will give you more job satisfaction.  You're getting paid pretty generously for a secretary, I wouldn't just throw that away.  It generally boils down to what will make you happier and what career you feel will be more gratifying.



Hope this helps or at least leads you in the right direction.

What's a good part time evening job?



I'm looking for a part time job that I could work from 7 pm till about 11 pm a few days a week. Right now I work Monday through Friday from 9-30 to 5:30 but need some extra money on top of that because my boyfriend lost his job and we have an apartment together and there's no way I can pay rent with just 10 dollars an hour. Any suggestions on something that I could do during that time frame but not overwork myself?

Waitressing or working at a fast food place are good easy jobs to get real quick that usually don't require too much experience. Waitressing may pay you a little more especially if you are a social person. You could also look at grocery stores as a clerk, bagger, or stocker though I dont think the pay would be as good but I guess it depends.

Was it altered before or after you signed it? If you signed an altered document and knew it was altered, that's just sloppy on management's part but not illegal. If they altered it after you signed it and your copy says one thing and theirs says something else, that is illegal.

A 6 month period when you first start a job is pretty normal.  If you are working out then at the end of 6 months you will have a review and then be officially hired.



The 6 months is (in my experience) a formality put in place to make really bad workers easier to get rid of.

go to most any nursing home and they will train you and pay for the state test to become a CNA.



it takes 75 hours to become certified, 40 hours classroom and 35 hours of clinical work and in Missouri an additional 100 hours of "on-the-job" experience. once you are certified and working you will find many homes will reimburse or pay for your continuing education in nursing.
being a CNA is EXTREMELY hard and often underpaid work but there is no more important and/or rewarding job that can be done.

CNA can be a very hard job, but it will give you some experience, and some headway before you gain experience into become a Registered Nurse. Many areas will allow you to bridge into the RN program if you are a nursing assistant and then have had experience.

Make sure your cover letter is PERFECT. No errors at all. Have someone proof it for you-I always do, because a second set of eyes is great. Make sure you put the name of the hospital on the letter, so it is personalized. If you do not have a name to send the letter to, write:



Dear Hiring Manager:



Your resume needs to be updated and perfect, too. Did you go to school for this? If so, add a copy of your diploma/cert. to the resume and cover letter.



After you send it, wait a few days, call and see if it was received. That is about all you can do at this point.



GOOD LUCK!

There is really nothing else that you need. If your cover letter covers all the important facts then you have nothing to worry about. Sending your resume along was a good choice, this way they will see first hand your experience and determine your abilities.

What are some jobs in the Medical field that dont require needles, blood, operation, etc.?



I am really interested in Pharmacy, but I think about all these other things, like radiology, sonogram, etc.; jobs that don't require blood or needles, which I like. I would like to go to school for Pharmacy, because I love the education behind medicine, but the chemistry part about it is going to drive me away from continuing school.
So I really would like to know what kind of positions are out there in the Medical field that don't have to do anything with needles, blood, operations, fixing bones, etc.
Im not good with any of that.
Please help me. I really want to find that one position I want to pursue.
Thanks.

Pharmacy is good! Make good money also. I would also try medical assistant. That way you are not around the needles thing you just do blood pressure, temps, and all that. Raidology has needles. Like when you have to do an IV to put in te dye and stuff for th CT's or MRI's so you may wantto stay away from that. If you are really interested in Pharmacy do it!!! I just took Chem and it really wasn't that bad. I did it online then just went in for labs. It was actually kind of fun. Have you tried Medical Transcription?? It is cool to! OH.... Physical therapy? you can help people. I don't know, you have to go with what your heart tells you!!! Think about it. They are all great paying jobs!

Veterinarian - although the tests are equally as difficult.  Nurse, although their schedule and training is strenuous (and you have to be able to write), phlebotomists, radiologists, hospital custodian.

You really shouldn't play about a death, especially in your family.  Just say that you have to go to court for a traffic ticket, you need to stay at home to let the repair man in to fix your heat and you don't know what time he's coming, you at some bad take out and you can't stay off the toilet, or my favorite...your boyfriend hit you and your face is swollen and you are too embarrassed to come to work like that.  Not only does this work; but anyone who has ever hated you will now pity you and you get the sympathy of the boss.  Of course if you care what other people think about you I wouldn't use this last one.  Most times people will try their best not to ever ask you about it but there is always one.

If he gets out there and really hits the pavement looking for jobs, it shouldn't take him any longer than a month.  Tell him to go to www.shrm.org, it's a website for HR professionals.  There should be plenty of jobs openings on this site that he could apply for in his local area.

I am now back in school to do something I have always wanted to do and now I have 2 years of school left. It is not worth being unhappy the rest of your life.

I have similar issues and I sympathize with you. It is very hard to find good work from home income. I have been doing surveys for years and the only thing I ever got was a $5 check from a milk marketing company!



All that time wasted!



This has worked for me though it does require an initial investment (100% refundable if it doesn't work for you)  but it really shows you a good way to earn a good income online. I am very happy with it.

Need help with license info?



My question is I was convicted on a petty larceny charge earlier this year and I want to pursue a career in social work, teaching, or something in the medical field. I currently work in the business office of a hospital now. My question is would I be able to get a license with this charge on my record. I am 23 yrs old this charge happened when I was 22. I know I was being irresponsible at the time and I deeply regret it happening even though it should not have happened in the first place. I just want to get past this and move on. What happened with the charge is that me and my friends were playing truth or dare and my dare was to go into the store and take something. It didn't matter what it was but as I was checking out I didnt feel right about it and I was proceeding to put the items back and then the police was there so I never got the chance to put the items back. I don't hang with those friends anymore but I just want t fresh start on life and start my career. I have completed a shoplifters class and paid my fine which was part of my punishment. I have never stole anything from an employer that I am worked for and my previous and current employer can provide great referances. I just need some type of help on what I can do. I will be finish with my undergrad in Finance in March 09 but I am to afraid to apply for a job in that field because of this. Can someone provide some type of guidence?

George W. Bush will become one more unemployed American Citizen come January.



What kind of job can he get that will allow him to support his family.  He was Governor and President and no one is real sure at this point whether he is or ever was qualified for those positions.  So we need to find him a job.  Any ideas?



Adjunct professor is out...not qualified and he isn't good at talking.  let alone preparing a lecture.  He  doesn't have Reagan's knack for confusing people with jokes either.



Administrative anything is pretty much shot...his reputation for nearly bankrupting his 'company' by waging impulsive wars (in spite of the fact that there was a real war to wage) and the fact that he successfully ignored a major financial meltdown for months, precedes him.



What can the man do?  there must be something?  Real jobs I mean. He needs to continue to support his family.

Help with job search - thanx everyone!!!!!?



Hi all,



I had to leave my previous job due to bullying and harrassment, both on professional and personal levels.  It was horrible!!!



I am applying for a new job - but am sometimes terrified at the thought of having this happen to me again, as it did.



What things can I look out for, to make sure that my next job will be in a reasonably okay, non toxic work place.



Any signs, logos?
Or what type of workplaces/sectors are known to have less bullying?
What job types?



(I can put up with and ignore most things...and I know that it happens abit in most work places - i.e. the odd bad apple, but would really appreciate some tips / pointers on this.



Just want to find a job where I can turn up and get on with working.



Thanks ever so much and Happy Bonfire celebrations!!!



Eagle :)))

You need to be a little more specific about harassment and bullying. Some forms of harassment are illegal and should be reported to the person in charge. True bullying generally will not be tolerated by management. and should also be reported. If that doesn't take care of the problem, then consider your future with the company. Find another job then give two weeks notice. Life is waaaay too short.

I've had this happen to me on 2 separate jobs. As you walk through the office, take a look at the other employees' faces. Do they look happy? If you get introduced to someone who works below the manager/director who's interviewing you, ask her questions like how long she's been with the company, etc. Don't ask her directly about her relationship with her upper, but keep a close ear on whether she has any praise for her.

You have the right not to be bullied or harassed in the work place. That happens in High School and below.



I think you need to keep looking until you find that particular job which "fits" you. Everyone fits in somewhere. You just haven't found your niche yet. Obviously, the place you worked at last is not for you. It's only a job. I would just take the experience of it in stride. I wouldn't give it another thought.



It is normal for people to change their jobs often until they find what they like doing in a comfortable job environment. That's how you learn what you like and don't like in a job.



You may want to take a few "personality and career" assessment tests and see where they "suggest" you fit in the job world. They inventory all your skills, aptitudes and interests. It's worthwhile.



I would try doing this first. You may come up with career choices that you haven't thought of. You may be pleased with the various career choices suggested to you. There are "free" tests online. Just type in free career or free personality tests in your browser's search window.
I hope this helps. Good luck.

What jobs are more available?



I am trying to decide on a major. I am 30 so I really don't have a whole lot of time for trial and error. I am choosing between teaching English at community college level, marriage and family counseling, and student counseling. They all sound equally rewarding and the salaries are all about the same. So, I am trying to choose by figuring out which one has the most opportunities, and of course which one is the quickest ( they all require master's degree's but marriage and family requires 2 years of supervised work, which I don't exactly understand) Does anyone have any suggestions on these careers or any other related careers? I really have to decide soon because I am finishing up my associates degree right now and have to choose a school and program in the next month or so. Thanks for your time.

I've looked on the social security administration but it doesn't have the information I need (unless I've overlooked it).



How much will it cost me to get a new Social Security Card?

</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Unfortunately, you still need to start at the bottom of the education.  Your next level would be an RN and that would be either an associates degree (ADN) from a community college or a bachelors (BSRN) from a university.  Depending on your previous education, you may get some credit for some of the pre-reqs but you will not get any credit for the core nursing classes.  Your best bet would be to get your transcripts and have them evaluated at whatever place you are trying for the RN.  Taking Xrays is not part of the RN curricula anyway, so that will not gain you anything in the nursing program. But if you took any gen ed classes etc that might get you a few classes (or more) shaved off the gen classes in the program.

What major do you think will offer me a better and high paying job, Health Administration or Dental Hygiene?



Do you think being a Dental Hygienist is a better, high paying job or do you think getting a bachelors degree in Health Sciences with a concentration in Administration will offer me a better office job. I'm not that interested in working in people's mouth for the rest of my life and I think having a nice office job in the medical field would be a lot better since I'm more of a quiet person and would rather like to deal with paperwork and of course the computer instead of cleaning a patients dirty mouth. I did want to major in Business Administration but these days getting a job in the business world especially with the economy is not such a good ideal. What do you think?

Sounds like you answered your own question.



The Dental Hygienist would have the most immediate pay advantage. However, for a long term career, taking the time to get the BS and working your way up in the medical industry would give you a lifetime advantage.

You will find out soon enough. As soon as all candidates are interviewed, a decision will be made and since you work for the company you will be probably be notified weather or not you were successful. Don"t start asking too early as you will come across as too pushy. In the meantime you need to practice your writing skills, particularly punctuation.

Try major chain hotels and motels They always need night managers and front desk people. Also retail stores open 24 hours. Check on  grocery stores. They usually restock shelves at night. Then there is a fairly good paying night job but you need a car. It's delivering newspapers.. Lastly, fast food delivery like pizza.

It might be hard to find a career that involves ALL your interests and strengths!  However, you might consider becoming a veterinarian--and then being another James Herriot : )  Or, sinc emost charities have some paid employees, you might apply to work on the staff of one of them.  They often publish newsletters, so you could bring more than one of your interests to the job.  And in any case, since you love creative writing and animals, think about Richard Adams and take it from there!

Hey iluv, finding a good way to earn some extra money can be really tough but it doesn't have to be. There are a couple of fantastic membership websites that i am a subscriber of where they show real methods of getting paid money on the internet.



My favourite is this http://wealthonline.notlong.com



It is absolutely perfect for first timers and they start with an 8 week action plan to get you going even if you have never made any money on the internet before.



You don't need any past experience or computer skills either which is why i like it so much because i am a bit stupid when it comes to things like that :-)



So, say hi to me in the user forum when you sign up, my forum name is the same as here.

Surely your parents would appreciate it- not having to pay for everything for you anymore?

You should explain to them that you would like some amount of independence, and that it would not affect your school work. Give them reasonable arguments that could help you to convince them.

Independence.
Spending money.
Maybe you could help them with bills or something.

Explain to them how it would benefit both you and them. It could be about how you will gain experience, gain awareness on spending and saving, financial independence, etc. For their benefit mention what you are planning to do with the money, whether it be for college, or for your prom dress, I'm sure they'll be all for it. =)

I worked in retail for 11 years, have a business management degree, and want to start a new career.  I don't care that much about money, but am more concerned about having "bankers" hours, and want to work close to home.  I have been applying for 3 or more jobs per day in admin, entry-level banking, and entry-level finance fields.  I haven't even gotten an interview.  I wrote a 2 page resume using all the "buzz words" for the jobs I am applying for, and still no luck.  What am I doing wrong?  And please don't send me a link about how I can make a million dollars, cause like I said, I don't really care about money.

It has been very rough out there with the economy, I came from the Mortgage Industry and its almost impossible to find a job in NY where I am. There is Craigs list, career builders,monster, and others...you can just research it online and see what others come up. Just keep looking,some may think we are over qualified and others may think we want more money.I have ran into the same problem..there are also support groups that help people,especially older mature people who have been in the same field and lost their jobs and can't seem to get another.Sometimes,you may look into training for a total other field like medical, for example medical coding, or so much more. I say don't give up,I took a work at home job at www.myhomebusinesspays.com/kmercurio and it has helped me and although I want the 9-5 thing,this is helping me help others either work at home or get health insurance that is desperately needed out there. Good Luck and just keep doing what your doing, or get involved in working from home for a legitimate company like I am, while waiting for another job or maybe train in something else. Best Of Luck

I have a feeling that employers think I'm either underqualified or overqualified, depending on the job.  I had one interview in 3 months for a bank teller, and I was repeatedly asked how I was going to feel in a non-management role with less pay.  Maybe I should try dumbing down my resume a bit.

For starters, it takes time to get calls back.  I'd consider going to a recruiter or temp agency and get your foot in the door with companies that way.



It also sounds like your resume is just too long and not to the point.  Forget the long 2 pages, and skip the "buzz words".  Try to highlight your accomplishments at each position, and what set you apart from your coworkers.  Focus on the skills you have, not how many "buzz words" you can put on piece of paper.  An employer can see right through that crap.

How much do legal assistants earn per year?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



There is no specific answer. It depends on who you work for, and where you work-actual town or city. Larger areas and firms tend to pay more than smaller ones.



Also, "legal assistant" can mean different duties. If you are handling the duties of a paralegal, you will be paid more than if you are doing less complex duties. Some firms use this title for paralegals, while other firms use it as a title for clerical/administrative assistants. It depends on what the firm requires of you.



I have seen paralegal salaries ranging from 30K-80K, and I had an interview for a legal assistant that was paying $10/per hour, because it was handling clerical duties, phones, etc. and helping the paralegals. It had none of the paralegal duties. However, I just saw an ad for a legal assistant that was actually a paralegal job, and it was paying 50K. So, it really varies.

I make money online (for real) and not by just taking surveys. I answer questions for ChaCha. ChaCha is a free text messaging service where customers send in questions and guides look up the answer and send it back as quickly as possible. Generalists/Specialist guides make 10 cents a question for every question that they answer. Once you become a top guide by giving good answers, citing legitimate sources, and answering questions in a timely manner you should be able to make 20 cents a question. You do have to take tests to become a ChaCha guide but they are fairly easy. And you can look up answers for it on some sites, but I suggest just keeping the page they give you to read about ChaCha open in a different tab. Being a ChaCha guide is awesome! There's always questions to answer and some of them are very interesting and funny. You can also learn things you would never learn otherwise!

<answer>



You can become an LPN in about 9-12 months. While some schools offer an Associates Degree LPN program, most of the time you are not earning a degree. You will earn about $14-20 per hour to start, some places might pay a bit more, but almost definitely not more than $25 per hour even with years of experience.



You can be an RN with as little as an Associate's Degree, which is a two-year program, however there are pre-requisite courses in biology, chemistry, etc. which must be completed before you start the nursing courses, so most people end up taking about 3 years to complete the degree.



You can become an LPN first, then take a RN bridge program, which usually takes about another 12-18 months.



Or, you could go straight for your BSN / BAN, a full four year degree in nursing. While both the Associates and the BSN allow you to take your RN licensure exam (same test for either degree option), you are provided with a more well rounded education, and trained in more of a leadership capacity with the BSN / BAN degree, therefore in the long run you will be more eligible for promotions and positions beyond regular bedside staff nursing. If you do the Assoc. program first, you can complete the BSN / BAN later, and most employers offer some kind of tuition reimbursement these days.



In a regular staff nurse position, you will make anywhere from $25-$35 per hour to start, if you hold the BSN degree it might pay about a dollar more per hour. The pay differences with the higher degree only start to kick in if you are in other positions, like supervisory or management. In those positions, you can make $60k per year and up to start.



You can go on to specialize and earn a Master's Degree where you could focus on being a Nurse Practitioner, Clinical Nurse Specialist, Certified Nurse Midwife, Certified Registered Anesthetist, Nurse Educator, etc. You could then go on and earn your Doctorate in nursing and work in research or higher education or other high level administration positions.



Opportunities are endless as far as education and specialty areas.

Occupational Therapy Assistant?



I would like to hear from COTA's on how they like this field.  I have a bachelor's degree in general studies which has gotten me nowhere!  I have always thought about OT, and the one area which really interests me is working in the mental health setting.



Are there a lot of jobs out there for COTA's in the mental health environment?  Please let me know any information you can give about this career, and the different job opportunities and if this is a growing field.



I do have a BS degree, and some people have said that I should just get my full OT degree and not OTA.



However, I want to see if I really like this field first and not spend thousands of dollars AND take more pre-req's, when I can just do OTA right here at a local community college at more than half the price!
Please answer my questions and if you think this is a good field to go into!  I am doing medical coding and billing classes right now, but I have heard that there are no jobs out there without years of experience!!!

What major do you think will offer me a better and high paying job, Health Administration or Dental Hygiene?



Do you think being a Dental Hygienist is a better, high paying job or do you think getting a bachelors degree in Health Sciences with a concentration in Administration will offer me a better office job. I'm not that interested in working in people's mouth for the rest of my life and I think having a nice office job in the medical field would be a lot better since I'm more of a quiet person and would rather like to deal with paperwork and of course the computer instead of cleaning a patients dirty mouth. I did want to major in Business Administration but these days getting a job in the business world especially with the economy is not such a good ideal. What do you think?

I think any administrator makes more $$ than a dental hygenist.  I've heard dental ladies say that their back was thrown out, their hands and wrists worn out and arthritic, and they had to quit doing it.  So 10 years of a not so great okay paying job in peoples' mouths, or a career in paper pushing and management, constantly moving up the ladder, bettter $$.

I am a dental hygienist.  It is definitely the higher paying job, but as far as medical benefits, you might as well forget that.  Most offices are small & don't provide health care.  Also, this is not a job for quiet or shy people.  You have to be quite outgoing & have great customer service/communication skills or you will never make it.  You must be able to put people at ease because no one likes going to the Dentist & many people are afraid, crabby, mean, & winny.  And trust me, you will have to deal with this every day.  I love working with people, but I have been doing this for 5 years & feel it's time for a change.  Just my honest opinion, hope it helps some:)

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



The highest earner depends on how many patients and what kind of insurance you accept. If you have many patients but then 50% are on Medicaid or Medicare, then you're not earning much. However, the specialists actually earn more than the Internal Medicine, Pediatrics and Family Practice doctors because they are the primary doctors who get those patients on Medicaid or Medicare. The specialists tend to accept more private/commercial insurances.  I read from an article sometime ago that the best paying ones are in the Ortho Sports Medicine. Why, well, many, especially kids, gets simple  injuries to major bone fractures or displacements that need major procedures and/or prostheses. I used to work in a peds office and almost every 2-3 days, we had a patient with a fracture because of merely playing in the school grounds. These kids are send by the primary doctors to the orthopedics for further evaluation and intervention. How about injuries in the workplace? Professional football players and the likes? Neurosurgeons or Heart surgeons maybe one of the highest paying but to compare the number of cases they handle, I believe Ortho Sport Medicine has more.

Although you never signed a non-disclosure agreement, that doesn't mean you aren't legally under that agreement. There are laws that protect business in the absence of a written agreement.



Although I am not an employment lawyer, I think it's well within the right of an employer to ask who you are going to. At the same time, you do not have to disclose it but that would make them assume it's a competitor. It's then the employers decision to allow you to work through your notice period or pay you a layoff and walk you out the door. Note; if it's the latter, it doesn't have to be equal to your notice period.



I would have in my resignation without stating who I'm going to. But, naturally, they will ask. Then I would state who it is and see how they react. Worst case, they pay you out and walk you out the door. Oh well. that's the capitalist economy we live in!

you do not have to say where you are going. make sure that you offer 2 weeks notice. just write in your letter that you are leaving for a better opportunity. if you are asked by mgmt. where you are going, just tell them it's a "large, progressive organization" or something generic like that.

Job hopping does send up red flags to other interviewers but one job where it wasn't working out and if you have an explanation about why especially if you were at your other positions for longer periods of time that would be fine.

Slavery was abolished 150 years ago. You can quit any job, any time. I just wouldn't list it on your resume.



Yes, sometimes a job doesn't work out the way we hoped it would. You need to take a hard look at the situation and decide if a change is worth it. Remember, the next one could be worse! And because you left the first one after 4 months, he won't take you back.



It's not easy but if you truly feel that it's not working out for you, then look for another job immediately.

Your feeling guilty. Quit it!  You are an "at will" employee. This means your boss can let you go for any reason or no reason. You have the same option. If the job isn't working out for you then you will have to find another job. But It is easier to get a job when you have a job than it is to get a job when your unemployed. So go find another job and turn in your two weeks notice. If your boss really wants to keep you he might just  start training you. Maybe even give you a raise to keep you at which point you can choose to stay or leave but be ready to do one or the other. Don't play games.

Job interview, and body language. Is this a a good or bad sign?



I went to a interview yesterday, and I thought everything went ok. After the interview they asked me to go and sit in there office downstairs while they were talking. Than they came down stairs, and all 3 were very quite. Is that normal after a interview? Usually with body language you can tell if you got the job.

What happen after they came downstairs, were they just quiet?  Did they say anything or did you guys just stare at each other?



Did they tell you they will be in touch?  Did they say that they have to interview a few more candidates?



Body language will only give you so much information.  If they were quiet, they probably weren't ready to make a final decision.  You should contact them in another day or so.

I wouldn't read too much into that sometimes people are afraid of giving away positive vibes too just in case so they try and act as neutral as possible.  If you feel the interview went well go with that if you did your best and you have the skills you can't do much more

How much does Old Navy pay?



I just got an interview with Old Navy for a cashier position. I am just looking for a part-time job with more hours than where I currently work. Right now I am working at a grocery store at 9.75 per hour to stock shelves. I don't have any cash register experience. My question is would they match my pay if I were to get hired even though its grocery and not retail?

Texas Unemployment Benefits Question - Confusing!?



If I was let go from a previous job (w2) in good standing, immediately took a position where I was (1099) and then was fired for my own fault.  Can a person get fired working for themselves?  How will that affect my unemployment benefits?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You still are entitled to the unemployment benefits.  If you were working at the 1099 job for more than 31 days then you can collect unemployment but if not they will send letters to your W2 employer asking questions.



Unemployment goes by quarters not by days.  You can collect unemployment so don't worry.

What  kind of Job can we find for George after he leaves office.?



George W. Bush will become one more unemployed American Citizen come January.



What kind of job can he get that will allow him to support his family.  He was Governor and President and no one is real sure at this point whether he is or ever was qualified for those positions.  So we need to find him a job.  Any ideas?



Adjunct professor is out...not qualified and he isn't good at talking.  let alone preparing a lecture.  He  doesn't have Reagan's knack for confusing people with jokes either.



Administrative anything is pretty much shot...his reputation for nearly bankrupting his 'company' by waging impulsive wars (in spite of the fact that there was a real war to wage) and the fact that he successfully ignored a major financial meltdown for months, precedes him.



What can the man do?  there must be something?  Real jobs I mean. He needs to continue to support his family.

Do you ask them what their problems are and then explain how you would solve stuff?  That is the best way to win a job.  Extend yourself beyond just interviewing and move to the mode of consultant.  Ask, ask ask about what is going on with their business and find areas where you can make a difference.  Then spell out how you would solve their problems.  Nobody does this but is incredibly effective.  I have hired lots of people and find everyone so passive.  They just answer questions and don't get agressive about how they can help me out.  I am a manager and I can talk all day long about my problems but nobody cares.  I sure wish I could find people who wanted to focus on my concerns by asking questions and then telling me how they can fix my problems.

What is the real reason you even had gone looking for a new job? Is it just the pay? It seems your boss as well as your co-workers are nice people.



If it's the pay, not the place or people, you tell your boss that you really needed extra money and decided to take another job offer. You have enjoyed working for your boss and with your co-workers every day but the economy had taken your priority over the work environment. Thank your boss for being such a great guy and that, if possible, you would like to keep in touch.

You should tell him right away since he is probably going to be doing next week's schedule soon.  I usually just say what is going on.  It's usually good manners to tell your boss you have another offer for more money or whatever and ask them if they'd like to counter it with more money or better hours.



It can be weird though.  I had one manager actually cry when I quit because he knew that the pay sucked where I was and that anyone who was any good got a better job.  I told him I was getting $3/hour more at my new job and that was what he was making as my boss. The place was taking in money hand over fist but paying the cooks crap.

If you can leave it off without resulting in a huge time gap in your career track, then I would do it.  But if you were there for quite a while, then the time between your previous job and the present could invite questions about the gap.  You will need to have an answer to a question about what you have been doing in the meantime.  If you think it will be too difficult to conceal, then I would put it on the resume, but be prepared to discuss why you left.  The description you gave in your question is a terrible answer.  I would say something like, "I had some personal challenges that consumed a lot of my time and I thought it was unfair to my employer until I solved my issues.  Those problems are now all resolved and I'm ready to contribute as I know I can."  Not having experience in a doc's office puts you behind someone who does, but you still got an interview.  There's a good chance that you competition for the job doesn't have the experience either.  If they had a lot of experienced applicants, then you wouldn't have gotten an interview.  Ask about the essential requirements of the job and give specific examples from your past of how you have met those requirements.  You need to answer questions by citing past examples of your experience.  Claiming to be a good learner is not nearly as good as reciting your past success at picking up new tasks.  Give concrete examples.  Good luck!

Be honest and give them the last job info. If you were fired/terminated just tell them you realized you needed to move in another direction are are very excited about the medical office field. Your prior employer can only answer a few basic questions regarding were you terminated? Were you absent or tardy frequently? Was your salary $...? That's it. They cannot volunteer any info. about you - it's the law.
As for medical office work, I tried it and you have to accept that the doctor is the boss and do exactly what he/she tells you. Don't defend your mistakes, just listen and respond positive. Good luck!

Hi,
As already said, don't include things that may go against you but be ready with an answer if they notice there are gaps in your employment record.



Dress business like, prepare some answers of questions that are likely to come up, for example why do you want the job? Don't say because you need it, say positive things like because you have organisation skills and are good with people and you want to apply those to do a good job there (assuming all that is true). Another question might be what can you bring to the job? Detail the skills you have that are relevant and yes by all means say that the specific requirements of the job you are keen to learn.



Good luck,
Bill

Most graveyard jobs are in retail and in small retail operations to be specific.



Drive around your neighborhood after 11 p.m. at night and see who is still open... then you know who has graveyard shifts. Now all you need is to fill out an Application and specify on it that you want the graveyard shift.



It's a hard shift to fill... and chances are you will get an interview soon.

Getting Promoted in The Fast Food Industry?



Ok so, I work for a KFC franchise in Minnesota, but I kinda have a problem.
I'm a shift manager at the store I work at, and I might just be putting not as much faith in myself as i should but heres the situation.
Hourly pay ranges for 6.75 -about 8.00 (Team Members- Shift mangers)
And the Salary Management positions range 25k per year - 50k + depending on store and labor/ food costs (assistant mangersGM's)



All the stores in the district are pretty close like all the GM's talk to each other alot so word gets to our district manager fairly easy.



I recently talked to our district manager about advancing to Salaried assistant manger job, expressing that i would like to go to more of the meetings, and employee improvement and training classes.
In his eyes he talks highly of me to the GM's in the district and all the GM's i know speek highly of me as far as work effort, experience and skills.
I'm just worried because our company is so big that other people most less qualified than me being able to move into that position, because people will gladly drive farther or move for such a big pay increase.
I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips about types of things i can do to secure that im a top choice of being promoted.
The DM told my boss to train me on the things i will need to learn in this new position, but sometimes the followthrough on his end can be scattered.
Tips anyone?

do the math, as a manager making $25000 a year you will be taking a pay cut. salaried managers work 55 hrs a week, and at $25K thats $480 before taxes a week. $8 an hour for 55 hrs is $500 a week before taxes (40 hrs X $8 + 15 hrs X $12 overtime pay). I worked as a manager and NEVER worked the 55 hrs, it was always about 62 hrs plus there was homework. I had no life. here's my tip for you, get a job at a sit down restaurant as a bus person, tell them you would like to learn to be a server. bus people make around $75 a day cash tips plus $3.08 an hour. servers make $3.08 an hour and anywhere from $75 to $300 a day, I average $180 a day and work only 4 days a week! I now have a great life and my managers are working 50 hours a week. non-chain restaurants start managers off at $35,000 a year and work less than chain managers, I have seen 2 servers get promoted to manager this year and they are doing well. my GM makes $95,000 a year and I have another from another location who is 28 years old and is the GM, who started as a backwaiter! get out of fast food, it's a nowhere job, good luck!

Yes, all residents get some form of pay.  Usually a Salary.



Most Surgical Residencies last @ least 5 years.  Some Sub-Specialties can take longer than that.  I thought about a Trauma Surgeon Residency but it was 5 years General Surgery + a 2 year Fellowship.  I want to have kids someday thank you very much!
I'm specializing in Emergency Medicine-love the intensity and that i'm helping when it really counts.  That's a 3 year Residency with a 1 year Fellowship.



When it comes to pay it can fluctuate.  What Specialty & where your working (ie New York, Springfield etc.).

Career quiz? How about volunteer work? You can volunteer in the hospital and have an idea what's going on there. You can also volunteer in the Red Cross, volunteer in the missions for the feeding of the poor, take short classes in the adult school like photography or cooking, or go the library and check out their educational videos. I think hands on experience is a better way of realizing your future profession.

Would you rather work with animals or people? Would you rather see a human being die or watch a dog/cat/bird die on the table in front of you?



They both require a lot of school so maybe the smartest thing to do is volunteer at a vet's office and then at a hospital and see what you enjoy

If you love working with animals then veterinary medicine is for you. However, if you have the passion to help your kind, then be a doctor. It is satisfying that before the day ends a patient will tell you,"Thanks doctor! You're the best!" Don't you think so?

Interview for a Medical Receptionist job, what should i wear?



I'm going for an interview for a medical receptionist job and I was wondering what to wear. I was thinking of a really nice dressy shirt, and dark wash jeans.



As of right now, (Just moved out into my own apartment) I don't have much of my clothes in my new apartment so i'm limited as to what I have to choose from.



I have gray dress pants, and black/white pin-striped dress pants but no shirts that really match!!



Do you think a dark wash jean is inappropriate?? (I'm kind of on the fence about it!)



Thanks!

Jeans are very very inappropriate. You will probably not be allowed to wear them even after you are hired.



Another good way to know what to wear is to go at that office and see what the staff are  wearing. If it is a high end doctor's office then dress  like them, and overdo the formality rather than the other way round.



If it appears more casual then still you need to dress in interview appropriate clothes. You must look like you made the effort to look professional. Clean face, minimal makeup, hair tied up unless its short.



Always give every interview like its your only job offer.



Good luck!

That means if your employer will need to sponsor you if you are a foreign national working in the US. They want to know if you can work in the US without their sponsorship.



My roommate was from France and had that exact visa. He was working for BT in New York and could stay as long as he worked for them. Once he quit it was right back to France with him.



If you're an American citizen put no. if you're not a legal resident put yes. The longest you can stay in the us with out a work visa is 90 days, so you would need your company to sponsor you.

They're asking you if you need a work visa sponsorship. Some employers will sponsor someone that does not live in the country their business is in.



If you are a citizen of that country, check no.



If you are an immigrant or do not live in the country the company is in, check yes. :)

If your schools has an associate in nursing that is all you need to be an RN.



However you could transfer to a 4-year school and get your bachelors in nursing and also be an RN.



You can be an RN with either degree but with a bachelors you wlil make more money.  But, you can start with an associates and then take the classes to get your bachelors while working as an RN too.

As a girl you work at the concession stand, giving people popcorn and soda and all the other goodies, as well as you make the popcorn and the nachos, etc. throughout the day



Or you work at the box office printing the tickets and giving them out to people. Usually the guys are the ones that clean, but the positions can tend to switch around depending on the place that you work at



Different theaters run differently. It's always busy so be prepared to work a lot.It's not one of those jobs where you see people sitting around doing nothing, waiting for a costumer to come along. You're constantly moving. in all, it's a fun and great job that keeps you busy, which is better than standing around doing nothing, right?



since you're young you'll get along great seeing as you'll be working with a lot of other young folks

Depends on your relationship with the owner or manager. You are only obligated to give two weeks. Since they treated you well they probably would appreciate you giving as much notice as possible.  Discuss your leaving with them before handing them the resignation letter. Point out you would be happy to help train your replacement. Also ask them if they would give you a written recommendation. The worst you would hear is no.

There is no labour that states you must give notice of resignation. There is what is called "professional courtesy" and it stipulates that you should give adequate notice commensurate with your seniority and length of service. It's enough noticed that the employer can make arrangements to handover responsibilities to someone else and start a job search for yoru replacement. So if you worked there less than two years and in a non-management role, 2 weeks is fine. If you are a manager and worked there 5 years, then 3 or 4 weeks.

Since you already know you should probably give notice early. It will give them more time to find your replacement. You can either write them a letter and say why you are going to leave or talk to someone in person but I'm pretty sure they will want it in writing. Also you never know if you will run into your old boss somewhere or if you ever need a reference or a job. It's better to build bridges and not burn them.

Is it an actual federal job or a job through a private contractor? If it is a federal job, it can take a while for them to call. There is a process to it, and it can take weeks for them to contact you. You SHOULD get a notice in the mail or by email, saying that they have hired someone else, or you did not make it to the interview process. I have applied for several federal jobs, and it took about a month for them to send an email saying they had chosen someone else.



If it is a private contractor, then you probably should have heard by now, but I have had a couple places call several months after I applied. Sometimes, they take a LONG time to fill the jobs.



You can call, but check the listing and see if they say no calls. Sometimes they do, and in that case, I would leave it be.



Good luck!

If you have some spare time, why not start a home based business and earn some cool cash? With the increased cost of living, food and fuel prices skyrocketing, I am sure you could do with some extra money on the side.  How about owning your very own online jewelry store?

Should I ask off of work already?



Okay...I just got a job at Walmart yesterday. I'm waiting on my drug test to come back b4 I can start. I just realized they'll probably want me to work on Thanksgiving Day, well I ALWAYS have plans that day and it is a really big deal to me and my family. I am married and we have an 18 month old son. Do you think it will be bad of me to ask for that day off right when I start since it is going to be so close? What would you do?



</question>



<additional details>



I honestly didn't want this job in the first place, but I just need some extra money.  It's not like I'd be doing a big part, I'm going to be working in the frozen food section.



I have to take it, working weekends is fine but I have family I haven't seen in 3 years that are goin to be down for thanksgiving.

It won't hurt to ask.  They will not be suprised or feel it reflects poorly on you.  But they may not allow it.  If you had said it during the hiring process you would have had a better chance.  But you are an employee now and you have the lowest seniority.  Are you willing to let the job go for this?  There will be other Thanksgivings.  Have you bought airline tickets already?  That might give you leverage.  Otherwise, I'd recommend planning to work this one.  Ask for Christmas off now!

The real question is how bad do you need or want this job? They aren't interested in what is important to you, your family or how you feel about Thanksgiving. They are only interested in being certain their store is adequately staffed with qualified personnel.  Since your a new hire your asking off will not impress them in the least and in fact may keep you from keeping the job. Thanksgiving will come and go. Your need for a job will stay.

you can and should ask but......................
understand that you have made a choice to work in retail and weekends and holidays are part of the job. when you ask be willing to do extra to make up for it or work a half day.



what are your plans at Christmas? do you expect to ask off again? better get your priorities straight now or don't accept the job (retail may not be right for you).



EDIT: then don't take the job there are thousands of applicants who will actually appreciate a job and will try to be successful at it.

Dressing for interviews (unless you're trying to be a stripper) does not include cleavage and sleeveless clothing. You should ALWAYS wear sleeves and nothing low-cut. That could hurt your chances more than help you. The third one, wiht the tank top under, is ok, but the others I guarantee you won't get a call back. They want a professional, and the other outfits don't say, "I'm professional"

That is my choice, however, you should find a shirt showing less cleavage. You need to dress as conservitive as possible for any job interview. But not too conservitive. Research the dress code for the company.

Wait until the criminal trial is over.  You may be able to sue and get a judgment fairly easily is the guy is convicted since the criminal standard of proof is higher than the civil.  While the judgment may not be collectible, it will be valid for a long time (in NY, 10 years and renewable for another 10) and accrues interest.  You never know what's going to happen in the future.  A judgment may be a handy thing to have in your back pocket.

The laws vary from state to state so your best bet would be to call an attorney in your local area. Most reputable attorneys will discuss this matter with you free of charge.



You are correct though, if this person is 19 years old and obviously nowhere near an outstanding citizen your chances of getting anything in a civil trial would be slim to none. You'd end up spending more in attorney fees than you'd ever see from him especially since it sounds like he'll be in prison for a long time.  There is some good news though.  Depending on the state you live in part of his punishment in the criminal trial may be some sort of monetary reimbursement (restitution) to the victim. That is something you may want to bring up to the prosecutor.

The min. salary is twice the states minimum wage times 40 hours a week. That means you would have to make an hourly wage that is double the minimum wage and you would have to be paid for at least 40 hours a week.



You do the math... make sure they really pay you a salary.
Your pay stub should show 40 hours a week and the equivalent of your "weekly salary" (1/4 of your monthly salary
There should not be a hourly rate on your pay check.



If you ask me... 12 hours a day for 5 days and you get what?
Get all your pay stubs and march into the Labor Court.... your employer has it coming.



Just read that you are a manager... now they are in real trouble. You have an annual salary and it should be min.
twice your states minimum wage times 40 hours a week times 52 weeks = annual salary.



You should run a search on your states Labor Laws - Salary and read up on it  and after that definitely make an appointment with the Labor Court or a good lawyer. They have to pay you back for all the years they cheated you.

He said that he would have another manager their to be a witness. However that other manager is also part of the problem I am having. I know I have to go to the meeting but I did request to have HR present at the meeting.

I'd like to get to a point when comparing men and women in this way becomes as unacceptable as saying that you are better or worse at something because of your race.



Parents, teachers and contemparies emphasise certain skills when bringing up girls, and different ones when bringing up boys. I don't think we should see qualities as being exclusively male or female, but that each individual is a blend of different skills and attributes. This male-female polarised view of life is impractical and outdated. And I'm also not sure it was ever entirely true. Working class women always worked while bringing up the kids and minding the house. The idea of a stay at home mum was a pretty middle class one.



I was brought up with many examples of strong, hardworking, intelligent women around me and I learnt to respect the contribution they made to my family, the wider community and to their work. I know families where the woman had to be both provider and carer because of divorce or death - quite common after the last war. But I also know of a family where the father took on the mother's role after his wife died. Despite everyone saying he wouldn't manage he did and was a brilliant dad to two daughters and now a brilliant grandad.



Obviously there are some physical differences, but strength comes in many forms. My wife might not be able to lift as much as me, but I absolutely know that I would not have been able to cope with child birth like she did.



The stresses of modern society, such as the cost of providing a home, mean that more than ever men and women need to work in partnership. And there can be positive side-effects to this: I've had much more opportunity to spend time with my children and watch them grow - unlike my father, to his regret - because my wife works.



I've seen many positive things change about the workplace because of the increase in women in work, and it's hard to imagine going back to how things were ten or fifteen years ago. Women have so much to offer in a business environment, and we lose so many opportunities because we don't take full advantage of their skills, insights and different working styles. I often wonder how long we can go on pretending that 50% of the population should be paid less or given less opportunities than the other 50% based simply on their genitalia.



But I think that things are changing and I hope that by the time my son and daughter are of working age, they will enjoy equal opportunities based on their skills, drive and goals rather than on their sex.

I am very heartened by these answers. I chose Darran because his feelings most closely mirror my own feeling that, despite physical differences, men and women are the same emotionally and intellectually. Many people said this but Darran's answer pointed us towards a hopeful future.

:-) Excellent answer. I take back what I said to Ashley K about the sexism of Denise's question. Or rather, I think she negated the provocation of her question by picking Darran's as the best.

Interesting... so you really didn't want an honest answer, you wanted a sugar coated "what-if" scenario that mirrored your own belief system.
Just goes to prove how even marginally famous people are not above seeking validation of their belief systems.

Darren and Denise are wrong, men/women are very different intellectually/emotionally. Women, personalise things and approach work very differently to men. Male/Female should compliment each other, not compete. You have removed the need for two sexes at a stroke. You FEEL- men THINK.

Here's my take on Feeling vs. Thinking:  Women are born with more mechanical ability than men so they do things when it feels right.  Men, however, being born handicapped have to think about it. LOL



HJC



Veritas: I think (!) your final statement is laughably inaccurate. If women didn't think, we would have no female scholars and to suggest that men don't "feel" is dehumanising and dismissive of their needs.

You only have to look at the differing attitudes to sex to see that this similarity isn't the case. The majority of women need an emotional attachment before they will sleep with someone, whereas most men feel no such need. Men and women think on different levels, how can they be the same?

That was a terrible answer. With that tone, you could answer every question in the world. Of course women and men are different! It's been scientifically proven.
Why do you people think this is a BAD thing? We should learn exactly, how we're better/worse, and utilize that knowledge.

Answer?  Multi-tasking!
I'm a working mum and still do the school runs, housekeeping, cooking, etc.  Oh yes, the opportunity is there for women to excel, so long as they don't pass the threat of starting/having a family! Why can't the majority have such well rounded views as Darran? Maybe someday!

we all suppose men are the stronger sex, they out live us, they do more work than us a man comes home  wants his dinner,  remote, a beer, then falls asleep watching the box,after a hard day  woman are up for a romp the truth is women,are able to take it all, watch out lads . a silver surfer.

Women should do better than men, they retire at sixty and get a full pension, men retire at sixty-five, getting 260 weeks less pension than women, and men have to pay NHI stamps for that period. This amounts on average to over £30000! and they say it's a mans world.. Les Anglesey

Women are GREAT at talking and nagging. Contrary  to what the "politically correct" might say, they are indeed a breed apart and completely devoid of any capability to understand men.

I wouldn't say it's not fair it's just that men and women are different in a lot of things and we both have skills that somebody else doesn't have so it depends on the person, not on the sex, it depends on who you are.

I think men and women have there own qualitys where they better each other. My partner is my rock in life and i would not be without him, we work together and do not compete to outperform each other. ButI feel quite puzzled as to why most people have said we outperform men by having babies if that is all we can say we are good at! men can outperform women because they can pee against walls then we are hopless at it! Women can do more than have babies but i feel saddened that thats all faith we have in ourselves.

Well it used to be that men were always the better sex at the physical and women were the psycological, but i know quite a few pretty strong girls who could knock a few blocks off someone lol and some who aced at things like boxing, rugby etc... Although men probably are better in the sense that when they fall out, they punch each other and then go down the pub whereas women get really catty and hold grudges, i think overall women are the more rounded sex - we have a bigger pain barrier because we have to deal with more physical struggles (if you know what i mean) for a start!

As you can tell by the posts, women out perform men in being sexist.



For many years now we have had women who have demanded equality, respect and claim that men and women are equal. Over the last 30 years, this has shifted. Degrading men and taking away mens rights has become fashionable. There are now hundreds of double standards in society against men, with women continuing to claim discrimination against themselves. Below is just the tip of the iceberg, although some are a little humorous rather than serious examples.



http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/s/s...



In the US, women are exempt from many laws that would be applied to men, such as sex with children, peeping tom laws, domestic abuse and child abuse, violence towards men, false accusations against innocent people and many more. They also have many government funded special interest groups, such as NOW, health departments exlusively for women when there are none for men, and better funding for cancers than men. Women, in general, also receive less sentence time for equal crimes compared to men.



There are far to many double standards for me to list and explore, but this is another example of where women are better. They are able to ethicly ignore these without feeling guilty. Men have not been able to achieve this.



Women can certainly outperform, but I don't believe many of those areas are anything for women to be proud of given the hypocrisy of the last 30 years.

I needed to earn some extra cash from home and a friend sent me to Your Free Surveys.  I was very skeptical about joining, but I was immediately impressed. I've received many surveys and have earned hundreds of points, cash, and free stuff. All this in just 2 weeks.  My first money I will make over $300.  They even give you $4 to join and have over $20 in surveys waiting on you.  Join for free at  http://snipurl.com/yourfreesurvey

There are a countless number of businesses you can operate on the web. They range from e-commerce sites where you offer a product or service to niche content sites and blogs where you can make money from Adsense or by selling ad space to other sites.  However, to make real money, you should work for yourself.



I started my own online jewelry store about 8 weeks ago and have already made $900 with it.  You don’t need any experience, they ship and process all sales, handle all customer service AND they even give you the website.  It's free and no obligation to get more information.  Just visit the link below.

Good Day, jason,
I know that people are always talking bad about them but I’m making good money from online survey sites.  You just gotta join the right ones….and the right ones are always free.

In need of a personal chef?



Where do i find a personal chef?



i would like to find one to help me learn to cook new recipes ideas. i am allergic to a lot of things including soy, gluten, corn and the list goes on so eating out is not a possibility for me. i am tired of eating the same foods over and over. any ideas? thanks.



p.s. please do not tell me to use the internet for recipe ideas instead. i have done this already and feel a personal chef would motivate me and give me new ideas

Signs of a good interview?



I recently had an interview for a job at a clinic. The interview seemed to go okay, and after the interviewer showed me around the place and said he could train me to use some of the stuff and how it would be a good experience for me. He also told me what the hourly wage was.



However, they still have some other people to interview and will get back to me within a week. Is this a good sign? And should I call them back within a week or let them call me?

you can send him a thank you card...and it is very wise to call persistently, at least every other day. if you annoy them enough, they will hire you.



It shows you like the place and you want that job...if you do not call, they may think you did not like the interview or them...or that you got a job someplace else.

I advice that the registar has made an order dissolving your marriage in the court. The order does not come into the force until onemonth from the date it was made. The date will be 20th of november 2008, if no request for a hearing has been made by your or the other party during that period copy of the order wil be forwarded to yo u when that month has expired. if youhave any questions regaring this order plZ contact  court officer..



But my doubts is as follows.



1) case is in Newzeland- & once the order has passed is there any chance that a partner can put a defence before 20th nove? if so how long will it takes to get finalised...(separated from 2 years) only i should get the dissoultion certificate.if partner will not file any defence with in how many days will get the certificate?

by saying new job, i assume you already have a job.  it's actually the best time to look for a new job when you already have a job.  if you don't have a job, well you have no choice.  will you find one?  perhaps.  will you find one that's better for you and relatively soon?  not as likely with the way the economy and unemployment rates are currently.



point is, if you have a job, stay and it's ok to look at the same time.  but just don't quit to look  and don't quit until you get a new job.  never a bad time to just look. how successful you'll be at finding the right job for you, that's the bigger question.

How should I respond to recruiters?



I've been unemployed for over a year now. I finished a BA in computers. Most recruiters say I have "no experience."



I guess everyone has experience when they graduate, right? *sarcasm*



I sick and tired of them telling me this. The students who graduated with me with the same degree I have and with little/no work experience are all hired in very good positions and companies. I'm not just slacking off at home. I look for jobs every day and when I finally get a phone call, it's just to say how I don't fit in the position because I don't have the experience.



How should I respond in these situations?

When they say you don't have the experience, tell them you're more than capable of learning whatever it is they expect you know.  Tell them your degree in computers somewhat proves you're more than capable of learning and applying the needed skills of any job in this industry.



Put a little more pressure on the recruiter when he tells you you don't have enough experience.  Make him be more specific.  Tell him you'll never get the experience if you don't know what it is that you're lacking.

Police officers and job outlook?



Thinking about switching careers and just wondering if any current or potentially new police officers have noticed any change in job demand because of the current recession we are in.  Specifically, in California, more specifically Southern California. Thanks

There is often always a demand for police officers as they come in go, its a difficult job to get into plus on top of that it is very easy to lose and you are competing with volunteers.

Employee relationship with a client?



I just recently started as an office manager at a pedi clinic...drama already..lol  One of our MA's was sending pics of herself to a patients father's cell phone in bra & panties..wtf...i know....the soon to b ex wife of the father and mother of the patient came in to spk to the dr about the entire situation..states she saw the pics and so did her kids, the kids recognized the MA..have been pts for 7yrs...The dr confronted the MA but...unfortunately got a lil retarded and brought her in when the wife/mother was in the office also...long story short...the MA admitted to sending the pics...said it was her personal business..done outside of the office..got his number outside of the ofc...that no personal relationship occurred...plus that the parents were already separated..told the dr if she fires her...she will sue her, because we have no proof that any wrong doing at work.  Went on to tell the dr she has many lawyers in her family, uhhh...and was yelling at the physician.  The dr contacted her atty who sd, technically the employee is correct and she could have a chance of winning a case against the dr if she goes to the workforce since a relationship could occur outside of work..blah blah blah.  So now what???......We are going to write her up for how she acted, unprofessionally..etc.etc...but...r u serious...they cant fire her??  Any advice would be appreciated

You don't say where you are.  In the US, in almost all states, employees are what's called employees at will, and can be fired without their having recourse as long as they aren't fired due to a legally prohibited reason like their gender, race, religion or national origin.  The docc should talk to a different lawyer, not to HER attorney.  She is NOT technically correct if she's an employee at will.

Thank you, i agree with what both answers said.  Texas is a at will state.  I contacted the texas workforce comission and they confirmed what you stated.  Thanks for everyones answers i really appreciate it.

Any tips for my career path I'm choosing?



Hey all I'm 19 years old and in my 3rd semester at my local community college. I'm half way through my associates in liberal arts and my GPA will be above a 3.5 when I graduate. I've been in many clubs and became an officer for one of them. Also I gained a $1,000 scholarship for tuition there. This is all to make up for my poor SAT score that I got when I finished high school.



I plan on going to SUNY Stony Brook. I plan on getting a bachelor's in respiratory therapy. Also I will become certified to become a personal trainer. After I graduate I might become affiliated with the US Air Force for a few years. (I like the atmosphere on air bases. The large open space. I went to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware with my uncle a few years ago. Air bases are awesome!)



From here maybe I'll either go into a more military career or a strictly health care and/or fitness back up career.



Just wondering if any one out there has some advice or tips on my decision making.



My hobbies:
-playing classical piano (mainly Chopin's nocturnes)
-motorcycles (Buying my first bike,+gear&insurance, I saved up for next spring. Will be a 2008 Kawasaki Ninja 250R)
-I want to learn how to fly a plan

Keep your grades up. You're doing plenty.  I would go for a bigger bike, you'll outgrow the power of the 250 very fast.  If you can, get a Yamaha YZF600.

Thanks for the reinforcement. =)
I actually was planning on getting a Fazer 600 in royal blue =) But is to much $. Maybe in the future. It's going to be my first big investment. The 250 is stylish and nimble. Something to zip around town with lol and explore places.
Thanks again, all the best

In my mind, there are several steps for in my career. First, I have to get a job, no matter bad or good, I have to practice myself and make myself practical and capable, but at the same time, I have to save some money for future use. Then I'd like to consider my own business. Since I have practiced myself well, then I can start the business of my own. Then, the business may be fluctual, maybe successful, whatever, I'll stick to my goals and make my business as successful as I can.



However, this is just a goal. Something really hard is to make your first step and insist on it. I hope you and me can all make that. Good luck.

After 4 years of trial and error, I finally created an income of over 20k per month. Funny thing, it was pretty simple, I just didn't start the right business or have the right information or support. Making money is fun when you know what to do. It is very frustrating when you do not. , if you are serious about making this kind of money I suggest to really go over this resource site. http://homebiznuss.50webs.com

OK, this is a realistic question. Before answering your question, I'd like to ask you a question. Why do you work? I think that an accetable answer is that you have to feed yourself and live on yourself. This is something about money.



So, money or what called a good salary can motivate you.
But, we're living in a pretty modern society now, what we need and want is not just food and drink, but something mental satisfing, I thinkg that would be mental content or something make you think happy and content, such as working hour, working situation and walfare.



After a long time of working hard, you would be tired and want to have a little rest , then appropriate and abundant holidays motivate you.



I hope I've told you something you want.

After 4 years of trial and error, I finally created an income of over 20k per month. Funny thing, it was pretty simple, I just didn't start the right business or have the right information or support. Making money is fun when you know what to do. It is very frustrating when you do not. , if you are serious about making this kind of money I suggest to really go over this resource site. http://homebiznuss.50webs.com

Every single day I work my *** off applying places, and calling them back...with barely any luck.  I've had 3 unsuccessful interviews and I've completely run out of money.  I have bills to pay, and no family to help me out...every friend I had seems to have disappeared.  I'm going to kill myself if I don't get a job soon.

Help! What do you think of this interview thank you letter?



I had an interview this morning for a promotional marketing position and I'd like to send my thank you letter but I thought I'd better get some second opinions.



What do you guys think of what I've come up with? (see below)
Any suggestions?
Thanks so much!
(I've omitted names and such)



Dear Mr. ______:



I would like to thank you for taking the time to interview me today for the ________________ Manager position.



I appreciate the time that you spent discussing your specific expectations for the ________ Manager position.
I am more convinced than ever that I will fit in beautifully as a member of the team and contribute my skills and talents for the benefit of the _________________ program.



I believe that my credentials make me an ideal candidate for the position.
As I mentioned in my interview with you, I have 11 years experiential marketing experience working with more than 100 different products and clients. These campaigns have ranged from local weekend sampling to multi-million dollar nationwide tours.
Over the past eight years of my career I have successfully trained and managed staffs of more than 50 including managers, brand ambassadors, technicians and talent. Being extremely organized with a high attention to detail has allowed me to thrive under intense work loads while being creative and adaptable in an consistently changing work environment.



I look forward to learning of your decision soon. Please feel free to contact me if I can provide any additional information about my qualifications. Again, Mr. ________, thank you for taking the time to talk with me about this exciting opportunity.

It looks pretty good except for a couple of things.  Although they are slightly different, your first two sentences are essentially redundant.  You could either drop one or combine them into one sentence.  I think it's the repetition of "Manager position" at the end of each that is the real problem.



You also have a minor typo in towards the end.  It should be a consistently changing work environment", not "an".



Lastly, I might shy away from using the phrase "fit in beautifully".  It's not bad but something a more along the lines contributing member, outstanding performer, etc.



Overall I'd say it looks very good.

I would say...3! Think about it...you drive around in your vehicle, listening to music...delivering pizza! The only thing stressful can be when its snowing like a B***H and there's 1 foot of snow on the roads, and some idiot won't go to the store b/c he don't wanna drive and orders take out! If they don't wanna drive, why do delivery people??? Or when you can't find where your going and you call the person and ask ?'s and there drunk and can't give good directions and laugh the whole time with loud music in the back ground! As far as talking to people...you knock on the door...say Hello when they answer...start taking the pizza out of the box and say $??.??! Give them their change...and say thank you and have a nice night! They might make small talk while their waiting, but its prolly a simple yes or no answer!



A tip for yah: The more friendly, fast and curtious you are, the better the tip! ( I give my delivery men a $5.00 tip!!!)

There is risk involved as far as being held up at gunpoint over a pizza delivery.  The risk may be greater in metropolitan areas or areas known for drugs.  Talking to people has nothing on the potential for being held at gunpoint.

Getting Promoted in The Fast Food Industry?



Ok so, I work for a KFC franchise in Minnesota, but I kinda have a problem.
I'm a shift manager at the store I work at, and I might just be putting not as much faith in myself as i should but heres the situation.
Hourly pay ranges for 6.75 -about 8.00 (Team Members- Shift mangers)
And the Salary Management positions range 25k per year - 50k + depending on store and labor/ food costs (assistant mangersGM's)



All the stores in the district are pretty close like all the GM's talk to each other alot so word gets to our district manager fairly easy.



I recently talked to our district manager about advancing to Salaried assistant manger job, expressing that i would like to go to more of the meetings, and employee improvement and training classes.
In his eyes he talks highly of me to the GM's in the district and all the GM's i know speek highly of me as far as work effort, experience and skills.
I'm just worried because our company is so big that other people most less qualified than me being able to move into that position, because people will gladly drive farther or move for such a big pay increase.
I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips about types of things i can do to secure that im a top choice of being promoted.
The DM told my boss to train me on the things i will need to learn in this new position, but sometimes the followthrough on his end can be scattered.
Tips anyone?

Dress smart, hair done - nice clothes etc..
Act yourself but not to over the top or other stuff like that.. and ask a waiter/waitress to see the manager and ask him about applying as a waitress. He would ask you to fill in an application form and do so.. and then he's overview it and decide.
If your had previous experience as a waitress that will give you a better chance..

Go to a restaurant and ask to speak with the manager. Inform the manager that you would like to apply for a position with his or her company. He or she may interview you right on the spot or give you an application to fill out.



1.) Show up like you have it together. Don't look like you just got out of bed and threw something on.



2.) Speak clearly



3.) Show interests



4.) Have a resume ready with references.



All you can do from there is try. Don't get stressed out about it. All they can do is say, "No" Then you move on.

When you fill out an application anywhere or any job, never just drop it off and give it to anyone.  When you pick up the ap, ask when the manager or person hiring will be there.



Always give your ap to them face to face so they will get that important first impression of you instead of just looking at a paper.



I strongly suggest you pick a restaurant that offers evening dining with cocktails.  You will receive much better tips and their dinner will be more leisurly.  The fancier the supper club, the more money you will make as tips and could likely have your own busboy.  Tell the manager that you love this restaurant and would love to work there with them.

The way that you can excel in the career of nursing, is by going to school and getting your Registered Nursing Degree. Then when you have this, you can specialize in pretty much any field of medicine that nurses do such as emergency, ob, cardiac, pediatrics and so on.

pp,



to get an hr job you should do MBA or PGDM in hr. Otherwise, you can't get the job as it is very specialized area. Instead you can try admin type jobs. there is a seperate deparment in IT companies for admin and they are also paid like the HR people and its good for girls. Admin jobs include appointing vendors for maintenance, for catering, for ticketing, for arranging travel, in short the overall maintenance of the company.

After 4 years of trial and error, I finally created an income of over 20k per month. Funny thing, it was pretty simple, I just didn't start the right business or have the right information or support. Making money is fun when you know what to do. It is very frustrating when you do not. , if you are serious about making this kind of money I suggest to really go over this resource site. http://homebiznuss.50webs.com

What does a legal assistant do mostly?



I'm thinking of going to law school in a couple of years. How could I obtain a job in the law field while being a psychology major? I know that it may be kinda hard to do without being a pre-law major or in a road to law school program. I have no law firm or law experience at all. So I'm trying to understand if I would be able to get an internship or job in a firm and know how to do the job? Or do they train their interns or college employees?

Getting a job as a legal assistant without law firm experience is almost impossible, IF the firm has you doing complex duties/duties of a paralegal. Legal assistant jobs can vary, depending on the firm. Sometimes, they can be clerical jobs, but often, they require experience and specific skills. In general, you will need to start out as a file clerk, or in another entry-level job. You can get an internship if it is part of a college program. I am in a paralegal program now, and it ends with an internship. That is the only way I know of becoming an intern. I have a BA in a liberal arts field and I am currently trying to find an entry-level job, so I can start building up my law firm experience. I am having a difficult time, even with a high GPA, multiple honors and high-level office experience. I am hoping that once I get more classes completed, I will be able to find something.



You should start checking out entry-level jobs; try Craigslist and your newspapers. There may even be job postings on your campus. There are entry-level jobs out there, you just have to look for them. A lot of them are full-time, so that may conflict with your hours. Just keep your eye open and maybe even send some resumes to local law firms.

A couple questions about becoming a cop in CA?



Specifically in the Los Angeles/Orange County area. How long does it take? What do you have to do? Are there different routes you can take? I ask for information but also for insight since I know that usually there are a lot of intricacies that people dont think about like for instance when people enroll in the military and dont know what they have gotten themselves into. I am interested in social work and criminology. I dont think I would want to be a traffic cop or a paper work cop or maybe not even a jail cop. I would like to work in the community. Do you get a choice?

Temping agencies in Wirral, UK?



Hi, I am looking to sign up to a temping agency. I live on the Wirral, and was wondering if anyone had any experience of signing up to temping agencies in the area. What are the best temping agencies to work for? Is it best to sign up to more than one? I am currently in a permanent job, but am not really happy in it.



Also, what do I need to take with me to the agency apart from a reference (which I also need advice about getting from my current employer - if he knew I was looking for another job, he'll try to persuade me in staying).



I am also hoping to go back to college in September.

Thanks.

You should definitely register with more than one agency, as they will all have different businesses they work with.
Kelly Services have large offices in the Liverpool and that's where many of the bigs one will be based, but they may have customers in your local area.
To register you will need to provide work/academic &/or character references.  You'll also need to provide your passpor or birth certificate and a document with your NI number to prove you have the right to work in the UK (this is  legal requirement across all agencies).

Good luck and happy job hunting.

I was born & raised in the trucking industry. My dad was a trucker so after I had put in 4 yrs in the military I followed in his footsteps & became a trucker also of about 16 1/2 years now. I do enjoy it for the most part, anyways! There are some rules & or laws I would like to change but it's a good profession. Just remember that when you see a trucker & his/her semi, please be grateful for the hard work that is involved because this is a "thankless" job! Without truckers, America
stops!! Without us to bring in all the goods to the towns & stores like 
food for your family, building supplies for your home, clothes for you to wear, regular merchandise for the stores themselves to sell to you, the
cars that you drive, farm & ranch supplies for the country folks, & sand
dirt-gravel-asphalt for the roads & highways, this here nation would

No such thing. A Lawyer is a Lawyer is a Lawyer!  You qualify to be a Lawyer and then, just as Doctors do, decide which field you want to work in - this could be criminal Law. Family Law etc etc

So, what do you need to study?  Law!

How much can you earn?  How long is a piece if string?

Is it difficult?  Oh no, any bottom of the class idiot can be a Lawyer and earn hundreds of thousands a year!



What do you think, of course it is difficult.

What skills do you need to have?  Well Brains will be a good starter. A Law degree would help as well dont you think.

Sorry for the sarcastic answer, it is not exactly a smart question.

What should I do about this?



I had a job interview last Tuesday and was told that I would hear by 5pm if had the job. I didn't hear anything and so assumed that I hadn't got it. However, I got a phone call at 8:45am the next morning saying that I started in 15 mins. Well, bearing in mind that I was still asleep, and the office is a 25 min walk away, that was not going to happen. So I said I couldn't make it. They have since emailed me, asking me to attend another interview this coming Thursday.



However, the agency that I am with (where I got this interview from) have given me a contract that states I have to consent to work more then the legal maximum of 48 hours in a week. Which I don't agree with. 
Also, this will be a 3 month contract, but I already have another 2 jobs that clash with this one, but neither of my other jobs start for a few weeks yet.

So, what do I do? 
Do I go to this interview, say to them that I can only do 3 weeks instead of 3 months?
Or do I not tell them, just leave when I need to and risk being taken to court for the loss that they will suffer (its in the contract)? 
Or do I not go to this interview at all?

Any help will be greatly appreciated guys!!!

Extremely bad form of them to give you 15 mins notice, and they should realise this.
Perhaps go to the interview, but be honest about the amount of hours you are willing to work, and make sure the contract is amended. See how you feel after the second interview, and go by your gut feeling.
Personally, I think it's a bit arrogant of them to mess you around like this..does not bode well for future dealings?

The one thng that stands out to me is that the company cannot legally hold you to a contract that is initially illegal from the beginning. If the contract has you taking part in something illegal it cannot be enforced.



If you look at what you need to survive, I believe that you should let the company know that you have other assignments coming up in 3 weeks, let them choose. You also have the opportunity to create the Life you want, Take control, by choosing what you want and need! They do not own your Life, you do.

Well, Judges make big bucks, so you could always aspire to that, but it would take you years to reach that goal, plus having to be elected to the spot.  Some police departments pay their officers a very good salary, usually the bigger departments in the bigger cities.  But with that big city comes big city crime and you will become a walking target.  You could try for the FBI or CIA, they make fairly decent salaries.  You do need a minimum of a 4 year college degree.



But, having said all that, usually the people that go into law enforcement don't do it for the pay, they do it for the job and what the job means.  The pay, though nice, is secondary.

Yeah, some sort of outdoor guide-- rafting, hiking, something like that. Work in the tourism/hospitality industry-- work as a lift operator at a ski resort or something. You won't make as much without college-- but not terrible.

Should I get a job as an outdoor cleansing operative ?



Basically I will have to walk round with a handcart and a litter picker and pick up all the rubbish in an area. It for 37 hours per week. Im also doing a degree at the moment. The reason I ask is that my mum said i would be the laughing stock of my friends which has really put me off doing it!!

Right you may well be the laughing stock of your friends but any of them with half a brain will realise that it is just a temporary job to put money in your pocket while you complete your education and start your proper career path. I wonder how many of the mockers would be asking for the loan of a few quid!

If i was an employer sifting through job applications from people who had just got their degree and were looking for a job, the fact that you had been prepared to get your hands dirty with a bit of menial work during your Uni time to earn your own money would be a big plus point in your favour!

a good job is one you enjoy going to do each day, that challenges you, that stems from your natural god given abilities and talents and feelings.

it is a job that you dont do for money, or to gain status but that you wish to do, its an extension of your best and you are not in conflict with it.

it doesnt depress you, it enriches you. it offers a life time of stimulation. it has purpose to you and meaning, it allows you to sleep at night, it taxes you mentally, and in the body, it gives rather then takes.

Pay? What's good pay and what's not? (UK)?



basically, i would like to know the pay salaries, and what would be considered a good career and what is not? What would you consider to be normal, and a reasonable standard of living?
the current national minimum wage is £5:52, so this is the lowest and can be achieved with little qualifications.
would £8 an hour be considered good? 
What about £10 an hour?
£12 an hour?
£15 an hour?
£20 an hour?

any advice would be graetly appreciated. For someone who is doing a degree, what should they be ideally earning? If they have a degree, whats the lowest they will earn?

if you say pay salaries a year, could you exlain that to me and how much that works out in an hours pay?
Any additional info would be great!

Thankyou.

How should I go about getting a job in computing?



I'm really good with computers, but I don't have any REAL good qualifications to show for it. I'm in Leeds and i've got a gcse in I.C.T and an as-level in I.C.T  but not any real specific qualifications.



I've got a problem because everywhere I look for training for say web programming and such always cost alot of money and unfortunately money is not what i've got and not really got no one to support me for money.



Also every time I look for jobs on line in I.T and general jobs in computing they always ask for so much and it seems like it's almost impossible to meet their requirements...I'm generally stuck and I need to sort it out, any ideas? It also seems very hard to get my foot in the door.Cheers

In the UK they are really picky about having the right qualifications for gas professionals - you will need to get CORGI registered to be able to work on anything related to gas and this is not negotiable.

However you may find that you can still find work in electricals with this qualification.

Why did you bother spending $20,000 on a qualification without first checking if it would be recognised in your own home country?

With all those qualifications why look for employment?. Such experience is sought by many small businesses, and those wanting to start up, therefore your best option is to go self employed.
 Spend a little money advertising in a few trade papers, or magazines.



Have some business cards printed and spread them around, then you will be earning real money. Self assessment tax payers are another group that would use your expertise.
 Go to it, and join the rich, and on to the mega-rich.

<question>



Employment rights......?



I was first employed by my company as a receptionist, and have since been promoted to accounts assistant, in April. There is a small acounts team of 8 people. Since moving over I have recieved most of my training from a friend of mine, who is also employed as accounts assistant and has been here for 2 years next week.

After a few weeks of me being here, this girl started to recieve emails from the boss complaining about the accounts departments performance as a whole, but the email was only sent to her, and HR was copied in. She felt like she was being victimised at the time.

Now she has recieved a letter warning her that she is at risk of redundancy and that she will be contacted by HR soon.

If they make her redundant before she has been here 2 years will she lose redundancy pay?

Also can they justify making her redundant when they have taken on me, we have the same job title and do similar things only she has much more experience and knowledge than me. It appears that it is a personal judgement against her.



</question>



<additional details>



Also, as i have not been here 12 months I dont have any rights whatsoever, so it seems as if they are going to do the same with me only they only have to give me a weeks notice!!



No neither of us are members of a union, and te emails she recieved were for example, a complaint about the noise, where she makes no noise whatsover. She is not a manager, and none of the managers or supervisors were informed of this, there is one particualrly noisy person and nothign was said to her!

The company is anticipating difficult times and has trawled the names of employees that have been with them for less than the 2 years so that in the event of redundancy they can save a lot of money. As for you as far as redundancy is concerned you have no chance of a payout. Maybe you were taken on in that dept so that you could take on the extra work when they get rid of her. If she was made redundant then they cannot replace her job for at least 6 months. As you are now in the department they have covered themselves. There is no honesty in business where employees are concerned. If you or she is dismissed, not made redundant then you may be able to catch them for wrongful dismsal. I suggest that you and she quietly seeks out some alternative employment and leave them if you can.

I'm not sure about the law - I'm not an expert and I dont know where abouts in the world you are based.  Are you a member of a union?  If so you need to speak to them.  If not, try contacting your local government office - I'm sure you will find someone there who can point you in the right direction for some good advice.

I tink there are two issues here.

Firstly, you say that your friend feels that she is being victimised.  Is their a reason as to why she should be receiving the emails when everyone else does not?  Is she a manager?  Are the emails about her work?  If there is no valid reason then I suggest she should save copies of the emails and get some legal advice.  Harrassment and victimisation at work are not acceptable - neither is bullying.

Secondly, this business of redundancy.  If a job becomes reduntant then it ceases to exist.  As you are being trained to do the job I think she would have a strong case against the employers.  I'm not entirely sure as I'm not a legal expert.  Again, she needs to check this with the experts.  Check the local area for free information on employment rights - local government offices may be able to help.

Your friend should go to a tribunal and let them sort it out. If the company cannot prove she was negligent in her work then she may recieve compensation. Q: do you or your friend belong to a trade union? If so, your union rep; will be able to act on your friends behalf. If not, then go to the tribunal. She may have a good case considering that it has taken them almost two years to decide that she is not doing her job correctly.
I hope this helps.

I've just finished a 2 year course, but can't get a job out of it!  What other options are there?



I did a BTEC in Countryside Management and got a triple M (worth 3 A levels at B grade) and everywhere I go to to find a job wants volunteer work, but I really can't afford to volunteer for a year without a guaranteed job out of it.

I didn't want to go to uni, which is why I did the course in the first place, but now I can't see any other choice, unless I get a completely unrelated job, which would defeat the object of me doing the course in the first place!

Any suggestions would be gratefully received - should I risk a year of volunteering?  Or go to university and risk 3 years and a lot of money?

Go to university, a 2 year degree in the U.S. doesn't mean much either. What employers want to see is the 4 year degree or whatever is equivalent in your country. Also pick a degree that you're going to get a job in, like don't choose a philosophy degree. Lots of people hate college, I do too but sometimes you have to do things you don't like to get to where you want to get. Good luck.

Join the club. I studied hard for three years at college, got perfect qualifications, but still find it difficult to land myself a job relative to them, its hard. I would say you should seek a recruitment agency in your local area, this is what I have done. You will be given a recruitment consultant who will help you find suitable employment in the field of work you want, of course you'll need to fill out some forms and maybe tested on your skills, then once you are registered, they help you get work. Honestly, I went the other day and they were so good, they give you tips on your CV and skills and stay in contact with you. xx

What jobs involve..?



I'm very interested in reading about crimes and watching documentaries on tv about them.

I'm also interested in ancient historical things, especially things like The Battle of Thermopylae between the Greeks and the Persian Empire (most people will know about this from the film 300).

I was wondering, what jobs would involve either of these sorts of things and what qualifications or whatever you would need in order to do them.

How about a career that involves both crime AND history?

Traditionally, an archaeologist is someone who digs for artifacts and attempts to discover ancient cities to tell the rest of us how previous people and cultures lived in the past. Archaeologists bring history back to life so that the rest of us can enjoy the accomplishments of our ancestors.  This line of work is sometimes referred to as anthropological archeology.

Alternatively, if you're interested in law and solving mysteries, you may want to consider a career in forensic archeology. Forensic archaeologists dig through modern or ancient crime scenes to uncover and inspect evidence, which in turn will help solve the mystery of "whodunit."Forensic archeology professionals play an important role in modern law enforcement as well as solving crimes of the past.  Some forensic archaeologists have even been featured in documentaries concerned with investigating and solving the crimes of ancient history or those committed in more recent times.

What the two fields have in common is the interlacing of clues to create a picture of what happened. Other than that, the two fields are incredibly different. Most people are not even aware of the forensic side of archeology!

To find work as an archaeologist, you will need at least a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree. Generally, archeology degrees are focused more on the historical or anthropological side than the forensic side. For a career in forensic archeology you may also want to consider a criminal justice program.

With a degree in archeology, you're not destined to spend your days sifting through sand in the hot sun looking for an ancient city. You can work in a college, university, museum, law enforcement agency, or even as a consultant.

To work in a college/university, you'll need a Ph. D and you may be required to "publish or perish," so be sure if you want to go this route, you enjoy researching, analyzing, and reporting your findings in addition to teaching from experience and a textbook. While you may have summers off from classroom work, you can obtain grants to do research in the field.

In a museum, you'll be required to have at least a Master's degree. Here, your life will be similar to that of a professor. You'll be researching, reporting on your findings, and giving lectures to the public. Like to be a little creative? You'll be designing the displays too.

Consultant work will cover everything from field positions that require a B.A. to cultural resources management work that requires a Master's degree. There are also many opportunities to work in government positions.

You may be surprised by the salary connected to careers in archeology. According to JobForge.com, the average salary for an archaeologist as of February 6, 2008 was $64,000. A supervisory archaeologist could make roughly $84,000.  These figures do not necessarily reflect income potential for forensic archaeologists.



Once you determine the field you're most interested in, do a bit more research (dig a little!) to find out what amount you can reasonably expect to earn.

Helping to track down people who "steal history" could be yet another career option.  As part of international law enforcement efforts to stop the theft of stolen or illegally acquired antiquities you could be a guardian of the past, thus preserving history for the future.  INTERPOL and the FBI are two examples of agencies with specialists actively engaged in  hunting real tomb raiders, site thieves, black market antiquity traders, and recovering artifacts.

Other careers that may interest you include historian, anthropologist, crime writer, historical writer, mystery fiction writer, and documentary film maker or producer.

I would suggest you go to college but if you can't afford it just work hard and ask to move up, ask your manager how you can do this and sit down w/ someone to review your thoughts of how to move forward in your career and what steps you need to take

Another thing is to take those test which help you figure out your interest and personality so that you sort of have an idea of what will make you happy in the long run

I thought I wanted to be a fashion designer but it turns out I would have been a better chef or interior designer or counselor (this one I may still do) which is something that truly interest me way more then fashion ever did

You will have no problem to get a job in London as a software trainee engineer in London as such job is in demand. Its not wise to leave your family and London for India no matter what is the pay they are offering you.

It is important in any letter of resignation, to be dignified and courteous, as well as having a good sense of humour.  Having written many letters of resignation, I consider myself quite an expert.  One tact which might cause a laugh or two, is to have about 5 or 6 in your pocket when you hand one to your line manager.

When he/she says that they cannot accept that, get out another one which they cannot accept.



Working out what they cannot accept within the context of a letter of resignation, is important in understanding the importance of the "letter" of resignation.



It is important because they cannot accept a resignation, unless it is in writing.  So your first step is to offer your resignation verbally.  When they say they need it in writing, bring out the first letter which they cannot accept as it will have a fundamental flaw in it.  (like no signature or pp'd from one of your mates)

Then on the next letter, write 4 or 5 pages, and on the final page say that your resignation is contingent on acceptance of your discussion regarding constructive dismissal.

On the third letter, say that a copy of this letter will be handed to prospective employers as a reference.  Furthermore, you would need it in writing that this was not a formal resignation letter.

In the final letter, write it by hand and make the handwriting completely illegible.



Then after all the letters have been read, and they still will not accept your resignation, throw your hands up in the air and say "Well what about a rise then"

you would go about selling their product by saying to customers "try our new clothing (insert name of clothing brand) its the latest fall trend" or something along those lines.. you can also point them into the direction where certain clothing styles may suit them better then other ones.. just be creative.. and ALWAYS smile and ask them if they need help with anything.. that seems to be the number 1 thing that most employees at ANY clothing store does..

Lost my Job on Friday!?



I lost my job on Friday, I have obviously already started looking for a new job, but until I have found one I am thinking of starting my own car cleaning business, where basically will just knock on people doors and drop leaflets if no answer. Have already designed my leaflet, a bit cheezy but will do. Does anyone think this is a good idea? I'm young but need money but am a bit embarrased about it. Your views on this would be appreciated. Cheers!!!

One door closes and another one opens eh? Its good to hear that you aint wallowing in self pity and are trying to do summat proactive.
Couple of points to consider tho man....
1) Is anybody else offering the same service locally?
2) Will you be doing this legit? I'm only asking as you'll be self employed and will be liable tp pay tax etc etc.
It might be summat to do on the quiet while you look for a more stable/secure income, if you catch my drift?
Why not pop your CV into local recruitment agencies and see what comes up? Better to have a few options than just the one. But, every tycoon had to start at the bottom, so if you wanna do it, then go for it.

I'll be honest with you. I don't know how far that type of business will go, especially if you have a "cheezy" leaflet.

Why don't you focus on getting a job first, and trying to start a business on the side? That way you get the best of both worlds and can make a calculated risk while being gainfully employed at the same time.

Check out this site. There's some good info. on finding a job fast and info. on resume blasting. I think you'll find it interesting:

I think it's a great idea - beats sitting on your **** while you're waiting for a new job!

However, will you now be claiming job seekers allowance?  If so, you need to look into how many hours you're allowed to work and how much money you're allowed to earn before your benefits will be affected.  Also, whether you're claiming benefits or not, I would still aim to keep your earnings below the tax threshhold.  It will be too much effort to set up a business like this on a temporary basis and do it properly, but at the same time you don't want to find yourself on the wrong side of the law.

Being a PA is not a clearly defined job such as say a Dentist, Pharmacist etc.  The title can mean anything or nothing. From being a Captain of Industries' right hand to being general Dogs body in some little backstreet firm, or a down trodden serf to some second rate show bizz personality with delusions of grandeur.

The backbone essential subjects for nearly all decent jobs with prospects are pretty much what they were 40 years ago!  English Language.  Mathematics.  A General Science subject. A Language such as French, German or Spanish. Plus, of course, in this day and age, Computer Studies.  You know, all those dreary old subjects that need work!  These days there are far too many airy fairy easy option GCSE subjects available that are of negligible use once  you leave school. Too many pupils are leaving school with high aspirations and a handful of easy option GCSE's then wonder why they cannot get a decent job.

The only things you really *need* are English and Maths.

You may as well take Computer Studies, but you don't need to because to get a good PA job you'll need to study a formal secretarial course so this should teach you everything you need to know along these lines.

A language could be useful, but again, not a necessity.

Then, I would look to take any subjects that improve your communication skills and research skills, like History.  This is because if and when you eventually get sick of being a PA, one thing that you could perhaps move onto is Operations Management, Project Management, etc, but you'll find making this move difficult if you don't have good communication skills.

Out of work for over 6 months, what am I doing wrong? ?



I've been out of work now for 6 1/2 months, I hate every second of it, in all this time I have only had one interview and I didn't get the job (they didn't tell me why). I'm applying to as many jobs as possible but don't even seem to get a reply back from them...

What is it I am doing wrong and what else can I do to find work?



</question>



<additional details>



Part of the problem is I was fired from my last job (unfair dismissal, but I’m unable to do anything about it) so it makes finding work difficult, particularly when I am stuck looking for the same sort of work. My partner is also now out of work – he worked in the same place I did, also unfair dismissal (exact same situation as me).

You're in a difficult spot.  The first thing you might try is to call the companies you've already applied to and see if those positions have been filled.  If not, ask if they have begun interviewing and try to figure out the possibility of getting an interview.  The next thing you would want to do is expand your search.  Most people only apply at places that they really want to work at.  It may be necessary to take a job that you don't exactly enjoy or is not the best setting for a short time in order to pay the bills.  If you can find one of these jobs for a few months or a year, then other possibilities may be open at your first choice.  Good luck in your search.

Faith hello. First of all what field are you looking into? That may have something to do with it. I was in the same boat also. Not anymore.Yea.But I had to open my search and go out side the norm. I like to cook and feed people. I put lots of resumes out there. No luck on the computer. What helped was I stopped putting hits out on the internet. To many people do that. So unless I really had something special to offer and a great resume.I had no luck. Yea I had some job
interviews,but it didn't amount to anything. Instead I searched the local newspaper and took leads from actual people. Good luck and don't get down. Something will turn up.

(1) Do not despair

(2) Consider what *could* be the reasons for you not finding a job:



- You're not qualified enough ---&gt; consider applying for lower level jobs, I know that money is tight for you, but also consider getting a further qualification in your profession

- You're qualified aright, but there are simply no jobs in your field ----&gt; consider changing a field, making a career change

- There's high unemployment level in your area ----&gt; consider applying even to jobs at McDonald's, etc.; consider moving if possible; consider establishing your own business using your skills

- You're not searching well enough: you're looking only in local papers, not on Monster.com, Yahoo! Jobs, Craigslist, http://www.simplyhired.com/ etc.



- Your CV/Cover letter do not look impressive enough - try to work on those skills. This is the last bunch of links attached



(3) Apply more! Someone wrote that he applied here 23 times in six month - this is about the number of applications I have sent in a fortnight  when I was unemployed. Especially that today you can apply online for some positions,

Looking for a job is a full time job. You have to work at it 8 hours a day. Here are some tips:
1. Join linkedin.com
2. apply at temp agencies and employment agencies 
3. read "What color is your parachute" and "Knock'em Dead" job finding books.
4. Look in the phone book for companies you really want to work for, and then pursue them. Take any job they have to offer.  I know a lady who volunteered for a company she really wanted for a few months, and they went ahead and hired her yesterday.
5. It is easier to get a job when you have a job. Get anything, and then keep looking for the job you really want.
It is possible to find a job during a recession.

I'm sorry for your struggle, Faith.  It can be really hard getting that foot in the door, particularly when employers ask for resumes to be faxed or emailed and they tell you not to call.  At my workplace, we get dozens of resumes for each available position.

You need to make every effort to have your resume and cover letter stand out.  Your resume is an advertisement for yourself.  It should not read like a chronological list of job descriptions.  If it does, you need to revise it and include things you have achieved in your jobs (e.g. "reduced overhead costs for Department by 15%").  The website below offers several excellent suggestions for doing so.

You should also have more than one resume.  One size does not fit all.  If you are looking for jobs outside your traditional area of experience, you might want to draft a "functional" oriented resume in addition to a traditional chronological one.

Also, your cover letter is the other way to stand out.  It is your opportunity to demonstrate your personality and interest in the position.  I know when you are job hunting, it's easy to get dispirited and send the same canned cover letter to all employers.  Overcome this urge and do your best to make it fresh each time.

Lastly, and most importantly, inquire with friends, relatives, former co-workers, etc. about positions.  Nothing swings the door to an opportunity wider than having a trusted employee vouch for your value and integrity.

I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you.  Good luck!

Depending on your job history--do not list your last job or use a phone number to someone else at the company to take the call for you. Had this happen once, instead of using the hr number-I listed the manager.

What is it that you and your husband would like to do? What is your interest? Do you want work outside the home or something you can do from home?

I worked in construction most my life and then when I tried applying for easier work, I learned I did not have the experience they wanted--based on my last jobs. Took me almost a year to find a company that would even give me a chance.

There are some great places to join that would help you in job search. I do not think linkedin is one of them. I offer two job opportunities that you and your husband may be interested in. I also know of another opportunity your husband may like?--It involves auto. 
Feel free to contact me anytime.

nothing, if he doesn't have your details, and even if he did have basis for a claim and tried to go through the insurance for the 'damage', because there were no other witness, his insurance would pay for his car and your insurance for yours. You'd both more than likely lose your no claims unless you have 4 or more protected no claims.

He got your number there is nothing you can do but wait on the police contacting you for leaving the scene of a crime - albeit you never done any damage but it had a mark on his car and he will say it was you that done it, the worst case scenario I think is that you or your insurance will have to pay for the damage.

Can't agree with any of the answers. 2 years ago I reversed from a parking space and didn't see a car right behind me. He said I had made a dent in his door. There were no witnesse's, I couldnt see a dent so I drove off. 2 weeks later I received a letter from my Insurance company. This guy had taken my numberplate number, phoned his Insurer who tracked down my Insurer. Heaven knows how. I ended up paying £200 for his repair. How unjust is that. In the UK today there is nowhere to hide.

Hi ,
Can you be really sure you did not do the damage??It does not matter wether there were witnesses or not-The proof could be the damage on the other persons vehicle.
I would be very careful on what you do--(If contacted by the police) as



leaving the scene of an accident is classed as a hit & run.Which is a fineable offence & points on your license,& if you lie to the police & get taken to court(though not very likely) & lie again-This is classed as perjury & you would just be digging yourself a big hole.That said--If no contact by the police within the next few weeks I would stop worrying about it.

It really wouldn't be worth him claiming on your insurance as a scratch would cost so little to get covered.

I really think his insurance company would laugh at him.

You should have taken photos though because if he really wants to carry on with this, he could damage it a bit more and blame you.

I don't think you should have driven off as that makes you look really guilty.

Don't do anything - he has two options open - report the matter to his insurers or the police.

Police won't want to know coz it was on private property and no one was injured.

Insurers will probably tell him to grow up.



If there is no mark on your car - then he will have a hard job to prove anything - so stop worrying about it -

Your Best option is to contact the police.

As for what Insomnia said, if we all look the other way.. we're all going to suffer sooner or later.



Well done and let the police know, not sure which country you are in, but if in UK, use a Citizen Advice Bureau to take this further if the Police don't respond quick enough, the faster we root such people out, the better life we all get.

Hope this helps and Good Luck.

Would they hire me back????



used to work at sports authority here at college for a few months, and in May i left to go home for the summer. I called in my last day of work and said that I couldnt go in and they were mad over it but I couldnt go in. Now I want to return and im alittle shy to call in and ask if they are hiring or would let me return. A girl told me last night that they didnt hate me over it but had been mad over the fact that I didnt go in my last day.



Friends of mine tell me to go back (friends that I had worked with). Should I go ahead and call tomorrow and try or just forget about it because they may not let me return and if they let me return I may not get a lot of respect because of how I quit?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You can try, but I'd be armed with a good excuse of why you couldn't make it on your last day. If they take you back, learn a lesson from it. Plan ahead accordingly. If you know you will have to leave in May, make sure to give 2 weeks notice.

Just keep checking your local paper, or hand out your CV to local reputable companies or local newsagents. These days it is easiest to get a job through word-of-mouth, or by actuallt showing up at the store with your CV in hand.
Another place to check is employmentforstudents.com It wasn't that helpful for me, but maybe it will be better for you =D
I know that it will be best to apply now before all the students come to your town and nick all the best jobs hehe!

Finding a job in the U.S.A?



I'm from england and my two children are desperate to move out of here. I think it could be a great chance for a fresh start but as we have no other family over there I need to get a work visa. Does anyone know of any jobs being offered for someone who has worked with people with complex disabilities for 18 years. I am highly experienced and I am currently working in a day care centre for people with disabilities, I would really like a similar job but also I need pay that is the say as what I get over here which is roughly £30,000 I'm not sure how much that is in US dollars but I think it's nearly $60,000. 
Thanks for your help.

My advice is this, I think you should stay where you're now, you've a very good job in the UK, you need to get an offer first from the US then you go to the American Embassy in London to apply for the work visa when you have the offer or the contract, this will take time plus the fact that the US is having a problems with jobs as well, usually they use their own people rather than  hiring one from yet another country.
I'm sure you have a great back ground about the job you do and you're doing it well, this experience would be very much appreciated here in the UK but not in the US. All the best.

I dont know what career I want! Help! please!?



Hey I'm 16 and I'm about to enter 6th form in england. I'm taking German, Psychology, Politics and Media studys. I was going to take english Language but I hated geography at GCSE so I could never do travel and torisum for A levels.
The only thing is recently I no longer know what career I want to do. I used to want to be a journalist but I'm not so sure anymore I want to work for an NGO but I don't know what to do or how to go about it or if when I retire I would have enough to fall back on. Recently I have wanted to become an air stewardess because I always loved travelling and meting new people and going to new places. The only problem with this is that I know my perants would be disappointed with me as they have already said 'we don't want to waste our money on your education if you want to become an air stewardess'. Normally I stand up to them and would just tell them its my life, but.. Well I dunno.
Some things about me are:
I love to shop, met new people, I care about the environment, I love animals, I'm a vegan, I like meting new people and making friends, I'm shy sometimes, I can be loud, I sand up for what I belive is right, I love big citys, I'm a good public speaker [I won an award], I'm good at debating, I give good presentations to people [again I got an award], I'm helpful [somtimes], I contibute to many things [another award... god i sound like a looser. =(], I like to use my hands, I love to help people, I can be creative, I love the sea. I hate blood, I hate  war and I hate hurting things/people for no apparent reson or gain.
The reason I ask is becase I really dont want to have made the wrong choice in 6th form and I dont even know if I wan to go to uni, although my perants are expecting me to do so, this is why I'm asking.
I'm totally confused right now about what I should be doing.
What are some interesting jobs out there? Something I might be interested in.

you're 16 and have your whole life ahead of you. in my experience very few people stick the first job they have. being confused at your age is totally understandable. it's also pretty normal. i've also found that not many people go on to work in the field in which they have gained a degree in. nevertheless although i didn't go to uni personally i think it can prove invaluable in getting employment which pays a reasonable salary. there are somepitfalls however. i would recommend that you do not go straight to uni from school. i think its important that young people learn something of the real big bad world like learning to live on a budget. ultimately though the only person who can decide if a job or career is the right one is you. you have plenty of time to decide don't rush into anything just yet

If you're interested in becoming a flight attendant, then go with that!  The reason that I say that is because it's the sort of job that people tend to only stick at for a couple of years anyway whilst they're young, so you could do this for a couple of years while you're thinking about what you'd like to study at uni.  I have a friend who is a flight attendant and she similarly thought that her parents would be horrified at the thought of her being a "glorified waitress".  So she went ahead and applied in secret and then only told them when she was selected, and they weren't so bad about it after all!  Remember too that you can make LOADS of money - you pay tax an extremely low rate because you are not classed as being resident in the UK 100% of the time, so even though the basic salary might not sound fantastic, your take-home pay is great.

As the Answerer above has said, most people of your age don't really know what they want to do.  If you are undecided, all you can do is try to take a wide enough range of subjects so that you don't limit your options too early.  I notice that you're not studying any maths or sciences so you're ruling these out.  But you're keeping your options open so that you could go onto almost any Arts degree.  You're probably best to study subjects that interest you and that you're good at and then see where this leads, rather than thinking of a job that you might like to do and then picking subjects to help you get there, as this really will limit your options.

Take some time to just get your qualifications, decide on colleage / uni vs getting a job straight away. Then think about what you love doing, what excites you, how much time and effort you want to put into work vs how much you want to earn. If you want loads of money, car, house etc then you'll spend more time and energy at work (no such thing as an easy life, whatever the glam mags tell you !). If want to work with animals likelyhood is that it will be hard and you won't earn loads for example. Don't be afraid to try something and then if doesn't work out, provided you have gained good results in your studies, you can always change. I didn't settle on my career until I was 30 years old.

What's the legal allowance for breaks throughout a working day?



I work 12 hour shifts in an office.  I've only been working there for 2 months or so.. But we are only allowed to have an hour for lunch.. and that's it!  The hour isn't paid.  We aren't allowed ot take any other breaks, although we can take the hour in two half an hour breaks.  What's going on?  Is this right?  Twelve hours.. and only a 1 hour break??  We're also not allowed to take any breaks after 6:30pm..  some of us work until 11pm.  Is this legal??  I haven't had a written contract yet.. I really just want to know what my rights are before I approach my boss.  Thanks.

Working hours and holidays are now subject to a raft of legislation aimed at making sure that workers get a reasonable work-life balance that will reduce stress and increase performance. Working hours are restricted to minimum levels although there are some exceptions and loopholes. There are a number of different types of leave as well; annual holiday allowances, compassionate leave, maternity and parental leave to name just a few.



Working Time Directive 
The European Working Time Directive has had a direct impact on many people, particularly those working on production lines and other more traditional factory-based jobs. Generally most workers will now have the right to a non-working period of at least eleven hours each day, a whole 24 hours off every week, a 48 hour working week and four weeks annual leave in each year. There is also a break of at least 20 minutes if the working day is six hours long or more, but the employer is not obliged to pay during the rest period or count it towards the working day.

But the law is very complicated and it's tricky making simple rules. Many of the restrictions on hours are averages so complex time recording and periodical reviews are necessary to ensure compliance. And people can opt out of the working week, either by choice or coercion. Night shift workers also must now have health assessments to make sure that night work is not damaging their health and they are not allowed to opt out.



Peer Pressure
In many white-collar (i.e. office-based) jobs the working hours directives are completely ineffective. As there is no official time keeping in many offices, workers put in long hours if they see their managers and co-workers doing the same, or are pressurised to work for as long as it takes to get a project finished or a deadline met. Many office-based workers will not have union representation either, which makes it difficult to break a culture of commercial and peer pressure that causes this culture of long hours.



Taking Time Off
Many people are lucky enough to have a greater holiday allowance than the norm, currently 24 days each year, for people who work a five day week, and in April 2009 it will go up to 28 days. Part-time workers now receive the same amount of leave as full-timers but pro rata for the hours they work.



Although there are eight Bank Holidays in the UK, employers are not obliged to give them as time off and if they do, they are allowed to count them as part of a holiday allowance. The allowances also depend on whether someone is considered a worker, an employee, or self-employed.



Maternity, Paternity and Parental Leave
Maternity leave has been established for many years now but paternity and parental leave are relatively new on the scene in the UK. Maternity leave is up to 39 weeks on statutory maternity pay although it does vary depending on how long you have been employed. Many employers offer their own scheme, which is likely to be more generous and related to an employee's salary at the time of the pregnancy.



Paternity leave is intended for the non-child carrying partner to be available at the time of the birth and for the first few weeks afterward. Paternal leave can be taken by either parent regardless of their sex and at anytime until the child is 5 years old. Any parent who has been employed for a year or more can take 13 weeks off at any point during those first five years, although it is unpaid. There is more detail about both paternity and parental leave in our Family Commitments article.



Other types of leave, such as compassionate leave, are known in government-speak 'time off for dependants'. There is a statutory right for employees to be given time off, without pay, to deal with emergencies such as a death in the family, an ill child, or anything else concerning a dependant that requires someone to be at home. Employees are allowed 'reasonable' time off, and as with maternity leave, this can be paid, depending on the organisation's policy, if there is one.



Check Contracts
As has been made clear throughout, the government lays down minimum requirements and it is up to the employer to decide whether to stick to those minimums, with regard to both working hours and leave, or to offer more. An employment contract, sometimes with an associated staff handbook, will detail the allowances and improving them is up to the bargaining powers of the employee or a union, if there is a recognised one at the workplace.

In the Uk your statuary right is a 20 minute break for every 6 hours worked. Unpaid. So yes they are keeping to the Law. If you have a break before 6,30pm they can ask you to work until 11pm. No doubt you cannot have an evening break because that is when the calls are busiest.
Sounds like a big company (call centre), they do tend to work within the regulations.

If a worker is required to work for more than six hours at a stretch, he or she is entitled to a rest break of 20 minutes.

The break should be taken during the six-hour period and not at the beginning or end of it. The exact time the breaks are taken is up to the employer to decide.

You are entitled to 20 mins for every six hours worked. The fact that you employer is allowing you to take an hour which can be broken into two 30 min sessions is legal.
However the display screen equipment regulations (H&S Law) state that if you are working with a PC constantly for the 12 hours you are there you should have a workplace assessment, this will take into account your workstation and the type of work you do.
Regulation 4 also states that your employer should be planning your activities so that your use of a display screen is periodically interrupted. Even if this means filing or walking across the office floor this is so you can avert your eyes from the screen and stretch your legs.



The regulatons also state that eye tests must be provided if required.
Look at the HSE website and type in DSE in its search engine, that will give you all the information you need and at work ask for your health and safety representative and request a workplace assessment.



The reason i am giving you this information when your question was about breaks is due to the fact that you should have more breaks if you are sat in front of a screen all day, especially during the busiest period. If your H&S representative is a good one and knows their subject then they should recommend this to your employer.
Good Luck

How are you sure about this? Are you assuming because you have had rejections that it is because of your GCSE result?



I would have thought that your degree results would supercede the GCSE ones.

You could try saying that unfortunately at school you had a maths teacher killing time until retirement who had lost all interest in his subject and any ability he may have once had at imparting knowledge to pupils.

Restrictive covenants in my Contract of Employment?



I am currently on garden leave from a sales job as I am going to a rival company. My contract states I can't contact anyone I've dealt with in the past 12 months for 6 months after I've left the company. Obviously I won't remember all of the people I've spoken to in that time so was going to ask my company for a full list of people I've contacted. I don't expect they'll give it to me but where does the law stand on this? If I call an old client (not realising I've spoken to them before) surely it's not my fault as my old company didn't tell me who I'd spoken to? Surely I can't be expected to remember everyone? Will they still be able to take me to court?

Don't worry about it.  It's very unlikely that they'd find out that you'd contacted anyone, and even if they did find out, I'd be surprised if they would bother to sue you - think about how expensive that would be for them.  Most companies don't really bother to enforce clauses like this.

I work in recruitment and I have known various ex-colleagues to copy the entire database before handing in their resignation (knowing that they would most likely be sent on garden leave following their resignation).  Obviously to be taking huge quantities of information like this is a problem for the company.  You speaking to just one or two people accidentally is not really going to cause them any great damage.

Non-competitive agreements are tricky.  In part it's to protect the company from losing a client, but it's also to stop you from possibly bad-mouthing the company you're in with someone who trusts you.  You could ask who else they've done business with before and as long as your old company isn't on the list, you should be fine.  I don't think they could track every cold call you could of made in the last 12 months.

You should prob. consult a lawyer with the agreement and find out how much you can do.  See if your new employer will let you use theirs since they may be liable in part for your breaching your contract.

By law what are your breaks at work?



I only work Saturday and Sundays at my local NHS. We start work at 7:30am and finish at 3:30pm. Our breaks at the moment are 10:30am and 1:30pm, which means we only have to go three hours after starting to have breakfast. But our employer is on about changing all of this to having 1 hour break from 12:00 till 1:00, which means we would have to work 4 and a half hours before we can have something to eat, and I don't have anything to eat before starting work.

I thought by law that we are allowed a 10 - 20 minute break for every 4 hours you work, but am not sure.

Can anyone help?

If you are aged 18 or over, and your working day is at least 6 hours, you have the right to an uninterrupted rest break of at least 20 minutes. Your contract of employment may be more generous than this. There is no law about when this break should happen although government guidelines say that the break should be taken during the day rather than at the beginning or the end. You are entitled to spend your break away from your workstation. Lunch breaks count as rest breaks.

The PDF below explains the law, regarding rest beaks. As long as you work more than 6 hours, you are entitled to a 20 minute rest break, although it is up to the employer if they allow you more time. However, the law states that an employer is not obliged to allow you rest breaks at a certain time, it just has to be at some point in the day.

It's different in each state and it also depends on the job.  I once worked in a bread factory where we worked 12 hour shifts with 2 paid fifteen minute breaks. An hour break is pretty awful if you are having to clock out for it and can't go anywhere.

In some states you get overtime for any shift with more than 8 hours of labor and in others it's more than 40 hours a week.  I had one bad boss that would have me work the last five days of one week and the first five days of the next so I ended up working 10 days straight with no overtime.



Most employers mandate a 15 paid break every three hours and a 1/2 unpaid meal break if the shift is more than 5 hours.

Sounds like a bad change.  Check with your local state employment office.

In the UK
If you are over 18 then its 20 mins for every six hours worked. 
The 20 mins must be taken away from your workstation and not at the start or end of your shift. 
If you have to wear a uniform and are required to change into and out of it when taking a break, time must be added onto the 20 mins to allow for this.
The law is different for under 18's and again for under 17's.

In the US you must have a 30-minute unpaid rest period if you are not a minor and work over 6 hours.  Like most of the other answers said, there is no specified time for this break.  I know my employer requires it to be in the middle of the shift (so between 11 and 2 for your type of shift).

Under the provisions of the Working Time Regulations 1998, adult workers whose daily working time is more than six hours are entitled to a rest break of 20 minutes and the break cannot be at the start or end of a shift.

Many people wrongly believe that you are entitled to break after 4 hours of work.  Only young workers (under age 18) whose daily working time is more than four and a half hours are entitled to a rest break of not less than 30 minutes. The break should be uninterrupted "if possible".

There is no requirement imposed by the Regulations for the rest break to be paid. Payment is a contractual matter between the employer and workers.

If your employer makes the change and gives you reasonable notice then there is nothing you can do.  They are complying with the legal requirements and you are not suffering a detriment.

The traditional Chicken and Egg problem.

That was exactly what I felt when I graduated.

While quite a few jobs are willing to consider people without work experience, you can also try for jobs that require 1-2 years experience in your field. They are likely to be willing to consider someone like you too.



In general, it's not only academic/professional qualifications that matter, but also how you perform in the work place, under the pressures from work which are quite different from pressure from school. So if you have prior work experience, highlight that.

Experience is important because it will show how well you can implement what you learnt in the 'real world'. How you have translated the certification into results which is afterall what all companies are after.

If you have none, then be ready to start from the bottom and prove your mettle. If you are good, you have no need to worry, it is to the advantage of the employer to keep good staff.

Good luck!

The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.  If there's no past behavior in your CV, then there is not much that's predictable and I think recruiters won't feel comfortable recommending for a position.  You'll get that over time... some time from now, prove in your CV that you've acquired experience, you've been a good manager and delivered results...

I think EXPERIENCE could be gained anywhere anytime as long as you don't take it for granted.  I mean though I am at school, I have experience leading my research team to fulfil a research project. I have experience consulting as I consult everyday during thesis period with my fellows. I have experience organizing a site visit as I have  organized several for my class on many study tours to many archaological sites...  I have experience presenting new products to clients as I used to do a lot of presentations on various topics to my class and teachers.  I have experience writing tough reports and meeting minutes and use standard computer software as I wrote many reports after field trips while at school, etc.  I also have experience dealing with difficult people as I meet many different people both at school, home and sport clubs and I do know what clicks and what does not.........  Hope this little idea can help.

Recruiters ask for experience because they want the best value for money they can get.  If they have to spend some time training someone up for the job, they see this as a waste of resources.  If they can get someone experienced, they think that they get a person who will hit the ground running.  Having said that, they don't always get people with the right experience, so keep applying and emphasise all the life experience you have, plus stress all the experience you may have gained in part-time jobs, etc, which can transfer to other jobs.  Good luck.

The nursing course is now done at university when before you were employed as a student by the healthboard.
The standard course is 3 years for the diploma but you can do extra course work for your degree.

Minimum age for entry is usually 17 1/2 yrs old.

The university course is bursary paid so its a small amount of money paid every 3 months over the year..so like most other students..you will probably be pretty reliant on a student loan or a part time job.

Most university nursing courses attach to a nearby healthboard for the practical side of the training.
You could join the trust's bank for shifts or join a nursing agency.

these are pretty common for nursing student's as you can do what shifts you like tailored around your course work.

Contact your local university or collage to see what their entry requirements are....Normally their minimum is 5 standard grades with at least one being science based..

Good Luck...

I guess it depends what sort of job you're looking at. If online there are jobs that fit what you can give and they're seeking people then i'd just go with a few but it wouldn't harm to go with lots.

The more jobs that you apply for my friend, the more chance of getting an interview and therefore the more chance of success. It is hard work looking for a job though, and harder work still trying to find the right job for you.



But, ask yourself if you really want to work at the place / organisation that you are looking at first. You may have to spend many years working on low pay!! So, don't just apply for any old job. You are interviewing them - just as much as they are interviewing you. Good luck, I hope you find the right job.

However, as much as I love working in retail, I want something more than just working on the sales floor. Any ideas on what I could do? I enjoy visual merchandising / window dressing. I've also thought about going to uni but I don't have any A-levels only GCSE's. Are there any part time courses that could help me? What are my options?

Aimwalk is absolutely right. Your employer does not have the right to know what kind of drugs you take, only that you were out sick. You can try begging the doc for a note. Don't even bother faking one, because your boss would probably call to confirm that it was legit.

It's probably time to look for a new job. Either you have a boss who is controlling beyond what is reasonable, or you have so many absences you're about to be canned for them.

Well try to find the bottle if you can because it could do you more harm if you don't find them. If an infection gets to your blood stream it can be fatal. But your boss does not need to ask you those types of questions because that is an invasion of privacy. Unless you said you were sick when you weren't. Otherwise it shouldn't matter if you needed some personal time. they might be trying to bully you. So just leave it alone and just do your job. If they ask just say you leave it at home so it won't get lost at work.

UK based legal question?



I know someone who was working illegally with a false document here in London but the document had there own name on it. Anyway she prisioned for 3mths. She was issued with a NI legally now it seems that her paperwork now shows a conviction  theft. It would seem that the judge made a mistake he  thought that one of her papers were not in her married name but  the others in her maiden name.

Her lawyer did not pick up on this error and she was convited 
Her marriage cert can prove that all these papaers were only in her name.



Anyway she will be leaving the UK shortly  due to the home office refusal to grant her stay . she try to  re apply  entry because her husband will  make the application. Her employer ie the management wants to re employ her and 4 managers have given her letters to say they would.



She was living in the UK since 2002 and married in 2003 to a uk citizen and asked the Home office many times to work and they kept messing about not making a decsion.

she was due to be promoted at work and her supervisor was jealous she knew him previously and he reported her to the police without informing their employer.



Anyway she admitted to obtaining her job by deception but she had not stolen anything, how can she get this off her record . After all if she was a thief her employer would no insist that they would love to have her back they are aware of the conviction and are a large Uk BASED COMPANY.

She was a hard worker never late and always helpful and often worked past her time without pay. All the Company's clients  miss her too.

I know AND she knows what she done was wrong ! but she didn't work in anyones name but her own, and didn't use these documents to claim benefits or anthing free, she had worked hard and paid Taxes via her own NI number.

How can she clear the theft charge ????



</question>



<additional details>



when she arrived in the Uk she enrolled in a college run by a nigerian she and 20 others student paid £1500.00 and handed over their passports for a nusing course and was told that that he would send them to the home office. Anyway 3weeks later they all turned up at 9am as he had said and he had vanished. Since it was her cousin who had introduced her to his college she said that she would try and track him down. anyway her cousin used her to be a babysitter by saying that now her six mths were up she would be deported just to give her more time ,



well she ahd now over stayed and had met her husband and married in the uk and then got a laywer to sort the mess out the home office knew about the college and she proof that she had paid they had her passport as he had sent it to them with the wrong address so when the 6mths were up she didn't  they had refused her to stay.

She should have reported it to the police but was very naieve. thats why she has to go back as she over stayed

She has done everything wrong from the start and was convicted for working here illegally. To arrive in 2002 and marry a uk citizen in 2003 looks like she has married for reasons other than love, and on paper that is what the home office will see.
Because she has got off to a bad start things have just got worse for her and the only way she can clear all this mess up is to go to a lawyer and see if he can find a way to resolve this. But this is going to take a long time and cost a lot of money.

I find it hard to believe that a large UK company after employing someone that was found to be working illegally with forged documents, someone whom had spent time in prison would be eager to employ her again!! What is this country coming to .

It depends, there are some really good ones. Me myself, I became a programmer to try to design video game and ended up designing bank systems to break the clear period on checks for local banks. I made a pretty good share of money, but got addicted to drugs, and arrested. I eventually after some jail and then about a year of rehab, am ok, and would not go back for any reason to change anything.
I recommend getting a program called VersaCheck. It lets you make payroll checks for you employees, and then cash them. Obviously you have no employees, but can cash the checks at idiot based places locally. To do this is an idotic approach, as you will probably get arrested, and can do some serious time.
How about this, for a day, go to Craigslist.com, and put up a Rolex in the NY area for 6,000 and do not give any serious information. Take 2 pictures from Google images of a rolex, and put them up.
In about 24 hours you will have 5- 10 emails from scammers explaining that they want to buy it. Which as you know is ridiculous, because they do not want to verify it's authenticity, they just want to buy it. Go along with them, as Craigslist is local only, but these people will give you many stories as to how they live in Nigeria and whatnot. Look for the holes in their stories, and create your own.
It's not very hard, and I have done countless things of this nature, but I am currently am selling a Rolex and have never seen this many scammers ever!!!
It DOES pay, and is VERY easy. Just have to know the right stuff.
Email me if your THAT curious, as I can barely speak in such an open forum.

Yes there is, in today's world online security is the new concern. Internet is plagued with online hackers and scammers. And to protect them from getting scammed people/companies  are ready to pay high amount of money.

And by doing this you earn money as well as do public service. So, its good in both ways.

A cover page is always nice to do. You can explain why you want the position, and briefly summarize your qualifications.

Unless you have some very unique and hard-to-find skill, if there isn't a position available your resume will be kept "on file," which is a code for it will never again see the light of day. Delivering it in person is always good too, if you can get to see who you will be working for.

Be assertive, the employer does not know you. You'll have to stand out amongst all the others. Make sure your resume is tailored for the specific job, and you know what is required of the position.

You should include a covering letter with your resume (and with an application form too, in most cases). It acts as an introduction to the employer and you can use it to emphasize the skills you want the employer to especially know about. 
You can send your resume to employers even if there isn't a position available but be prepared to send a lot of them and understand that most will be rejected/ignored.

Absolutely include a cover letter every time you send out a resume. A lot of recruiters and HR people will not even look at a resume unless it comes with a cover letter. Below I have sited two links. The first link gives you some general cover letter writing guidelines. The second link gives a few cover letter examples.

Yes you should include a cover letter, its gives a good impression, 
Secondly you should do both, try out giving your resumes at places where you want to work along with keeping tabs on openings online.

Is there any way I can check a company's maternity policy before deciding to accept a job?



I am job hunting and a companies maternity policy could make a massive difference to deciding which company I go to work for.



Is there a database or website that lists various companies maternity policies or recommends companies with particularly good ones?



</question>



<additional details>



I already have a job but the company have made some changes recently and i'm not enjoying that much anymore. I have made the choice to start looking elsewhere, though i'm not desperate to do so, and I am trying to be realistic about the future. I am trying to think ahead and put myself in a good financial position for starting a family in a few years time.



As I have the option as to where I apply I believe that considering these things now is quite a sensible thing to do.

Unfortunately this really is not the sort of thing that you can ask at an interview, or even on the phone to HR - you wouldn't get a look in if you were that blatant about it.

Several of the women's magazines run stories every year about the best companies for women based on different criteria.  Do a web search for them.

The best way to know for sure is list the companies you are interested in and call the Human Resource Department and ask to speak with someone in benefits.  They should tell you everything you need to know.

IF you need a job then you can not afford to limit your options........
in this economy and slow job market employers can be extremely selective. going into the process openly wondering about how much time off from work you will be allowed or if you will be paid while on leave at some point in time is not the best way to start the process.

IF a job is offered you should have all the information about pay and benefits presented to you so you can make a decision at that time.

it is highly ill-advised at this time to not apply for a job just due to a lack of benefits that fit your needs. after a job is offered you don't have to accept it;  but shouldn't you at least get the offer first?.
at least go to the door and see what is there?

In the UK there is a statutory law for maternity leave and pay/allowance. This is quite generous and allows flexibility. I doubt very much if you would find a company that would expand on these terms and conditions. 
Depending on your length of service and your annual pay will determine what you can expect. Acas website or BERR will give you all the information you need.

If you are presented with an offer the company should give you benefits information at that time to help you make a decision.  If you want to eliminate possible companies before or while applying, you should be able to find information on their websites.  I've had to do a lot of benchmarking on different employers' leave policies, including maternity, and I was able to find all of my information online,

Unless they have their HR policies on the web then no there is no way of finding this out.  Some employers such as universities publish there HR handbooks on the web so do a web search just in case.

There is no database that carries copies of these as most employers would like to keep them private.

There may be websites that recommend companies but then you are completely dependent upon whether the information is up to date and correct or biased.

Gail is completely correct - because UK law is already so generous in its' provision of maternity benefits, virtually no private sector employers give anything over and above this.

You could look for work in the public sector as usually employers in that sector are more accommodating of flexible working hours and so on, but of course they pay less ... I know that I personally would prefer more money and no flexibility in my hours.

Its always been difficult to get a job at 15 anyway, so dont worry about what you are going through.

However, with the current situation of the 'Credit Crunch' and the economic slowdown, companies are turning over less each year so cant afford to even keep their current staff. WIth unelployment rising, you will now find it even more difficult to find a job.

Try a paper round with your news agent or local paper.

depends on what state you live in, some places you need a work permit to work at 15 (and no, you can't legally work at 13! That's illegal!)

babysitting and mowing lawns was always a teen job (no taxes to pay either!). Don't expect to get anything great at your age, my first job at 15 was in fast food.



Also now that we have such an illegal immigrant problem, they've taken away a lot of the teen jobs like fast food, mowing lawns etc. So it could be that those jobs are already filled by them. Here in california you can't really get those jobs anymore.

Before you are 16 the number of hours you can work is regulated by the law; the younger you are when you look for work, the less qualifications you have and the fewer work options there will be available to you. If you don't get qualifications then you won't get offered more than a store job or McDonald's or something similar.

These days with the bad economy many are out of work, so don't feel so bad. Also, with the child labor laws in effect, 13 years old is still school age and nobody will hire someone so young unless you want to mow the lawn or deliver newspapers. You could start by doing volunteer work. You could check out volunteering in a hospital, nursing home, nutrition center, day care center, and so forth. This will give you a chance to network with others, meet new and interesting people, as well as obtain references for the near future. When I was 15, one of the first jobs I got was a junior counselor at a summer day camp. If you like working with young children, this may be something for you. I don't know where you live, but in New York it is required to obtain working papers for people not of the legal working age. Anyway, you should look into any of these things and remember, you are very young and have plenty of time. As you get older, you will be applicable for new opportunities. Enjoy being young now, because when you are older you will have to work anyway. Good luck.

I have been off work for 18 months on long term sick leave. I know its probably dependent on the company but I have heard that after a certain amount of time you can get paid off on medical grounds. I have been paid out on a company pension scheme that pays me part of my salary

</answer from>



<answer>



Not sure what your current position is,i.e. are you still employed or not. Assuming you are, generally companies will have two routes to dismissing people on medical grounds. The first is usually for when it is likely someone will work again eventually or could do a different role somewhere else and attracts a sum which will be determined by the company rules. The second is when someone will never work again and this usually allows for pension to be taken early in addition to a sum, but the rules will depend on the pension rules for your particular scheme. All of this will be based on medical evidence normally.

The national average is something like £25k, so compared to that it is.  However it depends on what stage you are in your carer and where you want to be.  A lot of people in this country will be expecting to be paid a lot more than that during their life.

Not if you're going to have to spend 60% of it on taxes to support:

1.) The NHS, who by the time you'll be needing it, will put you on a very long waiting list, hoping that you'll die off so they can save on the treatment. 
2.) the war in Iraq
3.) the council 
4.) schools so bad that your child is better off staying at home



The Swedes are taxed like crazy but you can see their tax money being put to excellent use!

Besides how much of that will you have to spend on living expenses? If half of what remains after taxation is spent on everyday living then your left with nothing!

Question about unemployment?



I've been granted unemployment after I went to appeal hearing.My last employer failed to show up to testify against me. I was reading through the papers and what got me off guard they sent a notice of the hearing to my employer but it came back to the unemployment office undeliverable.It also stated compensated week/s from 6/21/08.
Does that mean I get back pay from the time I had filed? I live in PA and I just want to be sure.

Yes,I am looking for a job if anyone is going to ask.



</question>



<additional details>



Oh trust me Beth,My last employer does have issues.I keep up with my ex coworkers all the time and they fill me in on the huge amounts of people quitting or people being terminated. I know a lot of people who was filing for unemployment but I didn't hear if they won their case.

You need an enhanced disclosure for the SIA licence and they go back for 10 years, anything before 10 years is ok, they obviously don't bother about speeding tickets or petty things like that but if you have served time then it affects you. Go to the SIA website www.SIA.co.uk they have a section that you can fill in and it tells you if you qualify or not. That way you know if its worth paying the £250 to sit the SIA exam which is in Health & Safety & Conflict Management. Hubby had to go through this recently

The salary for a beginning police officer is excellent.  You can also make more with overtime doing traffic control and security for events.  Many officers in our area make over $100K per year.  As far as "going through the ranks quickly", I wouldn't count on it.

Yes, if they are mentally ill yet still capable of doing the job.



If their mental illness makes the job more difficult you have a right to say you don't think they can handle it, but if they can do the job correctly it would be illegal to discriminate.

The answer is no, as a matter of fact, companies are allowed to check the physical and mental health of their prospective employees.

If their mental health will be a stumbling block in performing their job, then they are not hired.  The same is also true with physical health.



My opinion

***********
Darius, you are correct,  companies never says that an applicant is not hired due to race, gender, sexual preference, etc.  Oftentimes they will only say that the position is now filled.  Sometimes they will not even inform you what happened to your application.



I even encountered a foreign company that never hired homosexuals as the owner views this as a psychological problem!  Even if there is a law, how would you prove that you are being descriminated, specially if they just informed you that the position is filled or closed, and they would further inform you that your application is in their active file for future vacancy.

My personal opinion from my assessment of the Human Rights Act is it's NOT illegal... According to the Human Rights Act, Article 14, Prohibition of discrimination, UNLESS they can perform the duties assigned. E.g. I think it would actually be illegal (knowingly and intentionally putting the public in harms way) to hire someone with certain varieties of tourettes as an armed security guard, or a narcoleptic person as an Ambulance driver.
Article 14:"The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status."
http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukp...

That doesn't mean they can't be sued though...
"He was eligible for 26 weeks of disability benefits. But he was fired, instead, in a case that would lead to an $11,000 settlement."
http://www.mscod.state.mn.us/cd/docs/CDd...

If this is serious, you should contact a lawyer and if you have the time read the entire Human Rights Act as well.
http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukp...

I'm merely offering my opinion on the representation of this law and only a lawyer should give you his recommendation as far as what to do. Especially considering that the answer may vary depending on which state you live... Another source for clarity (who would probably ask for more specific information from you regarding the mental illness and the job) is your states Human Rights department... You can find your states Human Rights Department by typing your state name at the end of this search:

My assistant principal is a nark!?



I am 13 and in 8th grade at Middle School.  Our assistant Principal is making us lose our ever loving minds! I am in a public school by the way.  So he has had 40+ cameras installed in the halls and outside because we have a thousand people and our crowded so there are these trailer rooms outside.  i understand the outside cameras in case of a break in or a kid bolting out of three but i mean come on!  We are not allowed to chew gum, which i guess is ok.  no flip flops.  we  can't nibble on food before checking out of the lunch line because it is considered stealing and you will recieve a detention.  well im sorry that i eat at 6:00 a.m. so i an get on my bus that comes at 6:30 and not eat lunch until 12:50!  there are these noise traffic light measuring devices in the cafeteria to measure our noise level and if it goes red a siron goes off.  and the next day we can not talk during lunch. im a diabetic and drink a lot of water and i can not have a water bottle in my locker because hes afraid someone will kick it open and slip some alcohol into it.  and the dress code is super long!  our handbook of rules is 50 pages long and is in times new roman size 12!  and another rule is the pda "hands off policy".  because hes afraid a little hug will lead into us having sex  but we are aloud to slow dance at the dances? yeah he makes a whole lot of sense.  yeah right buddy, sorry im a virgin.  and were not aloud to sit with our other 8th grade friends at lunch who come in 10 minutes later because they have an academic 6th period and we have u.a. its so freakin stupid and the list is horendous and makes us want to scream! was your school like this? or is?

okay hi.. yeah my vice principal was a creeper too.. a lot of what you said was enforced at my old school too. we didn't have cameras though that IS weird.. and we had carts with food in them once you get to the front of the line to pick from. so we didnt nibble on the food on the way to pay. we couldnt hold hands, kiss, touch or anything either. we couldnt wear flipflops either. i went to a public school too. and our skirts had to touch the tips of our fingers ot we ahd to wear PE clothes. and pants couldnt be low and such. we werent allowed to wear white tank tops... wth? anyway all i have to say is that those types of things get better in high school? we can where flip flops and kiss and touch so thats good.. anyway good luck with that nutcase and i hope you like high school better. by the way i am a sophmore now :D and its waaaaay better than middleschool in my opinion.

University without a doubt!  Your first 3 years at work as a teenager  could see you in a number of jobs before you find one you like and may not have much of a beneficial effect on your future career.

Having a degree will be of use to you for the rest of your life. Often management fast track schemes are only open to graduates. At some time in your life you may wish to emmigrate and having a degree can help smooth the way.

don't know where you are, but if you are in the UK, this is  my answer...

I went to uni, and I absolutely LOVED it.  I chose a 4 year course that had a "sandwich" year in Berlin (I studied a partial German course),

University to me was one big, long, fun party.  I had the best time, and it is honestly one of the best memories I have of my late teens, early twenties.  The whole rumour of "you have to work really hard" is rubbish.  You work as hard as you have to to get by.  I gained a 2:1 (the second best possible grade).  At the end of it, I worked a few shitty jobs until I got onto a really good career path and accelerated.



My husband on the other hand, didn't go to uni and worked.  He is successful, and didn't need uni or a degree to define his career.  He does occasionally admit that he wishes he had had the experience..

You need to do whatever is right for you.  These days, a degree means nothing (in the UK), and your career will develop adequately without one.  The social side of it however...... it is certainly not something I would swap for the world.  I had a fantastic time.

Good luck, whatever your choice is xxx

For me, uni was a difficult time. I knew i wanted to study my subject though (psychology) and although it was difficult (not so much the work but the environment, i found it hard socialising) .. i don't regret it for a minute. It's made me who I am, and if I hadn't done it I would probably have still been waitressing or working in customer services. It gives you a new way of thinking and also lets you experience the world, budgeting money, living independently etc. I am doing a fairly good job now and have just got an even better one, and i'm almost certain I wouldn't have, had it not been for me going to uni. Plus being in a studenty bubble for 3 years has a lot of advantages! No full time work, lots of lie ins and lots of drunkenness (also student discount) and i barely notice my loan going out of my salary, it's next to nothin

I vote university!

When you say you "might end up with an ordinary job", I think you need to realise that job prospects are ALWAYS better for graduates than they are for those who have not gone to university.  Perhaps when you're 22 or 23, salaries for a grad vs a non-grad could be comparable, but if you look at those two people ten or fifteen years into the future, the graduate will have progressed considerably whereas the other one won't have.

In fact, I have a problem with the way that you've asked this question.  You say "university vs job/career" but what you mean is "university vs job".  Usually those without a university education end up in dead-end jobs and don't have a real career.

Of course, many people do end up working in fields completely unrelated to their degree, but this doesn't mean that the degree is pointless.  You've still gained soft skills such as communication skills, research skills, etc, which will be useful in any job.

Plus, remember that most people have the best time of their entire lives at uni!

of course you can - you cna work from the age of 13 however the work you can do will be very limited until you reach 16.



The sort of work you can do and the hours you can work will be limited for example you will not be able to work with age restricted products eg alcohol/cigarettes/gambling. You will also not be able to work with dangerous products eg coffee machines.



Check out your local county council website for exact restrictions.

If you are struggling to find work the best thing to do is pop along to your local Connexions centre and ask them to help you write a CV, there are also a lot of websites which can help you with this. A CV is a document which will provide potential employers with information about yourself and what you can bring to their workplace. At your age it is unlikely you will have much work experience but you can make up for this by putting in lots of positives in your personal profile section which is a breif introduction to you.

Hope this helps!!

Try in your local industrial estate. There are always folk who forget/can't be bothered to bring a packed lunch/dinner. The guy in the trailer near where my husband works makes a fortune - not to mention great bacon butties-as well as other more substantial stuff. As the factories work 6 days out of 7 , he makes a regular living too.

When you get your licence to trade you will need to contact the organisers of the car boot sale for permission to pitch. I did ask on sunday morning at a local boot sale (a big one) how much the catering van paid in rent for his 6 hour pitch and it was £80. I think there is a limit as to how many trailers are allowed at these venues. Don't forget you will need public liability insurance in case your gas cannisters blow up or you serve a dodgy beefburger.

Career change advice needed?



I'm currently an administrator, which i have been for three years, after doing NVQs and Diplomas in my Administration Apprenticeship.



But i've decided i want to become a counsellor/therapist. I'm going to be doing voluntary for a charity, which will involve offering support and counselling to those who live with eating disorders. I'm hoping that this voluntary work will help me as to whether i want to do this for a living.



But i need to know how and where to get started, if i decide to do this. For example, courses, colleges, qualifications etc. Has anyone been trained for doing so, and what did you have to do?



Many thanks!

If this is what you really want to and is your passion, then by all means go for it.  I'm a teacher and now I want get away from teaching to focus on social issues with children.  Hence i'm studying social science.  I think it's a good move but what you could do is check universities online and see what they offer in that field.  Then you might be able to do some of the courses/programmes online while you're at your job so you wont be losing much.  Goodluck though.

Can someone please help me with my job application form?



I have only just recently left school so I have no previous history of employment. I have been given a job application form for starbucks as I am looking for part time work while I attend college. The application asks me : Why do you think great customer service is important at starbucks? . . I know what to write it's just harder to think how I am going to put this down on paper in a more formal tone if you know what I mean. Any help would be great . Thank- you

If  customer has a good experience then they will come back to Starbucks. That helps increase turnover and profits, and sustains company's good image. There is a lot of competition in the coffee shop world and Starbucks need to remain competitive. Customers are paying and deserve high standards of service.

Good luck with the application

because starbucks depends on repeat customers, an excellent customer experience makes them want to come back.  fun service is a trademark of starbucks.  starbucks is the premier coffee beverage provider and attention to the individual customer is an important part of the experience.

A co worker lashed out at me and has 8 years sinority over me. what should i do?



i work in a law firm now. my previous job, i had an excellent relationship with my boss and co workers. i came here and myt life is miserable. i keep trying to connect with my bosses and co workers and they just dont seem to like me. they make you feel very uncomfortable and intimidated. i ask them to go out to lunch (co workers) and they never want to go out. friday, everyone was joking around about a shirt my boss got from a client. we wre all laughing. one of my co workers happens to wear shirts similar to the one my boss got. i laughed and said that looks like something you would wear. i think he dresses very nice and the shrit (in my opinion was very nice) he started screaming, cursing and yelling at me. he was insulted and everyone else said the shirt was ugly. i was trying to join in with everyone and he ruined it for me by yelling and using foul language. i want to leave this place but the market is bad. ive been posting resumes all over. i always had a good relationship w/everyone i worked with. whats their problems? i try my best and no one acknowledges it. i try to fit in and they make it hard for me what are their problems? One other thing about this man, hes been there for 8 years and one of the partners have a problem w/ him because hes always late and asks me to call and ask where he is. my boss does have an attitude towards me but is this one advantage over me? ive only been there for 4 months but i would like to appear a "better worker" over these people. mayble their jealous? how can I benefit from this until i get another job? i could care less about these peopel because they care less about me and Im sad  because i never felt this way in any job. i always have been on good terms w.bosses and co workers and still stay in touch w/them since i am not working there. i hate these people and this is not like me at all.

Keep your mouth shut. You seem like you probably say too much around these people. It's no that they don't like you, its that they are just not good people and do not trust why you act the way you act.
The guy with the 8 years has that kind of time for a reason, because he is him. Do not leave them yet, do not worry, and by NO MEANS do not betray him or anyone else.
You are fine, just try to deal with not making a connection. If people see you as a mystery, or that your too good for them, they will talk to you on their own.
A buddy of mine had this kind of beef, and just bought a Rolex, redid his hair and clothing style and went silent. Acted like he was a good worker, but that the job was a job, and that he didn't need it.
Eventually people wanted to know his secret, and gave in. Revealing very bad things about themselves and establishing trust with everyone.
You can do it, don't be so hard on yourself.

I'd like to get to a point when comparing men and women in this way becomes as unacceptable as saying that you are better or worse at something because of your race.



Parents, teachers and contemparies emphasise certain skills when bringing up girls, and different ones when bringing up boys. I don't think we should see qualities as being exclusively male or female, but that each individual is a blend of different skills and attributes. This male-female polarised view of life is impractical and outdated. And I'm also not sure it was ever entirely true. Working class women always worked while bringing up the kids and minding the house. The idea of a stay at home mum was a pretty middle class one.



I was brought up with many examples of strong, hardworking, intelligent women around me and I learnt to respect the contribution they made to my family, the wider community and to their work. I know families where the woman had to be both provider and carer because of divorce or death - quite common after the last war. But I also know of a family where the father took on the mother's role after his wife died. Despite everyone saying he wouldn't manage he did and was a brilliant dad to two daughters and now a brilliant grandad.



Obviously there are some physical differences, but strength comes in many forms. My wife might not be able to lift as much as me, but I absolutely know that I would not have been able to cope with child birth like she did.

The stresses of modern society, such as the cost of providing a home, mean that more than ever men and women need to work in partnership. And there can be positive side-effects to this: I've had much more opportunity to spend time with my children and watch them grow - unlike my father, to his regret - because my wife works.

I've seen many positive things change about the workplace because of the increase in women in work, and it's hard to imagine going back to how things were ten or fifteen years ago. Women have so much to offer in a business environment, and we lose so many opportunities because we don't take full advantage of their skills, insights and different working styles. I often wonder how long we can go on pretending that 50% of the population should be paid less or given less opportunities than the other 50% based simply on their genitalia.

But I think that things are changing and I hope that by the time my son and daughter are of working age, they will enjoy equal opportunities based on their skills, drive and goals rather than on their sex.

Here's my take on Feeling vs. Thinking:  Women are born with more mechanical ability than men so they do things when it feels right.  Men, however, being born handicapped have to think about it. LOL

Veritas: I think (!) your final statement is laughably inaccurate. If women didn't think, we would have no female scholars and to suggest that men don't "feel" is dehumanising and dismissive of their needs.

You only have to look at the differing attitudes to sex to see that this similarity isn't the case. The majority of women need an emotional attachment before they will sleep with someone, whereas most men feel no such need. Men and women think on different levels, how can they be the same?

Perhaps it sounds a touch flippant but an area where women always outperform men is motherhood. Although this is an area men can, by definition, never enter, in an age of increased pressure in the workplace, skewed work/life balances and high divorce rates we shouldn’t undervalue the contribution to society being a good mother brings. Regardless of what kind of family they come from, healthy, happy, loved children can only go on to ensure Britain is a better place.

An area of life where women outperform men, is death, or moreover, avoiding it

In the United Kingdom in 2004 women were continuing to live longer than men.

Boys and girls born in 2004 could expect on average to live to 77 and 81 years of age respectively. This contrasts with the turn of the last century when boys born in 1901 could expect to live to 45, and girls to 49. The increase in life expectancy at birth has increased between 1970 and 2004 by eight years for males and six years for females.

I dont think women outperform men in any area's men and women can do exactly the same things at exactly the same level, I just think that from an early age we are fed the notion that women are better with children and men are better with cars etc, if we all stopped with the competition men and women would thrive together not seperatly, obviously they cant carry children but i know alot of single dads that are doing the job of mum better than most women,

I don't know who you are, but here is an interesting one:  In the super-macho high-testosterone world of extreme elevation mountaineering, women are actually better equipped to survive than men!  Their bodies are better insulated, they have better balance, and they generally acclimate faster and require less oxygen overall!!  I'm not a woman but I have followed the careers of several women who were really astonishing climbers.

I think it is not possible to generalize this issue for a number of reasons. Here are a few that I think are relevant: 
1. Despite our sex, we have different abilities and inclinations, and are further complicated by the lives we lead, opportunities we have, and the time we are born in. My mother is the best storyteller I know, but she was born into a repressive society that forced her to become a houseslave. My father loves art but he is an engineer. Naturally, their performances would need to be contrasted with how they would act had they been given the chance to actually choose what they wanted. 
2. Traditional roles are still too strong even in the most progressive societies no matter what people say. Our view of success is very relative. 
3. Economic and social constraints also adversely affect what people can achieve in any given time frame.



I believe we can only take specific individuals at a specific point in time at a specific location to make this kind of statement.

After the Beijing Conference it became obvious how easily women match up to men in all areas of life.When put side by side, women most of the time will outperform men.Unfortunately, getting higher positions and the big Salaries has eluded women The area of life where woman outperform men the most  is management. Management in general is a woman's thing, If everything has been managed well you will find a woman being at the helm of affairs or having a hand in it. Women are more careful,  caring patient and meticulous in managing affairs. The  strongest point for the woman is home management.

Salary payment has been delayed (late) because the employer is sick or any reason.Do they break the law? ?



Since I have been giving them email or sms about the late payment. The next day I had been waiting there were no answers until I gave them a call and noticed that the employer was sick (although sometimes they delay the payments as it because of "they forget"). Do you think "they are considered breaking the law or agreement if they delay the payment as it because I found out the employer was sick"?

Seriously, I suggest you try being LESS confident.  Many people 'shut down' if a Salesperson is too confident, it makes them feel like you are bamboozling them.

Try pulling your energy back alittle, sound like you're trying to learn what you have to sell, this will make them feel more trusting towards you and put them in a better frame of mind to buy. It worked for me, increased my sale by over 50%

Good luck and keep going, you'll be fine...cheers

There are the obvious choices such as law firm, and public service positions, but there are some not so obvious - military lawyer, research positions, house counsel to non law related corporations, and there are a variety of dual degree options.  There are doctors that are becoming lawyers as well and are then used as expert witnesses in medical cases.  Law Librarianship, FBI, there's lots of options.



To have a law degree of any value, it should come from a school that is approved by the American Bar Association. Most are based at a university.  None of the correspondence or distance ed schools are ABA approved.  Most law schools have recruiters as well as career services offices.  If you are serious, call up a few and see what they offer.

You can work for the unions doing things like negotiations, and policies. You could also work for immigration, Google, MS, and some other companies that need legal advice or advisers. There is quite a bit that you can do without practicing law.  Yes, you really do have to go to university to study law.

It is difficult to be enthusiastic about a job you don't really want but it is best to seem keen if you want a real chance of being offered the job. Looking smart and professional will give you confidence, and then maintain good eye contact throughout the interview. When asked why you want the job you could say that you take pride in doing a job well and would enjoy the experience of working in such a prestigious hotel.

You say, "Because I enjoy working as part of a team and I'm a busy type of person who always likes to be on the go." make out that you are energetic and never like to be still...so the fact that you will be busy moving from room to room will really suit you. Say you are not a sitting down in an office type of person...and yes you CAN say that you enjoy cleaning...plenty of people do...they find it satisfying...just say that you have been always doing the housework at home since a young age.

Under UK law, everyone has to have written terms and conditions of employment within 8 weeks of starting. 
In the absence of written terms, the statutory conditions apply, which means you get minimum holidays, sick leave, etc etc.

If it's just a part-time job you want how about looking at your nearest supermarket
however if you want to put your results to a good cause I would go to your old high school or somewhere and ask if they need a tutor for a subject you did well in ( in september when school starts)
i know a friend who did that in maths and got quite well paid whilst in uni.

Will I be sacked for going home sick?



I am in work at the mo...I feel like absolute crap...I was physically sick before I came in this morning, i've got a throbbing headache, and my whole body is aching. I have been diagnosed with crohns disease, which gives me severe stomach pains and diohrea and ive had a lot of time off sick. I'm currently on my final warning for taking time off. I started work at 3.45am and I'm supposed to be here until 3.15pm, but as I said I feel like crap and I want to go home, but i'm scared to ask in case it leads to me being sacked.
I can't afford to lose my job!
Do my employers expect me to never be off sick again?
I don't know what i'm supposed to do...can anyone help?...has anyone else faced this situation before?



</question>



<additional details>



I can't go to the doctors untill tomorrow, at the earliest...I'll phone up as soon as they open in the morning. I am on medication for my illness, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything, for my symptoms so I'll speak to the doctor about that.
I know that as soon as I ask to go home my team leader will have an attitude with me, and try to make me feel guilty about going home.

This sort of dilemma usually attracts many unhelpful responses, however well meaning they are.Explain to your doctor exactly your problem and your situation , bear in mind he can only concern himself with your physical condition, perhaps he may refer your another specialist, the bottom line is that at the time of his examination of you your condition rendered you incapable of work.Your employer will decide in time to act within the law and offer you to resign with an agreed figure dependant on your period of service thus far, its a hard world he(employer ) cannot afford to keep you under the present circumstances, and you, not able to work, consistently, for him. Does this help?

Well, my wife was a manager at a pizza joint for many years and got fed up after a while too. With her manager experience she got a job at Krogers, a big chain grocery store.  She didn't get in at manager level, but some kind of high end Customer service thing (not a regular clerk at C.S. desk) (does money and alot of important duties including running the floor).  She makes about 16.00 an hour.  She has no college experience.  But just the manager skill can get you into manager or assist manager spots at just about anywhere.  Doesn't really matter that your experience is in food service industry. You can go into retail, gas stations, grocery stores and many others with your experience.

Sounds like you need a good vacation more than a new job.  I suggest two weeks to just "recharge" your batteries.

But if you feel a new job is the way to go remember that if you get another job like the one you have you'll have to deal with the same immature employees and an owner that could be worse than the one you have now.



If you look for a new job make sure that it is a step up.  You are giving up a lot with 18 years on the same job.  I'm sure that there is an amount of respect and trust that you have that you will have to re-earn.

My suggestion is that you take the vacation.  Tell your boss, "you can lose me for two weeks, or lose me forever..  your choice."  And tell them you want the vacation WITH pay.  You've earned it.

You must bow out gracefully and that is accomplished by starting your own business on the side. When the income reaches the level you are comfortable with you make your move, you will know when the time is right. This is much easier to accomplish than most of our society thinks. We have to find the cure for the cancer that has swept our nation called a "job", the cure is to invest in yourself and get out of your comfort zone. You do not need a degree, alot of money, or come from a rich family, it comes from your heart. I am retired now due to the fact that I have never worked for anyone except myself since the age of 17. My time is now devoted to helping as many serious people I can do the same thing. I am always available to answer your questions and help in anyway I can.

You will need references, so supply them.  Before you put them down, make sure you alert those you cite that they might be contacted.  Verification of employment vs. references are two different things.  List references for people that you worked closely with, that know your work.  Good luck!

they are of the same profession but a barrister is more versed in the law than a solicitor.  In other words a solicitor is deemed to be lower than a barrister.  Barristers undergo different training to solicitors and can command more in earnings.

In the UK a solicitor takes care of his client whilst the case is in a civil cort or magistrates court. 
If the ase is sent for trial in the Crown courts as they are called the solicitorr then assists the barrister to represent the client in the crown court!

You have done the right thing by asking your employer for time off work, however, they don't have to accept this if there is a business reason for not granting it.

If, however, you are the only person that works in your department, then your employer could be in breach of contract if they refuse to allow you any time off.  You should check whether any other colleagues are treated the same or differently.

You have a number of options if you are not receiving your full holiday entitlement form your employer.  You should try to resolve the matter informally at first, however if this doesn't work, you should raise a formal grievance under the organisation's formal grievance procedure.  If you have trade union representation, they should be able to advise you as well.

There are also organisations that can help to mediate between you and your employer, such as ACAS or the Citizen's Advice Bureaux.  If all else fails, you can look into the option of contacting an employment tribunal, but let's hope it doesn't come to that.

Generally leave (all types, including holiday leave) is at the discretion of your direct Manager, though it can be denied on the basis of 'operational requirements', eg; over christmas or easter period when it may be peak period for some businesses, and they need all hands on deck.

For your situation, it seems simple. You said you have already asked... So what did they say? They must give you an answer straight away (within reason), so you need to press them again for their answer. I understand that they may have no-one to replace you, though this is their issue not yours. At any time you could actually quit altogether, then where would that leave them. It is their responsibility to find appropriate staff coverage, especially for when you (only staffer) WILL (want to) go on leave (holiday, sick, bereavement etc).

Tell them you have already bought your airline tickets and paid for villa in Greece, etc..



Trust that they will be fair, and that they value your contribution to the company to give you deserved time off. Otherwise threaten to quit, then see what they let you do then !!

if you have given the right notice then your employer should be able to get cover for you in this time untill you get back, you are entitled to paid holidays by law but it depends what your contract says about when you take your holidays, they can refuse you certain dates but you have done everything the right way so you should be ok

Firstly, your employer is breaking the law if you don't have a contract.

Secondly, the law doesn't require 28 days annual leave yet - that comes in next April.  At the moment it is minimum 24 days, with no legal requirement for paid bank holidays - subject to you working a 5 day week.
Under working time legislation, you are entitled to this paid annual leave - but this can be at your employers convenience/discretion.  But at some point, you are entitled to the time off (i.e. not paid in lieu).

Speak with the HR manager - and if you don't have one, contact ACAS - they are very good.

You could ask for a Saturday job and ease yourself in that way. Most employers are looking for a bit of extra help at the weekend. 
Don't think that employers are doing you a favour, think rather that they are paying you what you have either earned or deserve. They will be getting your loyalty and commitment in exchange for a salary. None of us knew how to go on when we were your age, we all had to learn, and any employer worth working for will know that. Take your courage in both hands, put a smile on your face and ask for work. If they don't have anything for you, move on to the next shop until someone takes you on. All the ones who said no don't know what they are missing.

I want to say 'face your fears' and just go and ask cus it's the only way. Most small business people (cafe/bar owners) are more than happy to help and wanting to employ enthusiastic young faces.. go for it. If not just simply send your cv with a kick *** covering letter. You can do it, and if you want more confidence, getting a job will certainly help

No regular pay rises anymore?



I have worked for my employer for 4 1/2 years, and 2 1/2 years ago I transferred from a small city office to their head office on the outskirts of the city, as a result of the small office closing down.  The year after I transferred I was told I was not entitled to a pay rise because I earnt more than my colleagues (we're talking a few hundred pounds, not thousands) as I came from a city office, and therefore earnt more.  This year I was given 1% pay rise, whereas everyone else received between 2 - 4%.



I have ben told that if they give me any pay rises then I will continue to earn more, which is not fair on them.  My argument is that firstly I was not told about this before I transferred, and secondly that my pay rise (or lack of) is being judged solely on my colleagues salaries rather than my work performance (always excellent reviews).  While I understand where they are coming from, how does a company expect anyone to be happy with this excuse long-term?  Is this really fair?  I am starting to feel under-valued and demotivated, and feel I cannot sustain working for a company that is going to use this excuse every year.

In my own experience you will normally achieve a 10 to 15% pay rise by changing jobs and only 2 to 5 % by staying 'loyal' to one employer.

You can't change jobs every year but it sounds like yours is overdue.

I'm not sure what employment law says on this matter, but I think that if an employee is forced to relocate the employer must offer some compensation to offset any costs (such as rehousing or extra transport costs) to the employee.
I work in the public sector and if my post becomes redundant and I am offered a new post at a lower grade then my salary is frozen until the new salary 'catches up'. This may be a condition negotiated by the unions. I would advise you to see a solicitor if the the loss of earnings is enough to warrant it.

You are not being undervalued. You are in a particular cicumstance where to be fair to the bulk of the staff they have to be less than generous to you. You say that you were not told that the pay would be lower at HO in the outskirts. That may be so but i find it hard to believe that you were not aware of it. Most people have a pretty fair idea of how the pay structures work throughout their companies.

they are not going to use the 'excuse' [it is NOT an excuse, it is a reason] every year, only until your salary is on parity with the HO rate.

You are only seeing this from your own point of view! I cannot blame you for that, but there is another point of view - the other staff members.

Five years ago, the organisation that i work for when taking over work on sub-contract had to take on 2 of the other parties staff and take over their existing employment contracts on the same terms. These 2 people joined a close knit team of 10 and under 'their' contracts, they started off being paid 20% more than the existing team members and got 6 weeks annual leave instead of 4.  This caused quite a lot of bad feeling amongst the existing staff. The 2 new staff members have had their salary pegged since they joined and have not had an increase in 5 years!  they are now on the same rate as the rest of us. The company cannot do anything about the additional holiday allowance.

Have you considered that had you continued reciving a higher salary then your new colleagues may have become the ones feeling undervalued.

Finally, you mention your excellent reviews, perhaps your colleagues also receive excellent reviews and are every bit as smart as you!

ps Migellito - conditions in the private sector are very different from in the public sector!

It's common for the amount of your raise, if any, to depend on where you currently are in the salary range.  Also, ranges are typically lower in areas with a lower cost of living.  You benefitted from an effective "raise" when you transferred to the new area, with a lower cost of living.

It is of course your right to look for a new job if you feel you can do better elsewhere.

This is very, very similar to my own situation.

I have not had a payrise since March 2006 because apparently, I'm overpaid compared with my colleagues.  My colleagues have received regular increases to the point where they now earn more or less the same as me.

However, I am not overpaid in the slightest.  Compared with the market rate for my role and industry, I receive a very low salary - my employer has managed to keep its salaries low by employing foreigners who are not familiar with UK salaries and therefore were not able to negotiate a better rate for themselves.

I agree that it is completely unfair to base your salary on someone else's.  Okay, it might be fair enough in a company or industry which uses specific bandings or gradings to award pay, but my employer does not and most people's salaries are arbitrary.

Anyway, I have been arguing this point for a whole year now.  I took it to my Account Director, then to his Manager, and then finally to the CEO.  The Account Director and his Manager were the ones that had been arguing that it was fair.  The CEO agreed that it was extremely unfair, but said "What do you want me to do about it?  It isn't fair if I get involved in negotiating your salary and no-one else's."

Therefore, I know that now my only chance of getting a proper salary increase is to leave my current employer.  I'm still weighing up my options - there are a few good reasons why I would like to stay in the long-term due to prospects for career progression - but at the same time, money is important.

But, I completely agree with you - it does make me feel undervalued and demotivated.  For that reason I have started to look for a new job - just looking, not necessarily with a view to definitely leaving - but I posted my CV on Monster and my Line Manager found it as I work in recruitment.  I was honest with her and told her about the salary situation but although she is my Line Manager, she has no budgetary responsibility and therefore cannot agree an increase herself.  She has now agreed to talk to our Manager, but of course the outcome is just going to be the same as before.

So, I would expect for them to continually use that excuse, and you should consider leaving.  It might not be the right way for you to go at this time as I'm not sure that it is for me, but if you can be clear with yourself on your reasons for staying, then that will be your motivation rather than money.

You can wash cars, baby sit, do lawn work, pull weeds, do trash removal. I know a man, and his family who were very down on their luck. His daughters felt very bad for their dad, who had lost the family business to a fire. The girls were 9, and 11 at the time. They decided to do the old fashioned lemonade stand, with their moms help, and recipe. After one day they made $8 dollars, $5 the next, and gave the money to their parents. Pretty humble beginning, though the girls thought it was a lot of money. Soon they had people stopping by after work, moms bringing their kids during the day, a day care school stopped by fairly regularly. Anyway, their parents decided to try a Saturday market near their home. It was fairly successful. Then they went to the state fair, even more successful. In about 3.5 years they have grown to over a $250,000 per year business(they go to several state fairs each year now), all because those girls wanted to help their parents.

Child labor laws prohibit minors from working. That's just the government and its purpose is to protect kids from being exploited. Hey if you really want to work, move to china or mexico. This doesn't mean that you can't make money. You can set up your own business like others teens and tweens have over the years, some of them being quite successful. Your local library has a number of books that can help you like "Fast Cash for Kids" by Bonnie & Noel Drew. Ask for it. There are traditional teen jobs like babysitting and yard/house work but if you think about it, you're not limited to that kind of thing. You can sell products and/or provide services that people need. What you do depends on what you can do, what you enjoy doing and what people are willing to pay for. You will make more money working for yourself than for an employer so you have that edge. Discover and use your talents, time and equipment to build a reputable and profitable business. How about the following types of things:

Puppet Shows or Story Time for Younger Kids
Recycling Center for bottles, cans, paper, etc.
Copyright your own design (t-shirts, magnets, bumper stickers)
Furniture Refinishing (turn trash to treasure)
Sell books on specific topics
Write a book or newsletter
Teach people to do things you enjoy (computers?)
Make and Sell Crafts (garden flags, jewelry, ceramics)
Host Yard Sales for busy neighbors
Iron Clothes and/or do laundry
Sell energy light bulbs or programmable thermostats

The list goes on and on but short of selling alcohol, tobacco and firearms you are pretty much free to sell all kinds of products. Get your parents on board to help you. Create a business with integrity and your customers will soon find you.

There've been some pretty profitable businesses at home so yours can be also... Dell Computers, Microsoft, Ebay, Coca Cola, and even Trump Corporation all began small and began at home. Find and need and fill it.

I used this resume writing service in my area, this is the email address, (resume.help50@yahoo.com) you should try them, it only cost me $35.00 and I got a great job from this new resume, I never thought about the format that they use but the turn around time was less then 24 hrs.  I would have to say it was the best service I have ever used and it was worth every dime.  Also they let me pay through paypal.

Depending on your background, you could consider medical transcription, coding or billing.  I was a home based medical transcriptionist for 13 years.

Most transcriptionists get training while others bring their terminology skills from other health related careers. Most remote jobs require experience so there's a catch-22 in getting started however many doctors' offices and hospitals will hire newer candidates. Transcriptionists then can work from home once gaining the experience.

Lots more on this field on the website below, including free directory listings for transcriptionists.

I am a consulting engineer on mechanical and electrical installations in buildings.

My tips are as follows:-

1. Always make sure you put radiators under a window.

2. If you want to be energy efficient, one of the best things you can do is address the efficiency of your lighting - try to use compact fluorescents where possible.

3. Renewable energy - currently, for housing, solar panels on your roof and ground source heating will only pay back their initial investment, including any funding you can get, in 30 - 40 years at best.

4. New houses - the heat loss in winter is actually greatest through bathroom ventilation, if you have a large bathroom or more than one. Install a heat recovery unit.

5. In the near future, the water companies may reduce their guaranteed pressure to your house, meaning, depending on the area, you will have to buy a booster pump to get water to anything higher than ground floor level.

6. Wind turbines on housing DO NOT contibute anything significant in terms of energy.

EDIT: What a great question - I was hoping a KFC employee would tell us just what the secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices really is...

I would advise people to pay off debts based on interest rate being charged, not on actual loan amount.



The higher the interest the quicker the loan should be paid off. it saves you money in the long term.

There are aspects of public administration that are very similar to corporate governance, yet the social and ethical foundations distinguish it - performing a functions that supports doing works of public good. The MPA can be viewed as similar to an MBA for those wishing to pursue governmental or non-profit careers. An MPA often entails substantial the ethical and sociological aspects not usually found in business schools.

In recent years, public administration theory has occasionally connoted a heavy orientation toward critical theory and postmodern philosophical notions of government, governance, and power, but many public administration scholars support a classic definition of the term which gives weight to constitutionality, service, bureaucratic forms of organization, and hierarchical government.

As it relates to my field (which isn't public administration). . . it's a legitimate academic field for the same reason that business administration is a legitimate academic field.  Basically, an MPA is the equivalent of an MBA for those who are working in the public sector (or who at least spend a lot of time working with the public sector while in the private sector) rather than the private one.

If you're talking about at the undergraduate level. . . then, no, I can't help you much.  I don't know enough about what either business or public administration majors do for jobs to even attempt to defend that sort of thing.

Odd question you've asked...  Tell me,  why it shouldn't be a legitimate academic field?  It's a specialized public service that has existed for thousands of years, and decisions must be made that often don't come up in a single life's experience.  How's that for an answer?

Sort of like asking, "Why is Hospital Administration a legitimate academic field?" or, "Why is Astronomy a legitimate academic field?"

I don't recall ever see PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION available as an undergraduate major.  Majority of Administrator jobs esp supervisory ones in the Government and even private industry require comprehensive background to seeing whole picture of an organization and each one of its components.  There are major haedaches so to speak: OPERATIONS, LOGISTICS, FINANCIAL MGMT, HUMAN RESOURCE etc so in general, I seriously doubt if graduating with a Bachelor's degree in Public Administration is going to OPEN THE RIGHT DOORS to a good job when one graduates from college bec good decisions in real life requires hands-on experience in different work areas in order to understand the whole picture, bec keeping the unit one is assigned efficient and at break even within budget &lt;= is something not possible to be taught in the classroom...

Hope the Above Info Helps!

Advice wanted from experienced people?



Well i attend a reputable uni in the uk and do electrical and electronics eng. I recently got my results and i have failed my 1st year. I thus got moved to the ordinary electrical and elctronics course. The course is exactly the same as the normal electrical and electronics eng but i will be doing 3 modules over the enxt 2 years less than what i would have done if i was still doing the normal course.

How badly have i hit the chances of me getting a good job?



i am generally a confident person. work well in team and a great person to be with. Hope that this will help!

The key thing is to buckle down now and make sure you pass the next two years.

If you do this it will be ancient history.

I know of numerous successful graduates who messed up one or two years but still came through.

If you pass you will get the job and then it will purely down to performance in the job.

Depends what job you want to do. You could end up doing something not remotely related to your career. However the UK always has a shortage of engineers, and there are tons of graduate schemes from industry to railways, logistics etc, so I don't think you'll do too badly

that's all fine and dandy but you also need to be knowledgeable of what your learning. working in the skill you are attempting to learn takes precise know how and you cant just get by on confidence,working well in a team situation, and being an all around great person to be with., that's ok if your at a party and playing games and all but this type of work can be dangerous as well as deadly...

you have to buckle down and really be serious about learning what your being taught... apparently you teachers see you haven't got what it takes to become an electronics eng.and the classes you were taking were possibly too much for you to handle with no time to actually study and learn it.. for each class you take in your major you need at least 2-4 hours of study time a day. if your over loaded with too many classes you cut your study time down to zilch... there fore you will not learn all of what you need to learn... its harder to retain information when your brain is being overloaded... 
take your teachers advice and down size your work load and make more time for study time. also get hooked up with a Tudor too. they can help you study and retain what you need to remember and know for what you are studying for...

Do your homework.Research the company beforehand so that you can showcase that knowledge during the interview. The internet is a great resource, you can google the company, check business journals for company information, like ranking, sales, mission statement. This will give you a background and later you will be able to ask informed question.

Know where you’re going. Make sure to find out where the office is and how to get there. There are several free sites devoted to directions, Mapquest, Google Maps and Yahoo maps. Know how long the trip will take. Take the name and phone number of the person you’ll be meeting with. Know what the parking situation is, adjust your time accordingly. Save yourself time and unnecessary stress by knowing these things before heading to the interview.

Dress the part.As an Employment Specialist I have experienced this first hand. Two job candidates, different skills, both had criminal background. One gentleman was applying for a warehouse position. He had a suit on. The employers response, “finally someone to interview. The other candidate, more qualified, he wouldn’t take out his facial piercing, no job. Interviews, but no jobs. Your clothing should be neat, pressed, and professional looking. As it can be difficult to know the culture of the office environment beforehand, err on the side of conservative. However, don’t be afraid to inject some personality into your look, and don’t neglect the details. Make sure to have a fresh haircut and clean, manicured nails.

Rehearse beforehand.Prior to your interview, prepare answers to common questions the interviewer is likely to ask, such as What are your strengths and weaknesses? Why do you want to work here? Why should we hire you? and the ever popular Tell me about yourself. You can download interview questions. Conduct a mock interview with a trusted friend as practice. This works best if you can record it. This way you can see what your body language is saying as well. Non-verbal communicates makes up to 80% to 90% of the message being sent.

Go in with a great attitude and a terrific smile.  Wash, condition, and brush your hair.  Wear deodorant and a pair of pants and shirt jus above wht you'd be expected to wear at the job.

When they say, 'tell me about yourself,' do NOT reply with, 'what would you like to know?'

This is where you tell them 2-3 things about yourself.

Mine: I'm a person who works well under pressure and doesn't mind having to prove myself in order to have more responsibility. . . . .



Then I give examples of a time I performed under pressure and another when I proved myself to attain more responsibility.

Relax...it's that simple. The most important part of an interview is that you and your interviewer "connect". If they feel comfortable with you and you have the skills to do the job then you stand a very good chance.

If you don't connect on a personal level, you stand next to no chance of being offered the job.

Relax, and don't let the nerves get to you.

Don't over prepare for the interview by trying to anticipate what questions are going to be asked.  Just be yourself (your professional self), be confident, and answer each question honestly and things will be just fine.  Instead of focusing on the questions they are going to ask, focus on what questions you're going to ask them.  You'll really impress the interviewer by having well thought out questions and showing general knowledge about the company.

Hope this helps.

look at the job spec which will give you an idea of questions that will be asked
The job role requires  that you are able to work well in a team as well as being able use your own initiative.
You need to be the type of person who is honest and reliable and conscientious.
You will need to explain your views on equality and diversity.( this is really important),that you demonstrate respect and confidentiality.show that you consider good communication as very important including being able to listen. Let the interviewer know that you would always ask advice if there was a situation you were unsure of.
You will also probably be asked how you would deal with a situation regarding discovering a problem regarding a colleagues conduct and what you would do. ( raise it with your line manager). Dress smartly, be confident and give yourself time to think about the questions before answering.Take a bottle of water and Good luck!!!!

Good for you!  My best advice is to learn all that you can about the company. Learn what you can about their products, where's their biggest market, what stores do they sell to,etc.  Admit what you don't know, but give examples of similar things that you were able to learn quickly - for example, if they ask if you've ever  done any bookkeeping and you haven't - be honest, but let them know that you're eager to learn and have some similar experience. "No, I've never done accounts payable, but I'm a very organized record keeper.."



Usually at the end of an interview you're asked, "Do you have any questions?" - that's a perfect time to give a big smile and ask something like,"Well, all of my friends are asking when you're coming out with X design..." or something along those lines. Show a genuine interest in the company, be friendly, and always,always thank the interviewer for their time.

Oh, Sara, best wishes and luck to you, how excited you must be!
They might ask you:
Why do you want to work here? ("I like art and making things with my hands") What wage are you looking for? ("Whatever wage you start your entry-level employees at.") What -talents- do you bring to this company? ("I'm honest and conscientious, I care that what I do is of good quality.")
Good questions for you to ask them might be:
Is there opportunity for advancement?
Do you often have overtime, and is it required?
What, in your opinion, would be the hardest part of my job description?
What, in your opinion, is the quality most desired from the person you're looking to hire? (When this is answered, tell them, "I have that quality!")
Take deep breaths and try to be calm, you'll do great.

for one, research the company alittle. think of a good question to ask at the end of the interview. alot of people ask, what are your best/worst qualities about you. or how you would improve yourself. why would you be good for their company or what do you have to offer. then, pick out a nice outfit to wear. a button up shirt or nice top and black or tan pants. and nice shoes to match whatever color pants you may wear. (no gym shoes). make sure your first impression is good by look clean.  make sure you have a reasonable hair style. when you speak do it with confidence. that is a big part in getting a job. be confident, but not cocky. be positive, and relax. ( make sure to give a nice firm hand shake but not too hard at the end of the interview and thank them for their time in seeing you and tell them that you hope to hear from them soon) good luck.

the key to a good solid interview is CONFIDENCE.  You should display confidence in what you are doing.  There is no real preparation for an interview ... you should just go in with confidence and honesty.

Don't tell them that you have experience if you dont, you can tell them that you are a "quick learner" and have always had an interest in printing T-Shirts but have never done it.

Do you have reliable transportation to and from work?  That is something you want to bring up if not asked.  (That you DO have transportation, that is.)

When you are done with your interview ... be direct and say "So when do you want me to start work?"  That is confidence!

do a bit of research into the company you are getting an interview to work for. they may ask... 'what do you know about the company?'
another question they may ask is 'what can you bring to the company?'
thats when you can talk about your experience in designing your own t-shirts and stuff.
ALWAYS keep eye contact, relax, smile and enjoy it! When you first meet your interviewer...shake their hand. introduce yourself!
enjoy the experience of your 1st interview and learn from it.
sites like 'fish4jobs' may have advice on interview techniques.

unless you are applying for a job that includes design, I wouldn't mention designing your own shirts. Be confident and know the facts about the co. before your interview, make a list of questions to ask the interviewer, dress for the interview and most of all, be confident!

Yes you should definately say you designed your own T-Shirts! You never know they may eventually us your designs (which would be awesome!) just be yourself otherwise, be smartly dressed, clean and tidy, make sure you eat breakfast and get an early night tonight so your not lethargic and tired!

And if you don't get the job - you are still one interview closer to your Job. Another thing is to ask for feedback after the interview - admit that you would like to know of anyways that you can improve your interview manner - it shows your future employer that you are willing to adapt and apply yourself!

Good Luck!!!!

When preparing for a job interview, the first prerequisite is to identify the qualities most sought after by that particular employer, you should base you performance on those factors in order to impress the head hunters.
Little advice, employer. Always keep in mind one rule: tell them what they want to hear, all the best.

Try imagine what you would ask if you were interviewing. And practice answers.



But don't just write ideas down and memorise them...my top tip is to practice answering out loud. You might feel like a bit of an idiot talking to yourself when you're practising but it works.

Different jobs require different things, such as:

a t-shirt job is not to business but not to casual.

so dress upper casual.

look prompt, neat, alert, and ready for the job.

show eagerness for the job with your attiude but stay



cool.  Show them with your attitude that you are ready



and can handle the job.  This is your time to shine.



Show them what you are worth.  Brag when you get the



chance in a very conserative way letting them know



that you are an asset. (but don't over do it looking bad



or concieted)  Tell them how far you live if you are



close and tell them it is not a problem being on time for



work.  Tell them that you want to work to improve the



company reputation and your own within the



company.  Think as if you had your own business and



what you would expect from someone to work for you!!

As for the (base) pay.  When you will work.  Do they



pay one a week or twice a week (They do that in USA,



I don't know how they are in the UK).  Show good



behavior and manners and don't forget to be



yourself!!



Good Luck!!



I know you will get the job

P.S.  If they tell you they will call you don't worry, that is normal.



wait 3 days then call them and ask about the



(pending) status of your interview.  If they says it is still



in progess then call every 2 days after that and ask



again.  That will show them that you really want the job



and they will be impressed!!  GL!!

i am glad that you have your interview tomorrow ,but to tell you the truth preparing question in advance won't help you much to be relax when you get to the interview (when you will think of some question they may ask ,you must also think of the  answer )may i say that auto planning doesn't always work .be natural .have confident in you ,the think you can do is to boost your intelligence with positive thinking like ;i know i will get the job , i know what are my capacities(the thing i can do)which i am  good in ..they already have your curriculum vitae and the rest will do with your mind more relax it is ,better it will be.good luck.when you go to the interview i guest it is for the job you saw on the news paper .in my opinion i think you should keep what you do on t-shirt for a better time (i mean when you get the job you can use the t-shirt design to get a promotion)or maybe you can work there for a while  and later have your own bussiness.

A letter of application isn't important.  It can be used to highlight why you are a fit for the job, and why you're applying.  But when my candidates send them to me I never read them - I skip straight to the CV.

An interview is essential because without one, all they would know about you is what's written on your CV.  How can a piece of paper determine whether you're a suitable candidate or not?  They need to get a feeling for your interpersonal skills, how you communicate, etc.  Plus, they also want to ask further information that isn't covered on your CV.  They also want to see you - if it's a job where you need to interact with clients, for example, they need to check that you're presentable.  I would also say that how someone interviews is important - in my experience people who are outgoing, bright, confident and personable will always interview well no matter how crap the interviewer is or what odd-ball questions they're thrown, so you can tell a lot about people by how they perform in interviews.

The letter of application is often all that you from an applicant therefore it is very important.

An employer will want to know who they are working with and whether you will fit in, hence the interview.

Letters of application tell a potential employer or work experience host a great deal about you.



For example, have you been able to sell yourself well? Is the letter properly and appropriately constructed? Is the spelling and punctuation correct? Does someone look like they have made an effort? Is someone addressing the criteria in the job spec?

Unless all those boxes are ticked the applicant may well fall at the first hurdle.

In every field I've worked in we have had many dozens, sometimes hundreds, of applications for each position - so we need a way to weed out lots of them quickly. Factors like the above enable us to do just that.

Letters are, in some ways, more important than CVs. People often use a standard CV, sometimes one they've had drawn up by a professional CV company, whereas a letter is more likely to be their own work. Even things like addressing the letter to the correct person (whose name is correctly spelled and the right sex) can make the difference between getting to the next stage or not.

The interview is incredibly important. Is the person punctual? Are they appropriately dressed? Again, about 50% of the people I've interviewed have failed on things like that before they've said anything!

Then we will be looking to see if they can communicate effectively in person. For some jobs we will be putting them under pressure to see how they react. Where people claim knowledge of certain fields or processes we'll be asking them about those to make sure they do.

In other words a work placement is no different to getting a 'proper' job.

It's hard to say what should go on your CV without knowing a little about you and the kind of jobs you're looking for.

Generally, you should emphasise (by putting at the top and giving the most detail) whatever it is that is most likely to attract the employer.

So if you're a school leaver you would prioritise this, followed by any part-time work you've had.

If you've already had a job you would begin with your current or most recent employment details.

There's quite a good guide to writing CVs from Leicester University here: 
http://www.le.ac.uk/ssds/careers/cvs.htm...

The only problem is that it doesn't include any pictures of good CVs. The Work supplement of Saturday's Guardian has a CV clinic every week at the back - that's very good indeed.

Generally you wouldn't put details like those you mention, but if you're very young and never had a job then you could have a field called something like 'positions of responsibility held' and just state that you have looked after your neighbours' animals and babysat regularly

CVs are formal documents and shouldn't be written in the first person (don't use 'I') or sound at all chatty (although your covering letter can be more that way if it's appropriate)

Please ignore the suggestion to mention anything personal (like your sexuality) - that's wholly inappropriate!

Finally, please make sure it's correctly spelled and punctuated. I've discarded more applicants who've told me they have 'GCSE's' than any other single factor!

What do i need for this job?



hi, I'm 16 and i have just started my first year in 6th form. I'm thinking of joining the mounted police force when i leave 6th form, but I'm not sure what i need for it. what qualifications do i need and how would i get into the mounted police? do i have to do any years of normal policing and if so how many? does anyone have a good website that i could find this information on? thanks

if you contact the nearest mounted police force and talk to one of the high ranking officials, they will help guide you in the path you need to take. they enjoy helping teens who are career minded.

You would not join the mounted police. You would start as a police cadet learning how to be a police officer, then you could apply to be assigned to the mounted division. keep in mind though, there are relatively few mounted officers.

Are you interested in working only in a hospital setting? Clinics have Psych departments also, they are usually called Behavioral Health or Mental Health but this is a much safer option to start out if this is what you are interested in specializing in. Plus, you get weekends and holidays off...not to mention a regular day shift of 8-4! I used to be a nurse in Neurology in the clinic and I knew the nurse that ran the Behavioral Health department at the clinic, she was very happy with her job, much less stress than in the hospital, but still dealing with the same aspects.  When working in the clinic you work very closely with the doctors to provide care to the patients. You "room" the patients, getting their vitals and going over the review of systems to get down to the reasons they are their and then the doctor(s) come in make a plan of care and then call you back in to complete any procedure/plan that they have decided upon. Of course, in th eclinic their is a lot of phone work also...calling patients who are in need of medical advice or need their test results. The charting isn't as complicated as it is in a hospital setting because the patient is only in the office for 10-60 minutes, unlike the hospital when they are there for 24 hours or more. There are many more patients to chart on though. It's something to think about, I decided I liked being with my family on weekends, evenings and holidays so I opted for a clinic career. Best of luck to you in nursing school and in your decison to find your "niche".

Applying for B&W Tie Restaurant Server Position- I need to Impress them, HOW?



I have experience at a restaurant for 1.5 years, I made good money. It was in a big tourist city, on a pier in southern california. As you can imagine, it was always busy and you had to please a crowd.

Im going for an interview in 2 weeks for a brand new restaurant where I will need to know wines and different meat cuts and wear black and white with a tie.

I physically am very able. I look nice. I am a young girl, and keep myself looking presentable, and appealing to the eye, but by all means, Im pretty conservative (for comfort's sake). I have a nice straight, white smile, and make good eye contact. I do all those things. I dont need those pointers.

I need JOB SPECIFIC HELP. How can I wow the hiring manager at my interview for this fine dining chain restaurant? Are there any classes to take? Or anything that says "I went the extra mile"

Your help will be much apppreciated.

Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



A little bitter are we Gemini?

I dont think it is shallow at all to emphasize looks when it comes to a nice dining restaurant. Theyre not going to hire some kid with 20 pimples, and greasy hair, with thick rimmed glasses.... Not because they dont think he can do the job.but because he isnt likely to attract guests or invite an easy conversation.

Im not stupid, I worked at a VERY detail oriented restaurant prior. LOOKS ARE IMPORTANT, whether its the 'nice' thing to say or not. You work in a people pleasing industry-- you gotta look the part, its simple.

And I think you can blame the training staff of a restaurant if you get a server that doesnt know the menu. They train you for that. And if the server doesnt know it, they shouldnt have passed their training and been given tables to work. Everybody-- regardless of looks, gets the SAME training.

When your department begins accepting requests, you can get in.

You need to have at least 2 years (passing) in college, 4 years will get you a higher pay. You have to be physically fit, have a good eye for seeing the not-so-obvious, and you cannot have anything above a class B misdemeanor.



You will have to go through the recruitment program, and if you are accepted, then you will move onto the academy. After the academy you will be assigned a patrol job.

If you were called in for orientation, it means you're HIRED : ) During orientation you'll be watching a few videos on Gap Inc., safety procedures and customer service. You'll also be going over the employee discount agreement and topics in the Gap Inc. employee handbook. If theres enough time, you'll be taken on a tour of the entire store as well.

Orientations are usually done for new employees.  I'd say you have the job.  If they're paying you, you're hired.  If you're still unsure, call and ask or ask after the orientation is finished.

My guess is your interviewer thought they told you, but forgot.  They get frazzled doing interviews too.

I am a recruiter, and I recruit for positions that could be based anywhere in Europe.  I conduct interviews in English but 80% of my candidates are not native English speakers - most are German, Italian, French or Spanish.

Last week, I had spend so much time interviewing foreign people, that when I came to type up my notes I found myself imitating their speech patterns instead of using English that was completely correct - it was almost like I'd forgotten how to speak English, even though that is the only language that I speak.

Why would you like to work under a Japanese management?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



It takes a bit of getting used to, but there's no big issue. Generally the newer generation of Japanese are a lot more westernised than they have been in the past. Their work culture is  a bit different though. Generally their corporate culture is more structured and predictable than most European or American companies.

There are some really good companies out there who hire people to work from home.  I am a Dad of 4 and have been working from home for a while. Its possible to find companies without fees or upfront charges.

I looked for a very long time before I found the company I'm with today I will tell you that it is a lot of work and it takes committment.

This website contains a list of some companies that may be hiring, also also some general information on working at home and data entry etc.

http://my-data-entry.blogspot.com/

Take the time to find something you enjoy doing from home and something you believe in because you do not want your home to become a prison that you just do not want to work in.

Harassed at work, should I leave?



I have had to take time off work due to people spreading rumours about me and being made to feel unwelcome by a lot of people to the extent that I can't concentrate on my job, a job I do well normally.
I'm signed off for a week and have to see my normal doctor about extending this. My union says I should go ahead with a formal grievance but as Ihave no real allies then I don't think anyone would back me up in my claims even though they know they're true.
Should I look for another job while off and what can I do to keep spirits up in the meantime?

Being bullied at work is an awful experience and any advice given here is easy compared to actually facing the problem.  I must agree however with your Union and you should submit a formal grievance.  This is for two main reasons.



Firstly, although it is the least line of resistance to leave for another job, this would leave you with unresolved issues that may affect you for some time to come.  Mounting a challenge to these people and leaving under your own terms at a later date may be a better course of action in the long term.

Secondly, your Union would be unable to lodge any potential legal challenge on your behalf if the internal processes have not been engaged with.  Even if you do not feel you want to pursue a legal challenge at this point, you should perhaps consider that you may change your mind and that also, future actions by your employer may present you with that opportunity.

These situations can be extremely damaging to our well being.  The principal cause of this and other stresses is the loss of control we feel.  To this end, your challenging the treatment you are receiving is the first step to taking control of the situation and in my experience, people start to get stronger once they have made that first step of submitting a formal complaint.

Get back to your Union and start researching and understanding your employers policies and procedures.  You will be surprised how much of that control you can claw back from them!  Good luck.

Rumourmongers are sad pathetic people who target others to make themselves feel better.



Go to work and do your job as best you can because the coming recession may hinder your chances of finding employment.

The problem lies with them, not you. If they persist in harassing you, it will give you time to gather sufficient evidence for legal action.

I don't really know your problem. However if it's really true that some people are harassing you and you have no friends there at your work place, then quickly quit the place and look for another place of work where you will be happy. Remember we should enjoy what we do.

If you continue to work at a place where you are unhappy, your life will be miserable and your health will suffer.

Meantime cheer up. Maybe you can try EFT.
Check.

Hello James,

Having worked for the Industrial Tribunals, which deals with unfair dismissals, etc, I feel qualified to answer your question.

My first and most important advice is to contact the Advisory Conciliation & Arbitration Service (ACAS) before doing anything within the company you work for. This is a totally independent government body set up to protect workers and to offer advice & conciliation in workplace issues. The service is free (except the cost of a phone call), confidential and unbiased.

To contact them:

Telephone:  08457 47 47 47

Unfortunately you cannot email ACAS.

The ACAS website is:

http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articl...

Like sex discrimination, sexual harassment, etc it is illegal to to be harassed or bullied in the workplace.

ACAS will be able to advise you on your rights and the best thing for you to do.

If you are being harassed and bullied by your work colleagues you may have grounds to resign from your employment and make a claim for 'Constructive Dismissal' at an Industrial Tribunal. Constructive dismissal is where someone feels they can no longer work for an employer because of the way they are being treated, Health and Safety issues, etc.

Before doing this though you must follow the complaints procedure within your company and give them the opportunity to resolve the problem.



If you have been working for the company for less than a year, your rights may be less than if you have been there for more than a year.

My other advice is to speak, or write to your immediate superior and make a formal complaint about the way you are being treated. If he/she is involved in the harassment then go straight to the person in overall charge of the branch.



If this fails and if the company has a head office, contact them.

Any evidence you have concerning what is happening in your workplace should be kept and copies, etc provided to those your are making the complaint to. Also any witnesses who may be prepared to give evidence on your behalf should be approached.

As has already been suggested, keep a diary of what is happening.

If your employers decide to, dismiss you because you make a complaint, and you have worked for the company for at least a year, you may also have grounds to claim unfair dismissal via an Industrial Tribunal.

I must repeat that before doing anything, you should contact ACAS first.

Good luck and I hope the problems at work can be resolved.

Poseidon is spot on with his advice, however there are a lot of companies that don't do things as they should and you may find that going through a grievance could make the situation worse for you. I have been in this situation and people although were very nice afterwards it was obvious that they were only being that way because they had been told to be. It was so false.
My advice to you is get yourself strong, get some advice first from acas then from your union rep, it wouldn't do you any harm to look for another job in the meantime. You never know a better one may come along.

Can I be sacked for unpaid work?



hi, I'm in a bit of a problem.
Can I be fired for refusing to come in 15 minutes early for work?
(I come in five minutes early, stick my bag in the locker and am ready for work)

My boss now wants us to have a briefing every morning before work.. but not in work time, he wants us to come in 15 minutes early unpaid.
I have said no and he has said A: its normal procedure in retail and B: I will be sacked very quickly if I didnt. (Saying that I wont be ready for work if I havent been at the briefing)

He has also said that at the end of our shift if one section of the shop (any section, not just the one I'm in charge off) is not tidy we will all be kept back until it is, again unpaid.

Now Ive worked here for four months and have just been taken off probation (at the 12 week review) but the boss had his extended.
Im contracted to work at a shop for 40 hours a week (five days a week)

Any help would be good, I think Im going to be sacked on Monday :(

Call your state's labor board. You can not be required to work or attend meetings unpaid. It's federal law. Your boss is breaking it. If you are fired for this, be sure you have documentation about his practices of requiring unpaid work. you may have a case against him, but for that you'd need to speak with a lawyer.

He is threatening, harrasing and bullying you. It is not acceptable. Briefings are paid work as they relate to work. 
It is clear that he is not doing his job ie managing correctly and expects others to take his slack. Don't.
Clearly he's an *** but you need help. If you want to stay in the job then you need to take some quick and decisive action.



Speak directly to his boss, yes go over his head, also call personnel dept to double check your contract and call your unuion representative. If you are not in a union by now join one imediately.

You are not on probation. 
P.S. It is normal procedure in retail to brief staff in normal working hours and staff are paid the hours they work if they are asked to stay late to cover for whatever reason then overtime rates apply...

Don't allow him to sack you, say to him that what he is doing is illegal and state that you are going to contact his superior or your head office immediately.
If you are contracted to work 40 hours per week ask if they are going to allow you leave early to compensate the extra time worked or allow you to bank the extra time for an additional day off.
State that an extra 15 mins per morning adds up to 1 hour 15 extra per week now if you are on minimum wage of £5.35 per hour calculated over four weeks thats an extra £26.75 that you should have in your wage packet without any additional hours accrued by staying late.
Fight this, your boss doesn't have a clue.

No, he cannot MAKE you do that - he can ask and you can refuse. I would imagine that from his present behaviour he is probably having his collar felt by someone above him and is keen to show more than willing. Alienating his own staff will not help him. He probably needs some retraining. The old industry standard for going to a tribunal was two years but quite frankly he is exceeding his remit and would cost the company dearly if he found an UNJUSTIFIED reason to cease your employment after only a few months, and that would include extending your working contractual hours. Look on the www.gov.org. site under employment law - it's a bit long winded but eventually you will find what you need, download it and give him a copy. Head office don't always train their junior management the way they ought to and he may be just as much a victim as you.

Please don't despair. Your contract is everything :)

A contract of employment is a legal agreement between employer and employee. It comes into force when an employee agrees to work for an employer in return for pay; it does not have to be a written contract but can be a verbal agreement. Employers are legally required to put some of the main details of their employees' terms and conditions in writing, including hours, pay and leave. This is called a written statement.

Signing a contract.........?



could someone give me advice please?

i am a trained performer and up until now have only had office jobs but i recently got offered a part in a panto, which is good but its not that well paid and dosent last that long

as it dosent start til november im still on the lookout for further things or better offers.

but they sent a contract which they want signed and returned now, only then do they let you see the script and terms, etc.

what i dont know is if i sign this 'actors agreement' / contract and send it back then in between now and november what if i get offered something better?

ive got to think about what contract is the best job for me, salary wise, length etc so i dont feel its bad to want something better. but obviouisly i want to agree to take it now as i might not get anything else.

if i do get something better, can i not go ahead with it, surely they cant force you?

i have no experience in this area (contracts wise) as i said before i have only had office jobs and i know if you sign up to a job, you can easily resign or leave.

can someone advise, i cant get a lawyer to look over it as i am skint and dont have the time as they want it asap.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



You need to read the contract word for word and if you don't understand any of it you need to ring the person who sent it to you for a clear clarification.
You only agree to sign it when you understand what is expected from you. If you are offered something better in the meantime then you will need to find out if you will be under a penalty for doing so and what that penalty will be. 
Contracts are tailor made for the role it relates to and I'm sure it will involve penalties for you if you decide at the last minute that you are going to withdraw. If your role plays a senior part and half way through you decide to quit this could cost the company a lot of money so they will obviously do what they can legally from preventing this.
You shouldn't need a lawyer to look over it just make sure you understand everything before you sign it.

Me, I've been a lawyer for over 20 years, and I believe that it is unethical to encourage a young person to go into the practice of law.  Jobs were never plentiful and they are really drying up right now.  Too many lawyers being graduated every year by too many law schools is a good part of the reason.  There are just too many lawyers chasing after too few paying clients, and that's bad for everybody.

Anyway, to answer your question, legal practice generally falls into two categories; criminal and civil.  In criminal practice you can prosecute or defend, and there are two general subcategories of defense.  Those are  represented by public defenders and private practitioners.  Juvenile defense makes up yet another specialized area of criminal practice.

In the civil areas, there is a great deal more to choose from.  There's general civil litigation, business litigation, corporate representation, family litigation (divorces and such), personal injury, debt collection, environmental litigation, civil rights, and appellate litigation.  I'm sure that there are others, but that's what comes to mind just now.

Do yourself a favor and think about doing something more useful.  Even designing computer games will probably make you happier than practicing law will.  The emotional toll that it takes on a person is terrible and it will negatively affect your view of people generally.  Like I said, the job market for lawyers stinks and it is not a very good investment with regard to your future employability.

If attend a good law school (in the top 50 in the US News Rankings), don't graduate at the bottom of the class, make it a priority to get good work experience during law school (don't wait tables for extra money.  Instead, take unpaid internships and law school clinics that will beef up your resume), and you are willing to put some effort into your job search, you will be able to find a job after graduation.

Yes, it's a competitive field, and there are more law school graduates each year than there are job openings. However, there are something like 200 ABA approved law schools, and also quite a few not accredited by the ABA.  It's the graduates from the no name schools who have a hard time finding a job.

For the answer to your questions (what types of law you can practice and what the job entails), explore this website:
http://www.abanet.org/public.html

Also - please don't listen to Bluecow.  Attorneys are held to high ethical standards.  In order to be admitted to the bar, you have to pass a rigorous background check that includes a credit check, 10 year employment history, criminal history, references, and more.  Then, after bar admission, any unethical practices can be reported to the bar, and the bar investigates and disciplines.  Just like in any profession, there are good people and bad people.

Regarding legal fees, if you go to school for seven years and take a big test, it is reasonable to charge a lot of money.  Plus, there are thousands of attorneys who work for less than teacher's pay in public interest organizations and in government work.

The above poster is clearly not well informed.

good news: work as a volunteer nurse. experience from these count

bad news: you'll have to pay the hospital for that. learning is very limited because they only let you do vital signs and some routine work: kinda like nursing aides or worse.

suggestion: submit as many application papers to as many hospitals as possible. preferably somewhere you can train or learn and wait for the vacancies. ask the HR if they could just keep your application papers so that if ever vacancies became available, you're already on the list. if you could work in a rural tertiary hospital, then that would be great. if you can't find any, attend seminars and special training (like IV training) to gain an edge.



hospitals in the US (and probably abroad) don't pay much attention to whatever hospital you worked in in the philippines. they, however, pay attention to the experience and training you had. in fact, most hospitals don't even require you to submit your resume and application letter. they have their own application form to be filled out.

Being out of work for 8 years look bad to a potential employer?



Will they see that my last jobs were 8 years ago and think badly of me? I don't think my references will remember me by that time, plus my previous jobs would have been menial and lame because I was so young. Is this something that is going to make me look bad?



</question>



<additional details>



It will be because I have been raising kids, I have only worked for myself in the past 3 years and am having another baby in December so another 5 years without being employed.



I won't be in a rush to get a job or anything but I am really looking forward to starting a career once I have finished my degree and my kids are in school. I have had a homebased business actually so I suppose I can just use that

Sorry to say this: "Yes, it looks very bad".  Believe me, I have been there. I didn't work for 5 years. Why? Couldn't get a job. Slow job market. As time passed, the employers keep asking me what did you do during that period. It is a SIN not to work. It is something that is expected of everybody unless you were sick or in prison maybe then it would be acceptable.

On the other side, keep positive and there will be a company that accepts you but it will take a long time to find one.

Do what everyone else does.  Lie about a home based business.  And employers don't really check (they check your eyes to see if you are lying) if you did put down some business.  Unless of course you are applying for a high profile job.  They really just check your credit score sometimes depending on the job, and your references and SS validity number, along with your DL number maybe.

They'd really rather hire illegal Mexicans, (no insult intended) if they thought they could get away with it.

And most hiring managers are dumber than a rock to start with, and are just trying to meet their quota.  So wear something revealing to draw their eyes and brain away from banter.

Where do i stand if I have a job offer in writing but then it's withdrawn due to job cuts?



A few months back i was offered a job as a trainee financial advisor with a UK bank which i received confirmation of in writing. The basis of the offer is that i completed my CeFA Financial exams within 3 months and then i would be given a start date as i couldn't give advice unless i was qualified. However, i have now completed the exams required only to find out i may now longer have a job due to a certain merge with another company and there will be job losses. I know i was pencilled in for a start date and i've done my part of the deal so i feel devastated as i was really looking forward to starting soon.

I know at the end of the day they've still paid for me to do my qualifications so i have still gained but it was the job i wanted! Where do i stand on this now and what should i do next?!

Thanks

Look for another job. Sorry to be so blunt. But unless you where hired you have no job. Even if you where hired, with the merger, you would be one of the first out the door.
You might of done your part, but due to the merger the company you where working with no longer exists and as such neither does the job.

What happens if an employer withdraws a job offer?
=====================================
If the offer's withdrawn before you have a chance to accept, or because you haven't met the conditions (for example, providing a 'satisfactory' reference), you can't take any action, unless it has been withdrawn for reasons of unlawful discrimination.

However, once you've accepted an unconditional offer, and the prospective employer withdraws it, you can claim for compensation for breach of contract.

Unfortunately there is nothing you can do as you had not started.

Even if you had started the chances are that redundancy would have swiftly followed and without 2 years service you would not have been entitled to redundancy.

To prosecute in the superior courts (anything above the Magistrates) in England & Wales you need to be either a barrister or a solicitor advocate.
To be a barrister you need to join one of the 4 Inns of Court, have either a qualifying law degree (LLB) at 2:1 standard or higher or have a non-qualifying law degree or other degree at 2:1 standard or higher plus a high mark in the Graduate Diploma in Law programme. After joining an Inn of Court you need to complete the Bar Vocational Course and undertake pupillage for a year.
To be a solicitor advocate you need either a qualifying law degree at 2:2 standard or higher or a non-qualifying law degree or other degree at 2:2 standard plus a completion in the Graduate Diploma in Law. After that you need to complete the Legal Practicing Course and complete a training contract with a firm of solicitors. After that you need to specialise in criminal law and undertake a course which will allow you access to the superior courts.
Fledgling barristers tend to earn around £40000 and solicitors around £30000. Highly experienced QCs and top solicitors can earn over £500k and have been reported to earn upto £2 million.
Hours are long, particularly for barristers due to the prep work involved. Time in court is between 9.30 and 4. Rest of the time will be based in chambers/office writing advice, reports or doing more prep work.

Salary varies widely depending on where (city,state) you are applying but basically a starting salary borders on pathetic compared to what other lawyers make in the region, the hours are long and the job description involves putting up with a lot of thankless bitchy people and incompetent police.  It requires a law degree and a license.  I don't recommend it, it's a thankless, low paying, dead end, sucky job.

Is there a law regarding pay dates?



My company pays us on the 21st of each month.



This month the 21st falls on a Sunday

Do they have to pay us on Friday the 19th or Monday the 22nd or is it up to the company??

Most states have laws regarding how frequent an employer must pay employees. Each state is different. Normally, it is up to the company to establish pay dates that conform to the laws. They are normally fairly flexible and I doubt that you would get anyone in trouble for one or two days. Usually, when the pay date falls on a Sunday, the next work day would be the acceptable pay date.

It is dependent on the company, but your contract should state what their policy is and they clearly have to abide by this.

As a general rule, most will pay on the working day before, not the one after.

It's up to the company.  But if you have direct deposit it may go in earlier.  My husband has direct deposit and his paycheck actually shows up in the bank the day before.  We also have USAA though, and they are very good about stuff like that.  It depends on a few things.  If you just get a check than there's no telling.

Best way is to be employed as a plasterers apprentice, these kinda trade jobs are more based on experience then qualifications so you gotta start from the bottom and work your way up. Most plasterers learn from other plasterers on the job so look around and see if anyone will take you on as a trainee till you get your feet on the ground!

As my son-in-law who is a 15 years of experience plasterer said to a guy he took on with no actual working at the sharp end experience of plastering but had just finished the course - "you may know the theory and you may be able to throw a bit of plaster on a wall, but basically at this stage you know shite!"

A bit hard, but what he was saying in his own version of tact was that a college course pass does not make you a plasterer. It IS a good head start though.  In many trades a week of actually working at it day by day is worth 10 weeks in college.

Get the Yellow Pages and make a list of all the Plasterers/Plastering companies within reasonable distance ans give each a call.  Ensure you let them know that you realise that your course qualification does not make you a plasterer but should make you more use to them than a complete beginner with no experience of any type.

Hi honey, unfortunately they don't have those anymore, which is ridiculous, as this really prepared the Nurses with real life situations.

You do have to go to Uni, but you can enter as a mature age student, even though you have not completed Yr 12.  You will have to sit for a exam, then you are in.

I am not sure what is in the exam, but apparentely it is not hard.

All right, I'm your average, everyday white, college freshman and I need a part time job. Well, the other day I was out getting Chinese for dinner and well.... The thought kinda passed through my mind, hey maybe I could work here! I mean, it's close, it's convenient, I'm into the culture... and well... I like Chinese food haha. I mean it'd be cool to work there, but would a Chinese place actually consider hiring a white guy?

I live at a tiny town where 99.9% population here are white.  There is only one Chinese restaurant here, and all the waitresses are white girls.  So yes, it is possible.

In your case, 
If they can't find enough Chinese who want to work there, maybe you will have your chance.



But you'd be out of luck if you live at a place with lots of Chinese around...because they prefer to hire their own people.

Do I have to file forms if I hire commissioned salesmen?



Hi,

In WA, USA, do I need to file forms with the city or state when I hire commissioned salesmen? Is it legal to hire salespeople with no base salary and have them work commission-only? Would it be legal if it's just part-time and not full-time, or is it illegal for both?

What if the commissioned salespeople are from out of state? Do I need to file forms then?

And lastly, if I don't have an EIN, am I legally allowed to hire commissioned salespeople? What if I get an EIN later? Or do I need to get it first?



</question>



<additional details>



Note: Commissions vary greatly from $500 to $50,000 and up. They can opt to do this part-time while holding a full-time job.

paying by commission only is only applicable in certain high commission outside sales positions. regardless of how they are paid they must make at least minimum wage for every hour they work and overtime when applicable. 
paying by commission does not change the fact that you are the employer and as such have certain legal responsibilities to the employees as well as regulatory agencies.
you will have to obtain your EIN as well as all other licenses required in the state.

In my experience, colleges are incredibly slow in the entire hiring process.

Most likely if you called you wouldn't be talking to the actual department that was looking for someone, you'd be talking to the employment division of the college.

I don't really think calling is going to help one bit.

As you learn more about the law, you will realize that every answer "depends."  Depends on the jurisdiction, depends on where you went to school, depends on your rank at school, depends on what extra activities you engaged in at school (i.e. moot court, law review, etc.), depends on your outside experience, depends on who you know, etc.

If your image of a lawyer is wealth, your wrong.  most lawyers spend 80 hours a week+ in offices and walk away with $65 grand a year, not much.  If you attend a top-notch school, finish in the top 15% of your class, are a member of moot court and law review, then you can expect to make $130K a year, working 80 hours a week for a large firm.

If you want to go solo, good luck.  They work 2x harder.  One of the hardest obstacles is setting up your own practice.  It costs a lot of money in overhead and retaining new clients is extremely difficult, especially given the competitiveness of law.

You need to specialize, and that takes many years of hard work and experience.  A lot of people go to law school expecting a huge paycheck when they get out.  Truth is, I was making more money as a waiter before I went to law school, working 1/4 of the time, as I am now as a first year graduate.  A nice paycheck can be obtained, but you need to be the best of the best, so-to-speak (Ivy league, top 10%).

Most importantly, don't go into law if all you want to do is to make money.  you will be very disappointed and you will hate the work.  most people go to law school expecting to make money.  When they get out, they either don't make money and hate the work, or they make a liitle money and hate the work.  9 out of 10 lawyers discontiue practicing law within 10 years--something to consider.  Harsh reality, but very much the truth.

It depends on several factors and even the lawyer himself (or herself)

Some lawyers practice solo and keep all the dough others work for firms
Some practice criminal, civil or other types of law

Many are unemployed and make nothing - there are too many lawyers, especially from Tier III and below schools.  At a large firm, a first year associate can make over $125,000.  Most new lawyers make far, far less if they are able to get a job at all.

Depends upon the type of law you practice, the size of the firm and most importantly the caliber of your clients.

You can either be stinking rich, obscenely rich or barely surviving on only a few hundred thousand a year in most areas.

For instance at the bottom of the barrel but top of the potential wage scale... how fast can you run down an ambulance?

Bring copies of all of your certificates.  Bring letter a list of your schools with you showing all of your completed certs/degrees and showing the pending GED, so they can verify everything.  They may or may not ask for the educational references.  It's best to be prepared in case they do.

Explain your pending GED and when you expect results.

Sounds like you made the mistake of dropping out of high school.  Much more importantly, you've matured and are getting your education.

You are on the right track and I think you'll do well in the job market.  You've shown maturity, responsibility and that you're a self-starter just by getting your education started.  Good for you!  Best wishes for a bright future.  You deserve it for all of your hard work.

I was 15 and I detassled corn.  I also babysat kids around the neighborhood before that.

For babysitting, I charged $1.00 an hour.  I do not remember how much I got for detasseling.  It was probably minimum wage.  I am 40 now, so that was too long ago to remember for me.

I am offered employment contract but this I would sign with dutch location of the company, although this company is also present in UK. I would be living and working in UK so:
1) Is this legal ? (do I have to be employed by UK site rather then dutch site?)
2) Is this suspicious from HMRC perspective ?

yes its legal.many companies operate this way. they would have been locally incorporated in the UK, so its not suspicious.

I used to do this as a side job.  Most stores don't have enough of these
for all the drivers, so you could just try to be the last one in line for them...But, if your store has enough, yeah, you have to put it on your
car.  It is for YOUR safety, seriously.  Most of the stores have certain
neighborhoods that are shall we say not the best...It is better to use the sign than not to.

Where to find a job with a misdemeaner background?



Hey everyone out there....



As my title saids I got into some trouble this summer and now I'm trying to find a job. I was wondering if anyone could give me advice or point me to the right place where they hire people with misdemeaners. I live in the northern part of Califronia. If any one knows anything or can just lift my spirits, it would be appreciated. I'm looking for companies that might not do background checks or may hire even if it's a misdemeaner. I thought I had it bad but those with felonies can't find any jobs. I've come across alot of bloggers that want to turn there life around but cant because no one will hire them. If you need a lil more info on my situation and think you can help write back or ask me questions. I would really like to turn my life around, im not one of those criminals that will go back to there ways. I for one want to apply to nursing school next year and do other things but first I need to find a job like most people now a days. Thanks

There really are not any rules when it comes to being a paralegal.  Experience is the absolute most important thing. You are not a paralegal without it, so you have to start in a small firm/work your way up. Many paras are trained on the job and that experience and training is enough to qualify them.

However.....if you have no formal education and lose your job or want to find another one, it will be difficult without some kind of educational background.

Many employers want an ABA-approved school, which you can find at certain community colleges and a few other programs. Online/distance/correspondence programs are not approved and will make you less marketable, so try to avoid those. They also cost a lot more, in most cases.

I am a current paralegal student; I have a BA and I am earning a certificate at a community college.  My school also offers an Associate's degree.  It is approved, which is why I chose it.  I am now trying to find an entry-level law firm job so I can get experience. Having the degree or certificate is not enough-you need at least 2 years of experience for most firms.

If you want to be a paralegal, you should have excellent written and verbal skills, and you need to be able to work with people. You have to be able to work independently and understand that you are working for an attorney, so there are limits on certain things you can do. There are many tasks involved with the job, though, and the people in my class already in law firms like what they do.

Can anyone tell me more about being off long term sick and the consequences? ?



Hi My girlfriend broke her foot 4 months ago and it's still not healed, the doctors keep signing her off and in 4 weeks she has to go back to the hospital to see if it's any better,she has kept her work informed of every move and when she went in on tuesday with another sick line they told her that they would have to get in touch with the big bosses to find out if they could still support her,she was told that they may not be able to hold her position open for much longer. She has been with the company for 5 years now and only works 16 hours a week. On my understanding, I thought they had to keep her position open or at least offer her another one but i don't think they can sack her. Any help with this matter would be greatfully appreiated. Thankyou in advance.

Family Medical Leave which provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave from work  for a serious health condition.  This is a federal law that requires employers to hold an employees job for the time they are out (within 12 weeks).  Because she has been out in excess of 12 weeks, her employer may not be required to bring her back. (Her employer could have a separate leave policy)



Also, because she must have worked at least 1200 hours in the previous year, she may not have worked enough hours to be eligible for FMLA.

They can dismiss although they should have done the following first:

1] Taken independent medical advice to the effect that she will not be able to return to her job or that it would take an unreasonably long time

2] Fully consulted with your girlfriend

3] Considered any other jobs within their business

4] Been able to show that they can`t keep the job open

It usually comes to a head when she runs out of sick pay.

It will also depend on the size of the business.  An Employment Tribunal will expect a large company to go through more `hoops` than a small one.

Good luck!

My dear,



You do have qualifications!! You just have to learn to extract them from your low self esteem and market them in such a way that it comes alive in your resume.  Tailor your skill set to whatever industry you are applying for.  For example you worked in catering, and while you think you dont have customer service experience, you do because you worked closely with various clientele and managment groups...

Get the point?



Be creative.  Look at some job requirements and apply to places that have age equality.



Best wishes.

You need to figure out what you like to do (or at least are moderately interested in), then either get those qualifications (school is faster than working your way up at this point) or exploit the qualifications you already have.

Do you want to work outside?
Do you want to work in an office?
Do you want to work directly with customers?
Would you prefer to avoid customers?

You get the idea. Ask yourself these questions and you should at least get pointed in the right direction.



And believe me, the fact that you have a solid work history and can be relied upon is not to be sniffed at.

You do have qualifications if you've worked all your life, especially in catering. Customer service. Organization. Time management. Flexibility. Working independently. Working under deadlines. Stress management. Taking and giving direction. Working with a diverse set of people and personalities. Conflict handling/resolution. Communication whether written and/or verbal... the list goes on... I'm sure you have a lot of skills employers are looking for. The key to landing a job is selling yourself. Be confident.

Try one of the major supermarkets. The turnover of staff is very high and they seem to be always advertising. I know that you are looking for something different but you said you NEED a job so there may be a vacancy in one of there food departments ie: Deli, Cafe or Fresh Produce. Unlike the other answers, don't mix up Qualifications with Experience ( there is a difference)

If you want to take surveys for money, you should know a few safety tips first.

1. Don't give out your credit card #'s, SSN's, or bank account info.

2. Don't send any money, they are supposed to pay you.

3. Check and see if they have a forum. Reputable sites will have a forum and members will post pictures of their payments there.



The following sites meets all these requirements.I have also posted pictures of payments I received.

My feeling is that you need to bullet-proof yourself. What I mean by that is that its going to be virtually impossible to be secure working for a boss...ANY boss. You do not offer enough skills, qualifications experience (other than catering) to not be vulnerable.

Here is one solution and just one way to do it....

Work on the internet. Work from home. That way you will be your OWN boss and never have to worry again. You will need to start part-time, after work and gradually build yourself into a position where you can fire your boss and YOU become the boss.

How to do it? There are LOTS of ways to do it on the net, but it is hard to find one that will work. I have made some mistakes but have found one business that works for me. You can do this part-time. I am not saying that there are not other good sites, but this one works for me. It is FREE to try...

You could initially look at catering work within a nursing or care home or even a school.

Initially you`ll be working as a kitchen assistant but there is a lot of employee turnover in these businesses and an opportunity should arise.

Also worth looking at a part-time catering course at college.

You`ll probably have another 15-20 years work, might as well do something you enjoy!  Good luck.

Hi Honey, at 50 I was working in an estate agents, then I moved to a call centre, then did 6 months as a Vets receptionist, bought our own business in catering, sold that and now at 61 I am an Invigilator in a prison.  Point of this is, that the only qualifications I have are people skills and commonsense.  You can do anything, employers are looking for mature people with life skills instead of silly kids.
Good Luck, go on jobcentre plus online and try for anything.

Work and water supply?



Hi folks.
If the company who own a business park have to cut off the water supply for a day,how do the people who have businesses there cope with that?
Are there rules about on site staff needing to be able to have drinking water and hand cleaning facilities and do they have to provide bathrooms?
Do they actually have to shut down because there isn't running water  or can they simply provide bottled water and hand cleaning wipes and buckets of water to flush the toilets?

being legal has nothing to do with it - if your company monitors their employees by using mystery shoppers and you screw up - it's your own fault. It seems to me nowadays - a lot of people working in retail have no concept of giving good customer service - they sure don;t have the work ethic I did when I was in retail 20+ yrs ago - I'm referring primarily to  retail workers under the age of 25

Yes, and I expect if you read your contract or employee handbook it probably states so.

If you actually got sacked because of a mystery customer, it could be worth seeing if you have a case for unfair dismissal - but not saying that you would, without knowing the specifics.  But if it's just a disciplinary, then no problem.

I'm just curious ... what do you think the point of mystery customers are?  Whilst I don't work in a customer-focussed industry, my assumption is that they are there to let the business know how they can improve, and what they should be doing better or differently.  Clearly, no company wants to have rude or unhelpful staff dealing with customers, and if a mystery customer reported you as being a problem, then of course your employer wants to deal with the situation.  That's sort of the point.

Yes there is no doubt that it could be used as evidence in the UK although they need to very careful that the secret shopper actually identified you.

If the identification is not strong it would leave their case looking weak.

Anyone out there working in retail fashion?



I am currently working in retail fashion but would love to boost my sales and hopefully get promoted, I would just like to ask has anyone got good selling tips for me, other than can I help you? I feel this makes people just want to run out of the store (i find that myself) but I have to approach every customer.



I would really appreciate help.

I know retail fashion is not everyone's cup of tea but I work part-time (i am not a student I am a mum) and I love my job, I just want to be able to boost my sales and hopefully as stated above gain promotion.

Hey chick What I always start out with is " Hello how are you doing today?". It's almost always great conversation starter, and I don't mean being fake but really taking an interest in that customer. If that customer can see that you actually care and you are there to help them that will draw them more too you. But of course you will always have a few customers that don't want to be bothered at all and just greeting them and keeping an eye out to see if they need help is enough. Also by doing that shows that you noticed them and that lets them know you are aware of them because as we all know in retail we have our occasional shoplifters. I really hope that help you out at least a little bit if you have any more questions feel free to comment back or just email me. :-)

I used to approach a customer,greet them,and then say something like "If you need any help I'll be over there"and then go and do some paperwork or tidying,always making sure the customer knows where you are.
Another tip which I am sure you're aware of,is to know what you have in stock.I know that can be difficult in a large department,but it will impress people if you can say "yes,we've got those"instead of saying you'll have to go and look.
Also always try and look busy.There's nothing worse than seeing a bunch of sales people standing around chatting and doing nothing.Make it look as though you're tidying and/or cleaning your stock or sales area.You can chat while doing that.Won't only impress your customers,but also your Bosses.
It can be a great career,but it's what you make of it.
You obviously have the right attitude so there's no reason you shouldn't do well.As I say it's up to you.Good luck.

In fact my whole life revolved around work, because when I wasn't working, I would be socialising with work colleagues.  But, things change when it's something that you're not in control of.  Wht happened in my case was that my boss sold the company, and even though I was still doing the same job, I was suddenly working for a company where the people were horrible and it had values and ideologies that I did not agree with.

There are all sorts of things that could happen.  You could lose your job.  You could be injured or something and therefore be unable to work in the same role.  Plus, colleagues move on and you may love the ones you have now, but in a couple of years' time you'll be surrounded by a completely different group of people than you are now.

So, I think it's important to ENJOY your job.  You spend too many hours there to do something that makes you miserable.  But don't LOVE it.  In fact, you sound similar to my situation in that perhaps you don't have much of a life outside of work - I bet you spend all your time socialising with your colleagues too - so my advice to you is that you become unattached from your job.  Detached, whatever.  Enjoy it but don't love it.

If you love the job - that's great, but if it's just the perks - well that may be different.



What would happen if you lost your job for some reason? Would you have alternative interests and people around you? What would happen if you get old and ugly? Would you have missed out by not developing more normal relationships?

When we are enjoying present it can be easy to ignore the future.

"If you can find a job you love you'll never have to work another day in your life"

So the saying goes, and I think there's more than a grain of truth in it.

I have what is considered a good job, but I certainly don't love it and have always been very envious of people who have managed to find something they feel as you do about your job.

My only concern would be prompted by another proverb - the one about not putting all your eggs in one basket. If you have nothing else in your life that you feel great about, then should you lose your job for one reason or another then you would be devastated. I'd be looking for some other hobbies or interests to make your world a little more rounded

How do I get a good job?



Hi;
I am 24 years old and my work background is in retail.
Since I had my daughter last year I went back to work part time, now that she is 18 months I think it is about time to get back to work full time. However I am not to keen to work in  the same industry anymore, this is because I would like to consider a brighter work career, not just for myself but also for my child's future.
I would be glad to do office work, the only problem is that agencies do not seem very inerested in hiring people like me, bcause as they say they are paid to recrute experienced workers in that area.
At my age there is also nothing apart from a couple of organizations including "next step", to give advice in how to get a decent job.
It seems like I am stuck in retail forever, please don't tell me to get a degree or to go back to education, because I have already an ongoing degree in psychology, but I need something before I finish that, anddon't send me to job centre, because I have been there and they are not that helpfull.
I am afraid I will be stuck in my little shop forever :(
Please help. Any tips and advice are welcome.
Thank you

Don't be down!  First of all ignore all the idiots on here who are essentially advertising 'get rich, working from home schemes'.  First of all sit down and have a good look at your skills many of them will be transferable to an office environment (e.g. good customer service skills).  Your first step needs to be getting some good basic skills behind you.  Think about going along to your local College and maybe start with a CLAIT computing course or if you think that is too basic ECDL - both these offer a basic standard of computer literacy.  For any office job nowadays good Keyboard skills and knowing your way around a PC are essential.  When looking for office work, perhaps look for a receptionist type role first and then work your way up.  Good Luck, my wife moved from shop to office work a few years ago and now supervises 8 staff!

In the UK, you are legally allowed to work from the age of 13, but there are restrictions on the type of work you may do and on what hours you work.  These restrictions are generally no longer applicable once you're 16.

Now, just because you're legally allowed to work doesn't mean that you will easily find a job.  I believe that many retailers, for example, have insurance which covers them for staff members who are aged 16 and over.  I think also that some people may view you as too immature - and really, why hire a 14-year-old when you can hire a 16-year-old instead if they're just going to get paid the same.  Plus it may not always be possible for employers to accommodate the hours that you're allowed to work.

I would suggest that if you have a friend or relative who could possibly employ you (e.g. they own a cafe or something) then that would be the easiest way to find work, since they are less likely to be worried that you're immature as they will actually know you.  Plus small businesses will not be worried about the insurance aspect.

I work at a local bowling alley, they have a room for parents to drop off their children while they bowl on leagues. The bowling alley pays me because this way they get more people to sign up for leagues. Sometimes parents will also tip.



You can, actually, get a job at 14 if you live in a state that allows it (California, for example). Most places aren't normally willing to hire 14 year olds, but present yourself to them professionally and you'll definitely impress them. For the child labor laws, just do a search for "[your state] child labor law" obviously plugging in [your state] with the state you live in.

No i don't think they do, a lot of there job is quite dangerous. Dealing with wild animals, big birds, foxes etc and your schools liabilty insurance wouldn't cover you if you got hurt nor would the RSPCA take responsibilty for you. It also requires a lot of training, even if your in base just looking after the animals. You'd be better off looking for work experience in a kennels or in a smaller animal shelter that deals with only domestic animals. And as far as im aware they don't take on volunteers in there shelters or on the search and rescue things, for the same reasons. The RSPCA deal with a lot of stuff  other then just the care of the animals (which you need to be trained to deal with) they will let you do fund raising but you won't be able to work with the animals. However, other rescue centres will take you as a volunteer, kennels will look for dog walkers and smaller animal shelters with help cleaning out etc.

Unless you fancy applying to become Gary Glitter's PA, you can't get employment in the UK until you are 16.
The obvious alternative is a paper round until then.
There is something called and under 16 work permit, but I don't think they get granted very often, just in cases where someone under 16 NEEDS to work in order to live and keep a roof over their heads.

Try babysitting, dog walking (even apply at the local Veterinary and offer to exercise the animals, clean cages, for a small amount of pay) or even walking a neighbor's dog who may work all day (offer for a small fee)....if you do a good job, you could get referrals, go to hairsalon's and see if they need someone to sweep up, wash towels, etc...

http://www.ecashoffers.com/paidto/home.p... is a great way to make extra money.  They payout via Paypal, check, or money order the SAME day!  While other sites make you wait at least a month! The site will ask you to complete surveys and offers and those companies will then pay you. Unlike most work at home jobs this is one is really legit and actually sends real checks to you the same day you cash out. Best of all, it's absolutely free to earn money with this site!  I have already made over $2500+ from this website and keep it mind that everything is free. I would love to answer any questions that you might have regarding this just contact me:

Say nothing let it ride, heres the deal women in the workplace are full on chatter boxes especially the female token "bosses" you don't have to get her back or report her the best thing to do is say nothing to her just keep it totally professional.  The best way to piss a woman off in work especially one who thinks shes a "boss" is to totally find her and her conversation benign, non interesting as is herself.  Just watch out for her bitc'hy female minions and the one bloke in your place is so far up her ars'e he can taste her dinner.  Every place that has a female "boss" operates the same way.  I have a biatch like that, uses her token job as a weapon so what i do is totally ignore her, no good mornings no good nights i keep it all professional.  On an average day i muster about 5 words to her so the onus is now on her to make her think about her inappropriate behavior.  By playing it smart I'm the one that gives her the orders.

If you are doing something against company policy, then it doesn't matter who else is doing it.  Just watch out for yourself and don't rat her out.  I agree she's a hypocrite, but she'll get hers eventually.  It might be that there's something else about you they don't like, and they're using your Internet use as an excuse to discipline you so they can eventually fire you.  Be very careful and document everything.

Can I work in the UK as a physical therapist?



I have graduated from medical school in Novi Sad,Serbia.. as a physical therapist,I went 4 years to school,but I'm currently living in the U.S. and also have their citizenship... How could I work in my field in the UK? Would I be able to get my diploma evaluated if I finish school in the states???  The reason I ask,because I dont like it in the U.S. I love Europe... :)



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



In the UK you may need to do another yr of training, and in the UK they are known as physiotherapists.
The other option is sometimes you could start as a junior, and with initial support within a job you could work up in physiotherapy.
If you have different languages skills you would always be a good choice in the UK.
Look for rotation, or junior posts on www.nhscareers.nhs.uk you can apply for jobs through email, and also they have a phone number on most posts advertised you could always phone that person and ask their advice.
Good luck with your search.

I would have thought about £8-9 per hour or about £18,000 per annum.

Obviously it's a bit hard to say without knowing anything about you or your experience.  It could be lower if you don't have any experience at all, but it could be higher if you're very experienced and would be working in a role where you have responsibility for managing escalations or for training or something.

Generally, assistant CC's get around 19k
CC's get around 23-25k
Senior CC's can earn 30-35k

Finance Managers (resp. solely for credit control) can earn like 50k.

Depends on business type, sector..etc.

ER. That is where I work most of the time, but I also work on the helicopter. However that is more like a paramedic than a nurse.

To the guy above me, Kevin C, nurses can make really good money. It depends on where you work. I workd in ER for a while and there were more male nurses there than female. I guess cuz men can handle gore more than us girls

What is more motivational ?



1.-Have a serious talk with such employee
 2.-Make retailation giving him less hours in his job schedule
 3.-Give him hard time during the job



(this is happening at Orange county Domino's pizza store)



for example: deny to use the domno's sign on top of the car



but let new drivers put this domino's sign on his car



I always thought that most important job of the manager is make everyone works at confortable level creating good job atmosphere because this can increase the productivity in any kind of business
but this kind of pressure and hostigation hurts owner more than employees.

Punishment on the job is never as motivating as rewards.  If action requires some sort of suspension, so be it.  But overall, have a positive outlook to the work environment.  Ex: you'll get more hours if I see this type of behavior.  Instead of you'll get less if you don't do this.  But, sometimes, taking away things is the only action left.  *sigh*

Is it a conflict of interest in a union, for a steward to become a V.P. of the union and stay a steward?



Also, is it a conflict of interest for this person to work off the books at  a competitor while still holding both these positions?  I am in a direct conflict with this person and there seems to be bias on the  side of the steward.  And this steward has campaigned for our regional representative in a political campaign which he has won a seat on the common council . Please, no opinions on why you are for or against unions in the work place. Thank you.

Your contract might have that information on it. I think you'd be better off asking in the UK section of Yahoo Answers. Here in the US, you give 2 weeks notice for full-time work, and one week notice for part-time work.  But in most states, that is just being polite. There are some states called "Right to Hire", and they require no notice, which means you can't be penalized for quitting on a moment's notice.  Same with an employer - you could walk in to work and be fired that very moment, and the place can't be sued (unless you were fired for a reason that is illegal - like because of your age, sex, race, etc).

A legal executive deals with much of the administrative legal work undertaken by a solicitor but is not a qualified solicitor.

They do not tend to do any advocacy at all.

As a result they do not get paid anything like the rate that a solicitor does  and always find themselves supervised by a solicitor.

Many legal execs are extremely competent and I don`t know why they don`t go on to get qualified.

In an English court of law you have Barristers, one acts as the defence another will be the Prosecutor. In another case the prosecuting Barrister might be acting for the defendant. I think you've been watching too many American movies. I have never heard of the job as 'Prosecutor'

I doubt that a prosecutor would have a thankless, low paying, dead end, sucky job.

In England and Wales and Northern Ireland (not Scotland), the head of the prosecuting authority is typically known as the Director of Public Prosecutions, and is appointed, not elected. A DPP may be subject to varying degrees of control by the Attorney General, usually by a formal written directive which must be published.

The Crown Prosecution Service normally represent the police for prosecuting people charged. The CPS have their own staff to prosecute but can farm this work out to Solicitors in private practice, who would normally act for defendants, or for more serious trials, the CPS would employ Barristers from various Chambers, some of who would be Queen's Counsel.



You would call these Solicitors and Barrister prosecutors if they were prosecuting for that trial. However, they are not just prosecutors as they may act for defendants in a different trial. So they are eligible to act as a prosecutor or defence in any particular trial.

A prosecutor, who ever it is, would normally command a high salary and the more successful ones would demand their own fee.

Past Employer starting to harass me?



I quit a job a couple weeks ago due to unhappy employees around me yelling at one another, a poor training schedule and not being the correct fit for position.



I have by certified mail sent back any parking passes,badge and other materials.



They are insisting I sign an Exit summary which has incorrect data and dates and strange language and are insisting that I still have materials of theirs which I don't.



Is this harassment- I really cannot afford an attorney- but if I have to- I have to I guess.

Fired for overstating timesheet by a total of ~1.2 extra hour in 2 weeks?



My boss called me into his office one morning and told me that they had to let me go because I overstated my timesheet. I looked at the paper he gave me and he wrote down: extra 3 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins, etc for the days that he said I "overstated". (Yes, he even counted 3 minutes difference).



I counted the total hours that I "overstated" and they all add up to about 1.2hr for 2 weeks. Also, he never gave me any warnings about my timesheet or really showed me the proper way to record them. Before this employment I've worked at a place where they want everything rounded up to the nearest 15 mins. So if I've worked until 5:03, I would write down 5:15. So I was doing this with my timesheet before I got fired (and some I round to 10, not 15, cos I feel I should).



Is it fair to get fired because of this? I feel that he should at least explain to me how to record it properly and maybe even give me a warning before firing me. Also, all the clocks in the office show different time (my computer says 8:03, and the phone on my desk shows 8:08, everyone's computer also has slightly different time). What are the chances that he fired me because he hates me (I caught and pointed out some of his mistakes when calculating math)?



</question>



<additional details>



Of course I used the same clock (the computer) to keep track of time. But, when I said each clock shows different time, I meant that maybe my boss used it to his advantage, meaning he told me that I come in at 8:09, eventhough I came in at 8:04 (and claimed that I overstated by 5 mins). And when I leave, he would look another clock that shows a different time.

it sounds to me like he fired you for some other reason, but unfortunately had to use the time thing as an excuse. I think 1.2 hours over two weeks is definitely significant, but he should have said something before just firing you. Talk to him. Explain it like you did here. If he apologizes and you don't need the job, quit!  Who wants a job with someone like that for a boss. Communication is key!  If he stands his ground, tell him how you feel. You were treated unfairly



</answer>

Thanks for your input! I will definitely explain to him how I feel, because I don't think anyone should be let go without a warning first.

First of all arm yourself with some good facts about how you have progressed, eg how you have improved perhaps sales or efficiency within your role. Ask for a short meeting with your boss, and say 'I would like to ask for a payrise, as I feel I have acheived.....'



If the boss refuses, say thanks for considering it, can we review this again in three months, and what are your suggestions for a more favourable response next time?



Good luck x

Most companies have a "Work appraisal" and then give you a pay rise at the end of the meeting.  Ask your boss if the company do work appraisal as you haven't had one since you started and you want to know if they are pleased with your work.



If he says that they are pleased with your work, then ask them what they do about pay rises as you haven't had one since you started two.



If he says that due to the current state they are not doing pay rises, I would suggest that you hang in there but say that as soon as things settle, you would like to discuss pay rises.



Good luck.

First thing you should do is think about your position and how you have improved since starting.  Have you taken on any new responsibilities?  Are you also doing someone else's role?  What more things do you have on your plate from when you first started.



Come up with a list that you can present to your boss so that you can show an increase in your productivity.  What you are doing is showing him that because you are doing more, you deserve more.



Next, you could ask him about employee reviews.  Tell him you haven't had one since you started and you would like to have a meeting with him.  He'll know what is up.  Basically your boss isn't giving you a raise because you haven't asked for one.  It isn't right, but some people get away with this.



When meeting with him have a number that you want to earn and present it to him.  In fact, you could shoot for even higher than what you want and then he'll come back with another figure and you two can meet somewhere in the middle.  If he values you then he will give you more money so that you stay.



You need to also let him that you do need more money to live.  Tell him you want to keep the job and that is why you are coming to him instead of looking for another job that pays more.  That shows loyalty and also tells him that you want to keep your job.



It isn't easy, but this is the way you have to be when dealing with cheapo bosses.  The good news is they do eventually pay up but you have to initiate things first.

I start a new job Monday as an Inside Sales Rep for a company that sells industrial plumbing/heating products to wholesalers.



I found this job through a recruiter that found my resume online and they set things up for me.



What attracted me to this job:



1)  The owner is a terrific business person and an overall great guy.  He is also not afraid to spend money and treats his staff right.  He upped my starting salary offer by $2K when he found out I was interviewing with another company.  He also increased the post-probation salary amount by $4K so when it comes time for my review he's more than happy to give me a raise.



2)  It is a stable company (in a stable industry) that is growing.  No chance of me getting laid off or getting hours cut.



3)  Easy going work environment.  I work 8-4:30 Mon-Fri and I look forward to having a life and being able to do things after work.  I can also wear what I like to the office as customers do not show up at the office.



4)  I love being in sales but I hate cold calling.  This position involves no outside selling at all and all sales calls come to me.



It took me three months to find this job but I really feel lucky once I did.  I interviewed with several companies and knew that this was the right fit.  Job hunting involves more perseverance than I knew!

"Tell me about yourself" - keep it to the traits and attributes you have that will make you successful in the job.  For a retail job I might say something like "I am a people person.  I like to help people and solve problems.  I feel as if I get along with most people I meet and enjoy working in a team oriented enviroment."  If you are in school, mention that and your course of study.  Don't mention anything about your personal life - marriage, kids, whatever  - keep it about your skills



"Why should I hire you" - I give 100% of myself to whatever I am doing.  I am not afraid of hard work and I feel satisfied when I know I do my job well.  I am willing to learn whatever part of the job I need to in order to succeed with this company.



"Why do you want to work here" - This local store has a good reputation in the marketplace and from what I have heard it is employee friendly.  (Only say this if you believe it to be true.)  I have been a customer at KMart for many years and feel comfortable working here and representing this company.



I hope this helps you, even a little bit.  Good luck on the interview.  Dress nicely and professionally, arrive a few minutes early because you might have to fill out an application (but not too early), smile when you meet the person, stand up and shake hands.  Have a few questions ready to ask of them like what are the hours, dress code, what department would I be working for, how long have you been with this company and why do you like working here.  When the interview is over smile and thank the person for his/her time and ask them when they think they will make a decision.

Think like a politician say all good things, pretend as if you've always wanted to work their and you will be the most loyal employee ever. Wide eyes, big smile, show interest with lots of manners. Let the interviewer miss you when your gone. Get the number and call back before the end of the day and the interviewer by name for the opportunity to be interviewed. If you don't get the job, it's good practice.

CA labor law for part-time work?



I work 10-20 hours a week part-time supplement our income at $11.  I'm curious as how I legally should be reporting my time.  For example, this morning I worked for 3 hours, but then had to go back for in the evening for literally 10 min. to do turn down for a guest (I work at a bed & breakfast).  Tomorrow I will be working in the morning for probably 3 hours, then have to return at 3pm to check someone in, then return again at 9pm to check someone in and that only takes 10 min.  My question is, do I report the whole hour?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Your employer should have a policy or rules in place when this happens,  it could be greater than state requires but not less than.  CA Labor law says If an employee is required to report to work a second time in any one workday and is furnished less than two hours of work on the second reporting, he or she must be paid for two hours at his or her regular rate of pay. So even if you go back to work for 10 mins in the same work day you should be paid a min of 2 hours.

Last year when i was on maternity leave, i was paid incorrectly for most of the time.They're now demanding nearly £4000 back and asking me what i can afford to pay back each month. A friend has told me i legally don't have to pay it back but my Dad says i definitely do but i can pay a very small amount each month. We are broke as i'm now on mat leave again so really cant afford to pay a lot each month. What are my rights??

There are two limbs to the legal test. Firstly, Did you know there was an mistake? Secondly, did you rely on the money?



If, firstly, you did not know there was a mistake, and secondly, you relied on the money, then legally you do not have to pay it back and your employer will not be able to recover the money even if they take you to a tribunal or to court. If they make any deduction from your wages then that would be illegal and you would then be able to recover the deducted money through an employment tribunal.



EDIT: PLEASE DO NOT TAKE ANY NOTICE OF PEOPLE SAYING YOU NEED TO PAY IT BACK... LOOK AT THIS PAGE http://www.ncab.org.uk/Employment%20advi...
UNDER THIS CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY IT BACK:)

You can negotiate better terms. That is your right.
You can legally challenge them..That is your right.



Even according to the link someone gave you...YOU HAVE TO PAY IT BACK...



"It is important to know that you employer is allowed to claim this money back even if you can show all three criteria above. It is you that must make a legal claim to get back the money that has been wrongly deducted."



It is up to you to prove you somehow mysteriously do not have to pay it back.



2) There are rules requiring only a small pay back each month.



You can and will pay the money back.



You are lucky to have a job.



You know you owe the money.



Shirking your responsibility is wrong.



And you could (and should) lose your job.
I would never ever ever hire you. Think about that.
Your actions say a lot about your character.



Knowing your rights is always good and excellent...
Comments about  well I really do need the money... are not well received.

Not familiar with British law but if it is anything like US law, you most definitely have to pay it back.  There is no "we accidentally paid so you get to keep it" clause.  Sucks, doesn't it?  Just pay what you can.  I'm sure your employer will understand.

First and foremost, experience. No matter where you go to school, you need to have experience, usually about 2 years. I am in a paralegal certificate program; I have a BA and I am attending community college. It is ABA-approved, which is VERY important. I am trying to find an entry-level job now (filing, admin. asst., etc.) because it is extremely rare to find a firm who will start you out as a paralegal. A tiny firm may, but not where I live.



Since you have the BA, you can do what I am doing. Just make sure you go to an approved school. These have to be on-campus, as the ABA will not approve an online school.
The ones in my area that are approved are at the community colleges. My program is 33 credits, which is 10 classes and an internship at the end. It will take me 2 years going at night, pt. Probably the shortest time would be 18 months, because the classes build on each other, but I really think that 2 years is probably the average in my school.



Community colleges, tech schools, and universities offer certificates. Some require a BA, some a BA with a certain GPA and some are strictly paralegal programs that do not involve college credits. My classes are standard college credits that can be used for other programs. My school also offers an Associates degree.



You may want to try getting into a law firm in an entry-level job and then going to school at night, after you see if you like it and also because you need that experience. I wish I had done that this way. I just started the program, so I have some time to build up experience if I can find an entry job.

It's all about the environment you provide. Not only the physical environment, but the emotional environment. When people feel they are needed and that their work is valued, they will be more likely to stay on. People who are challenged appropriately and feel like they're part of the solution, will give more and be more productive, which will only add to the appeal of staying on.

let them know you are happy with them and their work, give them other things to do to keep them challenged and motivated, such as project work on things they may be interested. The more people feel appreciated and the more they are enjoying what they do they will stay with you, in some circumstances in spite of being offered a better paid post somewhere else.

I seem to have a problem finding a job i really like.I've had about 8 jobs since i was old enough to work,most have been in retail.the longest job i ever had lasted just over a year.I tend to leave because i get bored, or new people replace old employees who i then dont get on with and it makes me depressed.I have many transferrable skills both in basic admin and customer service but i feel like i've lost direction.I'm currently an optical advisor but its not something i want to do anymore-i needed a job at the time to pay my rent.

It's not always clear how to begin hunting for a job, I was in a bit of a hole over the past few weeks when I was job searching, until I uncovered the website in the box below that gives sensible tips and tricks. I soon got myself going down the correct track, and in a couple of weeks after a few interviews I netted a really excellent job.

People always assume that you can only have a satisfying job if it includes years of college and training, and a high salary. But if your just looking for a job for rent money, just think of what you enjoy doing, if you enjoy photography, work in a camera shop. If you enjoy video games, work in a games shop.



I enjoy driving, so I just got a job which involves driving a van.
Raise the bar a bit.

My advice would be to have a long, hard look at some courses that are out there, maybe part time learning. See what inspires you, whether is upholstering furniture, training to be a lawyer, nursing, alternative therapies, personal trainer, and then do some research about what careers are available in that field. You can still be employable IF you can prove to a prospective employer that you have the commitment to join their profession, and there's no better way to do this than to show you are undertaking/have undertaken a course of study in that area.

Try talking to an employment agency in your area.  You can find them in the phone book.  Employers have nothing to lose because they get to "try you out" before they hire you and you get a check from the agency.  Manpower is a large and popular one and they will work with you to find the right position.  It does not look good on a resume that you have had 8 jobs and the longest was only just over a year, but going through a place like Manpower will allow you to prove yourself.  People change and someone will give you a chance.  Figure out what you enjoy doing, call someone at an employment agency, tell them your situation, and it should work out for the best.

First thing first you have to figure out what you want to do. Not everyone has the idle job which they love and want to do for the rest of their lives. A job is something which pays your rent from my point of view. Not even singers like their job, but they do it because their big and have to carry on with it, when they leave they feel like coming back to it because they need the money. Its all about the money really.



Making your self look employable is something you have already got. You have got a lot of experience from different work places. Explain in interviews that you have this experience. How it has helped you with other jobs and how it can help you in the future or for the company your applying for.



In order for you to find something you want to stick too i guess....you just have to try it, what ever you have passion for, it may seem stupid but iam currently doing a network computing degree and was not really happy with where i was going, but the money is good so thats what iam thinking of. But i love music, i have though about trying out DJ'ing which is amazing, i love it, something to do at night after work. Currently still learning but gets my mind off work pressure and also make money off DJ'ing.

The only way you will stick with a job for a good length of time is if it is something you are passionate about.  Other than that you are trading time for money.



The problem you could face is that anyone that sees your resume sees you as a liability with no long term job history.  It costs a lot of money to hire and train and it isn't worth investing in you if they think you might split.  Sure, you could convince them otherwise in an interview but if you don't even get to that point to get face to face you could find it frustrating for you over time during your job search.



Having basic skills is great but it really isn't enough in a tough job market.  I would suggest taking some part time courses to beef up your resume with something stable.  Your resume needs to reflect that you do have some direction and that you are somewhat progressing as you get older.

Examine your strengths and what you know.  For a change, think if you can be your own boss.  You have extensive experience in retail, you can put a shop selling some specialty items.  If you have a car or a van, you can do delivery service for shops/stores.  If you are a kind of handyman in the house, you can do repairs here and there.



If you cannot be your own boss, there are still jobs that are available that do not consider age, nor gender, nor special skills but good in oral communication.  I am referring to the call center where employees or agents receive calls for orders, complaints, or inquiries.  Another is medical transcription where employees transcribe doctors tapes into written forms.  In whatever job that you do, you must love the job.  Otherwise, you wont be able to keep it.

Hello,



(ANS) No.1 you have my sincerest heart felt sympathy as I can totally relate to your story.



No.2 OK! Lets put this into a wider context here. My dad was a GP a family doctor in Liverpool & when my father completed his training back in the 1950's there was no concept of unemployment & trained doctors expected a job for life in the NHS quite literally.



In the 1950's there existed a much larger manufacturing industry in this country, we used to make ships, cars, aircraft, military hardware, bash metal i.e. make steel & iron and on top of this we used to have old fashioned apprenticeships which often lasted around 5 years for example to become a master printer or master builder etc.



No.3 - In my life time I have seen employment & the world of work turned upside down (during the 1970's particularly). ALL the past notions of employment & job security have gone. Unemployment became a reality & under Margaret Thatcher and the once safe & solid UK manufacturing base was utterly ripped apart under the Tories of the time (people forget this now). In my life time the world has moved from local & national capitalism into global capitalism for better or worse. Global capitalism has changed the entire way we think of work as a result.



No.4 - I read a quote by management Guru Tom Peters about the future of work & the nature of employment. He said a graduate student coming out of university now can expect to have at least 10 or 12 major job changes in his or her working life (40-45years) time in 4 or 5 different skill areas, that people will be forced to have a portfolio of skills ( a bag of skills) & constantly have to retrain & constantly have to re-skill just to stay in paid employment.



No.5 - Do what you love most, try to find work that you can directly relate too NOT just because you have to earn money to pay your bills. Work that touches you inside? work that means something to you NOT just a job because its a means to an end.



No.6 I have come to think that those people like my dad or others I have met along the way. Who have had what we could call a "career" have had a sense of direction & purpose are the lucky one's. What is a career its nothing but a series of jobs or roles for which if looked at over the long term i.e. decades has a flavor or underlying theme. That's what I think a career in the true sense is but NOT everyone is lucky enough to have a career. I don't have any answers myself as I'm in a similar situation too. In other words I DON'T think you or me are alone here, I think there are many people who face the same dilemmas when it comes to work in the current situation, its very confusing.

First off, don't quit your existing job until you have another lined up.



Well you are asking a few questions but the main one sounds to be "How do I not get bored and stay at a job longer then a year?".



You stated something that was very important. You took your current job just to pay the bills. That is a trap that most people fall into. They just take any job that comes along and don't really think if it is something they want to do. If you really take some time and evaluate what you are looking for in a job and what positions are out there that fit in that criteria you will be a lot happier, do a better job and in the long run probably make more money. But to do that takes a lot more effort then just applying to a ton of jobs and see what one says "yes".



First take some time to really think about what you are looking for and not looking for in a position. The first couple of links I supplied below will help with that.



The second question that you asked is regarding how do I look employable with so many jobs in my past. That is a challenge because on a job search when you are applying for positions you do not want to look like a "job hopper". The best way to combat that is through what is called a "functional" resume. This type of resume focuses on your job skills and not your work history. The third link I sited below will give you and example of a functional resume. You will also want to write a killer cover letter. I gave examples of cover letters below in the fourth link.



Overall you are hitting a point in your life were you want more from a job then just paying bills. To get that takes a lot more effort and a concise, well thought out and professional job search. Finally, the final link I supplied is just to a ton of job search resources that may help.



GOOD LUCK!

Past Employer starting to harass me?



I quit a job a couple weeks ago due to unhappy employees around me yelling at one another, a poor training schedule and not being the correct fit for position.



I have by certified mail sent back any parking passes,badge and other materials.



They are insisting I sign an Exit summary which has incorrect data and dates and strange language and are insisting that I still have materials of theirs which I don't.



Is this harassment- I really cannot afford an attorney- but if I have to- I have to I guess.



Any advice?

I hope you still have the certified ticket.  Scan it and send it to them with the list of contents.  Notify them in a brief letter that they do not want an Exit summary from you, and list your reasons why.



Most business' don't harass people when they quit a job as they don't want the bad publicity.  That might just get them off your back.



A lawyer wouldn't really do you any good as this is a minor civil engagement.

I have never heard of a exit summary before, I think you did a excellent thing by returning the most important things such as your badge etc&gt;, via certified mail. This will look great for a judge. If anything happens in the future. How are they insisting? have they called you, written to you? If they have written to you requesting things with strange language etc..make the changes on the document to reflect the correct dates and that you do not have the material they are requesting. and then again and make a copy then send it certified as well. Just keep it all together and If they try, in the future to harass you
tell them you will consider hiring an attorney and you will no longer speak to them without one.

Don't sign anything.



Seems like they are up to something by sending you this form.  It wouldn't be hard for them to get accurate info so I am suspicious as to what is going on.



I almost want to think that they are trying to fudge the dates so they can either not pay you what is owed or try to say that they overpaid you and then tell you that you owe them.



Keep your records tight about what is sent to and from and keep copies if you send anything back to them.  Don't worry as I don't think you'll need a lawyer for your situation.  Hopefully if they owe you money you will get it without any problems.

Do they call you or send you mail?  Call the HEAD of their HR (human resources)department, talk to someone in HR and tell them you have sent in all the materials.  They should take you off their automatic mailing list.  Human Resources is more understanding than your direct managers and are easy to deal with and are good at conflict management.



If you contact HR and deal with them, I guarantee you will not hear from them anymore!

Signing an 'exit summary' can probably do YOU no good.  It could even involve signing away some of your rights, which may be part of why they'd want you to sign it.  If you were in the UK, I'd suspect they were trying to avoid the possibility of your claiming compensation for 'constructive dismissal' which can apply even if you resigned.



You do not need to sign confidentiality undertakings or anything like that because it was implicit in your contract and continues to apply without the need for further documentation.



I suggest you tell them in writing of the correct dates.  Tell them the things you have returned and that you do not believe have anything else belonging to the business.



Ask them to tell you in writing of anything they think you still have.  If they don't reply as suggested then you do not need to communicate with them again.



As you probably appreciate, this career mistake will not look good on a CV and you will need to be careful how you talk about it in future job applications.  Naturally, you cannot expect a glowing reference from this employer though they would put themselves at risk of legal action if they were to give an untrue reference that harmed your job prospects.

Help boost my morale?



Just got a job after taking several months to find a suitable one. However, am not very excited about going to work. Perhaps it is because the previous job was a living nightmare. Therefore, I am having fear about going to work at this new place. Next, the salary is below my expectation and am not that keen on the working schedule. What should I do?

It's a job, and it's really hard to find a job with the economy so messed up right now. Just go to work as usual and maybe start looking for another and better job while you're still at this one. You have bills to pay and you need to eat so take the job and roll with it for a bit. It might not be as bad as you think it is.

Work is not the only 4-letter word that ends in a "K".  :-)



No one likes to work. Think of it this way - if work was fun - they would call it "Fun".



"See you after I get off fun tonight."
"I'll see if I can get off from fun."



This is not your forever job - it's a means to the end.  Buck up, suck up - go get'em tiger!!!!

Does the work schedule fit your needs at all? I was wondering if you are going to school as well. I would say, if possilbe, just give it a chance. Work is what you make it. I have had those nightmare jobs you were talking about, if you are giving it your all, and are still not happy, at least give a notice, so you can use them as a reference for a new job. Try and go in with a positive attitude. Getting along with the people is a huge part of the job. Try and have an open mind. You can look for something else while you are still making money. I have found that the temp servicies specialize and accomodate your special interests of the kind of work you are seeking, and  help find a job with hours that work for you. Most are temp to hire. If you are not happy with a job, they find you another one. I think that is your best bet., and there are so many temp places out there. Good luck!!!

Eh, your attitude is already shot.  Why even show up?  Right off the bat you'll be a burden unless of course you can somehow angle a lawsuit for some form of sexual harassment.



Pathetic.



I'm sure you think I'm a jerk but go back and read your original message and ask yourself if you will be an asset or a problem to ANY employer.  Maybe in fantasy land you're worth more monetarily but based on your attitude they should reduce their pay offer to you and re-evaluate their hiring parctices.



About 2 million+ people are soon to be unemployed due to the economics of the country.  Many should've been unemployed a very long time ago.  Being humbled always reverses one's attitude.

Not exactly that, but almost everyday I feel like I don't fit in Or rather I am on an island at work.  I am the manager at my job and believe it or not that can be one of the lonliest positions there is.  I have a pretty good report with most of the people I am over, but there is still that divide between worker and boss. People just act differently around you than they do their fellow co workers.  When you come around it is like you have invaded their space and they are apprehensive because they think you are there to make them do something they don't want to do or you are nosing aroung trying to keep an eye on them.  Most of the time I enjoy the time I have by myself, but once in a while it gets a little boring or a little lonely because you just don't really have anyone else there to really talk to or most importantly to relate to.

I have an opposite problem - I feel like I'm in the "IN" crowd and I don't reach out enough to those around me so that they feel included.



The only reason I'm with my "crowd" is because over time I have realized that I can trust those folks.



When I have reached out - the people made me feel like I did the wrong thing.  Of couse it's totally possible they just don't like me.

What is the best job for someone who just likes to get high all the time?



My friend is a hard worker, but he graduated college with a degree in scoial sciences and basically no job skills.  He basically has lived in his bong since he was 17.  He's a great kid, but basically just wants a job,not a career.  He thinks a waiter is a good job if he's high all the time, but I was thinking maybe a landscaper or something.  Any other suggestions?

If you posess a degree - or any extra qualification - then you'll already be in front of of the crowd when it comes to looking for vocations. My mate has a degree and he wasn't certain what direction to go with it, but he unearthed some excellent tips and tricks on the site in the resource box below which guided him to settle that he wanted to be a lab assistant. There is plenty of help on the site regarding extra vocations.

No way to the landscaper. Thats hard work in the hot sun. If he's baked then it will definitely show while he is on the job. Have him look for a job at a call center- if he is high the rude people wont bother him as much and his laid back demeanor wont offend anyone- or go for bartending.

He could have fun at a day care facility with all the kids or possibly a country/western bar.  Both would benefit from his social science degree and the bong would be compatible for the patience level required in dealing with the "customers".



But where do you end up with that degree?  Working for the county at Social Services wishing you got a degree in finance or biology.

Should I tell my boss about my discomfort in the office?



I have way too many responsibilities in my dental office. I am only an assistant to the doctor and we have two(2) others with my same title.



-When things are misplaced, I'm to blame,
-When a procedure is not set -up or goes wrong, I'm to blame.
-When things aren't ordered, I'm to blame.
-Even when I haven't been in the office in the few days; I'll come back and I'm getting grilled for a case that I didn't even work on.



The grilling is being done by both my manager AND the doctor.



-I'm not the "head assistant" and I haven't been there the longest.



-My boss/ manager continually tells me how valuable I am to our practice and yet I get treated this way.



Should I tell them how I'm feeling "attacked" by them? And if so HOW?

Yes, You really should talk to them. If you let it stew it will just boil over and you will end up saying something or doing something you regret.



This happened to me just a few months ago. I sat down and had a meeting with the "culprits"



I figured if they were still rude and uncaring about it all then I didn't really want to work there anyway.



Make a list of points you want to discuss and go over them with a friend or family member. Don't get over emotional. Just act mature and prepared



It turned out they were totally unaware of their behaviour and were really apologetic and understanding about it. I even got a pay rise!

You need to know why.  You need to talk to your boss and get the truth.  Could be your boss does not think highly of you - if so - you need some feedback so you can improve.



It can also be because he cannot get a replacement for you unless you leave the company entirely.  That was always my problem - I could not get a replacement unless the person left the company.  I had to deny 2 of my employees - who I thought deserved it - promotions.

How can I go about turning down a job offer?



The interviewer offered me a temporary position and I didn't know how to tell them no to their face, how could I tell them without sounding like a complete *** hole by Email preferably.
Any input would be appreciated

Hi there,



There is a wonderful at home business that requires only $10 to start work from home. I'll pay your way into the first package (a $47 value). It's a legit on-line direct sales business opportunity where you receive a commission for product package sales ($47 to $97+ per sale) and you are able to keep 100% of the money made from sales. It uses the GPT (Get Paid Today) payment method & uses the "pay it forward" concept to provide one of the most lucrative cash leveraging compensation plans available today. I'm apart of an awesome team on some 100+ members who provide full support and help you get started.  There is not the time or space to discuss it here, but I have provided a link below where you can check it out and come to your own conclusion. Check it out and take the Free tour here http://www.CashNwithToniTone.info this tour will take you throught the entire set up of the business and go over the compinsation plan.  Be sure to contact me and let me know what you think. Have a great day.

First let me give you a little detail about the other 3 posts.



Post #1, Affiliate Marketing: a good way to make $$, but there is a learning curve. Figure on researching for hours and hours. But it can be done and you can be successful.



Post #2, MLM: Great way to make money, harder than you think it is, and you are looking at about a years worth of work to make $1000+ a month. But, if you put the time in, it can quickly turn from that $1000 a month into a substantial amount of income.



Post #3, Mystery Shopping. Sorry to the other poster, but you absolutely cannot make $1000 a month mystery shopping, unless you live in a rural area and are working it 40-60 hours a week.



I have done all three of these things in the past, and still do #1&2 (though with different companies/products).



Another thing you can do is build a profitable website on a hobby or skill of yours, but again, profit will not show up for several months.

I've got tons of experience, the vernacular of a Dean, superior people skills and a stunningly polished exterior and I've been told I interview great.



Never the less this time around in the job market has been unusually tough.....either over or under qualified.



I'm slinging out resume to everybody and his freaking kid brother, but other than "field slave work" no really good bites.



I'm looking very strongly at going back to school even at 47 and find a field more marketable.

some places are just anal, dont want anyone with any criminal history. others look more for things dealing with theft and fraud or violence. i have a possessions charge and i am able to get good jobs as i am very upfront with the whole ordeal. just be honest with them about everything and if your particular charge doesnt have any bearing in the company, they could look over it. i work for a tax firm and as a manager at a restaurant. half of these charges people get are bs anyways, a lapse in judgement shouldnt prevent you from furthering yourself once you are past all that.

You will need to get a trainee post with a solicitor's firm after the degree. These are in short supply. I once knew a woman in  exactly this position who had no difficulty getting the degree, but had waited six years and still never got a trainee post.  The firms do seem to prefer the younger people.

<answer>



There are lots of fields you could get into with a law degree. Many companies employ lawyers who don't necessarily litigate in court.
You can be assured that most big companies have a string of lawyers. From supermarket chains to advertising agencies you will find there are lawyers employed.

I want a job/internship/volunteer experience that will pad my resume for grad school NOT A STUDENT self emplyd?



I have been out of school 6 months (i'm 23), I have a bachelors in political science from the University of Pittsburgh and earn decent money playing poker professionally online (4K-??? tax free a month.) I HAVE SO MUCH DOWN TIME!!!!



I now live in Baltimore MD. I am interested in getting an MBA and maybe a JA as well potentially practice business law.



I also have incorporated a furniture moving business with my friend which only takes up about 8 hours a week (he needs the cash and i figured starting a business helps me wash income and looks good on a resume)



Any advice on something productive i could do with my days for resume/fulfillment purposes? Money is not an issue but time is. Unless its a really sweet gig i won't make enough to justify giving  up being a card shark.



Thanks

Would having a bad driving record hold me back from my ideal career?



So, I've always wanted to get into law enforcement, but i think my driving record, (a few speeding tickets there, an accident here) will hold me back on ANY job in law enforcement. I wanna know if they'll somehow look past my driving record and still allow me to serve.



Also, I heard if law enforcement is a field you'd like to get into, its a good idea to start in security or corrections, just so u have something to show on your resume and your serious about this kind of career, but i dont even think they want me due to the points on my license. Lastly, im going to court for all my tickets and i really wanna get my tickets cleared, i dont care how much money id have to pay, i just want to start off with a clean slate. any suggestions on wat to say to the judge? no BS please, just be short and sweet

It depends if it's a matter of not accommodating a 'disability'. Now, I'm not saying left-handedness is a disability, but it does require accommodations for certain machinery, as most machinery is arguably set up for right handed workers.



If everyone is being forced to change the way they use that machine, there is not much you can do. If the change only affects left-handed workers, you might have a case. If it affects your ability to safely do your job, because a left handed worker, working with their less dominant hand might cause safety problems, then you may have a case.



It really will depend on the reason for the switch. Contact the Labor Board in your state, and ask them what they think.



Good luck.

I can't give you the answer, but I would suggest that you see a solicitor, one that gives a free initial consultation and specialises in employment law. Changing your working conditions like this sounds like something tantamount to unfair dismissal. Or maybe your union could help?

You need both!  Experience alone will not get you a job, and a graduate degree alone won't guarantee anything, but combined you become super valuable and can get a job anywhere!



I have a friend that has no degree but worked in management for 15 years, got layed off his job, and now cannot find a job in management, EVEN WITH HIS EXPERIENCE, just because he doesn't have a degree.  Thankfully he is going to school to get the degree he never had....but you need both job experience and your degree!

It depends on the employer. If the experience is in the same area of work as you are going to, experience is key. If it is a new area of work for you, then a graduate degree is better.

Agreed with Daniel, both are optimum. In my field having opportunities for internship and so forth gives minimal experience to bolster employment qualifications. There's little point in the greatest theoretical understanding if it can not be applied with accuracy.

It's in the right direction.  Background checks take time and money and they  aren't going to waste  it on an obvious reject.
While you don't have the job until you receive an offer, it appears you are someone they have an interest in hiring .

The problem I have however is that I have lost a lot of wieght over the past years so I have only one shirt that actuatly fits me. It is a graphic T. All my dress shirts and polos are way to big for me these days and make me look quite akward when I'm wearing them. I figured I should just wear this graphic t and some jeans, I mean this is only a labourer job, do you think my clothes will have much of an impact?

First let me give you a little detail about the other 3 posts.



Post #1, Affiliate Marketing: a good way to make $$, but there is a learning curve. Figure on researching for hours and hours. But it can be done and you can be successful.



Post #2, MLM: Great way to make money, harder than you think it is, and you are looking at about a years worth of work to make $1000+ a month. But, if you put the time in, it can quickly turn from that $1000 a month into a substantial amount of income.



Post #3, Mystery Shopping. Sorry to the other poster, but you absolutely cannot make $1000 a month mystery shopping, unless you live in a rural area and are working it 40-60 hours a week.



I have done all three of these things in the past, and still do #1&2 (though with different companies/products).



Another thing you can do is build a profitable website on a hobby or skill of yours, but again, profit will not show up for several months.

Sure,



Interviewers are directed to ask every candidate the exact same questions in the exact same manner.



This rarely happens.



Cultural understanding and sensitivity questions are great opportunities to tell interviewers how you’ve helped others or when you’ve shown empathy.. Make up a really short story. Short because interviewers have short attention spans...
You've got 15 or 20 seconds to present your example.



Ability to work under pressure. You must prioritize. The phone rings, and unfortunately, it must be answered immediately. The interviewers want to hear that you’re going to get every task done ‘right now.’ Tell them what they want to hear - in 10-15 seconds.



Prioritizing workload and meeting strict deadlines. Maybe it’s best to stress your strong organizational skills here. How you are perceptive and proactive, and not reactive. You are efficient; so, succinctly tell them what they want to hear.



Good luck.

something that fits the vibe of the store. i'm the manager of a skate shop and i will not hire you if i get the vibe that your not going to fit in well. don't dress grungy by any means were something you feel good about your self in but don't over do it. a cute t shirt and casual slacks is always good. the only thing i would say don't ever wear to a interview anywhere is jeans or shorts.

I'd go for something smart  - I know you'd probably dress more casually doing the job but show them you respect them enough to make an effort.  Can't go wrong with some basic black trousers and a blouse or plain fitted t-shirt.  Maybe a red top would look good - gives an impression of a vibrant and confident person, which sounds to me ilke the type they'd want working in a record store.  If you're more a skirt person, try a simple black "worky type" skirt - the kind you'd wear to an office, with some black tights and again, a blouse or a basic top or t-shirt.  Aim for smart but not fussy, though accessories could show you're not entirely out of touch with trends...maybe a cool necklace or bracelet, but keep it understated.

The guy, treats me with little respect, speaks to me very rudely. Not only this, but he thinks he has authority over me, like, if he sets a day for me to work that i didn't know about, he would demand it to be done.
He swears on the shop grounds, and totally doesn't make the atmoshere positive at all.
I really want to leave, due to the fact i should have to put up with such crap for lousy pay. And just stick to my studys, but I dont know......

Why be miserable for crap pay ?? Find another job first... take control of what you do and not be bothered by what others do.  Things like this strengthen you because they force you to make decisions about your life. Put it down to experience. Do you think you will never meet a nerd like him again ?? because you will. So, logic says ; you have to deal with YOU then no one can get in your face again.  Of course you can speak to him, but it might not do any good. This man will never command loyalty yet he will never realise that.

Crappy managers exist everywhere so sadly sometimes the only solution is to either suck it up or leave.  But do find yourself a new gig before you do that.



Start your new job hunt now and that will make you a lot more relaxed around him because you know your days are numbered.  And think of the day that you finally get to give your notice!



In your spare time do some good job searches and then be done with your lousy boss.  Oh... and find someone else in the company to give you a reference as I would NOT trust this guy to say good things about anyone once you are gone.

You can request an appointment with Personnel/ or his boss to discuss the way forward, at the meeting make sure that you do not swear or appear to be whingeing - but deal with only the cold facts - do not let him get you on an emotional level - come up with solutions (getting rid of the boss is not one but with enough evidence his boss might just take the needed action) so you are seen as a pro-active team player.
Meantime look around for alternative employment - if the meeting goes poorly then at least you already have leads to get you a new job. Unfortunately in life you will meet many like him - you will have to learn to cope with them but it does get easier each time ;-)

Where to find entry-level jobs in digital graphics, design, publishing, etc...?



I've searched through every job-search site I could find, and virtually every job I've found requires someone with more experience than I have.  I tried applying to some, and none of them hired me! Duh!



I think I'll have a better chance if I look for one that is more my level, but I'm having trouble finding these jobs...any suggestions on where I should look?

$400 - $600 a week sounds reasonable and legit however, I could be wrong as many ads like that are sent out by con artists. I think it's better to just avoid those type of things altogether instead of running the risk of having less money than you started with.

Can anyone who has interviewed/worked for the Hallmark greeting card company please help me out as to what I should expect? I've done a little research online, but I'd love to hear from someone who has experience with them. I would greatly appreciate anything.

Hallmark was my first job while I was in high school. Don't worry about it at all... the interview should be really casual and relaxed, and so long as there is no scheduling problem,  you should assume you'll land the job.



Working at Hallmark was okay, it was fun during the summer as I was young and there was very little responsibility. A major portion of the job, is refilling the cards...new shipments are always coming in.



There are some "corporate" stores, owned by the company, and usually paying more, but the majority of the stores are owned and managed by random people, so your experience will vary greatly depending on what kind of guy you're working for...

that would  be illegal, companies get round it by creating a new, similar role with a different job title. you could probably have a good case for tribunal if they did that and often negotiate a better redundancy fee to avoid taking them to one.

As you may be aware, JOBS are made redundant, not people ..



However if they have multiple Jobs of the same type (eg Project Managers) they can make 1 redundant and then choose which of the employees with this title has to go (the method the use has to be 'fair' i.e. non-discriminatory - in most cases things like your past Performance Valuations are used) ..  .. this may mean some other 'Team' gets split up and that Manager takes over your team ..



However it they eliminate your Job and then recruit a new employee (or promote an existing employee) to do EXACTLY THE SAME job, they are plainly in breach of legislation - your remedy is to claim Unfair Dismissal at the Employment Tribunal (link), however in almost all cases all you get is compensation (it's extremely unlikely you will get your old job back)..



The time sale is, in effect, 6 months (since after that time you can not claim Unfair Dismissal).

In the UK redundancy is where the job ceases, diminishes or moves to another location.



If you employer has done this and then replaced you within three months they run the risk of you bringing a claim for unfair dismissal.  You will need one years service to bring the claim.  If you haven`t got one year in you won`t have much re course unless you can demonstrate discrimination etc [for which you don`t need one years service]



Therefore if they waited 3 months, they can get away with it.

It is only illegal to not hire for protected reasons, such as religion, sex, race, etc.  Where you live is not protected.  If he doesn't like "Smithtown" and its residents, there's not much you can do about that.

No-one savours the thought of searching for a job, and most of us desire all the help we can get. After being jobless over the past few weeks I got myself a  brilliant job after visiting the site in the box below and following their helpful advice for a month or so. give it a try, it certainly helped me.

Can it state in a reference that you were dismissed?



I was dismissed fro breaching the Internet Usage Policy at work back in January. I have found it impossible to find further work, but recently was offered a job with the Civil Aviation Authority. They knew about my dismissal and were ok with it. When the CAA's HR Dept asked for a reference from my previous employers (the NHS) they stated that I was dismissed for Breach of IT Security Policy!!!!!!! During my disciplinary hearing it was never called that, just Internet Usage Policy. Anyhow, because of the wording of the ref ie security, understandably, the CAA were unable to take me on.



Can the NHS do that???????????

You should have received written confirmation of which policy you breached when you were dismissed. Since the CAA were aware of your dismissal and were ok with it (did they offer you the job) then you may have a claim against the CAA. If on your written notification it does not use the word security then the NHS are out of line and wrong to use that wording. Check your paperwork and if necessary go to see a solicitor for advice (1st half hour is free)



Good luck with trying to make a go of things.

No they should not do this. A reference is precisley what it says; a reference. They should not give you a reference at all in this case.



If I were you get somebody who still works there to give you a reference and say good things about you. Eg a friend etc

Your former employer's obligation is to provide a true, accurate and fair reference that does not give a misleading impression.



If the reference is not accurate, you could sue them for defamation of character or negligence.



"If the reference contains something which the employee regards as unfair, this could lead to conflict and even litigation. An employee who has been the subject of an inaccurate reference can sue the employer for negligence. This is because the employer had a duty to take reasonable care in the preparation of a reference.



To succeed in such a claim the employee must be able to show that:



the information contained in the reference was misleading;
because of the misleading information, the reference was likely to have a material effect upon the mind of a reasonable recipient of the reference to the detriment of the employee;
the employee suffered loss as a result (for example the withdrawal of a job offer); and
the employer was negligent in providing such a reference."

A bank can take its charges out of  whatever credits are applied to the account,  the source is immaterial,



If these benefits are paid to an account,  open a new account for them with a different bank, building society or post Office,  so that the charging bank does not have access to this money.  The main thing is to manage your accounts  so that charges  are not necessary at all.

it is illegal to take bank charges from housing benefit/income support/tax credit etc as it is a means tested benefit the social security administration act 1992 says that charges should not be taken from income related benefits as this has been set up by the government as the minimum amount of money some one needs to live on i had this problem with the halifax plc i changed banks in the end and claimed my charges back good luck

Yes its illegal for the banks to take charges from any state benefit that is means tested as it is a set amount to what you need for the week and the banks taking charges from this money would leave you short for the week. But banks don't know what money in your account is benefits and what is wages or other income. You should have benefits go into a basic account of there own so that banks can't touch the money. But you can't stop the banks taking there fees as you should keep yourself within your limit so that you don't get charged.

Leave my job or stay?



For a person who is very irritated by people.  I am currently a correctional officer and I hate my job.  I feel as if I am going crazy and I've only been here for three months.  I know I shouldn't quit until I find another job but I know of a place that as long as you show up they have some work for you to do but it is minimum wage, half of what I'm making now.  I have my CNA license but I couldn't stand the nurses as a CNA.  I worked as a CNA for 8 months before switching to the DOC.  I just feel like I'm going crazy and I know I have a car note, rent, and high insurance but I believe I can make minimum wage work if I work like crazy every day.  But I don't know if I can go back to being a CNA, even if it was in home health.  I need some words of wisdom.  I know that economically I should stick with the DOC but when I say 'I hate my job'... I REALLY mean it.  Not saying it is a bad job, because it is quite easy but I feel like I am going to snap.  Maybe I can get work through a temp agency?  Give me wisdom.

What advice do you give to someone with a college degree who CAN'T find a job?



Graduated college in 2000.



B.S. degree in liberal arts from a state university.



I send out an average of 10 resumes per week and have not been able to find "suitable" employment in the entire 8 years since I graduated. I have worked a number of odd jobs such as: security guard, or temp. (none of the temp jobs have been temp-to-perm or otherwise produced any leads).



I've also done extensive volunteer work (even 2 years in the Peace Corps), but this too, has not helped.



Going back to school is a possibility, but why risk taking on additional student loans? Considering the difficulty I've had getting a job with the degree I already have, I don't see how an additional degree would help matters. It would simply give me more debt and higher interest payments. Besides, my GRE and LSAT schools are extremely low (if graduate or law school was even an option) and my GPA was barely passing. (I might be dyslexic).



There could be other reasons why I've had trouble getting a job, such as poor interviewing techniques or the lack of personal connections. But the first one seems irrelevant if you even have trouble (as I do) just getting an interview.



I am 30, single and living with my parents. Can't afford to live in an apartment, marry, or have children of my own. Can't afford to date (not that this matters anyway - just try getting a date when you work as a security guard and live with your parents)

They will want to know what you can offer to the team as a leader, how you would organise, eg a job list where you can check up on, they will most likely ask how you would feel about having to tell someone that they're getting a disciplinary or something like that, and what you would do in a crisis so think of a few times you have had to deal with a bad situation at work.

Either way you do it (in one doc. or by attaching them individually) it is always best to include a cover letter. :))



However, you should not use the same cover letter each time.  You can use the same basic outline, but each time you apply for a new position, you should tweak the cover letter to each new job you are applying for.



For example, if applying for  a job at the HSUS, you might write about your deep love of animals and cite examples of cat rescues, etc..
But in a cover letter as an Admin. Asst., for example, you would explain why you would make an excellent asset to the office you are applying at...
These are just broad examples. :))



Also, find out the name of the HR Director (or the person who will be interviewing candidates) and mail it to that person's attention.



Example:



Danielle D. Norton, Human Resources Director
Potomac Medical Supply Company
145 Johnstown Road, etc.....

I usually have separate documents - one for resume and one for cover letter - so that when I send e-mail attachments they're separate from each other, because the e-mail itself is usually in cover letter format.  However, if you are interested in making it all one document, then go for it, hon.



Just remember, remember, remember to be sure that you ALWAYS have all information correct.  You don't want to send a cover letter that was meant for Company A to Company B.  It looks very careless and unprofessional.



Good luck, hon!

Yes a Cover letter is helpful to send along with your resume.  In the cover letter tell them that you are interested in the said position and why you would be a good employee for them.

In high school, you'll definitely want to focus on math and science to prepare for college where you'll want to study either mechanical or automotive engineering.



See if there's anything related to the auto industry in your area.  Many places have programs for high school and college students, from simple tours and lectures, all the way up to internships and scholarships.  Your high school counselor may have leads on other programs you may find interesting that are related to engineering.  Find out about them and start participating.



These can also help you get into a good college, so start NOW.

Many companies do criminal background checks as well as credit reports.  However, they must get your permission to do the credit report.  Most companies want to make sure that you do not have a criminal record or a credit history that would place the company in a compromising position.



You do not have to have perfect credit no do you have to have a blank criminal history to get a job.  Try not to worry and know that this is standard and they are not looking so that they can exclude you, but to ensure their own safety and best interests.

It depends on what level they are doing this background check. There are some jobs that require that you have a basic background check, and then there are some jobs that require that you have a more detailed check.



Basic Security Check -- this one just basically will tell an employer whether it is a good idea to hire or you, or if there is criminal activity in the present or in the past.



Detailed or Enhanced Check -- this is the one that they can do a whole host of checking such as credit, where you have lived and worked for the past 10 years, you driving record, criminal activity, and what you have done during employment gaps.

i would say is't just an assessment of the skills/knowledge you currently have that would be needed for the position you're applying for.  i wouldn't be nervous.  just do the best you can.  if you find it difficult and kill it, sure you might not be the person they're looking for but at the same time, maybe you'll discover the position isn't what you're lookng for either after that "task".  and even if you don't do well, doesn't mean they won't hire you.  when talking with your interviewer, to help just make it a point to them that you're a quick learner and easily trainable.  they may find the investment worth it if you can pick up quickly.

These type of tests are behavior/scenario like interviews.  They will be giving you a test to see how you think on your feet and how you would be able to different tasks in how they relate to your job as an administrator.



Some examples of scenarios that they may give you to do are:



1) Writing a piece of correspondence regarding a specific issue
2) Creating a spreadsheet or other sort of excel or MS office document
3) Provide a numerous amount of different tasks
4) To organize correctly a couple of senior managers
5) To show how you would organize your day
6) To show a bookkeeping function
7) To explain how you would hire or fire an individual
8) Payroll question
9) Manage a conference or an event
10) A combination of all of these like for instance with multiple choices



This is a small sample of things that you may be required to do as an administrator.



I wish you good luck on the job, and hope that you do well.  Do not get nervous.  This is one of the things that they are testing you for during this interview.

Do a little research on the company. Learn as much about them as possible, i.e. the history of the company, products offered, customer loyalty, etc... Review the qualifications, skills, duties they posted for the position you are interviewing for. What ever task you are given tomorrow, whether it be organizing a meeting, preparing reports, delegating work to subordinates, what ever it may be, be sure to showcase those qualification and skills required utilizing the wealth of information you learned from researching the company. Perform the tasks as if you are already employed there.

If they are asking you to have a diploma level in each of these areas then it requires that you have some knowledge or training in these areas.  I would say that they would be for skilled workers.  If you don't have training in these areas, you should probably get some training in some of these areas if you're wanting to work in these areas.

There's no such thing as a diploma level for being a waiter, room attendant and bartender. Unless you're an educated person with a college degree who has to resort to taking those types of jobs. All of those except for being a chef are unskilled jobs. Chefs actually go to culinary school and have to learn to cook well.

What should I do about this crazy situation at work?



So I have been at my job for about four months, I work at a hotel. I was hired specifically to do bookkeeping, bar audit and respond to emails on the overnight shift and prep part of the contenintal breakfast before I leave in the morning. In addition to this my boss has added several other tasks, setting up promotional emails using constant contact, kitchen inventory, bar and kitchen ordering, doing the accountants job when she is on vacation, and a few other things. I mentined about a month ago that it seemed like my duties were extening beyond what we had origionaly discused and he said no I was hired to do whatever he wanted me to.



Well, last week on of the other girls got in trouble for taking a lunch break (yes, I realize that this it's crazy to get in trouble for taking a lunch). She was the one responsable for amking the schedule. Her punishment is that I get to make the schedule now. I haven't quite figured out how that is punishment for her and not me. When I came in tonight I had a note in my box to make the schedule for the next two weeks to post tomorrow, and to leave someone off of it because they will no longer be working here, that they don't yet, but they will figure it out. He is also going to be out of town for the next couple of days.
So that leaves me making a rediculusly low wage doing all these things that we didn't discus when I agreed to work here for the said low wage. It also leaves me to deal with this person wanting to know why they aren't on the schedule.
How do I approch my boss and let him know that 1) I don't want to make the schedule, having me do it punishes me more than anyone else, or 2) That if I am going to have to make the schedule I would like a raise because I've taken on way more responsibility than we origionally talked about.



</question>



<additional details>



I live in a really small town and just quiting isn't really an option. There are only about 14 people who work at the same place I do.



On a somewhat unrelated note, I was looking online at jobs the other day when I saw that my boss posted two positions. On for head of Maintenance and Gardening, a possition currently held by a long time employee. The other for a Front of House manager to do some of the job I was hired for and some of the things I do in addition to that, and some of the things some of the other girls do.



My boss is the owner. There are only 14 employees. 4 desk, 1 bar tender, 4 housekeeping, 1 accountant, 3 maintenance, 1 event planner. So, it's kind of really us agains him.

Employees do have rights, and you have the right of an employment contract with a solid job description. No, don't just quit, but it might be a good idea to start looking for something else. I recommend a serious talk with your employer - however hard it may seem. If he doesn't value you as an employee, then it's simply not worth it at all.

I appreciate your frustration, but rarely is a job description set in stone, especially in a smaller organization where flexibility is needed when people are out sick or on vacation, or are terminated/quit.  At this point, because  you are so new, and because the economy stinks, I'd be inclined to suck it up and do my best without complaining.  In another two months, you'll have been there 6 months- and at that point it would be reasonable for you to go to the owner (with documentation) and say "Mr Boss, I've been here six months, and I've taken on quite a bit more than my original job description.

I can appreciate the frustration that you have in this situation.  But when you are hired, you are hired to do what your boss asks of you.  I believe that he thinks you can handle what he gives you, or he wouldn't be giving those tasks to you.  I know that you don't want to work for a low wage, but that is reality.  If you are unhappy with the wage that you're making, then apply for another one of the jobs that he has listed, or look for a company somewhere else that meets your needs.  Bosses are quite smart in the fact that they won't press something on their workers that they cannot do.  Also with what he was mentioning with the Front of House manager, it is possible that he is testing you to see how you would be in that role.  Don't argue with him, just do what he asks, and you might find yourself going up in role or stature within your company. Just because he posted the jobs doesn't mean that he doesn't want you or doesn't want anyone else within the company.  He is just wanting to post the positions in case the tests that he gives you guys don't work out.  I hope that this helps.

Job hunting can be a tricky task in itself, especially if you're not used to it. I was struggling with my job hunting for the last month until I found the site in the box below website which has some  great instruction for job searchers. After following their helpful advice for a month or so I scored myself a  great job.

Hi steven,



More and more people are now considering starting an internet-based business right at the comforts of their own homes.  For me, it was an online jewelry store.  I started mine about 8 weeks ago and just passed $800 in profit.  If you'd like free information, the link is below.  And don't worry...it only cost $12.95 if you decide to do it.



I'm glad I did it and hope you do the same.

Yes you would also be able to do this. If your heart is not in for going several of years to school, then I would choose nursing for you.  You will still have to go through several of years, but you may be able to shave off a year or so if you became a nursing anethestist. Actually a anethesiologist would take a lot longer to complete, since you have to go through a minimum of 4 years for general medicine, and then you never really stop learning in any of thse field areas.

I don't know what style they prefer something that can get messy probably...like a sports kinda watch but, the watch doesn't HAVE to be for on the job...It could be a great watch that is sophisticated and fun for going out day or night. A nice classy watch is a must have in every accessory collection.

I don't know that a particular brand or style is preferred by nurses, but your daughter of course might prefer a certain brand.  Maybe ask her friends what the "in" style is for her age group.



For nursing school, I would suggest she use a watch with a second hand, one that's easy to see.



Straps are good, I think fobs get in the way.  A strap is always attached to you :)

Should a company be able to fire you for a tattoo?



If you're hired, THEN get one, should the company be able to let you go? Touchy subject, I know, and BELIEVE ME- I am all for a good tattoo. But I was in a Guess store and the manager was a cute girl with a black butterfly in the center of the front of her throat. It was badass, don't get me wrong, about three inches long not counting the wingspan.
But I couldnt help but think "Is that the image Guess wants out there, representing their store?"

No, but you can't control what happened in the past, just make the other points on your resume so strong that the recruiters will look over that "bad spot" and still want to hire you because they realize you've made up for that mistake in other ways.

What is the perfect job for a full time college student?



I am really not too motivated to work, and school is my first priority. But, it would be nice to have a little extra spending cash so my husband and I can go out and enjoy things a bit more. What can I do? I have gotten a few little part time jobs, but nobody is ever in school or has gone to college, so they are not flexible, and do not understant college is work. My last job was asking me to come in everyday that I had off, and if I told them no they would put this big guilt trip on me saying they had to have their kids come in to do my job. I just don't want that. I was thinking of going to a gromming class, so that I can groom dogs through home, or pick up kids after school? That sort of thing. I like being in the comfort of my own home, and I am definetly a home body. So, what do you think? I though about maybe a paper route, but everyone says that they suck? I don't know????

If you have been looking for a work from home opportunity, you may have seen alot of ads for data entry jobs, ptc sites, stuffing envelopes, etc, etc.  I've tried them all and lost so much money.  Finally I decided to start my own home based business and now I'm taking down almost $200 a week from the couch.  I now run my very own online jewelry store.  You don’t need any experience, they ship and process all sales, handle all customer service and even give you a website.  The information to get started is free and if you want to do it, it's just a measly $12.95 a month.  Truly, you can't beat it.

I go to college full time and work.  It's a lot but I have to do it to pay my bills.



If they schedule you every day that you're off, then find someone to pick up your shifts or close your availability a bit.



You can do it but it's going to be a lot of work.  If you don't want to work, then don't.



I'd recommend looking for a serving position.  You get paid every day.
But internships would be the ideal job for a full-time student.

A cover letter must always accompany your resume and/or application to an employer. When emailing your resume, you may choose to incorporate your cover letter into the email document. If you choose to attach and send the cover letter to be printed, be sure to include a brief introduction in the actual email document as well. Put a specific subject line and a brief message within your email document, to let the recipient know the attached files aren’t viruses.



COVER LETTER DO'S & DON'TS:
DO find out the name and title of the person who makes hiring



decisions and write to her/him directly if at all possible.



DO address the letter to “Dear Sir or Madame” if you absolutely can’t find out the name of the person you are writing to.



DO compose each letter individually for each specific job or



company.



DO be as specific as possible.



DO keep it to one page, especially for entry-level positions.



DO use plain white paper



DO have a date on your letter



DO indicate if you are attaching or enclosing other documents



DO NOT address your letter "To Whom it May Concern".



DO NOT address your letter to “Dear Sir” unless you are 110% sure you are writing to a man.



DO NOT use “Mrs.” or “Miss”, always use “Ms.”



DO NOT write one general letter and send it to several companies



DO NOT begin each sentence with “I”. Describe what you will contribute to the organization, not what you will gain from the position.



DO NOT sign a letter in bright colors such as red, pink or purple.



DO NOT attempt to use a creative format, unless your job is 100% based on creativity.

How do you break free from a job where everyone is so dependent on you?



i've been here about three years. i like it OK, but i disagree with how things are run, some decisions that have been made, and i know i am not going to get a raise anytime soon. all kinds of unfair things have happened here and i'm getting really fed up and burnt out.



trouble is, i'm depended on quite a bit. i tried to leave for a better job last year and got put on such a guilt trip i ended up staying. (sigh)



this is a total "dead-end" job...meaning no advancement, and sometimes, with the way things are run, i worry that they won't be able to afford to pay us one week and i'll be up poop crick without a paddle.



i know i have the talent and experience to get a better job. i just feel like i can't escape from here. if i do quit they will want me to train my replacement and i have absolutely no inclination to do so. i've worked very hard for this company and feel i have gotten very little in return.

Yes i have been in this position and it really *stinks*. Let's just say they STILL miss me. You have one life, don't waste it on someone else's business. You deserve credit for your contributions, if you are being used and abused, leave.

Everything you said.....tell it to the guy who signs the checks (but exclude the criticism).



Your boss, if he has any brains, will appreciate your candor and honesty.  He will also respect you more.  And make suggestions to him as to how you can delegate some of  your duties that others should be doing anyway.  If all that doesn't improve your situation within a reasonable time frame, give the Boss two weeks notice, AND MEAN IT.  If you don't get results,  they are idiots and don't deserve your loyalty and expertise.  Good Luck

Does anyone know a job I could do?



I need a job I can work a few hours a week, either in the evenings or on the weekends or both, while I have a small home daycare during the day and stay home with my son.  I have a job like this (providing support for people with disabilities), but I hate it, and it only pays $8.50 an hour.  I'm working too much, and too hard, and not having much to show for it.  I have a college degree in Elementary education.  Can anyone think of a job I could find where I could use my education to make more money for my time?  I need it because watching children alone is not enough money, it is unstable, and if I lose children I need something to fall back on, pick up hours, etc.

How do I ask my best-friend-boss for a raise?



I have been working for her for 4 1/2 years now.  Her daughter used to do my job and made over $5 per hour more than me and that was 3 years ago.  My boss is always telling me how awesome I am and how I am the best employee she has ever had, hands down.  During the past 3 years, our sales have increased over the previous 3 years.  The last time I got a raise was 9/07.  I don't want to offend her by asking, but I think I deserve to get paid a lot more than I am.  What would I say to her or how could I 'hint' without actually asking??

I agree that it "depends".



You may find it best to keep it covered up since many offices are very conservative.  I work in the legal profession and must keep the one on my upper arm covered, which isn't really a big deal.  However, I don't worry about covering up my small ankle tattoo.

<asker's comment>



well you're proof an intelligent woman can have tattoos and a good career. it's important for me to see it, but i'll make sure it's small enough to cover it up with a fat watch :)

It depends on where you work. Most employers do not look kindly on tattoos. Where I work, they insist that you keep them covered. Having said that, the wrist is a hard place to keep covered. I know a girl who has a tattoo on her wrist, but she has to put makeup on it while she's at work. Weigh your personal pros and cons of wanting a tattoo and the hassle of keeping it covered.

yes it could def. disqualify you for certain jobs.  Maybe you can hide it behind a watch or something.  Well, actually, my ex GM had a butterfly tattooed on her wrist (very small but visible) for her late son. It symbolized something good.  I guess it really all depends on what you get.  I think that if you keep it small and tasteful it would probably be ok.  Use your best judgement.

Is this the best boss anyone has ever heard of?



I work in an office with 24 people mostly single moms.  We got a new boss BOB that is 25 years old and he is very handsome, hot and sexy.  He is the greatest boss any of us have ever had. Our old boss was fat, old, and ugly and hit on every female that worked for him married or not. What a contrast Bob is.  Us single moms sometimes need time off for dr appointments or school events.  Bob will cover for us when we take off time.  Last week I had to work late on an emergency job and I couldn’t find someone to take babysit my kids.  Bob took off work, picked up his girlfriend a model (She is gorgeous. To be that young and beautiful is every girls dream.) and picked up my kids from day care.  They took them to dinner, and a movie and them brought them home. He would not take any money for doing that. My kids were thrilled with him and his girlfriend and told me I should date him. That is not possible for 2 reasons.  His girlfriend is beautiful and he told us on day one, he would not date anyone that worked for him even though he thought that all the women that worked for him were beautiful.  He has done similar things to help the other single moms in the office.  We all want to give him something to show our appreciation but what we most want to give him, I know his girlfriend would not approve.



Any ideas on what we could do to show our appreciation.



Is this the greatest boss anyone has ever heard off. I wish we know how to nominate him for a boss of the year award.

Enrolled Nurses overseas?



Hi, I live in Australia and will be a freshly graduated enrolled nurse end of this year, and I would love to work overseas as an EN one day. I was just wondering if there are many enrolled nursing jobs opportunities overseas? And if there are any enrolled nurses from Australia working in another country, how did you come about going overseas? What are the requirements? How much experience do u need to have had?



Cheers

I Sound To Customer Service?



So today was my first day @ a telemarketing call center.. && I didn't expect it to be anything like it was.. I have had several phone jobs. My first job that I had for 2 yrs. was a receptionist at a car dealership then I transferred over to the body shop  to be an admin assistant. I did that for a year I handled all phone calls to customers as well as insurance companies.. having all this experience beign on the phone I thought I would excel at this job like I did my previous one.



That was defenitly not the case though.. The supervisor who was traning me said I have a very sweet soft && gentle voice but it just sounds too "customer service." I didnt know how to take this.. is that a good thing or bad thing? I have never had any say anything negative about my voice or tone.. until her.. I do have a very girlie voice but I always got compliments on it in my previous job cuz i always sounded happy && sweet. I guess I didn't sound like a serious salesperson or something. IDK! but she sent me home early && asked me to work on the script. She also said that if I didn't want to come back "her feelings wouldn't be hurt" I seriously think she hinted at me that she doesn't want me to come back! haha! I got another job interview on Thursday @ Kohl's they called me today. Do yall think I should stay with this telemarketing job?? I need advice! thanx

First of all - what a witch (the call center head)!



Second of all - why would you WANT to be a telemarketer????  I mean, most telemarketing calls can be avoided by the "Do Not Call" list (I'm making an assumption that you're in the US, if not, forgive me) so there aren't nearly as many calls to make.



This isn't the job for you apparently, hon.  You deserve to work somewhere where you will be treated better than this.  This woman (witch) apparently is afraid that you won't be able to make a sale because you have a softer voice, but I'll tell you this right now, I am a purchasing agent and I get a lot of sales pitches day in and day out and let me tell you, I HATE the people that call here and are loud and will not let you get a word in edgewise.  I usually hang up on them and if they call me back, before they even begin their spiel again, I tell them their behavior is unacceptable and I am not interested.



Go to the interview at Kohl's and keep an eye out for other jobs.  This isn't the place for you.  But I would NOT quit unless you had another job.

Kohl's sounds a lot better to me but if you need the money go on back tomorrow and give it one more day.



You've done well in the past so you should trust your judgment on this.

i would say screw it. it just doesnt sound like it's going to work out. (not your fault!) i would personally rather talk to someone who sounds nice on the phone...but it sounds like the boss thinks ur too nice and may not be able to close a sale.
anyway, kohls sounds like more of a fun environment. quit now if u can wait for $ til u get hired somewhere else. hope kohls works out!

No, don't stay with the job. It's not a good sign for a long-term commitment to a job when your boss shows dislike of you and say things like "my feelings wouldn't be hurt if you didn't want to come back." Under her, it will be harder for you to get promotion either.
Since you have another job interview, go for it. I hope you get the job at Kohl's. Your sweet and happy voice will be a plus, not a negative for a retail store like Kohl's.
Good luck!

Any help to find a job?



Ok so I been looking for a job for the last 6 months now and havent come up with anything (Last job discharged me on the account they had too many people and couldnt afford anymore). My email has 280 sent resume's and applications (not including the times I actually went out and drove around and put in applications in person) and only about 40 in my inbox are actuall replies (the rest are just junk mail telling me that some job found my resume online or to go back to school through university of phoenix or some crap). The actuall 40 are just people telling me they will look at my resume or they will call or dissapointments saying they went with another candidate. Some were actuall interviews that I went on and did extremely well in them but I still wasnt chosen for the position. Anyway Im tired of the signs saying we not hiring, or we're not taking applications, or we will keep your resume on file. Im sick on those phrases. The economy has made me lose everything (my apartment, my pride, any money I have saved up, and a tremendous amount of debt). Im living with my girlfriend and her folks until I can get back on my feet, but it looks like there is no hope. I heard all the inspiration things people tell me (dont give up, keep trying, something will come through, blah blah blah) and it means nothing to me because Im not seeing any change..even when I have a positive attitude all I get is let down, Day in day out, Im sitting here looking for jobs (mainly because i cant afford to put even a single drop of gas in my car) waiting for the phone to ring about an opportunity and nothing happens. Im doing my part, Im busting my a** everyday and nothing comes through. I have revised my resume so many times to fit the position Im looking for it ridiculous (not to mention all the profiles I have online to fill out for jobs). I have plenty of work experience and college. I cant even get a freakin retail job and its the holiday season. Not even FedEx or any other warehouse job is hiring and they are ALWAYS hiring. Anyway I live in Orlando FL (no dont tell me to go work at the theme parks because they are not hiring either) and any advice anyone has would help a lot. Its just hurts that when your a man you cant even take care of the one's you love or be the bread bringer (like I once was). Also unemployment denied me so thats out of the question too.

I got this email today...is the job oppotunity for real?



From: David Martins (davidmartins89@yahoo.com)



Sent: 30 October 2008 16:15:30



HERE IS MORE INFO ABOUT THE JOB:



This Self Employed Data Entry/Online Information Products Processor opportunity requires that you have a reliable computer with Internet access and capabilities, a valid E-mail account, basic Internet knowledge, and basic typing skills. You must also be able to conduct yourself in a professional manner. This includes having excellent grammar and spelling when communicating with clients via E-mail.



In addition to the above requirements, you MUST be able to follow instructions closely and completely! You will do all contact via E-mail, so you will not be required to call anyone at anytime. This allows you to work whichever hours are most convenient for you (days, night, or weekends).



You will be processing applications/orders, as well as placing ads by filling out forms in specific company databases (this tends to be tedious at times, so please be sure that you have the patience to do so before proceeding). This is why you will need to have basic Internet knowledge, though the training provided will give you step-by-step instructions on how to perform these tasks properly. There are no "down-times" with this position, so you will have a constant flow of work to complete. THIS IS NOT A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME, so if that is what you are looking for please do not pursue this opportunity.



There is work involved. You will be processing applications and orders from people responding to ads for a home based online information products business placed by you, which will be explained to you in the training materials.  As with any business opportunity you must be willing to work hard and try to respond to the orders in a timely manner.



You will be earning $10 - $20 (depending on what you charge) for each application/order you process. For example; if you process 30 applications/orders in a week you will make $300.00 - $600.00 weekly. The amount of money that you earn is entirely up to you, it depends on the amount of time and effort you choose to put in. Also to process just one order usually takes about 15-20 minutes.  The average part-time person makes $150 - $250 per week.



This work from home opportunity is legitimate, has excellent products and is very lucrative.



When you begin your new home based business as a Data Entry/Online Information Products Processor, you are considered a Self-employed Independent Home Based Business Owner. This means that as with any self employed position your taxes etc will be your responsibility.  The training provided will go a little more in depth about what to do with your taxes. You will receive your pay through a secure



online payment processor that deals with worldwide transactions or whichever online payment portal you choose. When an application is completed, $10 - $20 will be credited to your online payment processor account, which can be withdrawn into your bank account at your leisure.



You will have access to over 100 products valued at over $150 for your own or business use.  The 100+ information products come with resell rights and most have their own order pulling websites that you can set up and advertise to increase your income, you can sell this as a complete package or choose to sell the products separately.



There is a one-time non-refundable fee for the training materials and information products package. This also includes all processing fees and training costs. We offer professional on-line support for as long as you may need us. This is a one-time fee, and there will be no other charges to you. However, the fee must be received before you can gain access to the Training materials. We must accept this fee to cover



training costs, products, processing fees etc as well as to ensure that only serious applicants apply. This is a non-refundable fee, as this entire



package is delivered via the internet and once you have received it, it is impossible to ensure its return. All will be explained in the training materials.



This fee will not be waived for anyone, and cannot be sent from your first earnings.



Once your payment is received, you will be given a Login ID and Password via email to gain immediate access to your training materials. You will also get another email with information on how to access your downloadable online information products.  You will need a word processing program in order to perform this position successfully



(MS Word, Works, Notepad, etc.) Once you have logged into the Training Area, you will be able to access the training materials, and START working from home TODAY.



Most people typically complete the training within 24 hours or less. However, you can do this at your leisure. Keep in mind that the sooner you go through the training materials, the sooner you will START earning money with your new online business. I will be able to be contacted via E-mail at anytime af

If the case is to get him out of jail and put an end to his erroneous sentencing, you want a criminal defense attorney.  (The case is the State v. your brother-in-law, and you want an attorney to represent your brother-in-law.)



If the case is to award him monetary damages for being improperly jailed, you want a civil plaintiff's attorney.  (The case would be your brother-in-law v. the police, and you want an attorney to sue the police on behalf of your brother.)

How can I ask my HR dept. to see the application & resume I submitted 2yrs ago without raising suspicion?



Please don't respond to my question asking why I want to see these things. Trust me I have a VERY good reason for asking this. its just not something I care to share because you never know who could be lurking in your questions.



If you really want to know give me a good answer and I'll tell you why.

Is it really wrong to quit a job if you hate it, notcomfortable with coworkers, and ready for something bettr?



I've had this job for 1.5 years. There's no advancement, salary is low,,,,and i dont use any of my skills in computer and problem solving.
it's just removing staples from docs and organizing .



Coworkers are disrespectful as hell, cussin all the time and using disgusting language( they're girls but the disrespectful kind), not following the rules. MOreover, the pay is low and this company doens't care about us temporary workers...they treat us like trash. they put us to work in an unsafe dirty environment while they have a nice office.



I'm planning on quitting soon but fiirst i'll ask if i can do it part time so i can begin extensive job search.



is it wrong that i wanna quit ?? Some people would argue some money is better than none..BUT i've done that for long..I think it's time for something better. no?

we are living in harsh economic times, dont quit just yet, you may regret it, stick it out for a little bit longer and save some rainy day pay, I had a job where all my co-workers did drugs on the job and they hated me because i wouldnt do drugs with them, and they thought I was an undercover cop, they even threatened my life, saying that if I ever ratted them out I would be dead before I could get home, so I understand what your dealing with as far as co workers, just save that rainy day pay and then leave when you can.

Help! I don't know how to start my career? There are many things I want to do.?



I am really passionate about DANCING! but most dancing classes given at colleges are modern dance and ballet. I like it but it's not what I am looking for. I want to focus on having a career in Latin Ballroom dancing and I have not found a major that relates to latin ballroom dancing. I don't want to be a choreographer either. I want to be a dancer and compete around the world.
Another career I am very interested in is Zoology. I love animals and would like to help save endangered species. I know that this might involve traveling and getting my hands dirty and I'm completely fine with that.
Something else that really catches my attention is the United Nations. I know that I can work with some type of peace core to help children refugees in poor areas of the world. In this career at most times I know that my life could be in danger and I am completely fine with that too because my heart belongs saving or helping those in need.



My problem is I WANT TO DO THEM ALL!!! I am only 18 years old and I know exactly what I want I just don't know which to do first where to start...My biggest fear is starting off with one career and later finding out that I will not have the time and money to do them all. I'm barely in a local community college and I'm struggling already. I am a part time student and I'm looking to transfer to a 4 yr. institution but with what career?? I also work part time. It's complicated for me to ask this question without getting an answer like "You're crazy" or "Do you really think you can do it all?" I know I can. I just don't know where to start. I have very limited support from the people around me. Some people want me to work in a closed office or do something else I'm good at like drawing, photography or witing. I love doing those things too but it's not what "I" want to do. Is there anyone who can help? or direct me to someone who can help me besides a phycologist?

Isn't It Time You Followed Your Real Dreams ?



This extraordinary book is designed to help you achieve them. In it, Barbara Sher goes beyond the groundbreaking principles introduced in her phenomenal number one best seller, Wishcraft. Here she adds an important new element to the practical advice, success secrets, and motivational techniques that have transformed so many lives... because thousands of people have told her that they can't get what they want because they just don't know what they want.



Do those words sound familiar? If so, you have a common problem, and there is a solution. And Barbara Sher has a surprise for you. You Do know what you want. Your life is filled with clues. Everything you do, or don't do, has a good reason behind it. With profound wisdom and reassurance, she helps you peel away the layers, reveal your true hopes and aspirations, and discover exactly what has been holding you back. Because whatever it is Can Be Removed.



"This book is for those who want to find their passion. It is a step-by-step guide for restructuring one's life so tha it has meaning, direction and joy. I've always recommended Wishcraft to adults who were lost and trying to find themselves. This book should be mandatory reading for all high school students to prevent them from becoming lost adults."

How do I apply to the Law Review?



Applications are now open for students to apply to my University's Law Review. They state that you need to write an application letter of interest stating why you want to be on the LR.



I'm not sure exactly what I need to write to make myself competitive. I have 'decent' grades but I think I still have a strong chance. My head of school said to write an application about why I want to be included but also state my interests and research I have done (if possible). Does this mean independent research or research I have done in class?



Any advice will be gladly received!

<answer>



I don't personally think it matters how long you worked there, in a resume it is always better to include as much information as possible.



During high school and TAFE I had to undergo some "work experience" where you work at a company for a week and have to write a report on your week and I've even included those in my resume in a seperate little section at the bottom.

Is it legal for an employer to force an employee to pay for training that is mandated by the employer?



This is a legal question. My brother works in the state of Florida. His Employer has told him along with all of his employees that they must pay for a safety training course so that the company can have lower insurance costs. Is it legal for the employer to make the employees pay? If they don't pay, it was said they will be fined. Is this legal as well?



I'm not looking for opinions, as I think it's total crap, but actual Legal advice or direction to find it.

How to handle insensitive questions at work and at college?



Okay so here's my deal. I was born in Russia and I grew up in the U.S. I'm a naturalized U.S. citizen. Sometimes at work and college I encounter really weird stereotypes.



I had a professor ask me "oh wasn't Russia a communist country?" and then at work this one time this girl said "oh Russians aren't really that friendly, they're rude."



I mean I'm sure they wouldn't appreciated if I had said "so Americans were slave owners and didn't you put Japanese-Americans into camps even though they were born in America, during world war 2?"



Although oddly enough the professor that asked me that was from middle eastern descent. I wrote a letter of complaint to my college about the professor. Besides complaining what can I do to handle insensitive questions?

I would try to respond with factual but pointed responses. For example to the question about communism, I would say "I wouldn't know, I've been an American citizen since (year) and I don't keep up on Russian politics"



Sorry you have to endure that. Here's a bit of humor that hopefully cheer you up. I once overheard a woman at a restaurant talking about her recent trip to Canada. I couldn't help but listen in because she was talking louder than anyone should ever talk in a restaurant. She was complaining because she was the only American in the group and everyone just called her "the American" She ended her frustrated rant with this comical contradiction "I hate Canadians, they're so racist." At that point I couldn't help but laugh.



Anyway when people ask insensitive questions I would just make it clear that you don't appreciate being stereotyped because of your heritage, and that you are proud to be an American.

I don't think it was intentional. I don't think they were trying to hurt you. Why would they? I don't see why you couldn't say what you say here but in a slightly joking manner? That's like saying if I were to say to you about Americans being slave owners or how we treated Native Americans or about Japanese-Americans or even Middle Easterners here today? Were you here after 9-11 when Indians were being targeted because people thought they were Middle Eastern.



You could come back with some information since those sound like questions.



Cultural differences can be mistaken for rudeness or something other than what it actually is.



edit: Some Americans tend to be pretty blunt and direct. They say what it is on their minds. It's not always pretty and nice. I wish I could say that you get used to it but it's more like you learn to tolerate it because you can't change how people are. You can enlighten them though.

I would like to get certified for medical billing and coding, and was looking into Concorde Career College.... however right now due to money issues and child care restraints, it would be very difficult for me to be able to go to class.

In writing your resume, you must always emphasize your achievements. However, don't overdo it. Write the achievements that you think would compliment the position you are applying for.



Regarding the degree, you can just place their that you are CURRENTLY studying... whatever your course is.

I think they might still call you. form your description I assume that they told you they would  call you to inform you about their decision - no matter what it is. So wait maybe till Monday and if they do not call, give them a call.

Many companies are too business minded that they are inhuman sometimes or too busy to pay attention to trivial things like calling you back.  So its better to consider several alternatives while you apply for a job.  In that sense,  some will call you up at the end.

Potential employers 'say' one thing, and do another. Myself? I am still waiting for a call from a potential employer with whom I interviewed last week. If a potential employer can not do something as simple as calling me back when they 'promised', you have to ask yourself..."Do I really really want to work for them?"



A) We are in a recession, bordering upon depression, and; B) It is an employers market and they KNOW it.  Competition is fierce for even Part Time work.  Best advice?  Keep on looking.  If they can't contact when promised, it is best to move on.  They 'may' contact you down the road...but, you STILL have to pay your bills and eat in the meantime.

Depends how long you have worked there, as redundancy pay depends on legnth of service. Find out as much as you can. Find how much statutory redundancy pay is, how much the company might pay in redundancy, whether you are likely to be made redundant (is your job position no longer required?) Otherwise it is just guesswork.

If you posess a degree - or any alternative qualification - then you'll already be in advace of of the bunch when it comes to looking for careers. My buddy has a degree and he wasn't sure what direction to go with it, but he stumbled upon some good instruction on the website in the resource box below which guided him to settle that he wanted to be a lab assistant. There is lots of guidance on the website regarding alternative careers.

How can i get experience for a circuit design job?



Hi all,
I am currently working as a layout engineer and have 1/2 year of formal experience in the field. The company is the same one that i had my internship program with (was offered upon completion but not part of a bond). My interest is in circuit design and i am trying to move to circuit. Starting with with layout is fine for me (perhaps even advantageous) but circuit is my long term goal. I have attended a few interviews (one internal) but were told i do not have enough experience for circuit design. Its the classic "need experience for the job but need job for experience". I have been reading a lot of materials but still lack practical design skills, which is important. Is there anything i can do to gain skill/experience to land a job in circuit design, while being in layout. An interviewer once asked me if i have built any circuits on my own (hobby projects etc..). Can building hobby circuits help?



Background
I have a degree in E&E and have attended a 1 1/2 year internship program in semiconductor design. The final 1/2 year was on-job-training at my current company.



Note
I ask this because there are not many career opportunities for fresh engineers in circuit design compared to senior/principal engineers in my country (Malaysia).



Anyone faced such an issue before? Any advice is much appreciated, thanks.

It's not always clear how to go about hunting for a job, I was in a bit of a hole in recent times when I was job searching, until I found the site in the box below that provides sensible tips and tricks. I soon got myself going down the correct track, and in a short while after a few interviews I secured a really good job.

BPO?  Business Process Outsourcing?



Anyway, it doesn't matter what the position is.



Your approach to the interview should really be the same.  The most important thing to remember is that an interview is a conversation - not a test.  Just relax and try to talk to them as if you were talking to any stranger on the street.  Try to remember that an interview is a two-way street.  You are interviewing the company to determine if you want the job as much as they are deciding if they want to hire you.  Ask the questions you really want to know about the job (this helps remind the interviewer that it is a two-way street).  Be direct and honest.

Hi, well I've never worked in a BPO? but I've been on many an interview over the years.  First, find out as much as you can about the company, as it will prove your interest.  Try to relax (it's difficult), and be honest with the interviewer(s), let them know its your 'first time'.  Make as much eye contact as possible when answering questions.  You will be asked why you want to work there, have an honest answer.  You will probably be asked why they should hire you, so now's the time to 'plug' your qualities and skills.  You may be given hypothetical questions about how you would react to certain situations.  (past experience in any way helps, you may have come across these 'situations' at home or school).  Take your time answering, it's not a race.  Wear something appropriate, but comfortable (you don't want to 'figit' in a tight outfit).  Stay away from 'rambling' when you answer, be concise and stick to the point.  Have a list of references handy (even if they've seen them on your resume), and most important, be yourself.  A good interviewer can spot a fake.  Go into the interview with a positive outlook and a smile.  Good luck!

I would be very hesitant to answer that. Since it is on a form, you could write something like "negotiable". Or you could state a range (e.g. 25-30K).

Jay,



You will likely receive different answers from different nurses regarding this.  I know some RNs who are currently working who probably couldn't answer most of your questions regarding anatomy/physiology.  There are many working RNs who probably could not pass the NCLEX-RN exam if they had to take it again. There are others who not only remember what they learned, but also use that information daily in understanding and truly making optimal decisions about the care of the patients assigned to them.



This is not to say that either one does not perform safe care.  An RN in certain areas of health care are rarely faced with anatomy or physiology issues.  An example of this would be psychiatric nurses.  Most of the psychiatric patients have no anatomic or physiologic issues except neurophysiology.  These nurses understand their patients needs, and meet those needs appropriately.  In other areas, RNs are constantly faced with anatomic and physiologic issues.  These are important in understanding the processes and treatments being used.



There are also some people who have a greater abilitiy to retain information, while other learn, and understand, but do not retain for an extended period.  You see this in your current classes, where one student seems to not need to refresh their memory much before finals, while others study for days, yet both make similar grades.



In my personal experiences, I have used most of what I have learned, and require it frequently.  It will depend on the course of your career.



The more you retain, the more well rounded you will be.  But what you need will depend on your requirements.



In nursing school all nurses are taught to take care of children, labor and delivery and geriatric patients.  Yet that is a small percentage of the health care provided in hospitals.  You may have been taught what to do in the delivery room, but if you are working with a pediatric cancer patient, you probably won't need or retain most of it.

Should I pursue a Dental Hygiene career or finish my BA in Communications?



I have graduated from a dental assisting program in 2007 and changed my major to Communications in 2007 because as a DA i was not making enough money but I did like the dental field. I am transfering to a CSU in January to get my BA degree but, I really wanted to get into Dental Hygiene the only thing that drew me back was doing all the pre-reqs and not getting into programs year after year.



So, should I finish my BA degree in comms ( 2 more years) or start taking my science pre-reqs for admission into a dental hygiene program (1 to 1.5 years) then a 2 year program after admission (not for sure i will be accepted the year i apply, it can take years to get accepted.)



My overall GPA is only 3.43 in my general ed and I have not started my science classes yet...please help with advice from anyone that can help!

I would go for the dental hygiene career.  Hygienists make good money and they work great hours.  It is a field that is still in demand.  I am an orthodontic assistant that is just finishing my Communications degree from Regis University.  Although I loved my classes, I want to continue to work in the dental field.  I really wish I would have decided to go into hygiene.  It was the prerequisites that turned me off as well.  The extra time it will take will be well worth it.



Good luck!!

If you own a degree - or any extra qualification - then you'll already be ahead of the crowd when it comes to looking for jobs. My friend has a degree and he wasn't sure what direction to go with it, but he stumbled upon some excellent tips on the resource in the resource box below which guided him to settle that he wanted to be a lab assistant. There is a lot of help on the resource regarding extra jobs.

I would go for dental hygiene.  That is a stable industry and there will always be jobs available.  Communications on the other hand...it is hard to get an entry-level job out of school, it will likely be low pay, and there's not a lot of room for movement up the corporate ladder.

If a boss calls you "pragmatic" more than once during a performance review and even once outside formal review?



does this mean that he's actually against "pragmatism" , is using a euphamism to substitute some negative adjective he's really thinking, and that there may not be many more "performance reviews" in the future for the unfortunate employee?  :(



P.S., i know what pragmatic means in the literal sense, but he seems to be using it in a negative way.. does this mean that i don't take enough chances or what?

Severely p*ssed off with recruitment agency?



I saw a retail manager job advertised that I would have loved to do, and have the right amount of experience and achievements to fulfil the role correctly.



I'm not a dreamer, I really have solid experience in the sector.



The job was advertised with an agency. I sent them my CV and when they rang all they wanted to do was talk about what 'I looked like'
Did I wear fashionable clothes (yes) did I know the latest trends (yes) I had to explain what clothes I wore on a night out, etc.... The role is for a watch retailer!!! and the brand although it's nice it's not Hugo Boss or DKNY or Armani or anything in that league.



She didn't seem interested in asking me about how I increased sales by 15% like for like in my previous job or how I cut shrinkage (theft) by 60% or how I recruited a brand new sales focused team from scratch in a city with less than 2% unemployment or how I managed to turn my store into the companies best performing one out of 80 stores within 12 months.



All she cared about was... could I send a picture of myself (because 'i like to know what my candidates look like') and what clothes I wore.



I never did send a picture.
A) because I am not a freak, I am modern but I don't feel the need to send pictures of myself to people.
B) I feel they should have been more interested in the achievements that I have made in my career. Not whether I wear a branded shirt on a night out with my mates.



She phoned last week to say the position had been filled and that she would keep an eye out for any other opportunites.
I still kept seeing adverts for the job in the newspaper and on other recruitment websites.



I decided to email the retailer direct and guess what - they are interviewing today.....and said that I am too late for the interviews but should anyone not fit the bill then they will give me a call.



Why do recruitment companies lie?
They are messing with peoples lives.
Had I known I was going to get messed around I would have applied for the job direct.

There are laws in most countries which preclude discrimination, but recruitment companies get around this by various means. This is why I don't work in recruitment any more - I object.
What the company is looking for is probably a 19 year old girl who is blonde/Asian/bimbo with NO experience so can be hired cheaply, and anyone who doesn't fit the image is out of the picture. They are asking about your clothes because they can guess where you went to school and your family from those!
Cut your losses and give them the finger, try to connect with the sort of retailer you DO want to work for directly. as you have done.Apply to the accountant - ring to find out who that is - and put your claims to the job in work skills direct to that person.

HELP!I signed on for a course with skills train that I now regret signing on for but I've got to pay off ?



a loan: This guy was put through same thing I was only I'm doing a CIW website design course and I was stupid enough to bite the bait!



I was looking at MCSE courses on Google and I came across Skills Train.



I filled in one of their online applications, and within a week they called me and said that one of their "Career Advisors" was in my area that week.



So the "Career Advisor" came to my house, which I thought was strange enough, but then I thought they must be really professional to have "career advisors" doing house visits.



When he arrived he began telling me how much I would earn if I had an MCSE, and that they would guarantee me employment after the course. He asked me some routine questions about my knowledge and then without warning he transformed himself into a sales man.



He then started telling me about how they have a 92% Pass Rate and that I would not find any other place that offer a better deal.



He then began talking to me as if I had agreed to sign on with them; asking me how I would like to pay, I said I would pay in a lump sum, to which he replied "You don’t have to pay it all in one go, you can pay over 42 months" I said I would prefer to pay in a lump sum, as its easier for me to manage my finances, he then replied "That’s fine, you can pay in a lump sum, but it really is better to pay over 42 months, its interest free, I really recommend you do it".



At this point I became very suspicious, and made it very clear that I had not yet agreed to sign up, or pay anything until I had done my research on the company. He then huffed and puffed and with a disappointed look on his face he said, "That’s fine, I know".



He began packing his things without saying a word, then shook my hand and left.



I thought he acted like a complete sales man, with bully techniques. He made the entire course sound like something it isn’t.



Now that I have read about how horrible their service, and support is, I’m very happy I did not sign on. I have found out that by choosing to pay over 42 months, it meant they would sign me up for an interest free loan, where I would HAVE to pay them.



</question>



<additional details>



Sorry, i know my question's ambiguous but I feel so distraught. I'm saying I did sign up and now I'm paying 75 pounds a month for 3 years. They've got such hopeless support and the course is not really what I wanted (how could I have been so stupid!). No legal way to wriggle out. I've been on the course almost 2 years now and it's been an expensive mistake.

I done the same thing with Home Learning. The Sales advisor came to my house and was very pushy!!! and now i am stuck paying £60 a month for 3 years. The tutors are not very helpful, and if i ever manage to finish the course i doubt il be able qualified to work anywhere as the text in the text books are full of spelling mistakes and probably plenty of other errors. Do you know of anyway to get out of the contract?

How to manage the previous medical records?



Hello Everyone, I am a diabetic patient and having diabetes since last six years. So, since then till today I have got lots of prescriptions and other such medical records. The problem is that at any time one of the previous records gets needed for my further treatment and it really becomes bulky to take them all. They are really very difficult to maintain also as there are a numerous of them. I wanted to know that if there are any possible ways to get out of this problem of handling that much bulky hard data or bulky medical records?

It field help?
I am a US citicen whom lived in germany for over 30 years and just came back to the us two years ago.
I am really interested to start a carrer in the it field.
The problem is that im allready 38yrs. old.
I was thinking that after getting at least a bachel. in the it field would help me land a job.
The other thing i was thinking would help me land a good job in the field later on is that i speak and write german fluently.
My english is not really perfect at this time but i think by the time im done with shool it should be allright.
Is there anybody in the it field out there who maybe does hiring people in the it field who could tell me, if sombody with my age fresh out of shoool but has a the advantege of speeking these two languages could land a decent job.
Another thing is i realized that everybody is asking how to make 100.000$ a year, i would be happy to make maybe arround 60 or 80 after a few years. (would be nice).
please some professional advise. thanks....!!!

Sick and my boss won't take me off schedule?



Hello,



I've worked for 10 years at a restaurant that is family owned. I work everyday, close to 8 hours per day. I rarely take days off unless it is an emergency.



This morning, I awoke at 4 am and threw up. I went back to bed and awoke at 7 am and threw up again. I've had bad diarrhea, cramps, and a fever of 101.



I called my boss and left a message saying I was ill and wouldn't be able to come into work tonight. He called me back and told me to find someone to replace me.



It's Halloween and the people that I called were not able to come in. I'm owed shifts from a few people, but my boss refuses to put those people on in my shift. Plus, no one wants to do my job, which is take-out, because they won't make any money.



I called my boss back and told him I was not able to find anyone to replace me, and he told me I would have to come in.



What should I do? Should I go in while throwing up and possibly risking infection to customers and other staff, or risk reprimand from my boss (I probably wouldn't be fired, since they have no one else to work my position)?



I feel like I should just bail out on work for my health.

Do not go in!
Firstly, you need to think about yourself. You aren't going to get better unless you rest..and it sounds like you are pretty sick. Secondly, it is insane of your boss to try to make a personal who handles other peoples food work while they are sick!!! that is terrible...and if you wont get fired anyway...just stay home and rest!

I don't really want to do a degree if I don't have to. Full time study doesn't really work for me.

I am not from the UK, I am from the United States, but I work as an accountants assistant so I thought I would give you advice anyway.



Here in the U.S. there are alot of accounting jobs that dont require a degree....do you have any expierence in bookkeeping? accounts recievable? accountants payable?



If you dont have any expierence my best advice is...



Become an intern (thats how i got started) i worked (just a couple hours a week) for free for this business for about a year while I worked another job and now they have hired me full time as thier bookkeeper. I work directly with two accountants from a large firm. I am getting lots of expierence!



Is there a software program in the UK that alot of companies use for bookeeping? (Here in the US alot of small businesses use quickbooks for example...that is what I use and I track the companies expenses and sales and inventory through that software) If you can figure out a type of software that is used there then go take a class on how to use it.

If a boss calls you "pragmatic" more than once during a performance review and even once outside formal review?



does this mean that he's actually against "pragmatism" , is using a euphamism to substitute some negative adjective he's really thinking, and that there may not be many more "performance reviews" in the future for the unfortunate employee?  :(



P.S., i know what pragmatic means in the literal sense, but he seems to be using it in a negative way.. does this mean that i don't take enough chances or what?

I would see it as two options, really.  It is a possibility he was emphasizing a trait that maybe he would like you to change.  It is also possible, because of the overuse, that he is one of those people who fixates on a word he likes the sound of and uses it at any chance he gets, trying to make people think he is smart.  I've seen many, many people do that, especially people in leadership/managerial positions.

Should I be embarrassed to go back to work?
I've been reading where people have cried at work, crapped their pants, and etc. I did neither, but I did make a dumb mistake which was using the wrong codes. I also regressed over the phones while dealing with the public. And there has also been a couple cases where I asked for the wrong things from the customers. There is no clear cut way of dealing with things where I work and it sometimes gets confusing. I feel dumb and I'm looking for the ultimate answer that will finally bring me peace.

i also worked somewhere where there was no clear cut way of doing some things....it caused lots of tension...but when i worked for places that had better training and supervision i felt much better.  consider looking for other opportunities.



as for the ULTIMATE answer...Jesus is The way, The truth, and The life...God can give peace even in the midst of terrible stuff, stuff worse than a bad day at work.......ask Him for help.

Hey Mase,
We all make mistakes.  We simply need to learn to laugh at ourselves and not take it too seriously when we mess up.  If you own your mistake and try to do better, people will respect you for not making excuses.  There's always a learning curve and if the rules and procedures aren't clear cut where you work, you're probably not alone in making those mistakes.  Forgive yourself.  We always end up being harder on ourselves than we would be on someone else.

If you have been looking for a work from home opportunity, you may have seen alot of ads for data entry jobs, ptc sites, stuffing envelopes, etc, etc.  I've tried them all and lost so much money.  Finally I decided to start my own home based business and now I'm taking down almost $200 a week from the couch.  I now run my very own online jewelry store.  You don’t need any experience, they ship and process all sales, handle all customer service and even give you a website.  The information to get started is free and if you want to do it, it's just a measly $12.95 a month.  Truly, you can't beat it.

professions abroad are certainly an exciting notion, but you have to be really watchful of the legislative implications, if you don't perform your research properly, there can be nasty effects! The resource in the box below has plenty of instruction on professions abroad, my mate unearthed it, now he is a barman in Tasmania!

Sick and my boss won't take me off schedule?



Hello,



I've worked for 10 years at a restaurant that is family owned. I work everyday, close to 8 hours per day. I rarely take days off unless it is an emergency.



This morning, I awoke at 4 am and threw up. I went back to bed and awoke at 7 am and threw up again. I've had bad diarrhea, cramps, and a fever of 101.



I called my boss and left a message saying I was ill and wouldn't be able to come into work tonight. He called me back and told me to find someone to replace me.



It's Halloween and the people that I called were not able to come in. I'm owed shifts from a few people, but my boss refuses to put those people on in my shift. Plus, no one wants to do my job, which is take-out, because they won't make any money.



I called my boss back and told him I was not able to find anyone to replace me, and he told me I would have to come in.



What should I do? Should I go in while throwing up and possibly risking infection to customers and other staff, or risk reprimand from my boss (I probably wouldn't be fired, since they have no one else to work my position)?



I feel like I should just bail out on work for my health.

Climb out of bed, go to see your boss and when you are talking to him "accidentally" throw up all over him. Probably the last time he will ever question you when you say you are sick.

Do not go in!
Firstly, you need to think about yourself. You aren't going to get better unless you rest..and it sounds like you are pretty sick. Secondly, it is insane of your boss to try to make a personal who handles other peoples food work while they are sick!!! that is terrible...and if you wont get fired anyway...just stay home and rest!

If you do take-out, tell your boss that he can do your job for just one freaken day. I had a boss who did this to me, but I threw up at work, after a stomach ache. She told me that I couldn't leave, because no one was there to take my place. Mind you, I was only doing register work and she was doing nothing.

Your shift is your responsibility. If you are unable to cover the shift, it is your responsibility to find someone to cover it. If someone agrees to take your shift, and they don't show up, you are responsible for the shift. I would say that if you are feeling well enough to be on the computer in the midst of all the sickness, you are well enough get to the store for some Pepto or something. Then take a nap, get your butt into the shower and go to work. Because it is Halloween, it could be that the boss is accustomed to employees calling in sick just so they can go out and party, especially since it falls on a Friday night.

If there was any legit way to have a stay at home job I would be doing it (I'm 16) if you wait till your 16 you can apply at gamestop but the pay isn't that good or you could try at your local grocery markets just to get experience but whatever you do, do NOT work at ANY fast food place because you WILL get sick from the smell unless you try a pizza place because the smells there aren't that bad compared to the others. And another thing, don't move out of home! The way the economy is today just stay at home because having more than one working person in a house hold is easy than living alone and even IF you plan on renting a place with roommates in the long run you will be wasting your money. Wait at least till your 20. Heck your parents are stuck with ya till your 18 anyway.

<question>



What can I do at work, during LONG periods of downtime and not look like I'm slacking off to the boss?



I just started this awesome new media job where I get my own office, internet, amazing pay... I'm a hard worker and pretty damn good at what I do, and eager to do it! Yet this week there seems to be so much downtime because a producer is out of the office. It's driving me CRAZY!
I HATE being bored and trying to look busy.



So naturally, I kill time on the internet...blogging, shopping, social networking... a couple of times my boss' boss walked by and caught me but didn't say anything. Oops. Cue sinking embarassing feeling in gut.



Trust me, I wish i had work to do. Another time he walked by (Cue sinking feeling x100000000) a minute later, my direct boss comes in and shows me a link to web tutorials and tells me to do them during my downtime.



I'm sorry. Why do I feel like an idiot? I ask if there's anything that needs to be done and they just say "Sorry. Just sit tight" and that's it.



So my question is... what is the RIGHT and Productive thing to do during situations like these, so I"m not left feeling like a total moron?



Thanks.

Do what your boss told you to do, the web tutorials. You could always ask your co-workers if they need help. Tell your boss you have completed the tutorials and need extra work.  I had a customer service job where they were just starting up and had basically nothing to do for weeks. We were allowed to talk, read, play on the net. I even brought my knitting and taught several co-workers, including a guy, how to knit. Then things got so busy I wished for the slow times again.

I miss knitting so much. During the time that i was laid-off I knit all the time! Unfortunately this place is too corporate and could definitely not get away with knitting... if I could I totally would tho! Thanks to everyone for all your help and advice! :-)

Never do internet shopping at work. Besides looking bad if someone sees you, it's a good way to get your credit card number stolen.



Do the web tutorials your boss suggested.  Otherwise, don't worry too much.  They obviously know you have downtime and it's not your fault.  And just ask them occasionally if they need your help with anything.

If a boss calls you "pragmatic" more than once during a performance review and even once outside formal review?



does this mean that he's actually against "pragmatism" , is using a euphamism to substitute some negative adjective he's really thinking, and that there may not be many more "performance reviews" in the future for the unfortunate employee?  :(



P.S., i know what pragmatic means in the literal sense, but he seems to be using it in a negative way.. does this mean that i don't take enough chances or what?

I would see it as two options, really.  It is a possibility he was emphasizing a trait that maybe he would like you to change.  It is also possible, because of the overuse, that he is one of those people who fixates on a word he likes the sound of and uses it at any chance he gets, trying to make people think he is smart.  I've seen many, many people do that, especially people in leadership/managerial positions.

It's possible that he may want you to tone it down and be a little more idealistic, play along. It's business and there is a lot of b.s. in it. It's why I left for a time. I couldn't stand it any longer. I'm probably more like you. It is what it is. It's a no win situation sometimes. Tell the truth or be optimistic or say what they want to hear - it depends. You don't always get the same results. Managers have a lot of stress and pressure. It's best to cut them some slack.

With an MBA in hand , Oracle Dbms wont make good option.



SAP or other ERP offerings from Oracle are the one to go for if you with to enter this line.



Dbms is more technical & with very less overlap with MBA.



You could direct yourself as becoming a techno-functional consultant in SAP modules or other ERPs.

I went to a seminar on resume writing and they suggest using as many eye catching words as possible, here are some examples:
"Managed front desk, greeting customers and performing all related clerical duties"
"Delivered new employee orientation sessions"
"Educated patients and family members on care plans"
"Coordinated medical orders"



When employers see strong words like managed, delivered, persuaded, conducted, maintained, it makes them think that you have the know how! Just make sure you give a VERY short explanation of how you managed, etc like i did above!
Hope this helps!

It's best to associate each job with trasnferible skills they help you to develop.



an example would be



Server  xyz restaurant ect....



Working as a server helped me to develop confidence and social skills.I pride myself on quality of service, speed and accuracy.



Try to find things that your old job incorporated that could be applicable to the job your applying to.  A server job may seem unrelated to say an accounting position, but social skills, attention to detail, and quality of work are transferable from one to the other.



Don't include skills that are non transferable or irrelevant to the job your applying to. an accounting firm couldn't care less if you could fold a napkin swan.



Be very to the point and relevant.

What should I do about this situation?



I have a job where I work nights (sometimes until 1 AM), holidays and weekends and I have three kids. I live where it gets pretty cold and I pick my kids up after work. I live an hour from my job. It doesn't pay well and I've looked for another job but I can't find one for the life of me. I have tried diligently for four months now.



I have an opportunity to do some (legitimate - freelance) work from home. It is steady but I would not have insurance. I would have to purchase it on my own which I would be able to afford.



My mom says I am crazy if I leave my job to pursue this work. I don't know if I am just being desperate because of my situation or if this is a good solution. Help!

You should try it out for awhile in addition to your current job. See if it something you would enjoy and if it would still allow you earn enough to pay the bills. If it does, then go for it. If it doesn't work out, then you will still have your other job. Even though the current job does suck, it pays the bills.Good luck.

A surgical nurse usually is a RN. RN is the license you hold, surgical nurse is your specific job title for the area you work in (surgery, obviously).



A surgical RN will make the same amount of money that any other RN working in the hospital would make. You don't make more money based on what department you work in, you make more money based on your years of experience.



A new grad RN would start off making about $40-50k per year, depending on what area of the country you live in.

Continue in nursing or follow my passion? ?



I just graduated from nursing school and passed the boards as a Practical Nurse. Nursing was never my first choice but I fell into it for the money but there are no jobs for LPNs outside of nursing homes or psych hospitals, neither of which I'm interested in. I've always wanted my own business but in the meantime the harsh reality is I need money and stability, two things getting my RN would offer. So finish in nursing or back to business?

Actually, I disagree with the above responders.  There is a shortage of slots in RN programs, and a need for RNs.  But if a person is not interested in working in nursing, most quit the occupation and try another quickly.  Then the tuition and the position in school are wasted.



Also, though you may be a fine nurse technically, and know the information to pass boards, I find that nurses regardless of their level (RN or LPN) who are not interested in the occupation, usually perform minimally in the clinical setting when employed.



You will always do better if you are doing what you enjoy.



EDIT:  As a side note; while my wife is an RN, and I am an NP, we also own a travel agency, so we did both.  There are always options.

I would go back into nursing to go into Registered nursing. With registered nursing you're able to work in any field of medicine, and you're also able to do a lot of other things as well.



If you're heart is in business then you should go for it. If you want to go to nursing, then continue this, but it is ultimately your decision.

I think you already answered your question.  Since it's not the time to have your own business, stay with nursing while it pays your bills.  It's also good that you can save $ from this job, when the right time comes then jump in it.



By then you already have experience, if your biz plan doesn't work out, you can always go back to what you are.

If you are a nurse for money, then what bedside manner would you have on a bad day? I*m in the health care field and honestly, if you don*t care about the field then follow your heart elsewhere. But, where I live, LPNs can work in way more places than your listing.

How much did they offer you after finishing Medical Assistant training?



I live in NYC, so if there is anyone from NYC that can answer this..that would be great. If not, any answer would help. I'm wondering how long you trained to become a Medical Assistant and what employers are generally looking to offer you starting off.



Also, is there anyone that is a medical assistant and having their employer reimburse them for their education to move up ...and become a Nurse or something else like that...?



Thanks!

Think long and hard about doing a paper round.  I found it to be boring, poorly-paid, time consuming and restricting in that a 20 minute round in the middle of the day meant I couldn't do any all day activities.  I quit after 3 weeks!



So basically, I don't know, but I wouldn't say a paper round is one of them.

Well under MNCs various sectors like (computer, civil, telecom, electronics etc.) are there. In which field you want to go, coz for diff fields diff education qualification is required. But you must be graduated or post graduated in that field. eg. for Computer - BE or MCA in computers, for Mobile company - Graduated in Electronics or scien, for retail or banking graduate or PG in commerce.

well it depends.
besides well recognized degree, you must have ability to raise interest that why are so interested in any MNC. MNC people are very professional and highly networked. You need to have several references, in your bio-data.



In addition, volunteer works or sporting activities, or any project / team work records that you are positioned as a leader would be remarkable.

First job interview help?



Hi



I have my first job interview today. I have applied for the body shop. I have already seen the manager when I handed her my resume, she quickly read it and was impressed with a few volunteer works that I have done and she quickly assigned me a date for interview. Can anyone give me some tips about some interview questions. As it is my first time, I am unsure about what I will be asked. And what is the best way to impress the interviewer?



Also is it better to wear my hair down, I have long hair, or just tie it back in to a ponytail?
for the makeup, is mascara and lip gloss enough?



Thanks

The best thing is to be your self. Tell the truth and answer all questions politely. Give em' a smile every once and a while too.
Hair should be worn whichever way you like as long as it is neat.
Makeup should probably be a 'natural' look so no eye shadow or lipstick/lip gloss. Mascara you could probably get away with.

Dress professionally, slightly more than you would for actually working there.  Go easy on the makeup (mascara and lip gloss is fine, but you can wear a little more, like foundation or blush, as long as you don't plaster it on. Use a very light hand).



As for questions, they'll probably ask you about your work habits, how you'd handle difficult customers (a good answer is always "I'd check with my supervisor first") and what you think your biggest fault might be.  Just say "I tend to be a little perfectionist sometimes."  Employers love to hear that.

It does not matter to much about the hair as long as it is tidy, it is not like you are going for a job with the grand hyatt. Most important thing is just to tell the truth and be your self. They will just ask questions relating to your CV to check that what you wrote is true.



They may ask some questions that seem irrelevant, but it is just so they can get an idea of your personality.



Make sure you come across as Professional and approachable, because that is what they are looking for in staff. Retail is easy just smile and look happy all the time.

Not too much makeup, apparently that's a nono on careerbuilder.  Also remember, you always side with the company first.  And if there are any situational questions ie (a co-worker is stealing what would you do?)  A: Tell the manager in confidence.  Retail interviews are all situational,  If there was a disgruntled customer, how would you calm them down ect ect A: assure you will do everything you can to help them out and listen to them with full eye contact to assure them they are being listened to ect ect.  Also they always ask you what's you worst habit.  Always make it a good negative like, "I'm always concerned about time management, so I'm 15 min early to where I need to be." or "I'm a bit of a neat freak, everything has to be orderly and straigh." Good luck!

Dress and wear your make-up like the women who work there do, that is unless you look even better wearing more or less.



questions don't matter, it's your attitude and honesty in answering them.  Don't say you can do something if you can't.  But when you say you can't do it in a way to give it a positive spin.  such as: I don't know how to ____  but I'm a fast learner.



That's what always got me the jobs I had.  Being able to be honest with my boss and being able to bring ideas and knowledge from my past to the present situation.  I've been called McGuyver more than once.

I would say most of the interview questions will probably be customer service oriented, she may go through some scenarios and ask you how you would handle them. Think of things like that before you go. Think about a rude customer or a customer who wants to return items without a receipt and how you would deal with it. They're also going to ask you about your punctuality and your work ethic. Think of specific examples in your life that show you are punctual and a good employee. Stories about the ways you have resolved problems...etc...are always nice to hear as well. Also make sure that you show interest and excitement in the products you are going to be selling.



As far as clothing and makeup, you want to look put together and fresh. If you're talking about the body shops I know about it's all about looking healthy and vibrant, I wouldn't wear a whole lot of makeup unless you have things you need to hide (acne etc...). Pull your hair back in a low ponytail and make sure it isn't in your eyes. And for clothing, you can't beat black. Wear something comparable to what the other employees wear every day.



Good luck!

The important thing is to relax. Make good eye contact and try not to fiddle with you hands. I know it sounds dumb but those little things people notice and they can be distracting.
Some questions they may ask are:
Why do you think you would be good for this job?
Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
What kind of qualities can you bring to the job?
Probably a lot of questions on how you would handle different situations.
Use specific examples from other jobs or volunteer work that illustrate how you have handled a similar situation in the past.
Wear your hair how you feel comfortable. Don't just throw it up in a ponytail, make it look nice in a ponytail if that's how your going to wear it. Makeup is alright, just don't over do it. Try and look natural. You don't want anything distracting the interviewer, you want them to just see all your wonderful qualities and how they could not do the job with out you.
Last thing ask questions about the job? It shows that you are really interested in the position. You don't have to ask a lot unless you really don't understand something about the job.
GOOD LUCK!

You're really sick? Possibly contagious? Yes you did the right thing. Now, is the project that is due finished? If not finish it and make sure it gets to work somehow by the end of the day. Ask a friend, relative, anybody to deliver it. If you cant deliver  ask your boss to come pick it up on his/her lunch break. That is the sort of dedication a boss is looking for.

You should definitely finish the project so that it is done on time. If you are sick and contagious then staying away is the right thing. You don 't want anyone else to get sick.

Will I get this job? and Is this normal?



I have interviewed twice with a potential employer (hotel) and they stated they are satisfied and seem like they want to hire me. My last interview was with the HR rep who asked me for copies of my social security card, drivers license, and submitted a background check, However she stated that I am not hired yet and I need to interview with one last person, the General Manager. She states she will email me when he can interview me. I am confused as it seems like they are already processing new-hire paperwork but I am not actually hired yet and I am waiting for her email.

You have not been hired yet.  You may or may not get the job.  What the HR rep is doing is verifying your identity and eligibility to work in this country, which is required by law.

Some companies will do a background check prior to offering you a position, so yes, this is normal.  You also have to interview with the GM before you get a formal offer, but if you've made it this far chances are you're going to get hired.  Be patient.  Sounds like things are going your way so far.

Find a program usually referred to as an "accelerated BSN" program. This is designed specifically for people like you, who already hold a bachelor's degree in another field.



You may need a few prerequisite courses, it will depend on what you took for your previous degree and if they transfer correctly or if there is a time limitation on when the courses were taken. But once the pre-reqs are done you will only need about 2 years of nursing courses before you could earn your BSN and be eligible for licensure as an RN.

If you are wanting to go onto become to be a Registered Nurse, there maybe some courses that will be comped such as psychology, English etc. as you would have already done most of these academic courses with your degree program.  You may only have to do your clinical and theory courses, and the academics may be comped, depending on when you have taken the degree.  If you have taken the program recently, they will comp them. If it has been more than 5 years then chances are is they may not, but usually they do.

I couldn't tell you what the starting pay is, but you can see how little or how much you could make.



Check salary.com or online.onetcenter.org, the second website is one that the Department of Labor and my local Unemployment office both use.  It shows you how much each profession makes nationally, and by each state individually.  It's a great resource.  Good luck!

You type recorded notes from the doctors that go into patient files. I think it's also imaging pt files for backup as well.

<answer>



Medical transcription is where you have to do a lot of typing up of patient records.  Some of the different types of information that you may be typing from the patient records may include, but not be limited to prescriptions, consultations, laboratory reports, surgical reports, discharge or physical history reports, pathology reports etc.  It all depends on where you would be working for a career. If you're working in a doctor's office, then chances are is it would be just primarily prescription notes or referral forms.  If you work in an emergency, you could be doing a whole bunch of history and physicals, or if you're working on a ward, it depends on the floor that your working on.  If you're working on the surgical floor for example, you will have to do surgical reports, and you may have to do pathology reports etc. as well.  Good luck, and I hope that I answered your question for you.

First of all, call the unemployment office TODAY and start the whole process for receiving unemployment. The first day you call them is when your benefits will begin. I don't know what your field of work is, but explore your options. People know the economy is not doing well right now.

For a slacker like you it probably will be hard to find another.  Let's face it, when you were hired you were 22 and looked good.  But now you're 37 and its been going down hill for the last decade.  Since you lost your looks the boss wasn't going to keep you around anymore because you never were worth a damn as a worker.

Honestly, at your age YES.



You are neither willing to go down to a beginning level job. You also do not have enough experience to get a high level job. You are probably stuck in-between in mid-management level.



It will depend on which industry you want to work for. If you are in finance/economics, it will be tough but not impossible. If you are in the medical field, then there should be no problem for you to find a new job. If you are in the sciences/research industry, there should be no problem too if you have good experience. If you are in banking, then its going to be tough.

First call  the unemployment office or go online to apply for unemployment benefits. Second, tailor your resume so that way it won't give away your age. You can downsize yourself by saying over 5 years and mentioned the work that you do. Downsizing isn't a "lie". At least, you will get some interviews.

Do you think its fair for a job to determine if you are a qualified candidate by running a credit check on you?



I honestly dont feel that that is necessary. Your credit has nothing to do with your ability to work for the company.If you are highly qualified for the position then your past shouldnt stop you from bringing in money to clear your debts. Now as far as background checks go, that is understandable.Im initerested in hearing your opinions

From most hiring managers' perspectives, a background check and a credit check are measuring the same thing. The question managers want to know the answer to is, "How are you going to behave and act in the future?" The only way he or she can determine that is based on your past performance, whether that be from a legal standpoint or credit wise.



It has definitely raised some moral questions, but my personal opinion is that it is a useful tool in determining responsibility. If a person is constantly late on making payments, he or she may not show up to work on time. If a person charges way too much on a credit card and only pays the interest, he or she may be irresponsible. Of course, there are other circumstances that could make these cases legitimate, and they should be disclosed to your potential employer. The manager is more likely to hire someone with negative marks on a background report and/or credit rating if the applicant made a good faith effort to explain the situation.

Fair or not, a lot of companies are going that route now. They feel your credit history is a good indicator of your reliability. Especially with companies where you would be working with finances or directly working with cash. If your credit report is really bad, it is a red flag that you may be more likely to steal from the company.



Prepare for the soapbox: With some of the major financial institutions that have needed bailout or have already gone belly up along with their employee pensions, without even so much as a jar of vaseline, maybe employees and consumers should run credit checks on them and find out if they are trustworthy enough as our employer or bank. Their credit history shows us that they not only are more likely to steal from us, but they already have. They not only walk away from the mess with millions of dollars in compensation, they have the audacity to send some of their top people to celebrate for a week at a cost of over $400,000 of our money. Pitiful. That is what is not fair. We need to turn the fairness tables on them. Make them as accountable as they want us to be.

I can't answer your question about getting a job in Japan.



In the US, we don't place the same value on staying with one company our entire career as our parents or grandparents did. We tend to work at a place until we get bored or until we've accomplished everything there we want to accomplish. We also find that switching jobs can accelerate our growth in pay. That is, we can get paid more after 10 years by working three jobs than we would if we stayed in one job the entire time.



We also see that many companies do not last very long so the retirement benefits they might offer are worthless. So there's no advantage to staying with one company to build retirement benefits.



Good luck with school and finding a job.

Should I call the recruiter?



Last Thursday I had my first interview for a particular corporate job. First I interviewed with the recruiter for the department. Then she took me to meet the Associate Director and I interviewed with her for 30 minutes. After I got home, the recruiter called me and set up a time for me to meet with some members of the team I would be working on (if I got the job). I met with the two team members last Friday. I didn't really interview with them so much as chat with them and get to know them. The recruiter then called me and told me to send her my references. Today is Wednesday and I haven't heard from anyone. Should I call the recruiter tomorrow (Thursday) or is it too soon? Do you think I'm out of the running?

1. Get a good understanding of the subject which you have studied e.g if you are from electronics background get ahead with the latest technologies in electronics or say if you are from mechanical background get a good percentage. I mean to say you can opt for the core things.



2. Go for higher studies. Do MBA, MS, MTECH. Good engineers are required and recruited.



The good news for you is, companies are prefering more freshers as compared to experience as a cost cutting measure. So if you prove yourself, you will survive.

Besides setting all margins to 1", the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text, is "scanability." Here are some helpful tips:



1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.
2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;
3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;
4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;
5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;
6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;
7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;
8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;
9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.



In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file.



Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.



Good luck!

How do I get a job in IT or Software Development if I have no experience and only a 3rd class degree?



I have recently graduated from university with a BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree, 3rd class.



Being 100% honest I do not really have any commercial experience in IT or Software Development. The only slightly relevant work experience I have had was a 2 week work experience placement (compulsory during school) with a company where I actually did nothing but sit at a computer in the CAD-CAM and IT departments doing whatever I wanted because they didn't know what to do with me!



I am, however, a computer enthusiast. I can write software, computer games, program in many languages including C++, Java, HTML, PHP, CSS, Assembly etc. I can also build computers, install hardware, diagnose software problems (and usually solve them!), set up home networks, configure routers. Plus some would say I was basically on call as a computer guy during my time at university because I was always going over my friends houses to fix any problems with their PCs, internet etc. I'd call that IT Support!



So I believe I can do the job. But how do I convince employers that?
Such a low degree classification means I'm very unlikely to get a graduate role and my little or no experience, depending on how you look at it, means I'm unlikely to be considered for non-graduate roles.



Please help me. Do I have any chance at all?

You have to tell an employer about the stuff you did above and beyond school. They know you took the same stuff at school as everyone else/ All the work you did above school demands is your experience and is exactly what the employer needs to know and should be listed in a separate skills section on your resume.



When you have no work experience in the field, instead, fill the page with skills you have learned on your own.

Job search with forced resignation?



After working for a school district for a year and 2 months, I was forced to resign because of making little mistakes in my job over my time of employment.  I am now worried that my career in education has been ruined because of this resignation, as many substitute and teaching applications ask if you have fired or forced to resign. When I was forced to resign, I was told by my principal to say that I left due to professional differences.  I really don't know how to approach this in applying for future jobs.



Here's a little background:  1.  I live in Missouri.  2.  My bachelor's degree is in Finance, so I am wary to fall back on that at this time.  3.  My master's degree is in Education.

No, your career is not ruined. I worked at the Dept of Labor sometime back and there are only two ways to leave a job that shows on your record. RESIGNATION OR TERMINATION. That's it. No other details. You resigned which is a good thing. If you were terminated then you would have a problem. No former employer is going to go into anything for fear of a backlash by you and your attorney for defamation of character. The school district did you a favor. Now, learen from your mistakes and go get another job in education. You won't have a problem. Just don't go into anything. Say, "I resigned and that's all you need to know." Good luck.

How do I ask my best-friend-boss for a raise?



I have been working for her for 4 1/2 years now.  Her daughter used to do my job and made over $5 per hour more than me and that was 3 years ago.  My boss is always telling me how awesome I am and how I am the best employee she has ever had, hands down.  During the past 3 years, our sales have increased over the previous 3 years.  The last time I got a raise was 9/07.  I don't want to offend her by asking, but I think I deserve to get paid a lot more than I am.  What would I say to her or how could I 'hint' without actually asking??

I am in the same situation, as far as friend /boss.  I know what Im worth and see the value I bring to the business.  I usually ask for a raise in the spring, after tax season.  This is when they know how much they made last year and how much there tax liabilities are.  I wouldn't compare yourself to the daughter, I would ask for what your worth in a straight forward manner.  If you are valuable she wont have a problem paying you more.  Don't beat around the bush!

so you got a raise just over a year ago. well then tell her that their is more work and you  believe you do a good job, etc. and deserve a raise, and see if you can set up to get a yearly evaluation. you could also look up the average salary of people in your area doing that type of job, and see if you are below it or not.

On this situations you have to be very upfront and tell her that you think you deserve a raise.



Because if you tell her you have another job opportunity it might slap you in the face and actually she will let you go.



Try to sweet talk her maybe taking her coffee every morning or doing something sweet for her for a week and then drop the bomb

Cubs girl is right. You are not entitled to any unemployment  benefits if you quit your job. You can only collect unemployment benefits if the employer let you go for some reason (no fault of your own) like the company is moving out of the city where you work at and you have no plans on relocating or the department you work at closed. Other then that, you can't collect. Your friend is a contractor. He isn't working a regular job. That is why he is collecting.

Give her a follow up call or e-mail to see if you're still being considered. If I ever neglected to return a call or follow up on work items, I would face a firestorm; and yet in the HR world they seem to think it's ok not to call people back or worse, just ignore them. I've heard them claim they have so much to do, etc etc,; but really now - if you've already interviewed, they at the very least owe you the courtesy of a follow up call or letter to advise you of your status.



Good luck and I hope you get the job.

That's just how people are.  When they're superior to you, they don't feel like they need to follow through on their word.  The way I figure it, you have nothing to lose.  Go ahead an call them, first thing tomorrow, and call them out.  Say that you were told to expect a call and you never received it, and you would like to speak with whoever is in charge of hiring.  Speak with them and kindly ask about the status of the job.  It's important to change your tone with this person - too tough, and they may not like you.  Just be firm and let them know you're on your toes.

It depends on the school where you are looking to get into an RN program. Some require you hold the CNA license (you don't necessarily have to have work experience as one), others do not. You should meet with your school of choice's admissions reps and bring all of your school transcripts. They will see if your courses transfer appropriately and meet their requirements for their pre-reqs. If they match and have been completed in a relatively recent time frame (usually less than 5 years), you won't need to take them over and you can apply directly to the RN program. I am not aware of any state that makes you go through the LPN program first before becoming an RN, but in some places where the wait to get into an RN program is really long, you might be better off becoming an LPN and then taking an LPN to RN bridge program.



Just start calling schools in your area and seeing how many students their nursing programs take each year (and find out how many applicants they get!). Ask if the wait is shorter for a LPN to RN bridge program. Find out if they have wait lists that carry over from year to year. Learn about their entire admissions process and then you'll have a realistic time frame of how long it may take you.



You might have to retake some courses if your classes didn't transfer, but if you really want to be a nurse, you'll suck it up and deal with it and do whatever it takes to get there. Good luck.

Health Care Question?



I am young and need some guidance. I am a type 1 diabetic with a need for constant insurance coverage. I need eye exams and insulin consistantly. I am still covered under my parents insurance because I am a full time student. My dad just called and said at my 23rd birthday his company will drop me. My employer only provides me with a decent salary to afford my appartment, car, and food. What options do I have to get coverage through either a government program or anything else? I really need some guidance because I have to do something within 3 weeks. Can anyone help me?

There are more legitimate home based business opportunities out there than people want to believe. It is just a matter of finding the right one. For me...I started my own online jewelry store.  Over the past 10 weeks, I've averaged an extra $120 per week.  Everything is supplied to you...even your very own website.  The information to get started is free if you visit the link below.  And if you decide to get started, it won't cost a boatload of cash...just $12.95.



Good luck with your decision

assuming you are in U.S, you can go on COBRA for 18 months, whereby you pay 102% of the premium (both the employer and your father's portions so it will be higher) and keep that group coverage. Do that at least as a stopgap. Your father would arrange it thru his employer. Depending on what state you live in you and your earnings you might be eligible for medicaid (fairly low income) or there might be other special programs in that state for those without employer based insurance. You can also buy an individual policy, often from Blue Cross plan in your state or other companies. Call you state insurance department or look at their website.

Medical billing/coding/transcription?



I was wanting to know if you can do all three for doctors? For example, say you are already a work-at-home medical transcriptionist, and you want to keep doing transcription, but also start doing the billing and coding for the doctors you work for. Could you do that? I believe I have heard of people doing all three, but I am not quite sure on that one! Anyone know anyone who does all three from home? Or can you only do one? Please tell me what you know! Thanks so much! Have a great day!

Yes you can do all of these for a doctor. You wouldn't necessarily be able to do all of them at home though. But yes they are all things that you can do. It also depends on whether the doctor has another company as a billing operation.

If you are currently in IT, you have a real advantage over many people in the technical aspects of company's systems.  You should focus on having knowledge about income statements, operating expenses, balance sheets, cash flows, and how project NPV and decision point analysis are made.  Business analysts spend a lot of time looking at how parts of the whole are working, so you need to know about the industry you are in and how your company operates compared to competitors.



Business analyst can mean VASTLY different things depending upon the company, so be sure to get a role description and ask a lot of questions about what the position entails and the expectations.



Typical questions are pretty broad like how you have dealt with challenges (give example), where you see yourself in 5 years, describing your past positions and what you like most/least in those roles.



My advice would be to take some finance and accounting classes if you haven't already.

Most companies have put their recruiting and applications online.



One way or another, your information must be put into the computer system, most would prefer that you do that yourself.



Also, most tracking systems include questions for particular positions that are used to rate your experience and other things (Drugs, jailtime, etc.) to rule you out of a position.



Some companies get hundreds of applications for every job listing they have. They don't need to waste time reading all of them. Most corporate recruiters create a requisition that will screen most applicants out, then they look at the ones that meet a specific percentage and make a determination as to who moves forward. Most of these recruiters spend less than 10 seconds looking at your resume, so you have to have one that catches their eye.



By the way, they will reject you for asking "can u go" versus "can you go" and they will probably pass you by when the see things in all caps.

In your case learn more English and spelling before starting out outlooking for employment. Use the "spell check" more.



Next avoid like the plague these promises of instant jobs, big bucks offers, they are not all they seem to be and can cost you money.



Take any job you are offered now and be choosy when the the economy improves. Good luck.

I definitely would! In the workplace you have to behave professionally. You can't assume that others in your workplace have your same, (very off-color) sense of humor. Most people find farting disgusting, and this act of yours was particularly disrespectful. Your boss must have mistaken you for an adult when he/she hired you, because you're obviously a seven year old boy.

You know I don't think you have to wear bebe clothes. It's like If i'm shopping at Diesel I don't want the shop girl to wear same jeans as I'm going to buy, you know what I mean. But I know it's an interview. Just wear something more trendy. And by the way I hope you do good at your interview, it's a good opportunity. I envy you, just kidding.
Good luck girly!

What are some things I should do to work towards my new career goal? What are some places that I should try and work while going to school?

I would first look at the APTA website at www.apta.org so you can get an idea of what PT school entails.



Your next step would be to start taking the courses required for entrance into the program to which you hope to apply.  Presumably, you will have to take a lot of the sciences that you did not get as a business major.



As you near the completion of those courses, complete any volunteer hours that are required and take the GRE if required.



A job as a PT technician would fulfill your observation hours..although it does not pay much...but a good experience for someone hoping to become a PT.

Go to google, type in the names of the local community colleges, when you get to their websites they will have a list of degree's and classes required.  I am pretty sure something regarding Physical Therapy is on there.  It will say what you need.  Good for you having a degree in business.  I know LOTS of people who got bachelor degrees in business and don't want to do it anymore, plus they say you could end up working in like Office Max or in a cubicle and not make more than $40,000 with that degree.  Health field is NOT like that.  Good luck!!!

Hi. When you go, just go to the guest service area and let the other target employees know you're there for orientation. They'll either take you or tell you to go to the human resource room. Most likely there will be others there for orientation. You may have to sign a couple of things, read a booklet with the other people there, and then watch a safety video. Then the target employee who is giving you your orientation may give you a little tour of the store and the back room area. After that, you may get a sheet that has your work schedule for about the next 1-2 weeks. During those weeks, you'll be training, for about three days, with another employee who does the work you will do. Most likely, depending on which state you live in, you may only be scheduled for about 4 or 5 days within those 2 weeks. I've been working at Target since June of 08 and this is how my orientation went. The lady who gave our orientation was very nice, and I'm sure you will still get paid for your orientation depending on your state employment laws. I live in Chicago, Illinois so we got paid for ours. Also, like the Targets here in Chicago, employees rarely get 40 hours or more. If we go over 40 hours and have about 48, then they sometimes get a little angry and give us a warning. I'm not sure why they're so strict about this. So, I just wanted to let you know that you may not get the hours you want each week. However, because you got hired around this time of the year, you may get at least 4 days to work each week since Christmas is coming. I haven't been at Target for Christmas yet, but my employees say that it gets very busy and Target needs all the help that it can get. After Christmas, the hours you get will probably drop by about 1 or 2 days. Your boss or ETL (executive team lead) you be the one who will schedule you and post your schedule, along with the other team members schedule, up near the time clock about 3 weeks after your orientation. Hope all of this helps.

Go to the job centres that is what they are there for. Have a private interview to discuss your future plans.

Please stay away from paper rounds, although they do teach your son about responsibility, it's just a legal form of slave labour. Ive been working since i was 15 I started sweeping hair in a hairdressers and then moved to a chinese takeaway (however this was very tiring as i was still at school and not finishing till midnight!, i then worked as a glass collector/waitress. As long as it doesn't interfere with his school or college then there's plenty of jobs he can get that will teach him the importance of responsibility. Good Luck x

If your son doesn't mind working for long, including quite a few days a week go for fast food giants like McDonalds, Burger King etc.
If you go to like a chemist (I work at one) you will get more per hour but won't work for more number of days. Both you can improve your rank, and become manager = more cash, more responsibility, more stable job, more job opportunities.



Good luck to your son!

It'll be great if you can wear the clothes of Old Navy's when doing the interview tomorrow. It'll show them you like the brand and pay attention to details. Show your passion about helping people and tell them your working experience in the related fields. If you don't have much  experience, let them know you'll work hard and you're a really fast learner.



To answer your question, you need to pay attention to the store and figure out what you can do to make the store better. For example, if there are clothes scattering around in the wrong places, you can say you love to make sure the customers will have the best shopping experience in this store. Therefore, you will try to keep the store as neat and clean as possible. If you notice not all customers are offered helps, you can say you enjoy talking to people, finding out what they need and helping them. You'll greet all customers you see in the store and make sure they get all helps they need.



Be confident and don't be shy. You'll get the job. Good luck!

Interview questions can be tough, everyone wants to discover what questions will be asked - or indeed what questions to ask - but there is no straight answer. I had an interview during the last couple of weeks and I stumbled upon some good tips from the resource in the box below, concerning interview questions. They also have some things about job seeking and career choice.

well, since interviewers want to hear what you have to offer them, you should be ready to talk about how you enjoy dealing with the public, pay attention to detail, and have good focus while on the job. all employers like to hire people with "work ethic" - people that are not afraid to take the initiative on their own without being told or asked over and over. telling them this up front will help your cause.

You help the store by making the customer feel important.



For your interview, watch your clothes and makeup.  Most of all, watch your posture.  Whether you are 5'0" or 6'1", you should stand up tall and carry yourself with poise and self-confidence.  Practice in front of a mirror or ask a friend to give you pointers.

How long til I can work as an RN?



I am applying to go to a tech school next year and it's called "greentree health science".  It's a two year program, I am still in highschool however I'm going through that.  Can I get my RN license through that?



I'm really wanting to do that, due to the high demand of RN nurses and the money in it.  I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about this career, I have a daughter and am looking for a job that I can actually support us off of one day.



I was wondering if I could work as an RN straight out of the tech school, or if i have to take extra classes at a college to do so?



please help!
thank you.

She should apply for accounting clerk positions. There are dozens of those listed through a temp agency. Who knows? Maybe the employer would like her so much that they will hire her. Also tell her to look on Craigslist. She can work as a temp and interview at the same time.

Stick at it. Flexible jobs like that are hard to find, so a bit of sacrifice isn't going to hurt in the long run.
However, be careful of working too much. Weekends and weekdays of work is way too much as well as study. Choose the weekend or weekday job, not both. It aint worth the stress!!

What time does the training end? Is there any way you can just catch the end of your Halloween plans? If you can't catch the end of your plans, unfortunately, I think you should go to your training. But, I agree with the above comments, you should be weary of overworking. And...maybe you can ask around to find a Halloween party, because those are later at night. I know it won't be as good as your original plans, but, hopefully you'll have fun. Good luck.

Your experience as a full-time Mom sounds directly applicable to this job.  Find the job requirements for this job--something has probably been put out by the center (a job description, etc.).



Then take each one of their bullet points and think about what you've done as a stay-at home Mom that is similar, then list that.



For example,
if their job description states, "being able to devise and implement multiple projects simultaneously."



You could write, as a mother of x, I have spent the last 6 years juggling mulitiple responsibilities (volunteering at school; arranging for, participating in and transporting multiple kids to multiple activies, all the while ensuring that a safe and comfortable environment was provided for the family, nutritious meals were prepared, and that children's tasks (e.g., learning activities, homework) were completed in a timely and effective manner (assisting as necessary).



Job Title:  Household Manager for a family of XX kids and xx adults, including care of xx animals.



Length:  6 years



Description: point-by-point matching their bullet points in the job description with similar things you've done as a stay-at-home mom as described above.

Highlight what you did before you were a mom.



If you did volunteer work for the school, highlight that too.

I would just put that this is your first job in awhile and that you have been a full time mom so that they will see that you have had some really big responsibilities over the years.Also you should list any prior employments along with what you did there.

Is it wise or too pushy to call after a few days to check the status of the position after the interviewer has?



gotten a chance to interview a few more people? I was the first one to be interviewed since the posting.  So after an interview, like when they say, 'do you want me to call you, or do you want to call me?" (it's a preschool, and they are more laid back..) i just basically yes, she could call me--if she's interested as she did seem to be, she'll call, right? but now I'm thinking I'll call after all to show interest in a couple days after she's interviewed a couple more people. Pls let me know if it's a good idea.

It's tricky.  Most places don't move at lightening speed, especially when hiring.  Calling in, in some places, gets your name dropped into the trash right away.  Harsh and unfair, I know, but I've seen it happen.



I would give it at least 5 business days before you call.  This gives them a bit of time to make a decision and get the word out.  Another option too, is sending a Thank You note.  Nothing wrong with making them remember you, and adding a touch of class to your reputation at the same time.  A side benefit of this, is that it increases your networking potential.  If the people seeing your note, have friends or former co-workers in other day care centers or preschools, they might mention your name and info, if they hear that one of those places is looking for someone.  Many cases, it's not what you know or where you apply, it WHO YOU KNOW.



If you write, call or they call you, and you find out that they have hired someone else, don't let it get to you.  Sometimes places will hire someone who sounded really good in the interview only to find out that they stink on the job...and they go back to their short list and see who they had good feelings about.  You might find yourself being approached at that point.



Good Luck!

I think that is a good idea.  I have done that myself in the past and ended up with the job a few days later.  It shows that you are interested in the position, but don't call too often, that shows that you are desperate.

There requests are as below.  Has anyone heard of this and how legit can it be?  The last email I had received they were asking for my full name, mailing address, ph #, age.  Any info would be appreciated.  I had received about 3-5 of these after signing up with indeed.com for home typist jobs that I had gotten from you folks.  Thanks for your time and sorry about the length of this but easier to copy than to try to explain.

While there really is a Keith Ceramic at that url, I highly doubt that this is legit.  Why would Keith Ceramic send you the checks/money orders to cash and then send them the money.  Either the accounts you are collecting on would send the money directly to you, you would cash and send on the 90% or if the money was sent by the debtor to Keith Ceramic, they would cash the checks and send you the 10%.



What will most likely happen is that you cash the money orders/check, send the 90% to whoever is e-mailing you and then watch as the check/MO bounces and you are liable for to the bank for all that cash.



I also note you didn't post the e-mail address of the person sending you the offer.  If the person really works for KCM, the e-mail should be addressed something like Smith_John@kcm.co.uk - if it is a google, yahoo, or similar return e-mail, then you can pretty much figure it is a scam.



Last, re-read the e-mail - lots of grammar mistakes - no legit company would dare allow an official e-mail to go out like that.

lila,



The best home based business idea simply cannot be based on what people think but rather on how they work best with your personality. For me, it was an online jewelry store.  I started mine about 8 weeks ago and just passed $800 in profit.  If you'd like free information, the link is below.  And don't worry...it only cost $12.95 if you decide to do it.



I'm glad I did it and hope you do the same.

Im tired of the military.  Im an IT w/experience in satellite communications. Any good civilian jobs for me?



I am going on 5 years in the military. I came in and chose the IT field. I have been deployed 4 times now in less than 5 years. I have missed my daughter crawling but was there for her first walk. My marriage has failed but we are working it out. I am just tired of always being gone. I am not blaming the military because they have given me benefits and also have taught me many things. I just think I have done my fair share of serving my country and now I just want to be home more with my family. Is it worth it to leave the military and be a civilian? Even then, what kind of money can one expect to make working as a civilian in the IT sector, especially considering the fact that the economy is taking a beating?  In addition to that, I have TS SCI or scid64 clearance. My experience has mostly been in automatic signal acquisition satellite systems and manual acquisition systems with intermediate experience in networking.

I would recommend that you network and line something up BEFORE you get out.  Do an extension if you have to if you don't have something solid.  Are you working with any USG civilians?  Ask them how they got hired, and check the CCPO (or whatever it's called these days) website to see what jobs are available.



I don't know if you've noticed, but the economy sucks and not too many people are hiring, except maybe in Mumbai and Bangalore.



That clearance is the one BIG  thing you have in your favor that sets you apart from the low-wage worker from overseas--you'll want to stick with the government, perhaps with a contractor if you can't get on with Uncle Sam (that is better, though--you can actually apply your military years to your civilian gov't pension).



Good luck.  Some people have an easier time transitioning than others--the fact that you're tired of the life actually helps in making the switch.  You're also smart to get out ahead of the curve--there is a drawdown coming in the next ten years --if we don't end up fighting World War Three (in which case they'd drag your a%% back in)--and ex-military personnel with your quals will be thick as thieves.

There will be plenty of opportunities.  Besides IT you could also think about defense companies that sell equipment, telecommunications firms such as Qwest, even firms like Motorola, Texas Instruments, engineering firms that are involved in process control systems, etc.  Those are some examples that come to mind.



Also consider going to school if you will get some tuition help. Because upgrading your skills will further improve your career prospects.  Good Luck.



The economy is entering a recession right now and the next year is expected to be bad for job prospects.



So, I would say take your time to make the transition.

It all depends on what you are trying to accomplish.  If you are trying to sell someone something then the simple solution is the buddy system, I don't mean a friendly co-worker who will help you along the way.  I mean being the customers friend, asking them fairly personal questions about themselves and there lives, get to know them a bit and make a bit of a connection, this is called 'sweet talking'.  The other kind of service is far more passive.  Hello sir/ma'am.  Can I help you find anything?  How are you?  Simple, small, to the point.  Usually customers are pretty able to do there own thing in most stores most of the time but sometimes people are a little too afraid to reach out to the employee for assistance so asking someone if they need help is usually a huge bonus to them in the realm of customer service (giving them the actual service).
Almost always having a smile on your face and being friendly is generally the rule of thumb here and be sure to avoid negative topics.  Good luck.

In writing your resume, you must always emphasize your achievements. However, don't overdo it. Write the achievements that you think would compliment the position you are applying for.



Regarding the degree, you can just place their that you are CURRENTLY studying... whatever your course is.

Write about the things you have done and especially if you achieved something - write about it. But the things should be related to your work. Do not write about something that has no relation to the position you are applying for.

How to manage the previous medical records?



Hello Everyone, I am a diabetic patient and having diabetes since last six years. So, since then till today I have got lots of prescriptions and other such medical records. The problem is that at any time one of the previous records gets needed for my further treatment and it really becomes bulky to take them all. They are really very difficult to maintain also as there are a numerous of them. I wanted to know that if there are any possible ways to get out of this problem of handling that much bulky hard data or bulky medical records?

Getting Promoted in The Fast Food Industry?



Ok so, I work for a KFC franchise in Minnesota, but I kinda have a problem.
I'm a shift manager at the store I work at, and I might just be putting not as much faith in myself as i should but heres the situation.
Hourly pay ranges for 6.75 -about 8.00 (Team Members- Shift mangers)
And the Salary Management positions range 25k per year - 50k + depending on store and labor/ food costs (assistant mangersGM's)



All the stores in the district are pretty close like all the GM's talk to each other alot so word gets to our district manager fairly easy.



I recently talked to our district manager about advancing to Salaried assistant manger job, expressing that i would like to go to more of the meetings, and employee improvement and training classes.
In his eyes he talks highly of me to the GM's in the district and all the GM's i know speek highly of me as far as work effort, experience and skills.
I'm just worried because our company is so big that other people most less qualified than me being able to move into that position, because people will gladly drive farther or move for such a big pay increase.
I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips about types of things i can do to secure that im a top choice of being promoted.
The DM told my boss to train me on the things i will need to learn in this new position, but sometimes the followthrough on his end can be scattered.
Tips anyone?

do the math, as a manager making $25000 a year you will be taking a pay cut. salaried managers work 55 hrs a week, and at $25K thats $480 before taxes a week. $8 an hour for 55 hrs is $500 a week before taxes (40 hrs X $8 + 15 hrs X $12 overtime pay). I worked as a manager and NEVER worked the 55 hrs, it was always about 62 hrs plus there was homework. I had no life. here's my tip for you, get a job at a sit down restaurant as a bus person, tell them you would like to learn to be a server. bus people make around $75 a day cash tips plus $3.08 an hour. servers make $3.08 an hour and anywhere from $75 to $300 a day, I average $180 a day and work only 4 days a week! I now have a great life and my managers are working 50 hours a week. non-chain restaurants start managers off at $35,000 a year and work less than chain managers, I have seen 2 servers get promoted to manager this year and they are doing well. my GM makes $95,000 a year and I have another from another location who is 28 years old and is the GM, who started as a backwaiter! get out of fast food, it's a nowhere job, good luck!

You want first to be professional, friendly and attentive.  Ways to show that are dress and groom yourself so they can SEE you care about yourself.  If you have references from teachers, clergy, volunteer jobs, bring them.  It just shows you care about work.



You are going to be asked questions about the job you applied for, or that is available.  They are going to want to know about how you are going to get to work, anything that will keep you from performing the tasks of the job, why you want to work there, and when you will be available.

What to do with my job?



I am so indecisive about leaving or not my job. Now i try to explain the situation: I work in the office and a 'm specialist of public relation. I found it very difficult because all the day in my office came so many people and all of them are angry. I have to inform them, explain, justify, help and calm down. I have to work 8 hours a day and than when i go home my little boy is waiting for me. He has his desires, wants me to do almost everything for him. This is normal and i love spending time with him. But i'm so tired (more mental than physically). I don't want to be nervous while i stay near him. In the same time i need my work. We are a family and we need money ( the life with a baby is more expensive then the time i was only with my man). There 4 years that i am doing this job. Do i have to wait and be more patients?!

Trapped: Help please?



was thinking a lot before moving from a company to a college. I just thought that it is mch better for my CV to teach because I have a Master in humanities, and the company job was to assist in administrative work using my languages.



I feel I was trapped, literally, to sign the contract, because I am continuously discovering negative things in my first week: everybody fears the lady boss hysterically, and she seems to have a superiority complex!! Imagine a tv cannot be moved without consulting her! They did not explain to me that we don t have rights to go to doctor, etc.



I resent signing the contract, though I like to teach.



What I gonna do with myself????



sometimes I enjoy to dream am quitting and that I am going to another job!!!



I am so desperate!
