What do you think of someone throwing their own birthday party?



I have always worked on my birthday,or always spent it with some family,this year because my birthday falls on a  Saturday,I want to put on a  party.I am supplying everything,the only thing I ask of my guests is to bring their own booze,lawn chairs,as I am supplying the food.Is this too cheesy to put on your own birthday party?

I hope you invite ME!!!! This sounds like a great party. A birthday is to celebrate your life, and who better to arrange the party than you. Your life is great because of the people in it so your birthday party is a celebration of the people who make it great! Have Fun!

No, not really. It would be a little cheesy to ASK folks to bring you a birthday present, though. If you feel funny about doing it, why don't you drop HEAVY hints to your friends/co-workers that your birthday is coming up soon and see if they get the hint.

Good luck and...HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!!!
Enjoy.

No, it's not cheesy at all. In fact it's quite common. After all, how else can you ensure you do what you want when you are available? I've planned and hosted several of my own birthdays, and it was a lot of fun. Just make the invitation open, don't make any major demands. BYOB is not unreasonable, so don't worry. And asking them to bring chairs is fine if you don't have enough.

So, happy birthday and have fun.

Bubble Gum Formula for 1/2 pound of gum



What you will need from your kitchen: 
microwave safe or heat resistant dish. 
A spoon to stir the gum base mixture. 
Wax Paper or Ziploc Bag



1/3 cup gum base 
1/2 cup powdered sugar 
2 Tbs corn syrup 
1 teaspoon glycerin 
1/4 tsp citric acid



5-7 drops flavoring



1.  Into a microwave safe or heat resistant dish, place the Gum Base, Citric Acid, Corn Syrup and Glycerin.



2a.  Microwave Method  Place all of the gum base into a microwave safe dish.



Heat the gum base on high for 1 minute.  Remove the gum base from the oven and stir it. If it has not melted, place it back in the oven and heat for 30 more seconds.  Stir it again and repeat heating until the gum base is gooey.



2b. Stove top Method



Place the gum base in a heat resistant dish that will fit in a sauce pan of boiling water.  Cover the pan and bring the water to a boil. Turn the heat down so the water is at a simmer.



Heat the gum base until it becomes gooey. This can take up to 10 minutes. Be sure not to let the water boil dry.



3. Measure out 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and set it aside for later.  Pour out about one half cup of powdered sugar onto your work surface.  Make a well in the middle of the pile.



4. Remove the gum base from the microwave and mix in 5 drops of flavoring.  Pour the melted gum base mixture into the well.  The gum base may still be hot but it will cool quickly.



5. Dip your fingers in the powdered sugar and begin kneading the gum base and sugar together.  Work it as if your are kneading bread dough. Add more of the powdered sugar when ever the dough gets sticky.  Continue adding sugar until you have a smooth, stiff dough.  You must knead the gum dough until all the sugar is worked in.  This will take at least 15 minutes.  The more kneading the better.  Kneading to little will cause the gum to break up when chewed.



6. Now itâ€™s time to roll out your bubble gum and cut it into pieces.  You can make a rope about 1/2 inch in diameter and then cut individual pieces about 1/2 inch long.  Using a scissors make this very easy.  If you like your gum in sticks, roll out the gum with a rolling pin and then cut out the strips with your scissors.



7. Dust all of the gum pieces with the tablespoon of powdered sugar we set aside. Store your bubble gum in a zip lock bag.  You can wrap individual pieces in wax paper too!

The only thing you will have to go out of your way for may be the gum base...in austrlia we have it in most healt food stores...hope this helps =D

dip and biscuts with cheeses, olives, etc - so all you need to do is throw it all on a plate. If you do want warm stuff, just go to your freezer section and get like pastry triangles (spinach and fetta are really nice), spring rolls, etc, that sort of thing - so thats not really cooking, just throw it on a tray in the oven then its done - serve with sauces like sweet chilli. Have fun!!

There are some inexpensive stand-bys that never go wrong--bruschetta is filling and delicious; crudite with dip is always a crowd-pleaser; and even inexpensive cheese and crackers get scarfed down in no time. If you also put out some fresh fruit (seriously, put out a few bunches of red and green grapes and see how frequently people walk by and pop a few grapes off of them), you should be great.

What theme should i have for my 16th fancy dress party?



Its my 16th soon and i was thinking of having it fancy dress but i wanted a theme to it but i cant think of one!



I have already booked the venue, its a large room which can fit up to 175 people in so i need a theme with variety if theres a lot of people going.



I have been looking online and all i can find are cheesy themes, i would like something a bit different but easy enough to find costumes for, for everyone (and not too expensive!. Its also in the UK which might have a difference to themes - i dont know! lol!



Just if you have any idea please please help me as i have my mum bugging me to decide on one!
Thankyou =]

Would this be fun for a 13th birthday?



I was thinking of going to a mall with 7 friends (8 including me) and doing a mall Scavenger Hunt. We would have to take a picture of the things on the list with a cell phone or digital camera. Then we would eat there, at the mall, (Panda Express, Pizza, etc.) Maybe even a Dairy Queen instead of a cake.... Idk... Then have 3 ppl sleep over.

What do you think? Any other ideas??

Don't watch those rubbish chefs on TV. Start cooking for yourself.

It's easy. Start young if you can, get a feel for it, experiment, taste it, enjoy it, make your kitchen the centre of your home.. and you will make the best food ever.

You will eat healthier, tastier food. You will feel better. You will be in control.

I hate going to restaurants. I hate all supermarket meals. I hate all these silly chefs, making millions of pounds, telling us how to cook - their way.

The individual items sound good by themselves, but not together.  Honey glaze and Alfredo sauce?  Broccoli and peas?  Not combinations I would chose.  Perhaps the honey glazed pork chops with peas and roasted potatoes, or Alfredo with broccoli and plain pork chops.

How do you go about having a party for 20 plus teens in a suburbia type golf course neighborhood, or can you?



i currently live on about 15 acres in the middle of no where, perfect place for any big party, but my family is about to move into a little neighborhood on like a golfcourse type place its really nice but im wondering if its 'too nice' and if there is anything i should do b4 i have a 'house warming' party. i just want to be able to turn up some music and even if i can only have like ten friends over its cool it doesn't have to be huge. im just worried about noise levels, in case we get alchohol since we are all just shy of legal, and if cops are dispatched for the noise.

anyone who lives in this sort of place what do you do?

There is most likely a neighborhood law that says no one is allowed to play or make Noise outside after like 10:00. and also no loud music or parties after like 11:00. (that's how the fancy neighborhoods are in my town) (It sucks cuz when you go to the friends house you can't be outside very much cuz all the neighbors act like azzes.)

Does the new community have a clubhouse?  This would be a good place to have a party.  If you & your friends are not of legal drinking age though you should opt out of the drinking for this party as it would put other community members in hot water if you were caught & would also put the cabash on any future parties for you & your family.  I just had an impromptu squirt gun fight with my husband & kids last Sat night & it was a blast.  Think along those lines in having a good time.  Best wishes in your new home.

Check out the community rules. Most places like that have them. So maybe they don't approve of parties. And since your not of legal age to drink maybe you should find something else to do so no one is tempted.

You can usually play music until about 10, but check with the local police for their time limit:)



If it's a golf course community, there should also be a clubhouse, where you could use a room for parties......

Well her are some ideas:Because the 18th birthday is such a milestone in a young personâ€™s life, making it a memorable bash is something both the teen and parent will want to emphasize. Parents know the maturity level of their own children best, so they can help choose an appropriate party venue or activity. Letting the parental reins loosen at this time in a childâ€™s life is important; opt for more adult-like activities that come with responsibilities for the soon-to-be 18-year old.
[edit]
Concerts/Sports Game

A famous band or star that your child idolizes may be putting a concert on in a location near your home. Search for tickets through Ticketmaster using your location or by using the name of the performer. Purchase a ticket for your child and his/her closest friend or two.

Send your child to a local professional, college, or amateur sports games as part of their party. Whether she/he loves hockey, basketball, baseball or football, pick up a set of group tickets and head to the game.
[edit]
Amusement Parks/Trips

Living in a city or within driving distance to a local amusement park can be perfect for an 18th birthday. An all-day event at a water park or theme park can be tons of fun for your child and his/her friends. Make sure anyone invited understands the costs involved (paying for tickets/food/souvenirs) and what you are providing.

If you are planning a trip that falls around the 18th birthday, have your child select a specific site he/she would like to visit. Alternately, your child could invite a friend along to spend time with during the trip.
[edit]
Co-Ed Party

Allowing your child to host a co-ed party can be a perfect 18th birthday party idea, especially if you did not allow one for the sweet 16th party. This type of party could be a parental-approved co-ed slumber party, or a huge dance party at a rented banquet hall. Whatever the location, be sure the parents of invited kids understand it will be for both sexes. Make sure you do drop in for some supervising.
[edit]
Economical Birthday Ideas for 18th Bday

Not everyone can afford to rent a hall or take kids to an amusement park for an 18th birthday party. But that does not mean you still cannot host a memorable party for your child. Ideas for a low-cost party include:



* Pool Partyâ€”Host a backyard barbeque and let the kids enjoy the sunny summer day. Have a CD player with the latest hits playing in the background.



* Luau Partyâ€”Get out the tiki torches and leis for this birthday bash. Have a limbo contest and make sure there is plenty of pineapple cake for everyone to enjoy.



* Toga/Roman Partyâ€”Even high school students of today love having toga parties. Have extra white sheets on hand to help those who come without costumes.



* Mock Cocktail Partyâ€”Perfect for the teen who desperately wants to be an adult! Make horsâ€™ dourves and non-alcoholic versions of drinks like daiquiris.



Simply letting your teen go out to dinner and a movie separately from family can help make for a great birthday night. Celebrate the date separately with your teenager.
[edit]
18th Birthday Party Tips

The big milestone birthday like the 18th requires special attention. Even if you cannot afford to host an extravagant party, you should make it memorable for your child. Follow these simple tips to expedite the planning:



* Only host a party you can afford. If your teen wants to do something expensive, explain to him/her that she/he will be expected to contribute to the party, if you choose to have it.



* Provide supervision, but be relaxed. While an 18-year old is still a teenager, you should be able to check in and out of the party (or call their cell phones); constant supervision may embarrass your teen.



* Think twice before throwing a themed party without consulting your child. Some teenagers feel they are too old for birthday party themes.



* Set rules for your child and his/her friends (like curfew time) and make sure they are understood.



Finding birthday ideas for 18th bday is as simple as asking your child what he/she wants to do. But coming up with a truly memorable bash can take a bit of planning. Let your child help and the birthday will be magnificent.

Maybe play some prank games to spice the party up a little. Have one of your guy friends that nobody knows and have him play the part of the new boyfriend who walks in during the cake and ice cream and announces he wants to get married, now that your 18. Your family will flip. Just come up with funny simple pranks and your birthday will be one not to forget.

vodka, cranberry and lime....rum and coke....jello shots are super easy, go to a party store and get the jello shot shot glasses...make a big bowl of sangria....
Ingredients:
1 Bottle of red wine (Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Rioja reds, Zinfandel, Shiraz)
1 Lemon cut into wedges 
1 Orange cut into wedges
2 Tbsp sugar
1 Shot brandy
2 Cups ginger ale or club soda
Preparation:
Pour wine in the pitcher and squeeze the juice wedges from the lemon and orange into the wine. Toss in the fruit wedges (leaving out seeds if possible) and add sugar and brandy. Chill overnight. Add ginger ale or club soda just before serving. 
If you'd like to serve right away, use chilled red wine and serve over lots of ice.



Addition ideas: sliced strawberries, peaches, handful of fresh blueberries, raspberries, kiwi, a shot or two of gin, brandy or rum, a cup of ginger ale, citrus soda pop or lime juice.

Captain Morgan and coke
Vodka, OJ, and cranberry juice
premixed margarita mix on ice or blended in a blender
this is a yummy one for the ladies- Wild Night Out- mix one part lime juice, one part cranberry juice, one part white tequila- pour in glass with ice and top off with white soda
you can make a big batch of Whop instead of having a bunch of mixers- mix all white liquors like bottles of citrus flavored vodka, gin, malibu, and white rum in a big punch bowl, add a large jug of Hawaiian punch and two frozen concentrates of punch, cut up chunks of oranges, lemons, and grapefruits to float around in the bowl (eat them later with the alcohol all soaked up in them! yum!) make an ice ring from a jello mold to float around in the bowl also or you can just make it in a big Igloo drink cooler too.

<question>



Would you be interested in the following 5-course meal?



I'm having a swanky dinner party for my 21st. Mum and I have pretty much decided on what to serve, but I want to know whether our draft menu is of interest to folks... there are vegetarians, too, so we've also had to cater for them.

1) Gazpacho or Vichyssoise
2) Field Mushroom w. greens
3) Scallop dish; vegos: risotto dish (yet to be narrowed down)
4) Venison w. blueberry sauce & a side of baked potatoes; vegos: cheese-based tart w. caramelised onion & a side of asparagus
5) The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance: Croque en Bouche =D

Thankfully, my Mum and her friend are super cooks & my aunty is an ex-patisserie chef, so it's all doable for them. Any comments or suggestions re. improvements would be appreciated. Thanks!



</question>



<additional details>



A Croque en Bouche is a classic French-style celebration cake. It's a pyramid of creme patissiere filled profiteroles dipped in caramelised sugar, which, when set, gives the cake its name, 'crunch in the mouth'.

lovethedog, if you type Croque en Bouche into a search engine for images, you'll get a better idea. =)

Wow that sounds great!! #3, i would have the scallop dish, because that brings a lot of variety to the meal, unless you are going for a theme; for example, french etc.



Can i ask, what is Croque en Brouche? It sounds delicious. I would be interested in getting the recipe for it :) perhaps you could expand on what it is and maybe a link to a recipe. You should be a chef or restaurant manager, i reckon. Keep it up ;)
