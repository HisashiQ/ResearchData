Does Obama have to fear for his life now that he's the new president?



As I understand it, the most Southern states of America wouldn't be happy with a black president.



I'm actually quite glad that he won.



He must have to walk around with the secret service everytime he steps outside... right?

He had potential, if not the same potential to be hurt during the election to presidency. All that was stopped was like two groups of teenagers who couldn't have pulled it off anyways.

I'm an Englishman and to be perfectly honest with you I fear for Obama's life. A lot now will depend on his policies and what plans he has for America. If he makes good changes for the people then perhaps they will accept him. The downside is that at present he has inherited many many problems from the Bush regime and must appear to be resolving them. There will always be crazy people who simply want to kill for the publicity but I'm certain the American FBI or CIA are well aware of that. So fingers crossed and let's hope all goes well.

Actually, it an interesting question.  The first lady always gets to do some project of choice at the White House.  Hillary put art statues all around the White House grounds, and took people on tours.  Other first ladies decorated different rooms in the white house, painting them blue or red, etc.  Because Barack used the superficial skin color as a platform in his election, I wouldn't be surprised to see some effort on his and Michelle's part to try and rename the White House.  But hopefully, for Historical reasons, it would be preserved as is, and Michelle will just do some project in a room like the rest of the first ladies.

It wouldn't surprise me after this campaign to see this happen.  I don't think that politicians should endorse or not endorse any product or company though.  I think this would create a conflict of interest as to when a company is bribing a political figure under the false pretenses of endorsement.  I think this would create a potentially hazardous situation for all parties involved.  This would make lobbying much easier for the companies though.

Someone told me today that because of the way the Electoral College system works, McCain would become president !!

Pretty much in a similar way to the way a political party selects its leader, people would put themselves forward and there would be a vote.



Exactly how the vote would be administered, given there would be no party structure to do it, would be difficult: it would probably have to be done by house of commons staff.



The difference being that in some political parties, all members would be eligible to vote, not just the MPs.

According to Obama's sister, he was born in Kenya and then as
a one-week old infant, he was transported to Hawaii where his birth
was registered.



As is the case with most of the ignorant voters in America, you do
not even know the guy.  I suppose you also don't know that his name
is Barry Soetoro; and, he enjoys five other alias names, according to
the Federal Judge's paperwork last week.



So now we have the United States of Socialist America headed up
by the most staunch supporter of black liberation theology coupled
with a first lady who prefers the job of teaching classes to young
people on how to best overthrow the Government of America - gee, Michelle, I guess you can take a breather now, since your husband
can simply use the Office of the Presidency to destroy this Nation
you both hate so damned much.



One question for the voters:  HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN STUPID,
OR IS IT JUST THE INTENSE DESIRE TO VOTE FOR THE BLACK
GUY THAT GOTCHA THIS TIME?



Too bad you weren't considering the future of our children when you
made the decision to put a man's finger on our nuclear weapons who
by his own writings, would prefer to aim those weapons at AMERICA.

Should Obama haters be shot for treason?



After 9/11, I saw a lot of Republicans say that anyone who was against Bush was against America and should be shot for treason.  So, because Republicans are so big on accountability, should the anti-Obama crowd be shot?  How about water boarding?



FYI:  I didn't vote for Obama (or McCain).  I just like playing devil's advocate.

He said he voted for Obama... why would he do that if he wanted McCain to win? O_O



Anywho... I voted for Obama, I am happy, but I dont expect immediate change.  He starts... what... in January? I expect to see a start in his promised change within the next 2 years or so, but I dont expect to see significant changes in Obama's Term.

Actually, no, you are not the only one.
There are numerous people who know that, even though this event is "historic", and.... "a change"....  There is a great deal of hard issues in the mix that will not simply roll over and straighten out because of a new Presidency.  Things that have a great number of people feeling considerably apprehensive toward.
There is far too much work to be done, and far too many problems to face for anyone to feel that a person will be able to simply sweep them clean with karisma ...

Well, as he said, things may not happen in the first year or even the first term. We now have someone who will look at these problems with eyes from a different perspective than before.

Clinton wasn't untouchable.  People criticized him all the time.  I still hear jokes about him.  The difference between him and Bush is that nobody said criticizing Clinton was treason.

According to Ann Coulter, to question one's president is treason and anti-patriotic. Or does that only apply to questioning republican presidents?
"Any haters whatsoever should  NOT be shot" SHOULD be the logical answer to this question.

I am happy that Obama has won and what worries me is the evil that lurks in peoples hearts! My hope is that this country for once will choose the good that is in their," and for once let the love and goodness that is there be the ruler of their heart, and not the evil that is present have any victory". All the ones who choose evil are a part of why this country is going to hell in a hand basket. So my hope is this! please choose the good and decent and loving thoughts from your heart and don't be like the rest who choose the wrong! I hope that we become a country that is decent and caring and one that we all can be proud of!!!!!!!!!!!!

hi, i am from india



regarding your question, the MAHARAJAH of kashmir has opted to merge with india and both muslim and Hindus (Kashmiri pundits) used to live with harmony. Then pakistan backed terrorists forced the kashmiri pandits to move out of kashmir and spread wrong messages among hindus and got succeded to some extent.



Now the muslim majority even if want to be with pakistan, why India should get agree with it? And as far as i know, even muslims from India are not treated well in pakistan and called 'KAAFIRS'.So, its not in the interest of Kashmir and Kashmiri people to merge with Pakistan.

India is the largest one,since it has more population which gets involved to elect their rulers.
do you know that Panchap is cut into two parts because of rash decision by British during dividing India and Pakistan.
you started your question with asking if India and its claim as largest democracy.
what is the link it has got with Kashmir.
do you really know Kashmir wants to be with Pakistan.it is only the other way around,Pakistan wants Kashmir.
if it had been like Sahara desert ,they would not have been interested.Kashmir is where nature begins,water resources,climate,plantations and above all within their reach.
Bangladesh belonged to them,why they could not hold it for long.
do not waste time,Pakistan will never have Kashmir,not for million years from now.

It does if you know the demographics here in Indiana.  The main counties that went blue were Marion, Lake, and Monroe Counties.  These are some of the biggest population centers--Marion County is Indianapolis, Lake County is Gary, Hammond, and several other highly populated towns, and Monroe County is home to Indiana University.  Many of the other counties are predominately rural, so even if they go Republican, that's not a lot of votes.

ALl of the counties with large populations (Lake, Marion etc) went for Obama, but the REST of the state's smaller counties went for McCain.



Lake County is a subburb of South Chicago, and is predominantly African-American, Marion County, the state capital, has a high percentage of African-Americans, as does St Joseph County (South Bend).  Tippecanoe, Monroe, and Vigo counties are college towns, with predominantly young Americans.



The rest of the state is predominantly rural white Republicans.

Can America have free speech and be politically correct ?



Lets see free speech is where you can say the king has no clothes, politically correct is what the ruling party says is ok to say. In America we now have open housing laws so you cannot protect you and yours against crime, and as the crime rate went up they put in no profiling laws so the police have had their hands tied. So what is decent America to do.

Considering that Obama prohibited his campaign from speaking with people of the media who asked tough questions, I think he will squash our rights if he can.  He is a punisher, and will get even with certain people.



That's why Bill Richards switched to supporting him, because when he discovered that BO was going to win, he was afraid to oppose him.

I think free speech is only generally free to the one using it. Somewhere along the way, somebody, somewhere is going to get offended by someone else's free speech, and so a great debate goes on until that term/sentence is considered politically incorrect and banned. I guess we should just consider ourselves lucky that when we use our free speech and it offends someone we do not spend the rest of our natural lives in a dingy prison, or shot in the back of the head.

The good ones will realize that no matter the outcome, this was a historic election.  They need to understand that no matter how bitter the election was, we need to come together and unite behind Obama.  There will still be some who point fingers, especially at "the liberal media" and other such bug-a-boos, but others will hopefully take a good hard look at how the campaign was run, and realize that such a negative campaign, and the actions and decisions of McCain, were the biggest part of the reason he lost.  I only hope that they don't continue to harbor the hatred they've shown.

ALL of his decisions were bad.



But we owe him a debt of gratitude.  So much of this election was a referendum on his failed presidencies.

Congress is who actually decides laws and makes changes in the US, correct?



If I remember correctly, isn't it Congress who writes up a bill, votes on it, sends it to the President, and if he agrees, it becomes a law.  If he vetoes it, it goes back to Congress. Don't they vote AGAIN on it and if there is a 2/3 vote for it, it becomes law anyway?

<question>



Is there going to be a Northern American Union (Mexico, United States and Canada)?



Now that the President we have wants to make the United States a little more like Europe in every aspect, will there be a Union of all North American Nations and a common currency as Lou Dobbs and other journalists have been announcing? I already saw a commercial on CNN this morning, where the Federal Government is going to expedite new passports to US citizens, so that it is easier for them to move to and from those neighbouring countries. Obviously there will be more taxes in the US in order to compensate for Canada and Mexico. Spanish and French will become more important in the US too.

Sure, Asia is getting help from the International Food Policy Research Institute and from the Asian Development Bank. But what I'm really focusing on right now is on North Korea. i want to know what Kim Jong II  is doing about this. Hunger and poverty is a horrible issue in Asia. What is Jong doing about North Korea. Nothing? I must know.

Would you rather risk having Sarah Palin extremely close to becoming president?  McCain is 72, he has been through a lot in his life and it has taken too much of toll on his body, there was far to great a chance that Palin would have to take over and then you would truly have someone with NO EXPERIECE.

This is one of the most ignorant questions I've seen. Obama WILL be the new president of the US whether you like it or not. So unbunch your f*ucking panties and get over it! There's nothing you can do about it. It doesn't matter if you were or were not an Obama supporter- he won! It's over! Grow up and support the leader of your country!



The most ignorant part about your comments is that you probably consider yourself patriotic when you most definitely are not. A patriotic person would have faith in this country and support the future leader of it. God bless YOUR soul, you ignorant ignorant girl.

The fortune teller has spoken...our demise has been predicted. Let's not try to be optimistic or anything.



You do realize Bush took away a lot of your rights already with his war on terrorism right?



You do realize that we've had not terrorist attacks since the one that gave us a reason to go to war? Why is that, our southern border is wide open for ANYONE to cross. Do you think the Bush war machine stopped terrorist crossing, but allowed thousands of Mexicans to cross? Laughable, 9/11 was allowed to happen, just like the WTC bombing in 93 - look it up... the FBI had full knowledge of that bombing in advance before it happened. They even had an informant on the inside but decided to do nothing. They were supposed to supply fake explosives, but did nothing.



God will be taken out of everything? Have you ever heard of separation of church and state?



If you think Obama supports a one world government, what do you think Bush was pursuing? We aren't in the middle east looking for WMD's. North Korea has the WMD's... we haven't gone after their WMD's because they don't have any oil.

That is exactly right.  We do all need to make changes within ourselves so this country can improve.  I would hope that the first thing people want to change is--- less selfishness.  If people would stop thinking that the world revolves around only them and start showing kindness and selflessness, we'd be well on our way to a better nation.

That's what always happens under socialism - people lie and game the system because that is sinful human nature.



Capitalism rewards people's own self-interest and socialism pretends it doesn't exist and in the process stifles innovation and hard work.

They wont fight social issues.  Instead, they will get right to the important business of spending our money.  250 billion dollar economic stimulus bill is coming, plus another loan bailout as bug as the first one.  Theyre gonna try to slip them in while they have the momentum.



Obama has definetly called the american flag a symbol of opression, but now that hes president how much do you wanna bet he sees it as one of greatness?

Guess what? Obama is getting rid of the pledge or he wants to at least. So he may want to burn the flags. Obama is pretty stupid to want to get rid of the pledge. America why did you let him win? It's our vote that counts. Sorry America but Democrats failed us. I wish that I could tell you guys something better but my input is true. I totally wish our first black president was better. This is definitley a change no one will forget.

I voted for McCain. But honestly, after the election, I realized that Obama is the guy the country needs. I don't think he'll do much of anything. There's not much he can fix. It's impossible for the government to pull us out of a recession. The economy fixes itself. I think he'll be more of a do nothing president along with the do nothing congress. But he is very inspirational and he made tens of millions of Americans believe in America again. If you look around the world, they were all rooting for Obama. Other countries were building statues of him... He won't do much over the next four years, but he will be very inspirational, and that's why the country needs him.

Well, I guess that it will take a while to win over the haters but Obama will do as he wishes which is more Christ-like than this question and your attitude.  This is a new day, and your ideas have been repudiated by the majority of American citizens.  There are those of us who want to work together to make this a better country and that believe hate is of the last 400 years but this is a new century and we can make it what we want.

??????????????????????????????…



All I have to say to Liberals at this point. At least republicans and myself have acted with INTEGRITY and didn't act as childish as most of you have acted and are still acting at this moment. It isn't a football game and a matter of who wins or loses. It is a matter of who can run this country to the benefit of the people. It is a matter of who can do good for everyone. If Obama can do it then GREAT!!! I hope he proves me wrong. But at least act like adults and not children.



</question>

What is so ironic about my name? That interests me so if you know please tell me. I would love to know!



I am not making anyone look bad. What people say, and how they act whether it be in person or over the computer makes that person look bad.



Just in my defense here..by making the Question box full of question marks is a strategic move to get attention. As far as being childish you guys will feel I am childish because I am right and you don't agree with me. So stop acting childish, be an adult and just simply say you don't agree. Be respectful. If there is ever a republican out there acting childish..just remind them to be an adult. I can't vouch for the rest of my party. I can vouch for myself and my republican friends that I know. So if you feel someone is being childish..just be an adult with respect and say.."Hey, look you need to clam down and act like an adult. No I do not agree with you, but you don't need to act this way." No by my question or responses I have not acted childish I just brought up a reasonable issue. Like I said if you don't agree. just say I don't agree. That's it.

Hey Ihatelaundry - How about you take a leaf out of Obamas book and start talking and acting like a bloody decent human being. You're making him look bad.



As an Aussie, Ihatelaundry - if you we're ever running for presidency, I would have come there and ...



It's people like you who make america look bad with that disgusting 'lingo' you use. Absolutely bloody pathetic.

He says one thing but does another. I couldn't really tell you without taking an educated guess. The troops MAY slowly be pulled out of Iraq and put in Afghanistan. He says that he will hunt down the Taliban in the hills of Pakistan so it looks like instead of a war with Iraq, it will merely switch to Pakistan. To bad Pakistan has an extremely well trained military and nuclear warheads. The economy will go up and down like it always does. Based on Obamas voting record, everyone can expect to be taxed to death.



Until this happens though, I am going to give him the benefit of the doubt and I will stand up and support him as an American and try and not slander him or wear a t shirt with his face on it that says "not my president". as soon as I do that, then I have closed the door on myself to help make this country better. The country went into turmoil when Bush was in office (still is) because half of the country was not willing to reach a common goal. I will do my part as a citizen to not make that mistake.

Are Roth accounts going to be affected under Obama?



I called my investment company to take funds out of my Roth account to pay medical bills and was warned that I may have to pay extra tax.  I told the person that I already paid taxes on it because that is what a Roth is.  They said there may be additional taxes added to it under Obama.  I was surprised they would even say such a thing.  I do not have alot of money.



Have any of you heard this?



I am disabled and need that money for bills.

Bush has caused this.



The Cold War cost Billions and Billions of Dollars.
Reagan managed to stop the stupidity of the arms race.



Bush Senior maintained the wisdom of Regans legacy. Clinton maintained the same wisdom and improved relations.



Bush has wrecked it.



Reagan promised , as part of the deal, not to expand the borders of NATO. James Baker repeated that promise.



Bush Junior has ignored the progress Reagan made, ignored the improvements Clinton tried to achieved.



You can't blame the Russians for trying to defend themselves.



They, along with the world, have watched America break it's promises, They have watched America start illegal wars not on one country but on two. They have watched America extend attacks on Pakistan - and on Syria.



You should have been demonstrating at the time. It's too late to complain now. You're too late.

And the reason why Republicans will continue to lose is that they look at real problems Americans are facing as them being 'spoiled brats'. And no historian will ever put Bush as the second best president, he had historically low approval ratings for a reason you know. Even at best, he was still a weaker president than Clinton.

Should Biden Pay Delaware taxpayers the $2 MILLION?



that it will take to conduct the run-off election since he will not be able to be Senator? Yes, Biden not only ran for VP, but he also kept his name on the ballot for the Senate seat, but since he is going to the White House, another election must be conducted to fill the Senate seat he won last night.



Should he be required to pay for the election?
Why did Delaware permit him to appear on the ballot twice?
Does this say anything about the type of person Biden is? (ie. Shouldn't he be helping to "spread the wealth" instead of waste tax dollars?)

The hatred in America ... it pains me.?



Does anyone see this the same way I do...?
There is so much hate in this nation, though you will admit it or not, you hate the politicians of this world, you hate them enough, to the point where you will no longer hear reason, you bash them, and give them no room to help the world, I have, will you admit it too? I have seen that the presidents of this world, are hated so much by the opposing party, that they are blammed, bashed, and blasted for every action they make, in a world like this, there is no room for growth, only economic depression and the crippling of a once great nation, so please... does anyone see a ray of hope? A solution?

You have to understand, that with what just happened, America electing the first Biracial, African-American president, is a ray of hope.



People hate politicians no matter what. I will admit that I didn't support Obama because of the policies he supported, but the fact that America elected a biracial president is a ray of hope for racial issues.



And also, people are bashing president bush, and the entire republican party for the mistakes that have happened within the last few years. Yet they fail to realize that Congress is a majority of democrats.



So you see, everyone points fingers when most of the time they should point the finger at themselves - and this applies in so many situations. With racism too. Even though I am sad that Obama won because I strongly don't support his policies, I find the seas of diversity that have been at both candidates rallies to be absolutely beautiful.

Power, money, greed, power, posturing, money, power, greed, presidents sponsoring rock concerts, presidents getting thier dicks sucked, power, money, greed, war, famine, disease, AIDS, starvation, presidents making 300,000 dollars a year and wearing Armani, the Pope wears Gucci loafers, Brittney Spears gets more news coverage than genocide in Darfur, greed, cancer, stock markets crumble and millionaires wonder how they are ever going to live on the measly sum of 300,000 dollars a year.  PEOPLE ARE DYING ALL OVER THE WORLD, AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE BUDGETS TOPPING ONE BILLION DOLLARS.  Hate is irrelevant, my friend.  People are going to be people.  Which means they are going to sin.  Hate is inherently a part of this process, but really, this all comes from the God-given right we all have to make our own choices and form our own opinions........and boy, do we a have a ****-ton of each or what?  People suck, and most of them make shitty decisions, every day.  This definitely includes me!



But do you know what gives me a glimmer of hope in the midst of this huge shitstorm of lies, commercialism, war, pandemic diseases, and utter immorality we all must live in during this day and age?



It is this...........I remember, I have learned, and I most importantly and truly feel in my heart that this very night is the beginning of the End of Days, and I am so looking forward to the day when I will not have to walk into a booth, and vote for someone whom I feel is "the lesser of two evils"........I am not bashing either of them, however, I truly believe that the state that the world is in now is not able to be rectified.  It's over, and soon money, or status, stock markets, gas prices, what degree or job you have.....none of it is going to matter.  The solution to humanities largest problems (see first paragraph) is coming soon.......He is our ray of hope, and those that have faith and goodness in thier hearts......well, we won't have to worry about standing 3 hours in line to vote, or money or power, or greed, we won't have to worry about hate, or lies, or gas prices, and we won't have to worry about our children growing up in a world where they constantly have to look over thier shoulders, a world where 7 year olds die alone from gunshot wounds in the backs of SUV's, or a world where one man can order the deaths of 33 million people because he does not like thier religion.  The fate of this world is, and has been, beyond any politician for hundreds of years.  My hope for this world, the solution, is that it is time for our true heavenly leader to start fulfilling prophecies.
Starting tonight.

Barack Obama, was a huge supported of Abortion/Genocide....Or Choice is the word we use right?



He also wants to destroy my 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.



He supports an Immediate withdrawal of Troops.



I agree we should finish up the war. But Not before we win it.

Just means they don't follow a particular party.  I am Independent - some stuff Dems say I agree with and some stuff Reps say I agree with.  It also means that both parties will be calling you all the time to get you to sway their way.  You will also receive so much junk mail from these parties you could have saved a whole forest.

If you people had any idea of history you'd realize that Clinton had good years because of the republican policies put in place before him. The economy was just falling apart when he left office, which Bush revived with a tax cut.  The economy fell apart just recently because of those democratic policies (Fanny Mae, Freddy Mac), so now let's see if Obama has a clue how to fix it.  Don't hold your breath.  No matter, we'll just then elect another republican to clean it up.  It's a cycle. And there's always a new generation who can't figure it out to vote for the dems again to be their "daddy"

It doesn't matter.  If it passes, some Liberal activist judge will overturn the will of the voters.  It's California.  A once beautiful place that is now a shithole because of Liberals.

He wasn't the president of the United States, he was the first president  of the US in Congress Assembled under the Articles of Confederation.  Which basically meant he was the president of Congress..not the United States. He did not have power like the President had.  In fact Congress had very little power at that time because the US was not really the US yet, there was no Constitution.  They were a Confederation of independent states, not a country under one government.



Oh..I forgot to mention, he wasn't black.  That was a misconception given when someone assumed that his father, an indentured servent, was a chattel slave.  His father was not black and was not of African desent.

They then can cut cost by running the two together and eliminating duplicate jobs. This problem is all because of unions exerting to much pull on companies to make them give them things they can not afford to give. I won't buy form the big US car makers because it helps keep union employs working. Foreign cars are made here to buy hard working non union workers.

Well Natedogg is totally wrong in what he has said. If anything you should want to buy American made and keep our money here in America rather than sending it over seas and the Toyota trucks that are made in the U.S. are made union also. The idea is to help save both companies from going under, with them merging they are hoping that sales will increase since they will be one company not two and that will save them both. I think that Chrysler has nothing to worry about, I think that it will kind of be like the WaMu, JP Morgan merger, WaMu is still WaMu they are just owned by JP. I think that right now with the way that our economy is it is probably best for both companies, in the long run I think that Chrysler may end up regretting it because I'm sure eventually GM will want to get rid of the Chrysler trademark and with that goes Dodge, and Jeep and I truly think that will be sad, but hopefully it will work wonders on our economy.

Libraries are a cornerstone of local government.



If you don't like libraries, you should run for local government on a "stop the libraries" platform.



You do not understand the power you can wield in a local community if your message resonates.

Yeah, why should we offer information to the public for free? That's preposterous. If you're too poor to buy a book that's your own damn problem. If you can't afford books then chances are you shouldn't have the right to have an informed opinion anyway.



Now that I think about it, why are we paying for schools either? What, you poor people are too lazy to teach your own kids how to read, you have to make me pay for it? Oh, you can barely read yourself? Thats not my problem. Go into a Borders and read some of thier books! That'll teach you.

Just because we set a moral standard doesn't mean we live up to it all the time.  Remember, when the Founding Fathers set up the U.S., they intended "all men" to be all white landowning males.  Abigail Adams tried to get John Adams to include, women, but it didn't happen until 1920.  Blacks didn't get the right to vote until after the Civil War.  There was a lot of suspicion and hatred among groups, and there still is among some.  I think we're gradually getting away from it, but you can't turn away from it on a dime.

Even liberals own guns (gangsters and hippies).  That could  never happen.  Taking away guns is like taking swords away from middle ages people. It just invites a foreign invasion. Guns would become like weed. Everybody has it and keeps it hidden away until sticky situations.

WHAT "Gun Rights?"



1. A well-regulated militia being essential to the security of a Free State, the Right of the People to keep and bear arms shall be infringed. (A well-regulated People's Militia is essenial to the maintenance of free states- I don't know why Americans keep quoting these lovely words. They have absolutely nothing to do with THEM.)



2. You have the right to remain silent when the porcine is taking your nice shiny magnum away. You also have the right to be extremely vocal at the time. You also have the right to eat cocobolo.
"DO YOU UNDERSTAND THESE RIGHTS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE?"



3. You have the right to be mercilessly riddled with about three cases of police bullets, when they asked you, "Do you have a firearm?" and you bent down and drew out your Saturday Nite Special.



American civilian guns also have the little-known property of GROWING IN SIZE after police shootings. THIS IS NOT THEIR FAULT! Therefore, a DERRINGER, owned by the late suspect, becomes an M-60 by the time that the ambulance arrives, and by the time the body reaches the morgue, it has attained the the size, shape, and mass of a WW II Howitzer.

People dont want to accept the fact that not only is our new prez african american, but also the fact that he beat out a "thumbs-up" white man..
I have ben a supporter of Obama for a long time, but I was still willing to listen to what McCain had to say. In the end, I found  that Obama shares my beliefs, and obviously shares with many many people all over the country. He won the election, so now just sit back and see how he does... Remember though, Bush didnt screw things up in only 4 years, so dont expect that Obama can fix it in only 4 years.

Some people are ignorant.  If they feel he is more flawed then any other president then they are wrong.  Give the man a chance.  Unfortunately, many people fear a strong black man, just as many men fear a strong woman.  It is unfortunate.  America has spoken, and I'm going to support this man all the way.  People can drag his name through the mud all they want, they have that right here.  But it is not going to change my opinion.  Let them be mad, and upset, it bothers me none.  To many people have fought and died for this to be possible.  I am 26 years old, and just to think that 50 years ago, I would not have been able to vote and participate in this election, makes me feel so great.  My father came from nothing in butt-crack Mississippi, now he is retired living in a huge beautiful house supporting his family, just as my mother too.  They fought so hard growing up to live the life of luxury we live now.  This would not have been possible if is wasn't for the sacrifices, and torment they and many other endured.  Last night was a such a special moment for them.  I wish my grandparents could have seen it.  It is important to me that we all unite and keep this dream alive.  Lets not stop here.

No flaws will ever be found will Barack Obama and here is why:



When Obama screws up it will be blamed on Bush. Expect justifications like "Oh that was left over legislation from GW." or, "That deficit is interest roll over form GW spending." the Obamaphiles will go all out to make sure Obama is never blamed for Anything.

True Republicans will not leave or unlike the Dems when they lost threaten to leave.  We know despite having Obama as president, this is still the greatest country on earth.



So what will we do?  We will pray for Obama in the same way we pray for any president.  We pray for God's protection of him, wisdom to him, and that our leaders will make good decisions based on what is good for our country and not just what is good for their party or political careers.

Because they lost. They put a lot of effort into this political race, and they hate losing as much as anybody would. When Clinton won, back in '92, a group of Republicans got together the very next day to start planning how to disarm his presidency. They called themselves something like the Wednesday morning club.



Hopefully as time passes and Obama actually makes some positive changes in an inclusive and bipartisan way, their ire will fade.

indeed
my AP world history teacher made a really good point that got me thinking today



everybody's opinion is "Bush effed up the USA"
but then he said that economy constantly in a cycle of failure and then revival
he said in about 20 years the history text books are going to be calling bush an overall successful prez becus he dealt with more problems than any other president in such a short period of time
yet he didn't let America crumble under such issues
which brings me to my point, humans love to put the blame on others. now ppl are saying obama sucks. the guy hasnt even taken office yet



people should just stop bitching and see how they can make their lives better without just waiting for the gov't to clean things up for you



my philosophy now is deal with it
whether you like it or not you live here so grow up

People are not necessarily mad, they are afraid of the unknown. However, many of us are inspired and motivated for the first time in a long time. He made it clear that change will come with the aid and persistence of all Americans.  I watched the victory speech last night with tears in my eyes. I was overwhelmed with pride for our nation. I never thought in my lifetime that I would be so moved, so involved, or so inspired by an election. Last night's presidential results, have given this country a new hope. My hope is that people will see this victory as the beginning of a nation without racial, religious, or financial divide. I feel the urge to answer the call. I believe that African Americans needed to see Obama win to give them the incentive to open their minds that this country values and accepts them. I believe that those living below the poverty line needed to see the victory of a president that recognizes their hard work and sacrifices. I believe that young people needed to see that yes, you can accomplish great feats through hard work and determination. I believe that those people living with the fear of having a president who is not white, needed to see that this nation is a nation of color and diversity. Open your hearts and minds and rejoice...America has chosen it's first African American president.
The people of this nation have spoken, we are ready for change, we are ready for unity, we are ready for acceptance, we are ready for Barack Obama and his leadership!

Some people are angry because their candidate lost.  It's been this way in several of the more recent presidential elections.  It has nothing to do with Obama's race.  In 2004, many Kerry supporters were just as angry that Kerry didn't win.



To "123,"  President-Elect Obama did not win because he is black.  According to YAHOO!, Obama has over 64 million popular votes.  The vast majority of those votes were cast by voters who are NOT black.  While it is true that the majority of African-Americans voted for Obama, African-Americans (due to sheer numbers) did not make up the majority of Obama's popular vote.



If your hypothesis that Obama won because he is black is correct, then that means that many white americans (plus a number of latinos, etc.) voted for Obama because he is black.
Now, do you really believe that?  I don't think so.
Obama won because his message was one of restoration, hope, and change.
Whether or not you support him, his message is the reason he won.

He's already starting to renege on his campaign promises, and he hasn't even been sworn in yet.



That's kind of a bummer.



I wish him well, but I don't think he's the best person for the job.  I think he's in over his head, and some of his advisors are a bit sketchy, at best.



FWIW, I didn't think McCain was the BEST person for the job, either.



I found this article honest.  Pay attention to the part about TAXES RISING:



President Obama began this process last night, in his victory speech, when he noted that restoring the country's health might take more than a term. In the next few weeks, he should go well beyond this:



The deficit will be more than $1 trillion a year for several years
The country needs a massive new fiscal stimulus
The housing market will continue to decline through at least 2010
Interest rates and taxes will eventually have to rise (after the economy stabilizes)
Weak corporations have to be allowed to fail
Millions of homeowners will lose their house



Unemployment will probably rise to 10%
The government simply cannot "bail the country out" -- not because it lacks the will, but because it lacks the power
In short, Obama needs to acknowedge reality, erring on the side of overstating the problems and challenges, and he needs to prepare the country for several tough years. Because if he doesn't, within six months of his taking office, the country will have forgotten all about the prior administration and will instead be blaming everything on him.

yes it did pass. but it has nothing to do with close minded religious people. look . . i don't think your stupid but your question is very ignorant. if you believe in the holy bible which is gods words you cant believe in gay marriage because other wise you will be calling god a liar. god destroyed Sodom and gamor because he did not condone homosexuality he said it is a mortal sin. for as long as the human race has been on this earth there has been marriages between a man and a women, never a women and women and man and man or women and sheep or man and a dog. even African villages have marriages between a man and a women it is not natural for our race and to try and change it would be like betraying our entire way of life and being. but hating a person for being gay is wrong. wat you believe and wat you tolerate is 2 different things. why would you want to try and change the way god made us to live together on this earth i mean you are challenging god and wat he says we should do and how we should live. i myself would not dare challenge the man up stairs. be kind to others but do not try and believe in something that you know is wrong.

to deny same-sex marriage is still discrimination. using religion as the main reason on why to deny somebody else the right to marriage is completely wrong. there is the ideology of separation of church and state. it doesn't matter what you and i believe in, the state will decide based on logic and reason instead of what the person believes is "morally right and wrong".



and considering that this country is built on freedom of religion why is only 1 religion such a thorn in everybody's side.



you will never make a valid reason that religion is the only religion because there are so many. why must people pick only 1 religion to justify their answer?



use every single religion.
go to church on sunday, cover your head, grow a beard, be a vegetarian, cover your daughters and wife, pray 3 times a day, kill a goat, etc etc

Think about the question you wrote...you call us names...but we didn't call you names.



There are good reasons why prop 8 passed. Reasons that have nothing to do with "close mindedness" nor "religion". Not everyone who voted in support of prop 8 is religious. Some of 'em are honest decent atheists who just want to end the suffering.



You'll never understand as long as you call your opposition names instead of listening to us.



I find it sad when you wrote "I can't believe people these days"...why not? What's so hard for you to understand? The majority of Californians disagree with you on this issue. Doesn't seem so hard to me. Maybe you SHOULD try to understand others who hold a different view.



When you stop calling us names and start listening...really listening...then, maybe, you will understand...and learn something. You might even learn the vote in support of prop 8 was motivated by love and concern.

here we go...Because someone doesnt agree with you doesnt mean they are hateful, biggotts, racists or homophobes. The liberals always say this.  Some people dont think we need to go chaning the definition of words to suit people.  Marriage by definition is between ONE MAN and ONE WOMAN.  Do we really want to start changing word defintions?  What if 3men and 2 women wanted to be husbands and wives?  Who would you be to tell them they cant?  There is a guy on the news that seriously wants to marry his dog.  Why would anyone be so hateful and biggotted to not let him.  Do you see my point.  We dont have to agree but it doesnt mean we are hateful.  And honestly, by your answer calling religious people hate and close minded...who is really being the biggot and intolerant?

Why do you want to pay $7.00 for a dozen eggs?



Regarding Prop. 2 in California, come on people.



I love animals, but where is the logic in giving chickens area to stretch their legs and wings...before slaughtering them to eat.



Not only will this cost millions of dollars, bringing up the cost for everything poultry, its going to put the farmers in bankrupcy.



Oh, but you're not a farmer. So its okay.



You guys really messed this one up.



Note- The living conditions were just fine, there was nothing inhumane about it. If there was, it would have been changed long ago.



But if you want to pay $7 for a dozen eggs, thats fine by me.

Just so we are on the same page, this is not imported product. This is here in America.



And they are not diseased or tortured, just not living in a "free range". Remember, these are not pets. These are bred just so you can eat them. And infact, when living "free", they are more prone to attacking each other and eating each other.

<answer>



If having non-diseased and tortured animals (which affects the quality and safety of the meat) means paying more, then yes.  Plus it's the large agribusnesses that torture animals and leave them in their filth--small famers farmers have fewer livestock to handle and traditional farm life is more humane and sanitary than large factory farming.  I would much rather have American produced food than have Chinese and Mexican imports that end up killing people or making them very sick.  I wish tariffs and other trade resctrictions could be in place to protect domestic businesses.  Once tariffs are in place, American companies can compete and will gain a lot more business--and can then lower prices.



Tychicus: Something tells me that you're not really a farmer--sorry.



But when you place animals cramped together in their own waste the become diseased.  They'll also have a higher fat content and little meat (but they simply inject water and often salt into the "meat" to add extra weight to it.  Do you really want less for your money?  When you put them in slow, painful, stressful, and torturous situations, they produce extra adrenaline--which is bad for us because this hormone remains in the flesh of the animals that are killed.  Sorry but there's no excuse for factory farming being like thrid world countires.  Traditional farmers have been driven out of business by factory farms and people were better off with traditional farms--like in the good old days when we had more of them and food wasn't expensive.  Monopolies and price gouging (and artificial scarcity) by agribusinesses is what leads to high prices--they should all be broken up and more Americans should be given an opportunity to farm again.  But of course, healthy organic food is not what's heavily subsidized.

i voted no on this topic for a few reasons.



1. they are animals and i do not love animals but these animals were breed for one purpose. for human consumption. remember what drives the flavors of the meat we eat? fat. if there were problems the FDA would have done something already.



2. this puts more strain on farmers because instead of the 1 acre barnhouse that would hold 5000 chickens, he has to get a 3 acre barnhouse to house 3000 chickens. this just makes the farmer's life harder.



3. in the time of economical turmoil 7 bucks for a dozen eggs may not be much, but then price of every meat goes up as well. it doesn't help to have to pay so much for chicken when you barely have the money to afford a healthy dinner.

I think I'm missing something here....



Farmers need to spend more money to produce eggs and chickens.
Grocers won't want to sell such expensive products.
Grocers buy eggs and chickens from neighboring states.
Farmers have no customers for their expensive poultry.
Farmers stop raising chicken and raise something else or they simply go out of business.
Jobs are lost.
Chickens and eggs are now only imported from other states contributing to extra fuel usage and environmental impacts.



It doesn't make sense.  What am I missing?

just a few previous threats:



withdrawal from START-II: made good, now russian ICBMs carry multiple re-entry vehicles.



expanding nuclear deterrent and rocket technology: made good,russia is fielding 8 new ballistic missile submarines and a new sub-launched ICBM

This is a great question. And the answer for me would be just to continue to believe in my religion if this was ever to happen. I am a firm believer in God, therefore i know that the day will come when they will try to take away our religious rights and the Bible. But they cant take my voice away. I will pray hard. And im glad that i have the word of God in my heart. Therefore, if they do try to execute our religion or race i wouldnt worry.

Well I have always said that Obama reminds me of Hitler. Hitler blamed the jews for everything including the economy which most germans agreed with. Sounds similar to the Obama's followers opposition to republicans, whites and christians; also this is exactly what Rev Wright preached. Hitler also had his own private army to deal with opposition. Obama proposes a Civilian National Security Force which he wants to be just as strong as our military.

What can we do to stop arms dealing to countries that use weapons against their own people?



Countries often use supplied weapons against their own people and, in some cases, against the very countries who supplied them with the arms in the first place. How can this be prevented?

<evaluation>Best Answer - Chosen by Asker</evaluation>



How much worse is it to use weapons against your own people as opposed to your neighbours, or people a bit further away?



I actually think that if a country uses arms against the country that supplied the arms in the first place thereis some degree of poetic justice to it, on the contrary.



Do you expect an unwritten code of conduct that weapons will not be used against the supplying country but should only be used against other countries? Isn't that, even if it could ever be implemented and adhered to, extremely cynical? That would make selling arms a way to defend yourself: 'go shoot other people, kill them all if you want, but don't touch me...'



I think that we should first look at weapons that have been outlawed or should be outlawed. Think of Israel dropping cluster bombs in th elast 2 days of their invasion of Lebanon, think of Israel (I'm not picking on them,  it's just more recent) allegedly using DIME weapons that destroy animals and people but leave infrastructure intact, think of the damage land mines cause years after the conflicts have ended...



I think that the way to outlaw these would be to hit countries where it matters, in the pocket. If you sell landmines to country X and country X uses them, you will have to pay for the clean up. The directors of the corporations doing the sales and the heads of state and military of the country using the weapons should be personally responsible, declaring the corporation bankrupt would not be an option. If you supply cluster bombs, then you will have to pay for the clean up as well as the loss of income and cost of relocation of the residents of the affected areas.



Basically I am saying that the true costs of conflicts must be borne by the perpetrators and their suppliers.



This could be enforced via trade boycotts, just as those used against Iraq prior to the war, ensuring that they couldn't produce any WMD.



FInally this should be applicable to every country and corporation.

I agree with most of your points here especially around using weapons generally.  Many answerers point out that arms dealing is a fact of life, one option is to try to regulate this more, and the only way to do this is globally through the UN. Sign the petition: http://www.controlarms.org

Surely the best way would be for governments/armies to have control of arms manufacture, and only to be allowed to produce for their own use, thus leaving no surplus and having no profit available. It does seem silly for someone to be able to set up in this kind of business purely for profit

I think that more accountability within the arms industry is needed. These guys operate as if they are above the Law and indeed in most cases they think they are. The government also usually has a large vested interest in most arms companies, with big money fuelling the fire so it is very difficult to bring arms dealers under control even if they break the Law. A bullet is a "hot" politician and very few would dare to go up against them. They do as they please and everyone allows them to. Zero accountability and secrecy ensure they flourish with the Police and Security Services lending a helping hand.

America doesnt sell there guns to the American people. Switzaland doesnt sell there guns to there people.
And Germany doesnt sell there guns to there people.
My point is that why do countries make weapons and sell them to other countries.Because the companies(colt,couger etc.)know that they will get a bigger price for there guns if they sell them to less fortunate countries.When will the day come when the world stops these companies altogether.Maybe if we were to unite against them something could be done.But until people unite against these companies that wish to continue to make guns or other types of weapons the world will remain in chaos.

Nothing can be done.



Arms are designed to kill or incapacitate, and when someone is coming at you with a gun or a petrol bomb or a knife or even a rock, you need to knock them down before they do you in. Every State needs arms, otherwise the criminals would walk over you. If you do not supply arms, then States will build their own - witness South Africa, who, in the apartheid days, were forced to produce their own weaponry. They started with rifles, but soon acquired such expertise and produced weaponry of such quality that I would advocate purchasing some of their surplus Casspir Armoured Personnel Carriers for use with the British forces in Afghanistan.



I'm ex-Service (OK, I was a Cook), but I now provide security for HM Criminal Courts, and you should see the weaponry that ordinary British civvies carry with them. Getting rid of arms is simlpy naive.

There is no way to stop it, where there is money to be made there will always be someone willing to supply arms whether it be through legal or illegal channels. We need to come from the other direction and stop the demand for weapons.  But when the demand is coming from the despots and megalomaniacs in governments all over the world, we are fighting a losing battle.  It's a no win situation and the best we can hope for is damage limitation.

Let's all be aware that there are many countries around the globe that manufacture arms. The array of weapons is mind boggling . Those countries that manufacture arms are not really concerned about where they are shipped to . The illegal arms networking ,I am told, is so fantastic that it is near impossible to trace the route.  Arms cost a bomb. I am sure that arms shipments are very large ....and so are the cheques.!! Like in the movies .The bottom line is that the arms dealer does not give a hoot about where a shipment is going as long as the payment is assured.



Today the US supplies arms to country X because of some bilateral co-operation. 3 years later things do not turn out right and so country X attacks US interests.  If there is an armed insurgency within that country the govt. in power is going to use these arms against the insurgents....who are their own people. This is plain and simple politics . Surely we do not needexamples . The international community of the very rich nations ( is it G7 ? ) is trying to prevent North Korea and Iran from going nuclear yet some countries in G7 are reported to have stockpiles of nuclear weapons. Correct me if I am wrong please. Even Israel is believed to have such weapons, probably enough to wipe out all the "troublesome" middle east countries that oppose a Jewish state. The weapons have probably been supplied by the US. Do you think that one day tehe israelis will shoot at/ bomb  US interests ?  Maybe ?



So, if you can see where I am going with this you should understand that the kind of prevention you are talking about is not possible. A few countries want to police and rule the world. In the cycle they are at the crest. The crest is followed by a downturn into a trough and that time may be arriving sooner than you think for these countries.



The world is not fair and every dog has its day!  The answer is to destroy all arms. Is this possible ?Knowing how sick the human race has become it may not even be practical. The answer is blowing in the wind.

The simple answer would be to simply destroy all weapons, arms etc etc but this isn't an ideal world so that's not likely to happen, however, governments, the people with power, should be doing a lot more to combat this situation. they have the power to set up the ability for these weapons to be stopped being put onto the market, and for example if governments worked together in tackling this problem there would be a greater force working against this problem, stopping shipments, keeping tabs on the countries involved, random checks, pretty much do accounting, but also, eradicate the primary source to begin with if it is the black market, take out the arms dealers, that way there isn't anyone to sell the weapons. the government harnesses a lot more power than they let on so instead of hiding that power, they should use it to stop theses problems or at least contribute a lot  more to help with this problem

The approach countries take to the sale of arms around the world varies greatly.  It is not true that all western democracies have similarly firm attitudes blocking the sale of arms to questionnable dictatorships or indeed countries in severe political turmoil.  Lobbying the government, through a dialogue with your MP is a good way to ensure the UK's policy is morally defensible and the government as a whole applies pressure to other countries to avoid arms sales to unpleasant regimes.  Concern has been raised about the UK's own policy. Crucially, countries should be encouraged to co-operate and share information in an attempt to reduce the illegal trade.



However, realistically not all countries will follow an ethical policy and countries like China and some former Soviet States have indicated they will go their own way and supply arms on their own terms.  The illegal trade is even harder to stamp out and as long as people are willing to pay for weapons people will supply them - rather like drugs.



Conflict is, unfortuantely, a fact of human existance and it is hard to see this ever changing.  As long as people feel the need to defend their territory, culture and beliefs they will use weapons to do so.  The sad reality is that people will use anything that comes to hand as a weapon to pursue their aims if they feel strongly enough.  The genocide in Rwanda and the deaths of some 800,000 people in a little other 3 months was conducted with knives, machetes and other farm implements.  Very few guns were used.



Having served in the military and witnessed aggression in Africa, the Balkans and the Midddle East I have come to the conclusion that conflict is a reality of life.  Limiting the supply of weapons to places where they will be used against innocent people is a small but important step.  However I do not believe it will ever have a dramatic difference.  Will Russia really change its policy in the North Caucasus if countries refuse to sell them weapons or will they build them themselves?



Beyond that, the bigger question we need to ask ourselves is what do we do when we see innocent people being threatened and murdered and how should we re-act to the events that are taking place every day in countries around the world.  Do we have the right and the resources to judge every tribe, people and nation and prevent them using violence against others or amongst themselves?

Stop the companies that make the weapons for export in the first place. The only problem is what happened in South Africa and Israel, if you ban them importing weapons they make there own with some help from certain companies. In these case both countries ended up making weapons for export themselves. You could stop countries like England holding Arms fairs too!

No i found nothing wrong with it personally- not one of his best speeches but he had a hard speech to write as he had to express just how happy he was while not sounding to gloating- think about how happy you would be if you had just prepared for a job interview for 21 months and then finally got it. If you are feeling nauseous because of any racial issues then that is just sad for you if you cannot see past the colour of his skin to the great ideas and values he has

this is an ignorant statement. its not discriminations. label is put to dentote your ethnicity and your native country. im an african(descendant of african people)-american(natural born u.s. citizen). im not from africa but my ancestors are. your putting a label by just wanting to call it american. dont be ashamed of your ancestry. now a african immigrant or a chinese immigrant or whatever can say they are chinese. america was founded by immigrants and thats a basic right to move here and seek prosperity. so you have no right to tell someone to go ''home''. if they are a legalized citizen then they are home. thats bigotry to think otherwise

you are right it's the wrong reason to vote for him, but that is one of the few reasons that most people I know are voting for him.  It's not because of his policies or what he believes in or what he has done in the past to make America a better place to live and that's sad.

Those are the people who will really be in for a surprise when Obama is President. I'm happy they've cast their ballot for him, I'm an Obama supporter, BUT, when they find that they'll only have a tax break IF they pay taxes (which means they'll have to work and earn enough money to actually file taxes), they'll see that the government works best for those who work.
Even as a Democrat, Obama is going to have to restructure the welfare system to free up money for other areas of government. The reality is that the only difference between the two ideals is the fact that one candidate wants the 'system' in place for the benefit of those who actually need it, but wants to make it a more efficient and effective 'system', while the other would rather do away with it altogether.

Obama = Socialism = Free Ride. His most devoted followers know that Obama intends to increase taxes for the wealthy (and that is changing every day) in order to provide more for the unproductive people. Obama will look out for his people (African-Americans) first and his brothers and sisters in Africa second with his Global Poverty Act.

Lets see; for war crimes and for 9/11.



Bush has already pardoned himself.



It is time for the American people to move forward and become part of the world.  To do this, they need to clean up their backyard.  People internationally are asking the US to bring criminal charges against Bush.



Ask yourself why was it that the israelis caught cheering the collapse of the Twin Towers were released after being held for 3 months?  Ask yourself why it is that that release was achived only through an order from the Whitehouse.  Ask yourself why any further investigation into the Israeli connetion was stopped by Bush.



The facts are available.  israel played a part in the Twin Towers destruction.  That is impossible to deny.

No. If there was even a hint of that about to happen, Bush would likely pardon himself (yes, the President can do that. There's some question of whther the President can pardon himself in advance for something not specified).

OBAMA WON. democracy has spoken. and thats american. people are sounding like those ''jihadist terrorists''they hate when they talk about the end times and make threats towards our president

What?  Quoting you: "Jesus, the man" hasn't even been inaugerated yet?  Are you regergitating what the Islam Nation Leader is calling him? (ie watch the video where he calls Barack the Messiah).  And there YOU go, bringing up color again.  It's not the color, so YOU get over it.  I'm FED UP with black people drawing attention to the color of their own skin.  FED UP.  Black people are threads within the weave of our country.  Already.  Celebrate the beauty and diversity in our country, don't just "tolerate" the diversity as the movement calls it.  But I'm FED UP with people who stir negative relations by drawing attention to the color of their skin (ie, Barack used it as a platform to start his candidacy, knowing he could stir emotions.  It worked.  But it's actually meaningless.)  Barack is just another person.  Who gives a damn if his skin is black, or yellow, or white, or poka dot? Unless his agenda is to push for something other than equality, color does not matter.  No one is "afraid" of Barack, just pissed that a man who sits in circles with extremist organizations, tied to the nations and religious beliefs that took down our towers and 2000 lives as well as 4000 American soldiers' lives, and calls us infidels, makes me wanna vomit.  They weakened us, and now they plan to run our international relations.  They're so proud to have this place in our country presidency.  WTF? I thought Barack was an American?  Why are all the other countries so thrilled?  Hamlet worded it nicely, "There's ______ in Denmark."

Thats exactly what I'm telling you.  If it werent for racism, only 4% of all people would have voted for the republican ticket.



You might be part of that 4%, but I'm pretty sure all those guys saying Obama is a monkey in a suit are racist.

Because people fail to see that the only change that this country will see is radical, socialist change.  The Obama voters (not ALL of them, but the ones who insinuate that race played a part in your vote) don't want to see him for his far left wing politics.  They don't believe we aren't chugging the same kool-aid, so of COURSE that makes you a racist.  I would vote for a black man, like, let's say Colin Powell.  In fact, I always hoped he would run for president. But, no- we get the most radical lefty this side of California. This is why I despise jack@ss democrats. They were the only cocky, hateful ones in this whole election process. I'm not bitter that Obama won, I just hate the ignorant losers who voted for him- AND their childish smugness. Careful what you wish for stupid liberals.....Whatever Obama does to this country is NOT on my conscience.

I have no other explanation other than automatic assumption, the "hilarity" in it (see "Is it because I'm black?" and every off-branch of it), or plain ignorance. Some people didn't vote for Obama because he was black...but that's some people. Not all people who don't vote for Obama are racist. Actually, many of them aren't.



It also could be from bad experiences, believe it or not.

I'm not calling you a racist, therefore I couldn't fall into the "everyone" category.  I voted for Obama and it wasn't because he was African-American.  I actually had my own personal reasons and opinions as to why I voted for him.  You have your own opinions and that is your right.  As for those who are calling you a racist simply because you don't agree with Obama, they do not understand the meaning of racism.  They're just caught up in the moment.

This has been a reoccurring topic that i've been having with friends who are Obama supporters and friends who aren't.  People that say they haven't seen or heard this either are deaf and dumb or simply aren't paying attention.



One of the most left senators in our government ran for office and he happened to be black. There is plenty of reason why moderates and conservatives wouldn't vote for him.



Time after time I kept seeing the media referring to white voters who wouldn't vote for him and it was assumed time after time that it must be because of his color.  My local news broadcast brought this point up tonight when our extremely republican rural area didn't vote for him in any great numbers.  Obviously there was a little racism involved on both sides in this campaign. Its very sad since race really shouldn't have been a major contributing factor.

It's kinda like swearin when you get real pissed off.  It solves all your emotional issues and makes you feel better fast.  It's easy to label something everyone is cautious to talk about,  then they don't have to put in the effort to dig down and understand the real issues. Sad but true.  Don't try to understand it.  It's human nature.  Obama knew it as an American weakness, so he used it to his benefit.  Obama studied our cultural weaknesses and used them against us.  Too bad he'll never fully understand our cultural strengths, like why the heartland of America all voted red.

If it was a way-out wing nut policy Bush was pissing off the world by pursuiing, you can bet Obama will undo it.



Now if Europe actually decides its under threat from Iranian nukes, they can build their own shield. I get the funnies notion they're a bit more threatened by having Russia cut off their supply of natural gas, than by a nuclear Iran.



Iran is a country run by religious wing-nuts, but not by crazy people. Those religious wing-nuts have a legitimate beef with the US because of the dirty deeds we did for the Shah, leading them to kick him out and thumb their noses at us. Conciliation not posturing or sabre-rattling will normalize relations with Iran.



That was impossible under Bush because under Bush the USA, too, was run by religious wing-nuts. No more.

Because we are the most powerful nation in the world (not to sound conceited) and our choice of leader affects the world as a whole. We elected a very good man. We have finally gained our respect back after eight long years of President Bush.

Aussie here - Its nice to see a change for good.



Everyone in every country is in crisis, so any change that might herald an upsurge in fortunes is celebrated.



A lot of Aussies had problems with being dragged into the war with our US cousins, so I think they are relieved they might see their family sent home to them soon. (As I am sure a lot of American families will be relieved about too)

Initially it seems they're happy with the change of command.  But I doubt that'll last if the alliances shift with Obama's affilliations, like he said in his book, that he will "stand with the Muslims".  They "think" they had it bad with Bush?

America have had President Bush for 8 dreary years... and they almost elected another redneck with a VP who has the I.Q. of a rottweiler.
I think other nations are relieved that they do not have to put up with another simpleton who will lead the world's leading superpower for 4 years.

Bill Clinton's Presidency was the only 8 of the 28 years worth living through. The economy was great, we were not totally involved in an unnecessary war, and Americans were happy... And Bill Clinton was a Democrat.



One more thing, a Bush was either President or Vice-President during the other 20 years... And the Bushes are Republicans.



Go figure, GOP...

Thanks you are right!  If I m not mistaken I believe the Clinton's were in power as long(or longer) as well,



sometimes I have wondered if they helped to keep taking turns with each other !



Maybe we will see a little relief now with a new Democratic President and the much needed house changes!

Fatalities involving young drivers have jumped in NSW. One solution might be for teens to agree to a written contract with parents setting out rules for safe driving.

News:
So far, this year there have been 49 P-plate driver fatalities, nearly double the 25 killed last year – kids aged 17 and 18 on provisional licences whose lives have been cut short, leaving grieving and shocked families, friends and communities.



[Maybe it's time to sack all the driving instructors!]



New:
What's behind the sudden jump? No one seems to know. It isn't echoed in other states, and it bucks the long term trend – which is no increase or decrease over the last five years. So it seems to be a statistical anomaly.



[Why not sack the statisticians why you are at it?]



News:
What is certain is that teenager road accidents are common. Road accidents were the leading cause of death among young Australians. According to a 2005 report from the Monash University Accident and Research Centre, drivers aged 18-24 account for about 25-30 per cent of all road fatalities, but make up only about 14 per cent of all drivers in Australia.

They are politically incorrect, which is a shame.  Stereotypes exist because they have basis in reality.  Poking fun at each other in a good natured manner is healthy for race relations.  It's much healthier than banning all discussion of race and race relations.  Look at Carlos Mencia, he pokes fun at every ethnicity including his own and the guy is genuinely funny.



That being said, as with anything else there is a line in the sand that shouldn't be crossed.  Common sense should be the guide here.  For example, telling a joke about blacks love for watermelon is much different then telling a joke about blacks being lynched.

depends in what environment, and in what context. For example if your saying something to especially offend someone then what your doing is wrong. But if your doing something to be tounge in cheek within a circle of friends who ARE what your "offending" depending on whatever context should be fine.



As long as there is no truly malice intentions behind the joke, i see minimal harm and more dangerous things in this world to worry about.

1) Yes
2) I think that comedy should have no rules. I honestly believe that if you don't like a comedy show or stand up comedy or comedy on the radio etc don't watch it. The problem is that when someone ays a sexist or racist joke then it will make a lot of people laugh, but will offend a few, so surely they are acceptable when the majority of people like then?
3) I'm not going to list a racist joke in case i get banned from yahoo lol, but it would be one that probably plays on racial stereotypes



4) As i said before, in my eyes comedy should have no laws. If a joke is deciding people just need to remember that it is a joke,, they may not like it, but if that's the case move on and forget about it.



5) No i don't think any jokes should be of limits, because as i've said  few times lol if people don't like that type of offensive comedy then they shouldn't watch it.



I hope that helps.

Unfortunately, there are lunatics in this world.
I believe that several white supremacists will make an attempt on Obama's life for the mere fact that he is black.
Hopefully, security and other forces will crack down on these types of scum before they can do anything remotely lethal.

Which American political party is older/establhd earlier and has had more presidents - Democrat or Republican?



Why do they have the elephant and donkey as emblems/mascots, and considering America is a republic and democratic country/nation, why have political parties called the Republicans and Democrats?



Rather than Labour, Liberal, Conservative or Green parties?

There is no time to lick wounds, point fingers, and wallow in post-election mud.
We have to stand up for our principles, as we always have — through Democrat administrations and Republican administrations, in bear markets or bull markets, in peacetime and wartime.



We stay positive and focused.



We keep the faith.



We do not apologize for our beliefs. We do not re-brand them, re-form them, or relinquish them. We defend them.



We pay RESPECT to the office of the presidency. We count our blessings and recommit ourselves to our constitutional republic.



We gird our loins, to borrow a phrase from our Vice President-elect.



We lock and load our ideological ammunition.



We fight.



First assignment for fiscal conservatives in Washington:



1) Oppose the Democrats’ next stimulus boondoggle.
2) Oppose Obama’s windfall profits tax proposal.
3) Oppose new bailouts for states deep in debt.
4) Oppose new foreclosure prevention measures that will simply provide perverse incentives for borrowers to walk away and delay a needed market correction.
5) No more federal loan guarantees for corporations

I was born in America & I never thought I'd ever want to leave it, but I have made plans to relocate within the next 1-2 years. I busted my butt to get where I am today, and there is NO WAY anyone is going to take that away from me!



Obama's trillions in new spending will destroy the economy and his welfare system is forcing many businesses to leave. Pretty soon American jobs will be like the dinosaurs. I have spoken with several business associates & there are many businesses getting ready to cut out. A few will be relocating with me and among us, we will be taking over 5,000 jobs with us. We hate to do it but we are left with no other choice. There is no way we can continue to grow & survive under his plan.

I love how everyone keeps saying it's not about color it's not about race but everytime they say We have Elected a new president they go The First African American President has been Elected. I have no problem with the fact he is black but that's sad if that's the reason he was elected.



I am worried about the taxes that he is going to raise. The whole rebate thing is just going to send us farther into debt. But even if you don't like his views or opinions you need to respect him because he is our new president whether you like him or not!!!!

Allright there's a lot of extremely bitter people on Yahoo Answers tonight. Please dont take their comments to heart. I'm glad we surprised you but honestly most of us were so attracted to Obama's policies and persona, it's magical we can get rid of Bush's arrogance at the same time.



Most of us here are intelligent enough to know a world leader when we hear them speak. May we work together to lead the world for our children's future.



I doubt we could have accomplished that with McCain/Palin (who is so not Tarja Halonen, Palin is such a bitter woman I was EXTREMELY scared of her getting anywhere near the Presidency, no joke whatsoever).

Like most leaders he will probably go very grey haired very early but very popular leaders are always major targets so he will need to be very careful - maybe allow a settling down period before putting himself out there too much - perhaps a bullet proof clear partition in front of the microphone when he is speaking in public for a start - there is no doubt he is more likely to suffer attempts on his life than any other since the birth of America - change is often a precursor to trouble and this is a huge step your country has taken and it makes sense to watch out for trouble - I hope he survives into old age.

How much worse is it to use weapons against your own people as opposed to your neighbours, or people a bit further away?

I actually think that if a country uses arms against the country that supplied the arms in the first place thereis some degree of poetic justice to it, on the contrary.



Do you expect an unwritten code of conduct that weapons will not be used against the supplying country but should only be used against other countries? Isn't that, even if it could ever be implemented and adhered to, extremely cynical? That would make selling arms a way to defend yourself: 'go shoot other people, kill them all if you want, but don't touch me...'

I think that we should first look at weapons that have been outlawed or should be outlawed. Think of Israel dropping cluster bombs in th elast 2 days of their invasion of Lebanon, think of Israel (I'm not picking on them,  it's just more recent) allegedly using DIME weapons that destroy animals and people but leave infrastructure intact, think of the damage land mines cause years after the conflicts have ended...

I think that the way to outlaw these would be to hit countries where it matters, in the pocket. If you sell landmines to country X and country X uses them, you will have to pay for the clean up. The directors of the corporations doing the sales and the heads of state and military of the country using the weapons should be personally responsible, declaring the corporation bankrupt would not be an option. If you supply cluster bombs, then you will have to pay for the clean up as well as the loss of income and cost of relocation of the residents of the affected areas.

Basically I am saying that the true costs of conflicts must be borne by the perpetrators and their suppliers.

This could be enforced via trade boycotts, just as those used against Iraq prior to the war, ensuring that they couldn't produce any WMD.

FInally this should be applicable to every country and corporation.

I agree with most of your points here especially around using weapons generally.  Many answerers point out that arms dealing is a fact of life, one option is to try to regulate this more, and the only way to do this is globally through the UN. Sign the petition: http://www.controlarms.org

Surely the best way would be for governments/armies to have control of arms manufacture, and only to be allowed to produce for their own use, thus leaving no surplus and having no profit available. It does seem silly for someone to be able to set up in this kind of business purely for profit

Perhaps some of the 'PAP' parasites that make the celebrities life hell should be airlifted to the Sudan and let them take some photos worthy of a newspaper print. Guns will always be available to evil dictators. What we need to do is ensure that they aren't given a chance to use them without the fear of being found out.

The United Nations is at present our best hope. By outlawing certain types of weapons altogether and by sending inspectors to Countries accused of carrying out such crimes we can at least keep an eye on questionable regimes.

Probably nothing. Arms sales are just too profitable. They are also very easy to transport so smugglers will always be willing to take a chance. Besides do you think any of the major powers are going to miss out on this cash cow. We are the biggest supplier of arms to the world but if we stopped selling them the customers would just go to China, N.Korea, Iran or some other rouge state and get them

Pretty much nothing. The reason for this is: This issue is not isolated none Democratic countries. Even countries such as the U.S. have this issue. If it is not citizens shooting citizens, it it government offices. The only difference between western countries, and none Democratic countries is the western countries believe they are killing people for the good, whereas others just don't care. Needless to say, neither are right. The only way to stop it is, stop making weapons full stop.

Provocative question. Simple answer is, is it can't be prevented, look at  the "rendition" issue that's been discussed; Blair, "uh? we didn't know". B******s. Our government is as corrupt as any other and will turn a blind eye to the likes of BAE exporting weapons as it's a nice little earner for them. As a general populace we really have no idea what's going on - and we never will. Notice the FOI Act is being scaled down so plebs like us can't ask pertinant questions?

I don't think there is anything we can do to effectively stop arms trade with abusive regimes.



Even attempting to do so would require broad international support and an effective international body that could regulate arms deals. Unfortunately, the major international players are the ones who dominate the arms trade, and it is unlikely that they'll give up such a lucrative market. Even if the major countries did commit to controlling arms sales, new suppliers would simply enter the market. Trade in arms is much like trade in drugs. So long as there is a demand, there will always be a supply.

A better, more realistic, and more long-term solution is  to change the abusive regimes themselves. We should work to support democracy, individual rights, and freedom throughout the world. Governments which prey on their own people should be isolated and punished, and oppressed peoples should be supported when they attempt to fight back against despotic leaders.

YOU HAVE THE POWER TO STOP THIS HAPPENING .Yes one person can change the world if you believe that it needs to be stopped then take direct action against it YOU CAN STOP IT first you need to identify all companies that have any involvement in producing or shipping these items even supplying components, then highlight their involvement through the media .there are many and varied additional actions that can be taken to further weaken the evil that you are fighting ,probably it would be needed to win this particular fight, none of which could i condone . but you might find some interesting tips in such publications as "The anarchists cookbook" and "Eco defence" .
Whatever you choose to do don't hurt anyone , non violence is definitely the strongest way to deliver your message .

I wish there was a way to stop so much evil in this world, but it seems that this is the price to pay for the freedoms we enjoy in a Capitalist society.  Freedom of speech, and freedom to live as we want, also goes hand in hand with Freedom to Trade (Free Trade Economy).  From Britain's perspective, we have lost so many industries, that we have very little left to export.  Unfortunately, we do seem to have retained our expertise in producing and selling arms.  How can the Government ever be persuaded to restrict this industry which raises billions for the UK / Government!

I'm sure it's the same story for all the other countries who trade arms.

No regard seems to be given as to who the "Buyer" is... Democracy or Dictator, as long as they sign on the dotted line.....

The only way I think would be if there was a significant worldwide agreement to limit weapons production; in a similar way to the Kyoto Agreement for the environment.  However, unless ALL countries agree, AND then stick to it, it won't work.  i.e. what about the U.S (& Australia) for example who have not signed up to the Kyoto Agreement! And we all know how the U.S. as a country seems to have no regard as to carbon emissions etc.



I still prey for worldwide committment and unity in dealing with all these issues, including arms.  It just seems so hard for us "ordinary folk" to make any kind of impact when it's all linked to - and controlled by - Big Business, Power Politics, & Back handers (probably!).



Jay Kay - thank God there are people like you, who are lucky enough through talent to be in the public eye, but also have a concern for the world, and therefore potentially have more of a voice, to maybe make that little bit of difference.

For example, even this is raising these issues, and getting people to think & talk about them.  You never know....One Day...... the world will work together for the good of all...  Dan

Nothing can be done.

Arms are designed to kill or incapacitate, and when someone is coming at you with a gun or a petrol bomb or a knife or even a rock, you need to knock them down before they do you in. Every State needs arms, otherwise the criminals would walk over you. If you do not supply arms, then States will build their own - witness South Africa, who, in the apartheid days, were forced to produce their own weaponry. They started with rifles, but soon acquired such expertise and produced weaponry of such quality that I would advocate purchasing some of their surplus Casspir Armoured Personnel Carriers for use with the British forces in Afghanistan.

I'm ex-Service (OK, I was a Cook), but I now provide security for HM Criminal Courts, and you should see the weaponry that ordinary British civvies carry with them. Getting rid of arms is simlpy naive.

This arms dealing has been going on for many years knowing what really happens after selling them to a country where they use it within the country and to the country that sells them.  Do the sellers really care what happens after selling them?  My answers is no. As long as the business deal goes well who care what really happens. Same with oil. You give them weapons they give you oil. When killing started some how the ears go deaf and eyes goes blind.  One can never stop where greed over takes the morale value

The only answer i have to this question is that the making off all weapons is stopped, but as we all know this will never happen... why are weapons needed for if there where no guns in the world, there would be no full on wars, no school shootings, no gang wars to the extent they are at now... life would be a better for all... but the money made from arms dealing is too vast and involves too many different nations for there ever to be a total trust, it would be impossible to prove that each and every country has stopped their manufacturing of weapons... but until this time unfortunately millions will lose their lives because of a few power hungry leaders

The arms trade has disastrous impacts the world over, and has even managed to show its ugly head in Oxford in the guise of the Said Business school. Oxford Universities new Business school opened in 2001 was mostly funded by Wafiq Said, a Syrian with links to arms dealing who fronted £20 million of the £45 million needed to build the school. 
Most of the Said fortune is said to come from arms deals most notoriously the ‘Al Yamamah’ deal in 1986; worth around $31 billion over 10 years it is said to be one of the biggest arms deals of all time. Wafiq Said helped broker the deal between Britain and Saudi Arabia, admitting that ‘I benefited because the program led to construction in Saudi Arabia that involved my companies’. He gained directly from the deal as well because companies like BAe paid him for ‘helping this company fulfil its obligations in the middle east and Saudi Arabia in particular’. It included fighter planes and electro-shock battens used to torture political dissidents. The UK government turned a blind eye to the fact that they were directly benefiting a country which is renound for its human rights abuses especially in the area of criminal justice:

SO THE ANSWER IS - There is no no cure as all governments are corrupt. Where theres money to be made in arms dealing you will never find an honest politician world wide.

My first thoughts were that I think this could be prevented by monitoring the companies/factories that sell/trade them. If you think about it logically, globally there must only be a few manufacturers of such weapons.



Then I slowly began to deconstruct my own answer and supposed that there is actually no right answer. The reason being that even if the manufacturers were monitored, there could easily be a corrupt system of reporting, thus circumventing the purpose of control of such weapons.



It is sad to say but the Governments that allow for the supply and retail of such weapons make a hell of a lot of money and this is the catalyst and instigator of corruption.

May be another relative answer is actually setting up a body, that could be a watchdog. All countries that have these weapons factories could be involved and take part. This could perhaps be a good idea as firstly this would make it difficult and stifle any corruption. Secondly this would be away of ensuring that no one country is a dominant superpower if the countries are all watching each other.



In the interim I would suggest that might be away forward if the countries made a collaborative effort say like the U.N. or may be some kind of convention say like the Geneva Convention but obviously for the monitoring and control of weapons. The monitoring side of things could be a short tern solution. The long term goal perhaps of this anti-weapons trading body is to I think close down and stop the manufacture of weapons altogether. How utopian of me eh?!

Jay Kay, I'm not sure how to answer this as there is no simple solution as every answer can be criticised in that even if a body was setup, there would be the involvement of bureaucracy, also the financial side of things and furthermore who and how would these countries that don't co-operate and break the rules be punished?

Countries that use weapons against there own people often operate this way as there is perhaps little democracy and a lot of corruption. The question perhaps one should have asked is how these people, these mafia type governments exist and get into power in the first place?



I hate to do it… I hate to answer a question with a question but like I said there is no right answer and to find a solution is difficult and I also think anyone that suggests merely that we just stop it is being naive and simplistic as the truth of the matter is each country likes to retain and retail and that’s the way the cookie crumbles (I'm afraid to say and end on a lighter note).

Well I'm not from the UK, but logically, when situations change, it would be permissible to do so, the only issue I could foresee would be a time period between applications, and I don't know what that would be or how long its been.

YES. Although it wouldn't hurt to try to find another flat yourself. The council should make a new assessment based on your current circumstances. In any case there is nothing to stop you making an application - don't disqualify yourself by not going.

Is this one way to help Afghanistan and fight drugs



http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug...
We in the west keep fighting the war against drugs, which ruin lives.  The lives of those taking the drugs, the lives of those who care for them, and the lives of those who addicts steal from.
The article above refers to a bloke who has travelled to Afghanistan and is helping farmers to grow other crops instead of opium (used to make heroin).  Is this the way to fight drugs, by helping people not grow them?

First it's a great story and thanks for the link.

One mans mission and I wish him well. Will it make a difference? No!

Heroin dealers are not going to go out of business if heroin ceases to exist, they will simply diversify into synthetic drugs which is far worse.

In an ideal world the pomegranate crop will never have a bad year, but I will lay odds the farmers in question have cultivated a piece of mountain for poppies as a back up crop.

Then are we intending to subsidise Israeli farmers in the pomegranate market and has the man from Delmonte said, "yes"?

The war against drugs has as much to do with the end user as the supply chain. Nobody is suggesting cutting down Kielder Forest in the hope of stopping magic mushrooms.

This is a way of helping the people growing the drugs today, but it doesn't address the drug problem.

No. 
The obvious way to help Afghan farmers and keep them away from the Taliban is to let them grow poppies and buy the opium.
There is a very large legitimate market for opium to produce legal drugs like morphine. I have even heard there is a world shortage! 
Ideally the drug should be processed in the country to add value and create employment. 
Legitimate trade might solve the Afghan/Taliban problem, it's unlikely to be solved militarily.

Barak Hussein Obama dare not let you see the real man. He, like the characters in his bio, is a composite of many people, his Muslim father, his Muslim Step father, his Communist mentor Frank Marshall Davis, his white Grandfather, His Kenyan Muslim Grandmother. He was abandoned at a very young age by his father, and his mother. He doesn't know who he is. He is as extreme politically as any Liberal candidate Democrats have ever fielded, and then some. In other words Obama has nothing to offer America.  He is a WOLF in sheeps clothing.



At least we know who McCain is and who he will be. That I can deal with, sadly we don't have a decent choice in this election. Neither one is the best leader or even close to presidential. I do not believe in voting for the lesser of two evils. If I can't fully support one or the other, I won't vote at all.

Well the article's author seems to agree with the majority of it as the specific plans that he voted against... for instance it mentions one where the Thunderbay Marine Sanctuary wanted 1.768M for an exhibit...that its not that he is against them but was against plans that called for excessive money in many cases.

The author said it was to McCains credit that he was so steadfast in fighting pork barrel spending even in his own state and that it not just political double-talk.

Yes-and more. I just read an entire brochure put out by the Home Health Care association here in Denver Colorado that outlines what both candidates have done and plan to do in relation to health care. I gave my brochure to a co-worker or I'd be able to give you exact bills McCain voted against. You can add cuts to Medicaid as well-a tax reflief to seniors for prescription
drugs-there is a long list. He is no friend to health care or the poor.

Not what would, rather, what should be happening is we should be in a recession and admit it and stop lying to ourselves.  The problem with bailouts is companies get bought up for pennies on the dollar and with inflation and other measures to keep the economy afloat it is only delaying and worsening the situation.

The markets would be purging themselves and rebound.  These bailouts only delay the fall.  The corruption that caused these companies to fall stretches globally.  We should not bail them out.  Let them fail, teach them to do business in an ethical manner.  McCain will hold wall street and washington accountable.  He will make the crooks famous by publicizing their names.

There is currently no authoritative answer available anywhere.

A full electoral roll is not available anywhere on a website.  For the last few years, even those who bother to complete the electoral return to be included on the Roll have had the opportunity to opt to appear in a reduced register only (which is only made available for election purposes).

Paper copies will be available at a local library for the area in question, but these are in street order.  You are able to photocopy the individual page for a fee, but will need to know which library and which council.

Council tax records are different again. These are never disclosed (lawfully) to the public.  If you can prove who you are to the Council Tax authority, they will, however, let you have a copy of your own record of payment, which will show your address for the relevant time.

<question>



Is it always THIS that can bring down the world?



Isn't it ironic? For years, there have been a number of speculation as to what may bring down the world or take over the world. In the earlier years, some speculated communism, some speculated the coming of 666, some speculated world warming and lately, some even believed the rise of terrorism can have an adverse effect on the world.

However, ultimately, it is the financial crisis that can have an effect on the world. We can be on the brink of another great depression very similar to 1929.

Isn't the situation now fairly similar to the preludes to 1929?

Why must economics always be the greatest culprit?

I think you can attribute that to several different things, beginning with greed.  Most wars are about religion, and that is what the Mideast is going through with radical Islamists, Kurds, Shiites, Sunnis and all of the tribes within those.  No regulation to protect the middle class from the greed of the super-rich and gigantic corporations, which results in our broken economy.  As for another depression...I was born in 1928 and yes, there are some similar situations, plus many new ones!

It could be considered 'ironic' if it wasn't so obviously the linchpin of our relative success in keeping our Western systems working.  It will become ironic if we end up at war w. the East who bought into our whole system except for the 'one world economy bit' and it will take a heart of stone not to laugh when they are rich and we are 'poor.'  Basing economies on lies (eternal credit extension and debt) has the same end results as basing foreign policy and wars of occupation on lies.  It comes home to haunt all players.
This is much bigger than 1929..

I think everyone persues happiness we all just come from different circumstances and life chances and use different methods to reach happiness. Sometimes because of peoples circumstances this involves huring people. The herion addict is looking for happiness and he will plan to hold a bloody syringe to your throat if it gets him there. If it secures their living standards white south Africans will force black ones into townships legally and physically. A poor man mite have to steal your TV to get happiness.

I don't think it's any one thing, and I also think that it's too complex to put into words.  But, I guess that being happy is having a number of needs met, from basic needs such as food, clothing and shelter, to a balance of working and having fun.  And I would imagine that, if there were just one thing, then it would be, to quote a line from a song of a couple of years back, "not having what you want, but wanting what you have!.

Polands economy suffered with collapse of the soviet union and its economy. The entire social system and infrastructure of the nation collapsed and its trading partners dissappeared. Like with collapse of all civilisations economic activity resumed at a lower pace in a primitive form. This was unsuitable for the large population. These nations were often domenated, like russia is, by gangster capitalism. Today the shortage of jobs in poland is becoming less so because of a building boom taking place in poland.

Let's see, employment is a product of a successful business, so basically if the government made it easier for a business to be successful (i.e. get out of the way, lower taxes, deregulation, etc) there would be more employment... oh and more taxes collected.

When a business is burdened with high taxes after they're already experiencing losses, they produce even less, and employment will continue to drop because the business will be less successful.

The problem in this country is that business is over taxed to keep far too many people in non-productive jobs, such as in local government and the NHS (not medical).
This country has over the years lost Millions of manufacturing jobs overseas, so where are all these people employed.
I am not a Tory but I sometimes wonder if private companies would be better suited to running public services at least they usually only employ people they really need.

But when it comes to helping today's and future unemployed I would suggest that the quickest and easiest way to help was to ask many of the economic migrants whose skills are not in great demand to leave the country, who-ever they are and where-ever they came from.

Gordon Brown in my opinion was never the correct choice of leader, but by not calling an election a few months ago his credibility has fallen like a lead balloon. Coupled with the fact that he isn't a great public orator, there is a great fear that the Labour Party will be decimated whenever the election finally comes along.
The debate over his leadership isn't going to go away and the sooner it's cleared up the better.
It may already be too late.

If you understood what caused the markets to fall then you wouldn't have to ask such an asinine question. The housing market collapse is what precipitated this whole mess and that was cause by a democratic congress and president, in Clinton's first 2 years in office, relaxing the requirements for home loans making them easier to come by.  This lead to an over-inflation of housing prices.  When that bubble popped and people were unable to sell their homes before the were foreclosed on it created a ripple effect through the markets. The housing problem still hasn't subsided so our problems will still be with us for a while longer. It started way before Bush was elected so I'm sorry this is one thing you can't blame on him.

a very good question.

There is a very interesting thing about severely bad economic times.

Actually the worst the economic times...the better for the people with lots of money and lots of assets....for you see as the people who are suffering are losing assets and getting pummeled financially, there are some vultures flying lazy circles above them buying up things that people can no longer keep or afford for pennies on the dollar.  You see all these homes that are being foreclosed?  Well this credit crunch they are talking about that is preventing John and Doe public to buy a home is not keeping rich scavengers from snapping them up...and when the house values go back up someday...guess whose assets will multiply.

so yes..in essence destroying your country's economy and sending your people through a depression can actually be very good news for the few elite..who also happen to be ...as he himself prouldy said once.....the few rich and elite are his real constituency.  He really did say that. Look it up.

(EDIT) hey cmdr.....look up Credit backed Derivatives....and who abuse them please. Then look up deregulation of financial institutions.  Finally, look up the Bush adminstration's policy towards regulation over anything at all especially the financial markets.

In world view of the anti-Bush crowd, he is either ultra devious and evil or the dumbest President we ever had.  I wish they'd make up their minds.

The economy would be in a very similar state whether or not Bush was President right now.  Between the lending crisis, and high fuel prices, we ended up with a bit of an economic "perfect storm."

There were definitely other influencing factors that Bush did and didn't do that would have marginally changed the situation we are currently in, but Fannie, Freddie, WaMu, Leehman, and Bank of America were all going to end up like this.  We were on this track since the winter of 1999.

No, I'm not so sure. Politicians don't have power, they only enjoy the limelight they got by selling their souls to whoever paid their campaigns. With George Bush that is anyway the case if you see the pharmaceutical policies he has pushed through in his two terms and why Donald Rumsfeld (ex-pharmaceutical CEO) was on his cabinet and why they went to war in Iraq. The big forces are behind the scene, the best illustration is the oil price that has nothing to do with supply and demand market forces. The money of this world is in the hands of a few and they pull the strings. George Bush is not one of them, put controlled by them.

I personally do not think that George Bush is an evil man.  The world is a much safer place than it was.  Let me also clarify.  The tensions around the world, the stockpiling of arms by militants, the Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan were the legacy he  had inherited.  However, by the time he leaves his office, he would have ensured that the militants do not reorganize immediately nor do they have the power to strike at will at America.

As far as stock markets are concerned, he would not do anything that would affect America or American interests and falling stock shares are definitely not in America's interests.

Only about 5% of the money in this country is printed.  The rest is created by lending institutions; it is just digits in ledgers.  The amount of money that is available is dependent on the interest rates.  That is why the Federal Reserve controls the prime interest rate.

When lending institutions go under, it reduces the amount of money that can be lent and therefore causes interest rates to rise.  This is unacceptable because it takes control of interest rates away from government control.

When the government loses control of interest rates, it loses control of the economy.

I know this explanation may be a bit hard to follow, but I had to compress a lot into a short space.

There's a whole bunch of choices. Nukes could bring an to civilization, if enough of them are launched. A super large meteor definitely could destroy the planet. A local black hole would destroy the Earth in an instant.

But in the short term, I would think nuclear war is most likely to do the trick. Human beings have been fighting wars continuously for thousands of years. It wont change anytime soon. We will be destroyed by our own hand.

Americans need to get a passport and discover the United States isn't the world it's only just a country. The way the financial markets are going down it will be the doom ending of the opinionated, wasteful, money hungry, greedy people who bigot and put down other fellow Americans who are also in the American world.



They will think it's the end of the world because they will have to change there self centered attitudes and lives. To become just like all the millions of hardworking down to earth non materialistic, good American people who also live in the USA.

they should be given a sensible review of the beliefs of others



the science should be taught and time given to learn about other theories

and no it shouldn't be limited to christian or any of the other main ones like Islam, Judaism and Hindu etc but the curriculum is already restrictive of independant thought and mention an earth based or pagan belief and watch the teacher come out in hives and start shaking because they may have to teach a child who has a belief that doesn't fit in the nice boxes on their forms

I dont see the need for it. Religion is a personal choice and the people who have made their choices attend churches and can indoctrinate their own children in those choices and they even have sunday school etc..

So why the need to bring a private matter into a general education curruculum?

Freedom of religion to practice and be of any religion you want is a great thing and a very important freedom but its also a 2 way street.  That freedom also means that others are free from having religion imposed unto them by the state.  This is the freedom that not only allows us to practive faith in peace from persecution but also protects us from theocracy which  is a form of tyranny.

NO one wants to see public flogging of young women who have lost their virginity or forcing young women to not go to school and be homemakers, or wars with other nations that we don't like because of their religions so that we can send missionaries in the wake of the troops to convert them etc...
No one wants to see anyone boiled in oil like the church used to do to those who did not adhere to a strict interpretation of the faith.

The place for God in school is in a class called "Comparative Religion."

In a literature class, particularly a world literature class, the Christian Bible could be used.  There are wonderful, poetic passages in several parts of the Bible, Psalms, for example.

Science class, however, is a different matter.  Evolution is not a theory as the uneducated use that word.  It is not a guess, but a conclusion based on solid evidence.  Look up scientific theory.

I find this whole thing very scary, I had some nuts from the Jehovah witness knock on my door and try to ply this rubbish to me like it was 'normal'.

I was educated by nuns in a catholic school in Ireland, and I was told about the big bang theory, science. The angle they took was along the lines of 'its a miracle it happened as it did, and we should be thankful.  As indeed we should.



Teaching a 'belief' over fact is dangerous, and it would leave me asking 'where the ulterior motive is'? Maybe the answer is blind faith, once you have that you can be made do anything.

Christian, Jewish, Muslim beliefs all just a personal view.  And they are good views, and a great belief system to live your life by.  Which ever one you choose is personal to the individual, and it should be kept that way.



Before I get all the thumbs down I'd just like to say I'm not anti I'm religion by any means. It does a lot of good for a lot of people, but I would certainly draw the line at this.

after reading all the above answers I really DO think that schools should teach about ALL religions. Thats what I had in my school.

If you leave all religion out of school and let the parents teach the children, I am slightly concerned that the only views the children will get is the views of the parents. If the parents are of the increasing number of racist, poorly educated people, then their children are going to grow up with exactly the same views.

Too many people don't understand the many religions in this world - i think that making all children aware of as many other religions as possible can only be a good thing.

Things like when idiotic racists put real pig's head on a Sikh war memorial in my local town, just go to show the real need for religious education!

I think that children should be taught that there are many different ideas. Religion should be taught in RE, with all the religious beliefs, not just Christian. Science should be taught in the science room, and both teachers must emphasize that these are other peoples beliefs that are still being researched and they have the right to choose to believe what they like.

I am not a Christian and strongly do not believe in creationism, but respect other people rights to believe. I think it is greatly important to teach children respect for every ones beliefs.

They should be taught their Joseph Campbell comparative mythology in school. That's where the Book of Genesis goes, not in a science class. Maybe they can also read Huston Smith's "The Religions of Man" to give them a broader perspective on things.

If religion is allowed to permeate the science class, it should only be fair that science should permeate the church.

Seeing as this is an incompatible reduction, I oppose the teaching of God's involvement in the creation of the world.  Leave it in the church where it belongs.

No. Religious beliefs should not be taught in school full stop. Any religion.

That's why you have teachers in schools and ministers/ padres/ priests in church.



You wouldn't expect the priest to teach algebra, would you?

Religion should, in the simplest terms possible, be taught at home and at places of worship. It has no place in the education system.

Schools should be teaching the currently established view. I'm afraid that 'God created the world in six days and on the seventh He rested' is a bog standard ancient creation myth (every different civilization has one) and utterly unbacked by any evidence... not even evidence with flaws in it, as the Big Bang Theory is.

They should be taught that SOME PEOPLE beleive this.  along with scientific theories such as the Big Bang.

Then they can make up their own minds.



Its called freedom of beleif.

Banning religion in school goes against freedom.  Children can only have the power to make up their own minds about what to beleive when they have been taught about all the different beleif structures which exist.

The main difference is that the religion should not be taught with any sort of agenda - ie its no point getting a fundamentalist Christian or Muslim to teach creation theory.  You shouldn't be teaching the kids "This is what happened" but "this is what some people beleive".

Of course.  When you begin keeping some views out of education, you begin creating narrow mindedness, which is exactly what we have.
Every theory should be taught, every single one.  Why on earth would you only teach children one theory and not another?  It's madness.



The thing about theories is that they are just that - we don't know if they are fact.  Therefore you have to teach them all.  If you want a population of intelligent, open minded and educated people who are able to make up their own minds having understood fully the different views, you have to teach them everything.

Nothing should be kept out of education.  All that we know should be taught.  It is disgusting to only teach some of what we know.  The population of this country is largely ignorant to most things.  This is because the education system is selective about what it teaches.

the teaching of any religious beliefs should stay in religious education classes which, in the UK, parents have the right to withdraw their children from. Within RE classes, all religious ideas should be taught - not just the views of one religion.  Religious schools which are not private schools should be banned (in UK some state schools are religious based ie, Roman Catholic mainly but also Jewish and Muslim schools).

Religion and religious beliefs should be kept out of school and only brought up during History lessons so that children can see the devastation, the diversity and the social problems that Religion has caused over the centuries.

Kids who have those beleifs themselves, and not their parents, should be told this, but children who believe something else, should not. There is no evidence, and there is no accuracy on saying how the world was created. The Big Bang theory should be taught in modern times.If some children are of a certain religion, their parents/family/relations should tell them their religious beliefs theory.

He had the right to peaceful protest, to live within a society he felt most comfortable with.
 He had the right to take care of his being.
 He had the right to respect the rights of others
and still he has the right to look for his rights having taken through his teachings the rights of so many other
We the society he thinks so bad gives him the right to be tried by his peers and to pay the price his peers think fit,
 He will exercise his right to disagree with it all but be so glad if he can get freedom if our laws are not strong enough.

You can't use Obama. I mean you could but you can bring the racism element into it but how can you bring the justice. I think when they talk about Racism and justice they are talking about cases such as Sean Bell ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bell (2008?), and Jena six ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_Six ) to point out that it hasn't change talk about certain cases such as Emit Till  ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Till ) (1995)

When Republicans made a box of waffle batter with a caricature of Obama that resembled that of Aunt Jemima, sold it openly at one of their fundraisers and people ACTUALLY bought it, racism is alive and well in the US. I've also received numerous emails which contained either a racist joke about Barack Obama or a racist joke about Barack Obama and African Americans in general. 
Then there's the FACT that Republicans are trying to disenfranchise the poor, the elderly and minorities in America by challenging their right to vote and requiring them to have ID to vote. What groups of Americans are the least likely to have IDs? The poor, the elderly and minorities. 90% of all African Americans vote Democratic. The Republicans systematic effort to undermine our democracy only proves that they don't care about justice, nor do they care about their racist efforts to keep minorities from voting.

people are still racist, just not on as such severe terms, like most white people that don't hate black people for being black, they hate them for copying each other and not breaking the mold. we're now just pissed at them for fighting for all these freedoms and not using them, all i know is that it's sad when i hear people say that they don't want to make alot of money because then the welfare would stop coming in.

You have lost before you start.  If you follow Obama's story as he tells it, his rise into politics was a hand up all the way.  No racism toward him there.  If you look at his current political campaign, he is not only supported by all races, but protected by many.  No racism toward him there.  On the Justice side, I would once again refer you to his political rise as he has told it.  No one has dared to hold him accountable for his associations or even him own words.  Justice has been tilted in his favor ever since he made the deals with the political power brokers in Chicago.

Should we accept the government's decision?



Reading recently about the government's actions on Leaf fundaments, I was disheartened to discover that now there will be a 2% reduction in leveller and transfer rates for initial investors, growing to an almost absurd 4.5% on fruition of the capital sattelite funds. Shouldn't the Chancellor be moving in favour of growth generators such as these so-called 'Generic and Holistic Fiscal-Kinesis' agents recently installed by various finance houses?

Don't worry, Ray we're onto it.



They can expect more help from us than they can from the US, I imagine.  America doesn't even help its OWN people when they are hit by natural disasters (like the people of New Orleans) . . . it was UK personnell and charities which went out there providing emergency medical care and aid, whilst all you Republicans sat there gloating over your bank balances and muttering "not on MY taxes . . .goddamn Creoles shouldda had insurance . . ."

Anyway, don't you have a pig to put lipstick on?

EDIT:  Ray - re: "freebies"

I'm a fairly low income earner as is my husband, we don't currently have medical insurance from our jobs (although I soon will have as my contract is changing and comes with free BUPA cover)  and couldn't afford the £100 a month it would cost to privately insure us in the UK (with a crappy policy).



Yet thanks to the NHS, when I am feeling ill or my child is unwell I go to the doctors and get treated without paying a penny.  As I live in Wales I don't even pay for my prescriptions.  I could have £800 of drugs, if I needed it, for nothing.

My elderly mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer in March - she too is on a low income and doesn't have "health insurance" yet she was operated on immediately and the cancer is now clear.

Now could the same thing be said of a low income family without health insurance in your country?

Yes the freebies are working out pretty well thanks.  I know when I'm sick I will get taken care of.  Unlike a lot of Americans as Michael Moore has told us.

And FWIW I think Michael Moore is a Real American Patriot.  He loves his country and his people and wants to fight for them to get a better deal.  You should be looking up to him not slagging him off.

Even when I get private health insurance with my job (in the next month or so ) I will carry on using the NHS.

Oh dear Ray, now what's the issue? Have you got a little tense over something someone from Cuba,Canada,the UK etc has said to you, or did they pass some innocuous comment about the US?

As regards sending aid to Cuba the offer has been put forward from the British government (which is apparently being considered by Cuba) and a number of UK and European NGO's are already there - I couldn't give you an answer regarding Canada i'm afraid.

Btw, I see you're now claiming you're in Britain, as apposed to Thailand, Hong Kong, Argentina, Chile, Sri Lanka and countless other places (sometimes within minutes of declaring you were somewhere else) depending on your attempt to give an answer more credibility. Really, we'd all find your humourous comments a little more believable if you'd just admit that the furthest you'd actually travelled is when you move your sofa into your front yard to indulge in your own kind of social networking.

Hope my answer helps. All the best.

Are Internet Petitions Valid?



I am having a debate with my father on whether internet petitions are valid or not.  What i think, is that most of them are a bunch of bull, but i think it is possible to have an internet petition that is valid.  I would assume that they verify signatures via IP addresses, but i am having a tough time finding the info on the matter.  So if any body knows exactly how these work, or better yet if you can direct me to a site that can tell me all of the details ( preferably a government site ) that would be great. thank you

Is the US really a free country? Are the policies of the US govt consistent with 'freedom/rights' ?



Im from the US, and I can safely say that this is NOT a free country.



A few clarifications for the post below:

"Although I have used the US govt many times below, the question I have addressed is for the entire US.

I guess I also wanted to point out the inconsistencies in the policies of the US govt, giving 'rights' for things that are not right/dangerous, and vice versa."



The Post:

Americans themselves are nice generally, but its mostly the govt that pisses me off. Kids can have guns at a very young age, and for what? Self protection? Go to some of the southern states, and see how easy it is to get a gun. Go to some of the slums in NJ (in fact, NJ is now almost full of slums) and see how many kids have guns. These kids can be serious threats to societies, only because they want to 'protect' themselves from unforeseen situations. I live in NJ, and I can safely say that the slums of Newark are spreading all over the state. No place is safe anymore.

And the brotherly city Philly has one of the biggest crime rates between the blacks and whites. Talk about brotherly. I still feel black people are not trusted by the whites, even though the whites try to be nice to them, i guess. Blacks are still discriminated in this country.

Not to forget about the rights of women. Women are treated as sex objects mostly, thanks to the misconception that Hollywood has promoted (that if you look sexy and show your bod off, you'll be a 'powerful' person). Don't forget the 'limited' role of women in the running of this country. Hence, this is the freedom for women we all talk about!

The campaign against drugs is an even bigger farce than the women rights one. The govt bans pot, which has a lot of medical benefits for the treatment of people. Alcohol is far more addicting and harmful (and kills your brain cells) than pot, yet it is pot and not alcohol that is banned. Even nicotene is more harmful and addicting as compared to pot. While in Canada, you can drink alcohol when you're 18 and even before that in European countries. People here can only drink it in public when they're 21. Pot is not banned in most European countries and not in Canada either, but it is in the US. Although I dont take drugs personally, is this a free country?

We talk about the freedom of expression in this country, yet when (looking at the minorities) the Iranian president came to Columbia University a year back, he was not even given a chance to speak at the beginning. And who was stopping him? The president of the university himself. The president of the university had already concluded his opinion of the Iranian president before letting him defend himself. And this is the president of one of the best univerisities in the US!!! I believe he should have let the Iranian president make his case , and then should have bashed him for his ideology. I feel minorities are not given proper rights in this country.



I would appreciate sensible responses from Americans and other people.

No this is not a free country.



The government owns all the land, a citizen is forbidden from owning land.  The government controls all the currency, citizens are forbidden from using their own.  The government controls all business, a citizen cannot run a business without government permission and must abide by all regulations.  The government controls all travel, a citizen cannot travel without government permission.  The government controls all farming and agriculture, a citizen cannot decide what he wants to grow and how much of it.  The government decides who can own what firearms and when they can be carried, a citizen must seek government permission to own and carry a firearm.  Does everyone get the idea?

There is not one single aspect of any US citizen's life that state or federal regulation does not touch.  This is not a free country.  Those that believe this is a free country only believe it because the phrase is repeated so often.

Monetarism is more about controlling inflation via interest rates, as opposed to the Keynesian method of controlling it via taxation. The premise of both is the same - inflation is caused by an excess of money in an economy, and the way to control it is to take some money off people. If I have to lose money, I would rather lose it as taxation (at least it gets spent on us via public spending, interest payments merely go to bank shareholders.)

I disagree with you to a point. And by the way, your Doc Martins are still home grown. One of Thatchers best quotes would disagree with your point "The only problem with socialism, is that, sooner or later, you run out of other people's money to spend". If Thatcher and Reagan were still around, this world financial crisis would not be happening.

Oh come on you can't tell me you would'nt have jumped on the money gravy train too given the opportunity. Now apportion blame on us too because as a nation we have set too much store on how many riches we have accured without too much effort either.

Your right we need to address the balance and bring back our own  manufacturing industries but we still need the money men to negotiate the best deals for the raw materials for the manufacture of goods.

No don' t blame Maggie she pulled us out of the mire but Labour has dragged us back down into the Slough of despond.

Balancing the books so that expense does not exceed income is a monetarist exercise in both Economic schools of Free Market and Nationalisation I thought.
The bail out of a companies over trading in speculative products is more of a sign of intellectual bankruptcy than bad accounting. A central pillar of the ideology that supports the 'economic growth' rhetoric is the belief that 'greed' can only be satisfied by keeping a lose reign on 'market forces'.
Political parties are so incestuously paired with enterprise and commerce they have become merely the executive arm of business as usual; experts at deception, cosmetics and presentation when it comes to protecting the interests of the elite and denying the RIGHT of public referenda.
Thatcher merely represents a momentary success in elevating greed to a higher status.in the language of capitalism, which still lingers like the smell of bad breath, in our education system today. Churning out little greedy egotistical animals in a food chain driven by the sentiment of a mad idiot called Darwin who likened the human species to a community of monkeys fighting it out in the jungle in a 'survival of the fittest' pecking order.
International trading directives are in the wrong hands.

Please, as someone who is genuinely scared of a McCain/Palin administration...?



I ask those of you who are confident in or leaning towards a Palin/McCain administration to justify your perspective.  It can be as short or as long as you like, but please, try to justify it.  I am a feminist, a fiscal conservative and social liberal, but I've found extreme difficulty in finding any redeeming qualities in the alternative to Obama/Biden (I like Obama, but I am grossly opposed to Biden, so I'm not fully in support of the Democratic ticket).

P.S.  Ron Paul and other third party supporters, been there done that.  It got us Bush in 2000.  The time to build up a 3rd party is not during the election season - it's during the off seasons.  I'll never vote for a 3rd party member that hasn't been campaigning since January 21st of any off-election year.  You gotta sow the seeds early, or else you're not viable.

<additional details>



Duane L:  You fail.



Homeless in Phoenix:  Yes, I've really thought about this.  It is precisely because of my fiscally conservative values that I am opposed to Sarah Palin.



As far as my views on Hillary Clinton are concerned, you don't know them, so don't pretend that you do.



P.S. Homeless in Phoenix:  someone who is "leftist" isn't necessarily opposed to fiscal conservatism.  Also, you haven't provided a shred of evidence supporting your radical claim that Obama is "the most leftist senator in U.S. history."  I've heard and read that claim by many people opposing (and supporting) many other U.S. senators.



Conner S:  That's about as non-answer as anyone can get.  In the words of Sarah Palin, "Thanks, but no thanks."



X X:  Wow... that is just about the most unfounded statement I believe I have ever encountered.  Supporting documentation, PLEASE!!!!!  Do you even realize that prior to Lyndon Johnson, the Democrats were essentially the Republicans of today?  It was racial politics that caused the big switch.  My elderly Deep South relatives are still Democrats, because they are the legendary "Southern Democrats," that existed prior to Lyndon Johnson's "betrayal" of the whites.  They're just so uneducated that they don't even realize the party lines changed.



X X:  It's pretty obvious you "thumbs-upped" everyone else who agreed with your unfounded position and "thumbs-downed" the one person who disagreed.

Come on people!  I'm serious!  e-mail me!  Talk to me!  Give me real answers.  I want to be convinced!  Since Obama voted in favor of FISA, I'm not a huge Obama fan.  I don't support the federal government spying on its own citizens.  Three decades ago, such behavior got the President impeached.  Please!  Help me see whatever the heck it is that you are seeing... and trust me, mentioning Barack's middle name, or sharing unfounded accusations about him isn't going to help.

The best case I have heard is hes a radically extreme muslim/radically christian socialist marxist commy and don't ask for any proof of that because we don't have any.

Plain and simple the democrats have never been able to defend the country and they have started most wars in the 20th century:
Democrats:
WW I



Wilson an isolationist was forced to fight because of American death due to U-boat attacks.  Had he joined the war in 1914 it would have been over in 18 months, thus saving hundreds of thousand lives!
WW II  Roosevelt an isolationist was forced to fight after Dec 7th.  Had he joined the English in Sep. 1938 he could have stopped the killing/murdering of MILLIONS of people.
Korea,  Truman his sectary of State said they would not defend the Korean peninsula. 3 months later the North attacked.  He did not fight to win and started the Democratic policy of containment (of Communist)  which has lead to untold misery and death in the Cold war.
Viet Nam  Kennedy/Johnson fought with no intention of winning thus wasting 58,000 American and many more N. & S. Viet Namese.
Bosnia  Clinton Bombed the Serbs without any Congressional/UN authority.  He destroyed all the bridges across the Danube and killed 2000 Serbs.  Serbia did nothing to us.
Kosovo ibit Kosovo has been part of Serbia for over 1000 years.
Somalia  Sent in too small a number of troops.  Did not allow them to bring tanks and had the Bangladeshi "back our troops up".  Thus many died and he with drew without Adi.
Republicans:
Granada  Freed America Medical students held by Cuban army occupying Granada.
Panama (Operation Just Cause)  Removed a drug smuggling tin horn dictator.
Gulf War (UN authorized)  Freed Kuwait stopped Saddam's regional ambitions to become a modern day Suleiman.

Because the BNP are generally a bunch of knuckle dragging louts, and really don't do themselves any favours when their members are constantly being caught on camera spouting their right wing nazi leaning tendencies.
It's not just Labour who are endorsing positive discrimination, all the leading politicos will happily suck up to any group if they think there are a few votes in it for them. And if all the top politicians are doing it, then it must be ok, eh ?
The thing that really pi**es me off about this positive discrimination, is the fact that 99% of it is dreamt up by a bunch of white liberal lefties who have nothing better to do. Most people in Britain who are from an ethnic background are keen to distance themselves from anything that singles them out as 'different'. They just want to get on with their lives.
Not only without abuse because of their racial background, but without a helping hand because of it as well.

“All black people will be repatriated, even if they were born here”, BNP leader Nick Griffin told Wales on Sunday in 1996 and he was also  convicted of incitement to racial hatred in April 1998 and according to the 2001 manifesto any black person who commits a crime would also be thrown out of the country, even those who were born here. Thats why the BNP are classed as racists... becuase they are.

Whilst obviously no one should be given or not given a job etc. on the bases of the colour of their skin becuase we are all equal. But it is important to remember that in order to have an equal outcome in society we sometimes need to treat people differently who are in different circumstances. For example those who are single parents get more benefits than couples becuase they are in a more difficult circumstance. Often the colour of your skin can put you in a more difficult circumstance, your a clear example of someone whose views make being black more difficult.



So basically your the cause of what you disagree with... my solution is stop being racist and stop the BNP!

Because the BNP's aim is a whites only Britain, and to remove all non-white citizens from our land. Who stays would depend on race - skin colour - and not nationality. The BNP do not recognise Black Britons - the two terms to them are mutually exclusive.

If you mean have Asian people subjugated the existing population of Britain. then the answer is 'no' - but Britain did that to large parts of Asia in the 19th and early 20th Century.

No, besides colonized not being the appropriate word, I get the drift of an underlying lack of education.
Britain is an Island that has been visited and lived in by all sorts of people from all over Europe, to start with, and later the rest of the world.
Very few people can say they are not the product of foreign invaders or immigrants.
That's how the world works.

While it may be said that Asians immigrate to Britain and may even send money etc home, it can't be said they've colonized Britain. Colonization was the subjection of a country to foreign rule; essentially an occupation by a superior (usually European) military power - we're not ruled by any Asian country, so it can simply be called immigration.

The meaning of the world colonise doesnt just cover migration it requires a certain level of migration and usually exterior force and internal vunerability.  This involves the coloniser taking all the resources and becoming culturally and economically powerful and even dominant(cultural dominance invetibally involves it getting privileged legal status eg revival  + legal stat of hebrew in Isreal/palestine). This is how it is right to say that the Americans Jews and Europeans colonised different parts of the world. Although I wouldnt go as far to say that colonisation is a euphamism for ethnic cleansing the competition between the colonisers and the usual dominance of them means that it almost always involves killing of the former inhabitants of forcing them to migrate. The Asians have moved to Britain, they have even established a cultural foothold but they certainly arent dominant. In fact it is part of Europeans historic legacy that they migrated to the west in the first place since capital, wealth, jobs and oppurtunity have been concentrated in this area of the world by the worlds colonial past.

Isn't Palin's support for the aerial hunting of wolves the embodiment of what is wrong with conservatives?



This may or may not be true, but there is video footage and numerous articles claiming that governor Palin, the potential Vice President of the United States, supports the cruel and cowardly practice of aerial hunting of wolves:



Video:

Article:
http://www.slate.com/id/2199140/



This brings me to my point about Republicans. People who are on the conservative end of the political spectrum frequently extol the traditional American mores of patriotism, bravery, manliness, rugged individualism, and family values. Conversely, the portray liberals of being bereft of such lofty virtues. Yet, neoconservatives like Palin, advocate aerial hunting of wolves instead of hunting them face to face (not very manly) Right wingers, such as George W. Bush, frequently send other people's children, and not their own, to die for wars that they declare (not very brave or patriotic). They willingly take money from government subsidies when it engenders the growth of their business (not very ruggedly individualistic). These Christian conservatives talk about family values, and then nominate a woman into office who would rather spend her time promoting her political career then taking care of the special needs kid that she delivered into this world (not really an example of family values). This is hypocrisy of the highest order, don’t you think?

With wolves being one of my most respected species, I can find no more reprehensible use of taxpayer money than funding the cowardly aerial killing of wolves.  The irony is that the extolled virtues you site, as bravery and family values, are often exemplified in wolves to a greater extent than in many humans.  The hypocrisy you reference is absent from wolves too.



For those who may not be familiar with the culture of wolves, there is a fantastic book: “The Last Wild Wolves, Ghosts of the Rain Forest” by Ian McAllister.  It is an eloquent expression of the value of their preservation.  It is a book that expands one’s awareness of life.

So, the simple answer to your question is yes, Palin’s support for the aerial hunting of wolves is the embodiment of what is wrong with conservatives as represented by Palin.  It represents a selfish, egocentric, hypocritical leadership that ultimately destroys the values that it gives lip service to.  It appears to me that the values represented are only adhered to when it is convenient for their selfish desires.

It was a toss up between you and Humanist. However, I like the way you tied in the aerial wolf hunting, with what I was trying to do in making it representative of everything that is wrong with conservatives.

Nope.  Nothing wrong with that at all.  I think that as humans, we are higher on the food chain than wolves or bears, or rabbits, or any animal, and we should continue to do what we, as humans have done, since the beginning of time.  Hunt for food.  I hunt every year, I fish almost every day, and I shoot ducks.  I eat all of them.  If someone is shooting an animal for fun, and not eating what they are shooting, then yes, that is wrong.  But for consumption, absolutely not wrong in the least.



BTW, I'm voting the McCain/Palin ticket.  She rocks!!  Who else would sell a plane on E-bay? (Someone in politics I mean!!)

And before I get some stupid comments about how I vote, I vote for the person, and whether or not their beliefs are in agreement with mine.  I don't just vote along party lines, and I don't vote for how someone looks or anything like that!!

"Yet, neoconservatives like Palin, advocate aerial hunting of wolves instead of hunting them face to face (not very manly)"
-- and hunting wolves face to face has what to do with anything? maybe it's safer to hunt them from the air than hunting them on the ground? maybe it's more efficient and quicker? it has nothing to do with being "a man".
"Right wingers, such as George W. Bush, frequently send other people's children, and not their own, to die for wars that they declare (not very brave or patriotic)"
-- i'm pretty sure neither of Bush's daughters are in the military, so how would they EVER get the chance to go war? don't you think if they wanted to go war they would enlist? it's not about sending other children to war, it's about protecting your country, which IS brave AND patriotic. and i'm pretty sure the fact that he's a republican doesn't make a single difference in the decision he made-a democrat is just as likely to do the same thing.
"These Christian conservatives talk about family values, and then nominate a woman into office who would rather spend her time promoting her political career then taking care of the special needs kid that she delivered into this world (not really an example of family values)"
-- um how do you know she's not taking care of her special needs kid? do you know for a fact that the kid is back in alaska instead of with her during the campaign but not wanting to put him/her in the spotlight of horribly criticizing citizens like yourself?

sounds like you are very opinionated and you think that every Rebulblican is the same and has the same beliefs on every subject. Um Ron Paul? He was running for president and believes EVERYTHING president Bush does (like pro-life) but thinks it should be up to the states to decide the legality. Maybe you need to look at both sides with n open mind instead of automatically assuming every "right wing" politician is the same.

it because of people like yourself that this country is divided.

This is the epitome of conservatism and their laissez-faire attitude to killing. As long as they don't have to look you directly in the eye it is OK to kill you. Dropping bombs from a mile up and killing women and children is collateral damage and can be easily dismissed.



The problem is that those who take solace from a military that is not brave enough to engage the 'enemy' on the ground squeal when 19 Saudi 'friends' target our cities with planes from the air. Until Americans wake up and realize that humanity doesn't end in North America we can but expect further atrocities.

The European Union..?



I have to write a 100-150 word speech on what the EU means to me. This is what I have come up with (approx 130 words). Please read it and tell me what you think and also tell me what word I should put in the blank!!

(It is to decide who is on my year's team for a competition!)

Fifty-seven years is not normally classed as a long time so it is quite ________ that it took 57 years for the 6 countries of the European Coal and Steel Community to turn in the highly successful, 27 country strong, European Union that we know today.
This union has made it possible for us, the Irish nation, to prosper both economically and financially. It has provided us with the largest single market, in the world, making it easier and more cost efficient for us to import and export various goods.
On a local Irish level, this means that Irish farmers have a larger market on which to sell their produce, meaning that they need no longer worry if there is a large enough market for goods such as beef and dairy products.
On a personal level, the EU makes travelling within the union easier because not only do we have freedom of movement
between member states but we also have the added luxury of not needing to change our money within the union, unless we are travelling to either the UK or Denmark.

Two peaces of advice. I hope you arent offended.



I think the first part of the sentence needs to be in opposition to second part of it:

eg 57 years is a short time in terms of history so it is quite a feat
 OR
Europe not long ago was a continent filled with rivalry and conflict so it is

also i think you should mention the Lisbon referendum.Maybe mention how surveys point out that irish people arent anti-eu. You could also talk about challenges which the EU has faced(the war in georgia, nice treaty, war in iraq, yoguslaiva) and how this is the latest challenge of the EU to accomadate and democratise.

You are been brainwashed I see which makes me very angry
Look at UKIPs website and come up with something more contraversial to shove there f*cking with your mind back in their face
I would end it by saying "brainwashing and having to write sh1t like this is a nefarious symptom of the EU's propaganda wing, the extent of which has not been seen since the days of the Hitler youth". Mention that the EU makes 75% of our laws and if we don't like these laws we can't vote them out as in a democracy because the parliament just follows the bidding of the EU comissioners who are the law makers and are not voted in or out
Screw the competition, show you're an individual and not an EU puppet and zombie to your teachers
If your teachers haven't told you anything negative about the EU or mentioned that  a lot of people despise the EU and why and that this is a valid viewpoint then you are being used as a puppet . Does this not anger you?

Name spelled wrong on voter registration card?



A friend of mine registered to vote, but when he got his voter registration card in the mail, his name was spelled wrong.  His last name, "Luis", was spelled as "Lois"; he must have not written clearly when he filled out the form.



Can he still vote?  How should he go about getting this fixed?  Should he just send in a new registration form?  He hasn't changed his name, it was just misspelled.  All the other information was correct, except the last name.  We are Nevada residents.

I am a teacher. I don't think the cane is the right answer (although it did do wonders in its day). As a teacher I can't imagine causing pain to a child. BUT the system we have these days is absurd - children can not be mollycoddled and need to have some sort of discipline. I worked with a very old teacher once who said that all societies problems today are based on the way children are disciplined in schools. In some ways I agree, but I do not know what the answer is to get children to have respect and know the difference between rights and wrongs....

I am a 71 year old grandmother and went to school in the 40'& 50's when punishments in schools was allowed. I was caned a few times for either talking or not paying attention. Yes it hurt at the time, but never made any lasting effect on me. None of the teachers were classed as sadists because they did punish us. I know that I deserved it. When I told my Mum after school she just told me that I must have deserved it or the teacher wouldn't have hit me. I had some very good teachers and I loved school, I hated to leave it when I had to. So long as the teacher knows where to draw the line and not be brutal, then I can't see any harm in it. One of our teachers couldn't hit us so she sent us along to the headmaster to doll out the punishment. And standing outside his office, which was in the school hall where everyone passing through could see me standing there, was a punishment by its self, as they knew why I was standing there, luckily this didn't happen very often. Some form of punishment should be allowed back into schools, I am sure it would help the teachers.

You have many answers to this but I would like to bring forward the importance of discipline, without the child becomes spoil ed anyway.  The cane is usually the product of many warnings, being kept in, lines, extra homework and what have you. If all that does not work then yes I,m for the cain.  We can see the lack of discipline on our streets today, perhaps the 'cat' or cat of nine tails should join with the cane in later life.  They are both a wonderful deterrent

When caning was around it was abused. If you want evidence see the newspaper reports below, I was a kid at John Kelly Boys School in North London, where the second example quoted happened. I hated the teachers and was happy to leave school at 15, I subsequently went to university and got a good degree. But how much easier it would have been without having to put up with vicious sadistic teachers; the brutalization they engendered got some kids into truly violent behaviour. If you want discipline in society we need stop giving real criminals soft sentences, they look at what car thieves, knife wielding gangs, and drug dealing youths do, and they think – ‘so I may get caught – I get few hours community service’ so what?  If school kids saw what could happen in the ‘real world’ if you broke the rules then discipline would fix itself.

Don't get me wrong, I hope it doesn't happen, but anybody with some sort of investment knows it is not good.

It is no wonder that the bailout is hugely impopular, because in essence, it amounts to taking taxpayers' money to save the profit of large banks, in a "reverse Robin Hood" operation: take it from the poor and give it to the rich so they can continue to turn a profit, on the excuse that "their profit is everybody's gain".



However, if we analyze it from a strictly pragmatic point of view, it is probably true that the consequences of a massive economic breakdown will be much worse for everybody than burning taxpayers' money in this operation, unfair as it may be.



So, in my opinion, from the moral point of view it is wrong, but from the pragmatic point of view, it is necessary.



The finer points in the bailout try to mitigate this unfairness by, for instance, establishing that the banks should return the benefits of to society in general along few years, and the US government would keep tabs on that and enforce that policy. To what extent this will work, it is uncertain, especially because it is difficult to define exactly what "giving back" means in legal terms.



I am not an American, but if my country were in the United States' situation, i'd definitely be supportive of a bailout operation, but would at the same time loathe the idea. It would be a necessary evil. Letting the banks break to "teach them a lesson" would end up having adverse consequences on millions of people who don't have anything to do with the crisis, so in essence we'd be making 1000 people suffer in order to punish 10, and that's harder to accept than any bailout plan.

With a fiat money system and the Federal Reserve all we are doing is making this a worse mess for later.  Home prices are trying to come down according to the law of the market.  The non-liquidated assets are worthless because nobody wants them.  Let the market take care of this problem because in the end it will anyway.  All the bailout will do is tax, indebt, and plummet the value of our dollar further.

If they were to ask me if I wanted to bail out these crooks I say no.  They messed up by not watching how they ran their business.  Why should we give them more money to flush down the drain?  Are they going to pay us back?  No



Are they going to give us part of their profit? No They need to fail and we need a good old fashioned depression to snap the heads of our youth around to see that the world is not all me me me and that a hard work ethic means something.  Is the government going to bail me out?  No If they continue to mismanage their money and fail again what then?  What happened to free enterprise?  Bush wants big business to have a free hand to do as they see fit like not care about their employees and supply them with good health care or a decent wage.  It is fair to go have a work force of part time employees and provide no benefits for them.  So they have had their freedom let them keep it!  Why bother them with the burden of having to answer to any one.  I say let them all fail and wipe the slate clean.  Their own greed has led them down this path of handing out loans with out securing the correct info to make sure that the person could pay.  How dare these greedy ******** ask us for more money!  Are we going to charge the 30% intrest that the credit card companys charge us to keep us as their slaves?  I could keep on with all the ways that I am fed up with government sticking their hands into our business and our pockets but hey I have to go get some sleep so that I may go to my second job to pay my bills that no one is going to pay for me.  Heck I just need a measly $40,000 to bail me out  what do you say can we add this to the tab?

Moore's films are largely annoying and often childish in presentation.



I liked his TV show years ago.  Very childish and very hilarious.  Example: Drove trucks with huge speakers on the street in front of the house of the guy who runs Muzak; played elevator music EARLY in the morning.  Funny.



I keep hearing about lies in Moore's films, but I have not seen them listed.  And I am talking about substance, not the "out of context" that always happens in film editing.

Michael Moore's life revolves around stretching the truth to put a few more bucks into his bank account.
He wrote a book about "Stupid White Men" and failed to note that of his team of advisors, researchers, accountants, production people, etc., the vast majority of them are white men (who are, in my opinon, stupid for being associated with Michael Moore).
You would be right more often than not by assuming that most of what comes out of his mouth is a lie, or not quite the truth.

I'm not sure if you understand that Michael Moore's films are not documentaries.  He has an agenda, and he freely admits that.  He wants to show you a side of a story that he thinks the media is not telling us.



I haven't seen this thing you mention, but I think MM's films are important because they get all of us talking about issues like health care and the war in Iraq, and that is good for our country.  We don't have to agree with him or believe every little detail in his movie in order to benefit from having the topic brought up and having public dialog about it.

Strange. I felt exactly the opposite way. Those lies you speak of seemed to mostly come straight from the horse's mouth - all those people being interviewed weren't actors as far as I could tell, they were all just talking about their own experiences. His research looked extremely thorough. I don't think there was much in the movie that couldn't be backed up by facts. :-)

The bill doesn't pass the House tomorrow.  We're screwed even more.



A good analogy:
You live in a city with various neighbors.  One neighbor vigorously chain-smokes, even in bed.
The neighbor next door to him hoards gasoline in his garage...he's afraid of rising gasoline prices.
The chain-smoker eventually lights his bed and house on fire.  The fire spreads to the neighbor with stored gasoline.  The gasoline explodes into your whole neighborhood.  Houses are now burning all around your home.
Think of the Govt's bailout as trying to quench the fire before it spreads to your home.



Yes, you'll still pay for it.
Yes, the idiot chain-smoker has died and left you a mess.
But, how much could you end up paying if the fire isn't quenched?

The last step is for Bush to sign it. He's pretty desperate though and is likely to sign even with the assorted goodies they added on to make the deal sweeter for the Republican House.



And remember, the cash for this is gonna be part of our deficit, we will borrow it from China initially. The firms that receive the cash are obligated to pay it back under this bill, and the govt will hold the mortgages till they are worth some cash as well. This is a crunch, but not a bankruptcy.

“I am from the government, and I am here to help.”  This is one of the scariest phrases in the English language.  There are some serious problems in our great country; with the economy being the one on everyone’s mind these days, and more government cannot be our only option.  Our leaders in Washington are faced with difficult decisions everyday and I applaud their efforts to fix all of my problems, but $700 Billion more debt is not going to help me or my children.



The average American either does not own stocks or has no idea what they have invested in through their 401K plan.  However, we all struggle to keep current on our mortgage, utilities, car, and credit card payments.  If the government wants to “bailout” someone, I am here ready, willing, and able to put the money to good use – but it is MY money that they want to give me!  They want to take my tax dollars and give it to a company so that it won’t have to face the troubles that most of America is facing – debt.  They want to cover the 7% of mortgages that are in foreclosure and the so-called “golden parachutes” for the executives that funded these bad loans in the first place.  I say, hold the executives accountable for their mistakes.  If I make bad decisions in me job, then I am fired or at the very least reprimanded for my actions.  Wall Street is the only place in the world that I know of that REWARDS incompetence.  These guys were supposed to be financial geniuses but they CHOSE to fund bad loans because they got greedy and now their companies are failing.  Why do they deserve to be bailed out at all?



The general consensus is that the world as we know it will cease to exist unless Washington bails out Corporate America.  Well, if they want to “help,” why not help those of us who are struggling here on Main Street, not Wall Street.  Take ½ of $700 Billion (that’s $350 Billion) and give it back to those who can use it.  The argument against this is that the government cannot MAKE people use money that they send out how they want them to.



Why not?  The government is very fond of vouchers.  Why not send out the money in the form of mortgage vouchers?



There are approximately 135,260,000 U.S. Taxpayers, if 75% of them own their own home, then that is approximately 101,445,000 people.  $350 Billion split between them would be about $3,550 per person.  If that money were sent out to the American people in the form of mortgage vouchers, we could “bailout” the economy for ½ of what the government wants to spend.  The surplus in the average American home that could be provided by these vouchers would fund the stock market – either directly by people investing, or indirectly by people buying more consumer goods.  The banks would receive the vouchers from the government anyway through the mortgage payments and then they would have to do what the rest of us have to do when we get ourselves into a financial mess – WORK HARD AND SACRAFICE UNTIL WE CAN GET OURSELVES OUT OF IT!!!

I am a teacher. I don't think the cane is the right answer (although it did do wonders in its day). As a teacher I can't imagine causing pain to a child. BUT the system we have these days is absurd - children can not be mollycoddled and need to have some sort of discipline. I worked with a very old teacher once who said that all societies problems today are based on the way children are disciplined in schools. In some ways I agree, but I do not know what the answer is to get children to have respect and know the difference between rights and wrongs....

I am a 71 year old grandmother and went to school in the 40'& 50's when punishments in schools was allowed. I was caned a few times for either talking or not paying attention. Yes it hurt at the time, but never made any lasting effect on me. None of the teachers were classed as sadists because they did punish us. I know that I deserved it. When I told my Mum after school she just told me that I must have deserved it or the teacher wouldn't have hit me. I had some very good teachers and I loved school, I hated to leave it when I had to. So long as the teacher knows where to draw the line and not be brutal, then I can't see any harm in it. One of our teachers couldn't hit us so she sent us along to the headmaster to doll out the punishment. And standing outside his office, which was in the school hall where everyone passing through could see me standing there, was a punishment by its self, as they knew why I was standing there, luckily this didn't happen very often. Some form of punishment should be allowed back into schools, I am sure it would help the teachers.

You have many answers to this but I would like to bring forward the importance of discipline, without the child becomes spoil ed anyway.  The cane is usually the product of many warnings, being kept in, lines, extra homework and what have you. If all that does not work then yes I,m for the cain.  We can see the lack of discipline on our streets today, perhaps the 'cat' or cat of nine tails should join with the cane in later life.  They are both a wonderful deterrent

When caning was around it was abused. If you want evidence see the newspaper reports below, I was a kid at John Kelly Boys School in North London, where the second example quoted happened. I hated many of the teachers and was happy to leave school at 15, I subsequently went to university and got a good degree. But how much easier it would have been without having to put up with vicious sadistic teachers; the brutalization they engendered got some kids into truly violent behaviour. If you want discipline in society we need stop giving real criminals soft sentences, they look at what car thieves, knife wielding gangs, and drug dealing youths do, and they think – ‘so I may get caught – I get few hours community service’ so what?  If school kids saw what could happen in the ‘real world’ if you broke the rules then discipline would fix itself.

The only time everyone comes together, is in national emergencies.



And then only for a very short period of time.



You have two completely divergent political views.



1. Thinks the government should protect you from cradle to grave.
2. Thinks individuals are smart enough to make their own choices.



They will never come together.

So if the dems take guns back, then the right will have nothing.

I really don't know what you're getting at. Post-debate was nothing but analysis. The liberal analysts said Biden won, the conservative analysts said Palin won. The rest gave their opinion. There is no unifying CNN figure that you seem to think exists. Almost all of the commentary on CNN consists of members from each side, I don't know how it's possible to think CNN has a single unanimous mindset.



Why do news organizations have to pick sides? Not every news organization cares, in fact CNN's been pretty neutral throughout this process. Fox and MSNBC are partisan jokes.

If they want it they should have it.



It would also be nice if Texas and California and New Hampshire and Vermont could have independence from the US, and if Quebec could have independence from Canada. And maybe Ireland should be 2 countries, and maybe Iraq should be 3 or 4. And Taiwan and Hong Kong and Tibet could be free of China. Devolution is where its at! Who needs to be ruled even in part by people who live in some far-away place and have different needs and motivations than you do?



Conversely, how would you like it if the British Isles became a protectorate of the US? Or if North Korea annexed South Korea? What kind of sense does that make?

Scotland is a voluntary member of the union. The Scottish electorate have the right (they have always had the right since act of union in 1707) to leave the union at any time they choose. Scotland should be independent as soon as the majority vote for it. (but ONLY if the majority vote for it).



It really annoys me that some english people seem to think that it is up to england to decide whether we should have independence or not. I wish they would take even just a few minutes to at least try and understand how democracy works within the United Kingdom.



Historically, (in 1707) it was England who needed Scotland to join them in the union, not the other way around. England could not have risked a Scottish alliance with the French as this would have meant almost certain destruction for the English nation. The situation is different now but the United Kingdom would be weaker without Scotland as part of it. The idea that Scotland could not manage its own affairs is ridiculous. The global trend towards self-determination has shown the success of many a poorer nation than Scotland thrive following their own independence.

It's an act of desperation from a discredited administration. This man is a proven liar, has been sacked twice and has done nothing for anyone except himself. The sooner we have a General Election the better.
This Government is so lacking in moral backbone that it is also trying to politicise the sacking of Sir Ian Blair - by common consent the worst Metropolitan Police Commissioner for decades. Just because they didn't have the bottle to do it they really shouldn't criticise someone who has.

Mandleson has been great for the UK in Europe, as well as a brilliant trade commissioner.



He is however a slime ball.  I hate him more than anyone else in politics, and that includes George Dubiya Bush and Nick Griffin.  The man can not, and should not be trusted.  Ever.



Tainted with sleaze, not once, but twice.  Looks like it is going to be a third time now he is a position of power.

I would remind the asker of the question that a European Commissioner is required by Treaty (going way back to 1957) not to put their home nation's interests before that of the Union as a whole; otherwise it would be no better than an imbalanced free trade bloc.  The EU is emphatically different from that.

I'll take Obama's experience AND his character, temperament, judgment, and integrity over McCain's experience in selling out his country, his volatile completely out-of-control temperament, his utter lack of good judgment and grasp of reality, and his corrupt lack of scruples or integrity ANY day.

We live in a Country that is now uneducated enough to believe being a Senator gives more similar experience for President than being a Governor does. Seems to me most people that think that way do not know what a Senator or a Governor does. This will be like the third time in our history that we put a Senator in the Oval Office. One could even be a Junior Senator. Simply pathetic. We ignore the State Senate experience because it is even less relevant as experience to be President than U.S. Senate experience.



Vote. For someone, anyone with actual experience because Neither of the 2 major Candidates have it.



Free One: Where do you get 10 years as a Senator? OMG. He has been on the Senate for about 3 1/2 years. 2 of which he has spent running for President. The state senate and his time as a Community Organizer do not count. Not even! Telling someone else to do research. Priceless.



Your 10 year comment is totally misleading. State Senate experience is not even the same as The U.S. Senate. You grouped it all together as to suggest 8 years as a State Senator is somehow the same as U.S. Senate. It is laughable and you know it.

Ah, Kevin B: I put my source at the bottom of my comment, so look before you accuse me of not doing my research. 8 years in the Illinois State Senate plus 2 in the U.S. Senate equals 10.  People only like to talk about his 2 years in the U.S. Senate and ignore the State Senator position.



Regarding Obama: 10 years in the Senate is not a 'little experience".  He  also serves on 3 out of the 4 Foreign Relations Committees. "He is the Chair of the Subcommittee on European Relations and serves on the Subcommittees on African Affairs; East Asia and Pacific Affairs; and International Development and Foreign Assistance, Economic Affairs, and International Environmental Protection. This cross-section of subcommittees places him in a unique position of having knowledge about Asian, African and European issues.
He has visited Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan in Asia; Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, and the Palestinian Territories in the Middle East; and Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa in Africa. Obama has also co-sponsored the "Lugar-Obama Act" with Republican Senator Richard Lugar who was Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations at the time."
Do more research, cowboy...his life experience is extensive and admirable.  He's also spent more time trying to help the poor (in Chicago) than George Bush has spent reading the comics (and that's a lot of time).  The list goes on and on...do some disciplined research yourself.

Experience is an important factor but it isn't the only factor that should be considered. Look at Bush he was in politics as early as 1978, and you see what a mess he made. To me, it is not that important how long you were doing a certain job, what SHOULD be important is the amount you accomplished and what you will accomplish in the future.

I seem to remember reading him recalling the visits (he met with Saddam twice) in one of Bob Woodwards books. Woodward has interviewed him a few times. Sorry - I can't remember which book it is.



The reason was the supply of weapons. And it also probably extended to supplying satellite intelligence. USA was keen to support Iraq's war against Iran. When Iraq seemed to be winning - I understand USA then started supporting Iran as well - as they didn't want there to be a clear victor who would command the whole of Iran and Iraq.



USA's original position was they supported the Shah of Iran - then came in the revolution and USA was hostile (Iranian hostage crisis).

At the time America sold guns to Iraq there was a bigger threat , Iran, that was at war with Iraq. The sale happened a few years after the American Hostages were held for months by Kohmani and his group of student extremist. I do not agree with the means to the ends but it has been common practice since the beginning of the United States. The country often takes a position of neutrality but it generally still sales arms to the side it would rather win.

if  your  name  was  on  a  list that  was  meant  to  be  confidential,  lets  say  a  voters  list and  your vote was  made  public to  those  who  would then  find  you  to  be  an  embarassment. lets  say  you  lost  a  promotion  as  a  result  of your  party  allegiance.



If  this information

Given the seniority of this high position and the level of responsibility that goes with it I would say it was fair enough. They can pay him what they like, I'm just glad that he's going.

No, I do not think they have it yet...but it is probably a matter of time whether they build one themselves or they get it from somewhere else.



I will say this, if they do use the bomb on Israel, well...the entire mideast will be turned to a sheet of glass in the fallout because Israel DOES have "the bombs (plural)" and you do NOT want to push Israel into a corner in a war for their existence.

Definitely not! We are a country, that aside for differing culturally and economically, also differ in our political and ethical views.



I find this question extremely offensive and demeaning. We are not simply a country to the north. We have our own constitution, rights, culture, heritage and identity. For you to suggest that we are simply 'a state' is ignorant and arrogant. I for one, would never want be associated with the USA for this reason: People like you.

The banks stop lending money because they can't borrow it.



So - no loans for cars, no mortgages, credit card limits don't go up or are reduced, innovation doesn't get any funding, corporate lines of credit are cut ( no payroll money for small businesses), etc, etc.

Some banks might fail, stocks will probably drop and people will seriously re-evaluate what they are spending money on. Which is something we are long overdue for already.

Businesses and people would find it hard to get loans.  Some more banks would fail and be sold off and the economy would slow way down.  The bail out will be worthless if it doesn't stop the practice of making loans for more than the property is worth (which they do with cars and houses).

The people responsible for the 'crisis' might be held responsible.



People who bought homes they could not afford would lose them.



CEOs of big financial corps would get less than multi-million dollar bonuses.



Several democrats would get a whole lot less financial support from the corps they were supposed to protect.



Foreign investors would take their losses and learn that speculation is high risk.



Other financial institutions would learn that greed and mismanagement are NOT good, and they may restructure their businesses to be ethical and profitable,



The government would not own a stake in 70% of American homes.



That's enough good reasons to start...

The bail out bill is like a "debt consolidation" line of credit on your house.  So, if you were to max out your credit cards, then finding it difficult to pay them off, you borrow money using a second mortgage to pay off said credit cards.  If you do not change (and the vast majority of people do not) your way of spending, then you will once again max out your cards, plus now you will also have to pay the second mortgage.



All this to say, what Wall Street needs is a credit counseling course, not a tax payer financed buy out.  They need to make a sea change in the way they operate, or we will be right back here in very short order.

Does the role of the media goes out beyond its boundaries, nowadays?



While the legislators are crafting resolution for the 700 phuck bail out plan, maybe its time for them to legislate one that will reign on the media. More often than not their irresponsible comments and braggadocio just muddle the real issues, oftentimes arousing fears and panic. Its time to regulate and reeducate this people for responsible journalism.

putting  boundaries  on  the  media  is contrary  to  the  first  amendment in  the  first  place.  they  are  supposed  to  be  free  to  exprress  anything  they  feel  the  people  have  the  right  to  know.



people  who  arent  doing  anything wrong  are  typically of  no  interest to  the  press  unless  they  are  celebrites.  in which  case  they  live  and  die  by  the  media and  must  accept consequences  their  actions  may  bring.

So speaks the words of fascism.



The media is there to keep the government honest, to ask the questions that the government would just as soon not have to answer and point out the other side of the coin when the government wants to go a way that may not be wise.



If the government has such a great idea in a new piece of legislation, LET THEM PROVE IT.



So far, on the bailout issue, the government has preached the politics of fear and hasn't proven a thing.



Had the media been doing a proper job, Bush could never have got you into that stupid war in Iraq.

Maverick was the family name of a rancher in Texas who did not brand his cattle.  Be it for PETA type reasons, or something else.  So when other ranchers came across unbranded cattle they were considered a Maverick, or belonging to the Maverick Ranch.  Get your facts straight.

For the record there is still a maverick family out there, and they are appaled that the rich history of their family name has been politisized by McCain.  The only reason this is a word is because of the Family...It is a FAMILY NAME

Sarah Palin never gave a clear answer to anything. She also proved that Biden is right about McCain being just another Bush.
Palin also seemed frightened the whole time. She also did not take things in the serious manner they should be taken. She killed it by saying "Ya darn right" a million times.



She also killed herself and McCain with the war topic.

I found Palin's manner of speaking to be very annoying.  Cutesy-Fargo-folksy sorta thing that just came across as condescending and/or as if she was talking down to grade school kids and/or as if she really didn't take anything very seriously.  Became very annoying after a while.  Other than that, the debate didn't make much difference.

I don't hate anyone, but he annoys me with his constant habit of cutting people off in mid sentence to tell them how stupid he thinks they are. No he does say it that way, but the inference is clear in his methodology. My solution, I just don't listen to him. The last conservative commentator I really liked was Tony Snow. The reason was because he always seemed pretty fair in his criticisms and allowed people to make their points even when he didn't agree so long as they did it in a civilized manner.

He's been accused of being a "far right" guy, and he's made it clear that his producers keep accurate records that show he gives both sides fair time and access.



HE is clearly a conservative, but unlike the Liberals on the other networks, Bill O let's others speak for a fair share of time.

Shall we compare gaffes ?



I think it's fair to say that Biden's biggest gaff has been confusing FDR with Hoover and TV with radio. McCain's biggest gaff was not realizing Spain was an ally. ( I know, I'm comparing top of ticket to bottom of ticket, but it's relevant in that each is their tickets foreign policy expert)
Please don't bother if all you have is bashing either guy, I would actually like to read reasonable opinions as to the question I asked.
Thank you



</question>



<additional details>



Even when you bother to ask for someone with an actual answer and not a mindless bashing. (and in the case of the first answer an ignorance revealing lie) You still get so many "bash the other guy" statements irrelivent to the question posed. Come on people, if you don't have the mental fortitude to answer a simple question, you should be busy studying, not killing time on YA



C Grahame. My apologies About the "Ignorance revealing lie part" I missed the context at first. ( couldn't delete that part.) I see now that you weren't nessicarily believing the lie that He is a Muslim, but were refering to a gaff. However the question was about two specific gaffes, niether of which was one of Obamas.

National Convention on Water Democracy



National Convention on Building Water Democracy, Resisting Water Privatization, 1 st and 2 nd February 2006 at Indian Social Institute, Lodhi Road, New Delhi, Organized by Navdanya/Research Foundation for Science Technology and Ecology



A National Convention on Building Water Democracy, Resisting Water Privatization held at Indian Social Institute, Lodhi Road New Delhi organised by Navdanya Research Foundation for Science Technology and Ecology on 1 st and 2 nd February 2006.



Convention was opened by Dr. Vandana Shiva – Director, RFSTE who addressed the crisis our rivers and waters are facing. The combination of pollution, diversion through dams and privatization is killing our rivers and water bodies. One indication of this crisis is the refusal of people to bathe in the holy Ganga at Allahabad during the Maghmela because of the pollution which has increased after the damming of Bhagirathi at Tehri.



Dr. Shiva stated that if our rivers die, our civilization will die. Dr. Ramaswamy R Iyer, Former Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India showed that the mega projects that are killing our rivers are unnecessary in a country as large as India with more than a billion people. Decentralized systems of water conservation and management are the most effective means to provide water for all. Movements engaged in rejuvenation of water resources shared their experience of success, can bring dead rivers and water bodies to lives.



Leaders of the water renewal movements like Mr. Anupam Mishra of Gandhi Peace Foundation, Mr. Rajendra Singh of Tarun Bharat Sangh addressed the Convention. Sessions in Peoples’s Alternatives for Water conservation and rejuvenation were addressed by Mr. Manu Bhatnagar of INTACH, Dr. Anil Gautam and Mr. Ayan Biswas of Peoples Science Institute, Dehradun.



Sessions in Building Water Democracy in Ganga and Yamuna were contributed by Mr. Sunderlal Bahuguna of Chipko Information Centre, Tehri, Prof. Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, Vice Chairman, South Asian IUCN, Prof. H.C. Nainwal, Reader, HNB Garhwal University, Srinagar, Uttranchal, Commander Sureshwar Sinha of Pani Morcha, Mr. Shantanam Seth of Ahimsa Trust and United Nations Volunteer Programme, Mr. Vimalendu Jha of We for Yahuma.



The Convention has also had the first screening of film “Ganga from the Ground Up”, The film “Jijivisha” on the death of the Yamuna was also screened.



Sessions on Resisting Privatisation was addressed by Prof. Banwarilal Sharma – Convenor, Azadi Bachao Andolan, Mr. S.A. Naqvi of Water Workers Alliance, Dr. Sudhirendra Sharma of the Ecological Foundation.



The National Convention condemned the attempt to privatize and commodify our precious water resources through World Bank driven water sector reforms. Different states like Rajasthan and Mahararashtra are creating new Water Policies and Water Laws declaring water a state property, which can then be converted into private property. We demand that these policies and laws be changed to recognized water as people’s common property. We will build movements of water democracy to protect water and people’s right to water.



The Convention resolved to defend water as a living resource, a gift of nature, a fundamental right of all, water is not a market commodity. It is not a Sate property. It is nature’s most vital resource, a common property, a basic need. It must stay under the control of society, which dedicates to itself to its conservation. This is Jal Swaraj, This is Water Democracy.

Because soon there will be several million more hungry and homeless.  This bailout isn't going to fix anything.  The SEC has an insured debt of between $60 and 70 trillion dollars.  To say that they aren't sure about a $10 trillion dollar spread should tell you something.  This is really bad people.

The bail out is ostensibly to prevent the economy from collapsing, because if there was a depression (and there probably will be one at some point anyway) then there'd just be way too many homeless people to feed and clothe. Things shouldn't have been allowed to get to this point anyhow... so your question is still a very good reminder of that.

Because if you want to encourage an activity you subsidize it.  Start giving free clothes and food to the homeless and I can guarantee you one thing.  You will have a lot more people that are homeless.  The more government programs you have to "help" someone, the more people who want that help you create.

Because we are already throwing good money after bad.  At least this money should keep businesses open while we go through this recession.  Throwing money to the poor and homeless without jobs is like giving a man a fish every day without teaching him how to fish.  He will always be there needing a hand out.

The buy-out package was never about fixing the problems of the country or our economy. It was a gift to the corporate overlords.



If Congress really wanted to fix the mess, it would have worked from the bottom up, not the top down.



If Congress had given every taxpayer $1 million:
Most people would have enough to pay off their mortgages, thereby eliminating the foreclosure problem, and pay off their other debts like car loans, student loans, etc..., providing that "liquidity" to back to the banks, which would then have opened up the credit markets.
People would have had enough to purchase some "big ticket" items like appliances and TVs, which would have increased demand in the manufacturing sector, and increased employment.
People would have stashed some away, increasing the national savings rate.
People would have bought stocks, or invested more in their retirements funds, thereby bouying the market.
And it all would have cost less than $300 million.



Make no mistake, by subsidizing irresponsibility on Wall Street, by socializing the debts and borrowing money from China to prop up our economy, we are doomed to failure.

Does it make more sense to have the Government print their own money rather then a privately owned bank?



I mean from my understanding when the privately owned banks (Federal Reserve)  print money they also tack on interest rates and gain more power than even the Government. If the Government printed it's own money there wouldn't be interest rates. Now I understand printing money shouldn't be the answer because it causes inflation, but as long as their going to keep doing it at least make sense of it and have the Government do it.

The government does control the money from printed by the bank. Over time, the Federal Reserve has become much more private. Because of this, two people basically have control of all money in the country, the Secretary of Commerce and the President of the Federal Reserve. It's convenient that you quoted Jefferson, because although he was opposed to the bank, since it had already existed, he took advantage of it and made the largest purchase of property with its bank notes. Jefferson was opposed to a national bank and speculation. Jefferson as president used the national bank to buy a huge mass of land from the French, called the Louisiana Purchase. He then took this new acquired land and gave it to speculators. I am not discrediting Jefferson from making this decision, but I am noting that you can only take everything that a power seeker says as a grain of salt. Most people change when they actually gain power, at least to some extent.

<question>



Obama is currently challenged in court to produce a vault (original) birth certificate.  Why won't he?



He isn't producing it.  Instead his people have filed for dismissal.  If he has nothing to hide, it would seem that he would submit a real, physical, original birth certificate for the courts examination.  (Not the picture of a birth certificate that used to be on his website).



Odd, no?



He is running for president of the United States.  I can't get a job that pays 12 dollars an hour without producing an original birth certificate.  Does it not make sense that he should be grilled even harder?



http://www.obamacrimes.com



</question>



<additional details>



He didn't submit one.
And if he was born in Hawaii, the law says he has to prove it. He hasn't yet.  Why are you afraid?



Definitely not a rumor.  The attorney is Phil Berg.  If you did your research, you would know this.



1096, he hasn't shown his birth certificate to the court.  He has had ample time.



Those pictures of a supposedly legitimate birth certificate on factcheck would not have been sufficient for any of us here in the real world to show to any government agency if we were trying to get some special licensing, etc.  Why should it be sufficient for Obama?  They are pictures, and I'm sure I don't have to mention Photoshop...



sub, there is one messiah, and Obama is NOT his name.



I am not fooled, and cannot be bought with bribes.  What fools people are to even believe Obama in the first place.

Haha, I love all these people who dismiss this as already being refuted. If it were true, we would have heard about it on the news....lol! Good one. The fact is, if you research for yourself, you will find that this matter has not been resolved and a legitimate birth certificate has NOT been provided. The copy of the birth certificate Obama has provided doesn't have an official state seal or a signature. The same question was asked of McCain, and he provided the evidence, and the case was dismissed. We are not seeing that here.

For those that saw Hannity's America tonight on Barrack Obama ?



I felt is was very interesting and filled in a lot of blanks. But it is not over yet.



This is only for those who have watched the show.



What did you think? And what would you like to see in greater detail?



I still like to see his college records and thesis.

A thesis that had to be publish does not get thrown out. My final thesis and project is still on record at the school I went to 30 years ago. It is on Micro Film but it is still there. My project of a 1 million volt tesla coil is still on display at the school too.



Take a look at the link some one sent me above.



It is also a matter of record the republicans tried to regulate Fannie Mae and the Democrats blocked it . But you guys don't believe that either even though it is public record.



I read his books and I do not trust Obama. He is not a good character I can feel it.



Yes I am smart. Smart enough to see a sham. If Obama wins in 6 months after he takes control of the office you will see
what I mean.

TRhank you for you 2 cents. You opinion has been recorded and I trust FOX News more than I trust Obama. Maybe you were not alive when Professor William Ayres bombed the buildings. but had I had my way the S.O.B. would have been executed.  Here is a note for you, Here was protestingf a war that was started by Democrats.

There is not much known about Obama. I remenber when this would have been enough to make votes say no way. I don't think he is the anti christ. But I do believe he will finish the job Willian Ayres started.
I also believe the destruction of the USA will come form inside.

It reminded me of Hitler and the way he deliberately and recklessly excited hatred and violence. It's a new low in American politics. I've been planning to vote for McCain, but now, I may vote for Obama just to protest such cheap shots, or I may not vote at all. Sickening. McCain has some good points and he should run on them, not on this sleazy, morally bankrupt vile that Hannity and Palin and the other designated attack dogs are spewing. I hoped for better from big, bad John. Say it's not so John.

Here is a link about his thesis and several follow ups from AUGUST.



http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2...



I was absolutely stunned at the level of smear of this special.  They connected Obama to every major radical figure in the last 30 years--even as "friends of a friend" type association-come on it's even beyond the "6 degrees of Kevin Bacon" game.  However, in such muckraking even if someone believes just one of this scatter gun style throw EVERYTHING at the guy and hope something hits type of strategy it will have succeeded.  This special did nothing but play on peoples deepest fears and that is exactly what is needed to win support back to the GOP ticket right now.



There has NEVER been a person without a human background in this world.  Imagine what the media could dig up on yourself and think of how many things you have said or done that could easily be taken out of context.  Being a public figure you will meet tons of people that are good and bad.  Part of politics is to be nice to everyone (at least on the surface)  Smearing to bring down another person starts to polarize people--Divide and conquer right? When we separate into us vs them, very dangerous and bad times lie ahead.



Why not try the radical idea of  winning votes by being clear about the policies that the candidate will stand for and actual facts of plans for the changes that both parties wish to make? But it doesn't work like that because mud sticks better.



The end of the show even tried to blame the poor for intimidating bankers into giving them loans without good credit and that's why we are in this crisis...let us pity those bankers who must have been shaking in their boots from threats of the poor and were forced to give  them loans (at ridiculously high interest rates and the banks/credit card companies happened to make HUGE profits)  Do you really believe that it's the bottom up ---the poorest of the poor--who have really caused all this economic crisis?



YOU ARE SMARTER THAN THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Wall Street now runs through Washington.?



Beginning in January, the House and Senate will hold a series of hearings to determine what caused the current financial crisis, and what reasonable regulations will be needed to prevent it from happening again, said Democratic leaders.



In addition, lawmakers will wrestle with what sort of institution replaces the now US-owned housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Mr. Frank.



"We have to rewrite housing finance in America," they claim
Instead of periodic government audits, they now face the prospect of dozens of regulators from the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency working permanently in their offices, peering into their business all the time.



So what does this all mean for the free market system? Have we seen the end of capitalism itself?

Why don't they stop the market from crashing and do something?  Cut interest rates right now.



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I think Paulson had announce that he will be stepping down after this year. Bernanke may follow as well after the mess the two of them made of the stock market. To them they really don't care!  after the bail out bill was pass into law which provide them protection for any law suit it doesn't matter who will in their mind.



Well that was their job to prevent the market to get into this kind of mess and see it grow rather spiral downward. the interest rates are low and have been for a while. I think this was cause the train wreak in the first place.



as long the interest was low more loans that the banks can approve and the house market prices continue to soar. if they had step in and start to rise the interest rates after a few cycle (9 months) and let the house market settle down for a while (9 months) before they lower the rates again. you just down want to let things get out of hand until it too late to do anything about it.

This financial crisis is more the fault of the democrats than the republicans.  While I have never defended Bush, in this case, it isn't his fault.  This financial mess started in 1977 with the Carter administration.  It was pushed along more by Clinton signing the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act that was put into effect after the Great Depression to prevent another depression.



Clinton said it would be a problem, Bush tried to make a new commission to oversee Freddie/Fannie, and McCain was co-sponsor of a bill that could have stopped what has occured but the democrats said it would prevent the poor from buying homes.  This is all well documented.  They both destroyed America.  Wise up and become an independent and vote all these career politicians out of office.  I don't know how anyone could stick up for either party at this point.

Ok- I just asked a question- HOW DID HE DO IT?  What exactly did he do- Specifics
Because I could say the same thing about the Democrats.  (except I can give specifics)



For instance-



In 1977- 78 The Carter (D) administration thought it should be the right of anyone to own a home. He did some mild legislation to make it esier for low income people to get one. Then in the Clinton Administration it was given steroids. This was based on a mistake in a Harvard Study that 'proved' subtle discirimination was a practice in the housing market because a black man with $10 million in assets was denied a $60,000 mortgage and a white man got it. Later they realized that the Black man only had $1000 in assets, but who cares about accuracy, right?



Well, have you ever seen those little EHO things? That's what came out of all of this. Banks started giving loans without proof of income for fear of the government messing them up by pointing the finger and yelling racist at them. A lot of people got loans that had no business getting them. Well, add to that the 0% interest loan. People saw they could buy a house that was WAY out of their price range at a low monthly price. The governemtn TOLD them to make these so everyone could own a home! Unforetuneatley the interest started kicking in. This was called an ARM- Adjustable Rate Interest. Well- This raised their mortgage so far taht they just couldn't pay anymore, and the house was forclosed upon. Enough of these and all of a sudden the banks had all this debt that wasn't being paid, which cause foreclosures.



Now, I realize the republicans had their part in this fiasco, the congress from 2000-2006 was basically worthless as far as republicans go, However, it was mainly Democrats that put us there in the first place.



Now, one of the biggest lenders was a sorta government sorta private set of companies called Fannie may and Freddie Mac. Yeah. They had these CEOs that took all of these bad loans because all it showed on the books was the fact that it was a loan. Loans mean income, and income is good. This gave the CEOs VERY large bonuses, so of course they wanted all of these bad loans- it lined their pockets! People like Obama's advisor, Franklin Raines . He got about $50 million from it. Jim Johnson also got rich- He also woks with Obama.



McCain tried to reform this whole thing (it's on record) but was stopped by the Democrats.

I am very concerned that most Americans think the Democrat and Republican parties are actually significantly different from each other!  Both are socialist and both are totalitarian.  To what degree each party is more or less than the other on any given issue is irrelevant.  There is only one party that stands for responsible freedom and principles.

Yahoo's programming will automatically delete questions if they're reported by enough other users.



Yahoo has an email address, where you can send an appeal and ask for the question to be restored.  In a day or two, some sort of actual human will read your appeal.  If they think your question was deleted unfairly, it will be restored.



Not that anyone would ever see it again anyway, but that's the system they use.

Where to begin? Narcissism is the ultimate factor if I'm not mistaken.



Lack of empathy for others. Lack of wanting to do good for the world and not just yourself. Lack of mercy. Lack of vision. We are stuck in short-term views. We are stuck at helping ourselves at the expense of others. We are out of balance.



The problems are in both parties. Look for the candidates in each party that support our Constitution.

This financial crisis is more the fault of the democrats than the republicans.  While I have never defended Bush, in this case, it isn't his fault.  This financial mess started in 1977 with the Carter administration.  It was pushed along more by Clinton signing the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act that was put into effect after the Great Depression to prevent another depression.



Clinton said it would be a problem, Bush tried to make a new commission to oversee Freddie/Fannie, and McCain was co-sponsor of a bill that could have stopped what has occured but the democrats said it would prevent the poor from buying homes.  This is all well documented.  They both destroyed America.  Wise up and become an independent and vote all these career politicians out of office.  I don't know how anyone could stick up for either party at this point.

<answer>



Ok- I just asked a question- HOW DID HE DO IT?  What exactly did he do- Specifics
Because I could say the same thing about the Democrats.  (except I can give specifics)



For instance-



In 1977- 78 The Carter (D) administration thought it should be the right of anyone to own a home. He did some mild legislation to make it esier for low income people to get one. Then in the Clinton Administration it was given steroids. This was based on a mistake in a Harvard Study that 'proved' subtle discirimination was a practice in the housing market because a black man with $10 million in assets was denied a $60,000 mortgage and a white man got it. Later they realized that the Black man only had $1000 in assets, but who cares about accuracy, right?



Well, have you ever seen those little EHO things? That's what came out of all of this. Banks started giving loans without proof of income for fear of the government messing them up by pointing the finger and yelling racist at them. A lot of people got loans that had no business getting them. Well, add to that the 0% interest loan. People saw they could buy a house that was WAY out of their price range at a low monthly price. The governemtn TOLD them to make these so everyone could own a home! Unforetuneatley the interest started kicking in. This was called an ARM- Adjustable Rate Interest. Well- This raised their mortgage so far taht they just couldn't pay anymore, and the house was forclosed upon. Enough of these and all of a sudden the banks had all this debt that wasn't being paid, which cause foreclosures.



Now, I realize the republicans had their part in this fiasco, the congress from 2000-2006 was basically worthless as far as republicans go, However, it was mainly Democrats that put us there in the first place.



Now, one of the biggest lenders was a sorta government sorta private set of companies called Fannie may and Freddie Mac. Yeah. They had these CEOs that took all of these bad loans because all it showed on the books was the fact that it was a loan. Loans mean income, and income is good. This gave the CEOs VERY large bonuses, so of course they wanted all of these bad loans- it lined their pockets! People like Obama's advisor, Franklin Raines . He got about $50 million from it. Jim Johnson also got rich- He also woks with Obama.



McCain tried to reform this whole thing (it's on record) but was stopped by the Democrats.

Well, there is a big difference between associating with a business partner who later turns out to be a crook or associating with a person who has a known terrorist past.



Given the latter and the fact that Obama won't even salute the flag, you have to question his loyalty to this nation.  A patriot he is NOT.



And to be president, maybe you should be a patriot; a person running for this office should love his country.

sabrina f you are a hate full loathing person and i hope you don't have a gun but if the party in power is afraid of guns the im glad i have them because that is exactly why the founding fathers wanted us to have them. if we need to over throw.



bama was being misleading when he denied that his handwriting had been on a document endorsing a state ban on the sale and possession of handguns in Illinois. Obama responded, "No, my writing wasn't on that particular questionnaire. As I said, I have never favored an all-out ban on handguns."



Actually, Obama's writing was on the 1996 document, which was filed when Obama was running for the Illinois state Senate. A Chicago nonprofit, Independent Voters of Illinois, had this question, and Obama took hard line:



35. Do you support state legislation to:
a. ban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns? Yes.
b. ban assault weapons? Yes.
c. mandatory waiting periods and background checks? Yes.



Obama's campaign said, "Sen. Obama didn't fill out these state Senate questionnaires--a staffer did--and there are several answers that didn't reflect his views then or now. He may have jotted some notes on the front page of the questionnaire, but some answers didn't reflect his views."

Was Monica Lewinsky an agent planted in the White House to zap Bill Clinton?  ?



Consider hints from Bill and Hillary about how far the Rove team would go to win the power of the presidency. They all seem willing to do anything short conducting a military coup to seize power. I have read the comments Monica made before the incident and all the others. I tend to believe it was carried out to do just what was done. Nothing accidental about it. The point is, these partisans are far worse than most people can imagine.

As a taxpayer, will you be able to work enough to help pay off the bail out and all the trillions of debt?



You will have to work much harder, trouble is they are all agreeing that business will close and jobs will be cut. Maybe Medicare, Medicaid must be cut out. Even Social Security will take a big hit. How about those mortgage bankers and their friends in congress and the MSM like CNN, you think? This could progress from an alarmed public to chaos. Lies and propaganda is at a fever pitch. CNN is leading this propaganda war.

well first of all the idiots for that money have to repay the 700 trillion so tax payers pay nothing. The only thing is that there not sure right now how to price everything for stuff. The recession will still be here til early 2009, it may improve a little but what you have now is gonna stay the same til then. Jobs will come back soon so the end isn't here yet. As long as there no wars for another decade the debt will go down.



Now as to Medicaid, medicare, Social Security already were not gonna get any money cause those three systems are falling apart right now. Were not gonna see any money for our retirement so i don't expect to see those three working when I'm 65. No Cnn is not leading the propaganda they are a news agency which reports base upon the 1st amendment, the real propaganda right now is wall street or washington d.c. where the politicans and the greedy business people are. I blam ethem for the mess that is going on there both to blame for this.



Bush spent 4-5 trillion dollars and never saved money like clinton did. Then everything on wall street fell apart cause last summer when it was at 14,000 everybody bought things they couldn't repay back so that led to a housing bubble, and credit crunch. Then add oil problems plus problems on wall street with the banking firms and there's your mess for the big deficit. Everything else is a domino effect as to having too much debt and spending too much on 2 wars.

Christine M: I would agree with that assessment, specifically about the information they had available, had they voted for on the first vote.

It becomes obvious they many voted in their own self interests after being granted numerous earmarks in return for changing their positions.

No, but it does mean that next month, you can vote against your local representative (and if a Senator is running, them also) if they voted for the bailout.

I believe this bailout was completely unconstitutional. The free market is suppose to punish irresponsibilty. However, the government rewards irresponsibilty, therefore, this tells you that we are no longer a free market economy.

I'm not for it. I think it was something thrown together in haste just so we would have "Something" to show the public but I don't see how you got the taxation without representation. We are being represent by the people we elected. They may be doing a crappy job but they are still our representatives. Let's vote out all incumbents regardless of party and start with a new House and a third of a new Senate. Maybe then they will listen to us.

We are represented. Represented by self interested sob's! This is one of the biggest if not the biggest scam pulled on the American public. How anyone could justify voting for anyone that voted yes is beyond comprehension. They are already setting it up for the time they come back and ask for more.

No, the representatives (and we are a Representative government with Congressman/woman, and Senators that cast votes for the people they represent) voted for the Bill.  So, you had representation in the taxation.  If people don't agree with it, then they can vote out their representative and push for the represenative replacement to put out legislation to reverse the decision.  But WE DID HAVE REPRESENTATION.



Remember, one oath that our Representative Body takes is to make decisions in the "best interest of America".  With the info that they received, that over-rides public opinion at the time; hence, Obama voted against invading Iraq - the people wanted it, but he had an obligation to check the facts and vote for what was best for the country.  20/20 hindsight is always tough...the Economic Recovery Plan will only tell in time.

No. The bailout is not a tax.  By your argument the Iraq war and Bush's subsidies to Exxonand other favored companies are also taxation without representation, since the majority of Americans oppose them.



Look, I don't like the fact that the bailout is necessary. I don't like the pork attached. I don't likethe fact that by stepping in the government is inevitably saving the sorry a**es of some of the crooks involved in creating the mess in the first place.



But the crisis exists and has to be dealt with. You have a choice: intervene and stabilize the financial sector--or another Depression. And you do not have a third alternative.  Its one or the other.

Want to Know More About Obama's Taxing Policy?



Obama wants to charge more taxes for people who earn over $250K.  Does this include capital gains (amount earned through the stock market including 401K plans and real estate?) Is it true that people who earn more than $250K from the sale of a house will have to pay more taxes? Again, the same with retirement plans? By how much, exactly?

The 250 k applies to income.



It doesn't apply to house sales  -  which isn't income.



It doesn't apply to retirement plans - which are always treated differently for tax purposes.

In 2008 in the UK is this how little a life is worth? ?



See http://uk.news.yahoo.com/skynews/2008100... just 7 years and no driving for killing two kids. I think the penalty should add up to more like 40 years in prison with NO CHANCE OF BAIL OR EARLY RELEASE. Seems like we are now a nation of whoosys. Footballer or not, no one made him get drunk and get behind the wheel. And all our law system says is that its ok. Two lives are only 7 years after all! This is sick! What do you think?

I couldn't agree more. It's insane to be so lenient, killing somebody by reckless driving whilst drunk is no different to shooting them with a gun. He should get the maximum sentence for this CRIME and not just a stupid slap on the wrist. The law needs to be changed NOW, to send a strong message to others, this total disregard to others safety or life is not and never will be tolerated. It makes me sick that such a miscarriage of justice is possible. Of course he should get two life sentences minimum. The law is a joke!

I'm a driver and make sure that I keep well below the legal limit, one pint of beer and then onto soft drinks, or coffee.



Yes, I know that the likelihood of getting stopped after having another couple of beers is fairly low, but what if I killed someone?



Could I live with that on my conscience?



No, and many of my friends feel the same way.



So when a driver drinks more or double the legal alcohol limit they have made a deliberate choice to take that risk and should, I think, be jailed for a long, long time and banned from driving for life.

Hard to say.  It's going to be close.



Whoever it is, I can guarantee, will serve a four year term.  And lose on reelection.



I have a feeling it'll be McCain.  While Obama is polling well, I have the feeling that some people will walk into the voting booth and, in the privacy of the booth, be unable to bring themselves to vote for a (half) black man.  Specifically, because the McCain campaign will have done an artful job of creating an image of him as being affiliated with black terrorists (this has been debunked, but if Sarah says it enough times), being a Moslem, and so forth.

my plan is let the big insurance companies handle things. the government does nothing but mandate the new laws. everyone goes into a pool of which the insurance companies draft names by lottery, it's random. no one can be turned down. if you have insurance, you don't have to be a part of the plan. everyone else who has been drafted pays a premium to the carrier that drafted them. (the insurance companies make huge bucks, thus driving the cost on insurance down) and for those who can't pay, the gov picks up the tab. it's so freakin' simple!



it's just like auto liability insurance. once it was mandated, the price fell to nill.



oh, also, i would limit the cost of some procedures like cat scans, x-rays and other boon doggles that bankrupt the system."



YEAH, THANKS...

Except that it is being paid for by the bailout bill (guaranteed), so people scrambling to protect their credit rating so they NEVER go into forclosure are the ones footing the bill.

I think it should have been done a year ago.
That way we wouldn't have had such a quick bust of the bubble which would have allowed the economy to settle more slowly and now instead we have had a increase of homeless families which is putting a strain on states.  As the depression continues, there will be more and more of this.
Greed will kill us all.

Yes Muslim countries treat women like possessions and animals and many Asian countries treat blacks as low life unintelligent forms of life so what do you suggest we do?  I suggest we act like the Republican Party did when they fought against the Democrat Party and ended slavery as well as when the Republican Party fought against the Democrat Party and passed civil rights legistlation even though Democrat Al Gore Sr. fillibustered to deny blacks the right to civil rights.  I believe woman, especially Sarah Palin, are just as intelligent as men and Palin is certainly more intelligent and qualified than Obama to lead this country.  She is the only one running for Pres. or VP that actually has executive experience.  I think we should elect people based on their qulifications like Palin and not race like Obama.  If a person is qualified on their own merit elect them and show the world experience counts.

Who cares what other countries think. We need a President and Vice President that understands our problems and is willing to make a change. Barack Obama will just make our problems much worse just like everything else the democrats promised to do for us.



Palin and McCain could be our only hope in getting reform while the other side will just blame Bush for the last 8 years for every problem.
It'll be too bad if the democrats stand up and take responsibility for their actions too

Would you publicly hang George W Bush for His Crimes?



George W Bush has just forced Congress into a $700 Billion give-a-way to his family and friends.  This is only the latest crime against the American People which include:  Stealing the 2000 and 2004 elections through voting machine rigging, voter intimidation, illegal scrubbing of the voter rolls and election fraud; Planning and executing the 9/11 attacks on the WTC and the Pentagon using Bin Laden and his underlings as unknowing stooges; 2001 Anthrax attacks on Democratic US Senators; starting a war against Iraq by lying to the American People and the United Nations about Weapons of Mass Deception; torturing thousands of innocent people around the world in violation of the Geneva Convention and US Law; Spying on the American People and suspending Habeas Corpus; Aiding and abetting the false prosecution and conviction of Alabama Governor Donald Siegelman; aiding and abetting the firing of 9 US Attorneys because they refused to prosecute innocent people for George W Bush's political purposes; Profiting $100 million on insider trading of Bear Stearns Put Options;  etc...

Bush haters disgust me. This rant is old as it can be. If Bush had committed a crime is there any chance at all that when the Democrats took over in 2006 that the first thing they would have done is start impeachment hearings?



As for Don Singalman he was found guilty! There was no politics involved the man is as corrupt as the day is long!

I believe he should be held accountable somehow.  I mean, they ran Clinton into the ground over an intern and a cigar and Bush has done so, so much worse for our country and he is hailed "a good president."  I think he is the worst our country has seen in a long time.

Boy are you one of the paranoid nuts out there.  Bush never stole any election.  The 9/11 attacks where planned years before he came to office. And I could go on but you live in your own little world where if it doesn't agree with you than it is a conspiracy.  Also we never signed the Geneva Convention even though we try to live by it.  We did find weapons of mass destruction, just not in the large quantities that the press wanted.  So do some research using main stream sources before asking questions that make you look like an idiot.

First of all, you have no proof of the whole "voting machine rigging" and "intimidation" you speak of. Get real!



You also have no proof of the planning and executing of 9/11. Bin Laden did that one...and he was free to do this thanks to YOUR democratic bud, Bill Clinton!



As for the rest of your garbage, I believe YOU should be thoroughly examined and investigated by the FBI, CIA, and Secret Service!

A mind is a terrible thing to waste.



First of all, if Bush managed to force a Democrat controlled Congress to do anything, he's a hell of a lot smarter than you think he is.



Second, if you believe that anyone in the government managed to keep a plot to perpetrate 9/11 a secret, you're overlooking the fact that Clinton couldn't even keep Monica Lewinsky a secret. I can assure you one of that the greedy capitalists that surround him would have sold a book deal by now if there were a shred of truth to it.



First of all, the WMD's in Iraq weren't the centerpiece of the logic behind the war, the repeated violations of the peace from the invasion of Kuwait was, and second, the fact that Hussein did have two members of his cabinet charged with development and use of WMD's suggests that the threat was more real than you imagine, and third, a buttload of yellowcake was recently found in Iraq and quietly sent to Canada to be processed for peaceful useage.



The geneva convention doesn't apply to non-uniformed combatants.



You're right about suspension of Habeus Corpus, I'll give you that.  The Constitution doesn't give the President the power to do that, it belongs to Congress.



US Attorneys work for the President.  He could fire them all if he wanted to, and doesn't need a reason. Clinton did so.



If you're upset about profits from Put Options, why aren't you excited about special favors on loans? A LOT of Congressmen got special deals from Countrywide.  There's more than one kind of corruption.



If you keep focusing on the not-necessarily-true "crimes" of Bush, you're going to keep overlooking the obvious corruption of others in your own party.



Neither is as pure as the driven snow.  Neither deserves your blind support, even if that's the only kind you seem to have available.

Just like all people Democrats hope their government has their best interest in mind. When you take a look at what the government has done for us or more appropriately to us over the last ten years it's easy to understand how one would be drawn to a slick talking politician selling communism as the answer to ones problems.



The Democrats want to grow government when what we need is less government. We need good paying jobs that are not migrating our of the country giving our people a chance to realize the American dream. Our next administration needs to put the hogs in congress and our business community in jail. It would be in our best interest to see which members of congress filled their pockets from corrupt business leaders and kick their butts out of office and into prison.



I would be more concerned about my congressional  representatives than I would who is in the white house. Obama as a communist will fall quickly to an impeachment if he were to win. As a society we may sometimes be fools especially in hard time grasping at hope but were not stupid. Don't give up your personal freedoms a lott of blood has been shed to keep them and it would be very difficult to get them back.

Cuba is a very sore subject with me. I will never be able to understand why we have not long ago resurected our relationship with Cuba.
A friend is always better than an enemy and the Cubans like us very, very much.
The only reason I feel we have distanced ourselves from Cuba is that we have hope for Castro to die or be overthrown and we make Cuba another State of ours and then while still poor will agree to that..

First, and foremost, we will gain by Cuba's loss.  What would Cuba lose?  Cuba would lose an extremely convenient prop for the Castro regime.  Cuba's government can conveniently blame every one of their failures on the trade embargo, whether it is true or not.



Second, we can start to lure Cuba more into our sphere of influence.  As it is now, Cuba doesn't care if they displease the USA, since there is nothing the USA could realistically do to them at the moment.  We have left Cuba with essentially nothing to lose.



We would also gain access to good cigars, cheap sugar, good rum, and another market for agricultural goods.

World markets fall as Washington/Senate corruption seen as why predatory lending has not been addressed?



There will be no end to the insecurity of financial markets until the root cause of the caustic debt is acted upon which is predatory lenders and their immoral greed and predatory lending practices.



Even Obama has the "queen" of predatory lenders on his staff, (Penny Pritzker).
There will be NO safety in the financial markets until predatory lending practices are STOPPED and the excessive interest rates are dropped to sustainable levels such as 3% above prime for good credit, 5%-7% for okay credit and no more than 10-12% for bad credit.
Sarah Palin has been the only candidate in either party to address predatory lenders and their immoral greed (outside the US Congress).
Wow - the current economic crisis is seen by World financial markets as Washington's failure to address predatory lending prctices and Washington's corruption!!!
The World and the Nation see Washington as corrupt and Obama's promises of HOPE being empty if nothing is done to stop the root cause of the current financial quagmire.
$700billion of tapayer money has been allocated to predatory lenders instead on immediate need/use in the labor market and now the US dollar will fall precipitously and the average family will be going hungry due to the Washington fraud/corruption.
Will the demon-horned Senate EVER act to regulate predatory lenders as assured, or will the corrupt Senators continue their self-enriching tax first approach, and continue to give false assurances to address the predatory lending problem later?
Now we see the Paulson fraud first-hand homeless families, hungry families, continued inadequate nutrition, continued inadequacies in education, worsening/deteriorating infrastructure/roadways.

<question>



What is "smearing" in a presidential campaign?



For instance, if I state the fact that in 1995 William Ayers threw a fundraiser in his home for Barack Obama, and that they have since both been members on a charity board together, is that "smearing" because William Ayers is a confessed domestic terrorist, or is it just stating a fact that people should know about?



If you want to tell me what smearing is, give me a specific example.  Let me rephrase that.  Give me a SPECIFIC example.



</question>

what is a definition of 'casual acquaintance'?  I don't think casual acquaintances give you fundraisers.



and mccain has not 'run out of constructive things to say about himself', how pathetic to say so.  Why would you suggest he can't do both?



STOP....  you are completely misrepresenting what she said.  She SPECIFICALLY SAID"pals around with terrorists".



bill ayers is a terrorist, and obama pals around with him!!!

Smearing is when you air commercials about someone's casual acquantaince, and attempt to make them look like bosom buddies.



Seriously, do you personally background check everyone you work with?



Should we run down the list of corrupted and indicted Republicans that McCain's worked with over 20 years, or do you believe that his honor is his own?



Why don't you give an example of why it's NOT smearing? Be specific. What about Obama's occasional interactions with Ayers is a "fact that people should know about"?



Because what it really looks like, is McCain has run out of constructive things to say about himself.

Smearing is what is viewed by the subject as negative, like Penny Pritzker, queen of predatory lenders, has Barrack Obama in her pocket and is thus just one of the reasons why Obama offers tainted if not false hope to Americans.
The US Senate, friendly to the Bush/Paulson fraud, have shored up multi-millionaires and billionaires of Wall Street and fat-cat CEO/Executives with tax-payer money, devaluing the US dollar.
Washington is seen as corrupt for not directly addressing the root cause of the current finincial crisis which is primarily predatory lending but includes tax-breaks for the rich at the expense of the average US family.

Recently a typically acute documentary on DWTV provided these facts about the Muslim "country" :
85% of its resident population is unemployed.
The country is dominated by a local (Albanian) mafia.
The economy (such as it is) is sustained entirely by "aid" from the EU and remittances from "Kosovan" expatriate workers.
The only thing booming, is the birth-rate.

Social turbulance means that there has been very little bussinesses willing to invest here.  It is like any unstable country in the world. I dont think it was a huge mistake. The EU has invested in many places which have had troubled economies and pasts such as spain and ireland and in these countries the invested money has led to a return in the form of an economic boom. Both of these countries have dark pasts and the island of Ireland has a a similar situation to kosovo. I people were afraid to go to places with no developed economy it would never expand. I dont think its a mistake. Its not as if its a nation of girls living in council flats wearing hoops pushing there babies around lol.

Yes everyone knows that the new countru of Kosovo does have som eproblems but don't all countries and anyway give it some slack its not even 1 year old. People everywhere say that since Kosovo is a samll country (10,908km2) it will fully develope at a rapid rate.



85% of Albanians in Kosovo aren't unemployed. The true figure is 30% and gradually falling. It is not 'dominated by an Albanian Mafia' it only suffers from a bit of corruption now and there. With the help of E.U AID it will be rapidly progressing.

And in fairness, the line of questioning was somewhat confusing.  The interviewer had been speaking of South America, and only South America.  Now obviously she was not trying to trap McCain, but she did a quick switch to Spain.  McCain was agitated at the moment, and obviously missed the transition to Europe.

They should learn to work better together, and stop with the smear campaigns against each other.



However, I believe if they would all resign and let us try some non-partisan experts for once, it would be awesome!  It is more than obvious that the representatives that we have serving us (or should I say; that we serve) do not know what they are doing.  They engage in elementary arguments to avoid being exposed for being non-functional, and ineffective.



If the citizens cannot see the truth due to their inability to educate themselves, the policies that could be adopted by the politicians could be policies of honesty and integrity.  Maybe if the politicians were more honest, we wouldnt have so many dummies voting blindly!

Hmm, trick question?  None of these actually BETTER the average citizens life much.  The fiat currency, is a result of counterfeiting which the average citizen would be thrown in prison for- because it lowers the value of the dollar when you print money that has no value backing it.



Growth of government only leads to police states.



Foreign military adventures, kills our budget and only pisses every other country off.



Govt debt spending is BS, because they create the debt and we pay for it!



Inflation tax, is the same as taxing taxes.



all of the above absolutely suck!



You must be an Independant, because all of the above is what we get from BOTH of the 2 big parties.

Republicans how do you suppose we can do this?



According to Republicans, who have the genius nuke em' all if they don't agree with us strategy, in order to win the war on terror we need to go to war with Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Syria, and maybe even Russia.  How do you suppose we go ahead and do this without bringing the entire world onto its knees, while we will be brought down on our backs? You want to know how to really win the war on terror, its really simple, really controversial, and will probably lower gas prices as well.  It does not even require any military operation.  All you have to do is cut off support to...to...ISRAEL.  I know taboo, haha, we all know that they have us by the balls cuz all those Jews basically own America so it's easier said than done.  Haha its funny when I walk around FT. Benning and I see AMERICAN soldiers wearing Israel Defense force t-shirts, I tend to question where their loyalties lie.



In addition to this I also wonder if Iran, had attacked and destroyed a lone US warship, flying the American flag, and said it was an accident, would Iran exist right now? THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX...I know it must be tough being a conservative.

it imploded from the fire that ignited the fuses to the bombs that were in the building to blow it up.



A building that crashes at near freefall is not pancaking.  it fell in one piece, unless you close your eyes when they show the tape of it falling.

The signature crimp at the center of the building is more than enough evidence that it was imploded using demolition tactics.  The owner of the WTC buildings insured the buildings for more than they were appraised at (SHORTLY before the event) and in his own words "we gave the order to PULL"  - the numerous maintenance teams that were unidentified and suspicious in the months before the tragedy.  The diagonal cutting of the beams, the molten metal and the presence of Thermite, the numerous "helper" detonations, and many more FACTS about the destruction of the towers would be evidence BEYOND a shadow of a doubt that the buildings didnt fall from planes hitting them.  Building 7 wasnt hit by anything, and never in history has a steel structured building fell from fire.

This monumentally stupid circus you call an election is laughable, if it wasn't so serious for us all. You have no left leaning opposition and never have had and that has lead to the skewed political landscape in America today, where the only choice is between 2 conservative parties with similar ideologies; most of which are out dated, old fashioned and backward thinking, not to mention, bloody dangerous!



McCain and Palin are just too ridiculous for words and are doing a terrific job for Obahma. The danger is that the political illiterates in your country will vote for this loony double act out of some misguided and uneducated, red neck, militaristic, flag waving clap trap that they hold dear and sacred. God help us!

Lots of damage in every respect. I don't know about "proudly," that depends on how high your IQ and education rank - in the dark swamps of inbred, Bible-brainwashed neo-con mentality, they're all very proud of Dumbya's achievements, particularly that he allowed for 09/11 to happen; people who actually know their head from their butts are ashamed and bitter of even being Americans under such a dismal embarrassment like Dumbya and his Dick. But then, Dumbya's partners and friends got really rich, having basically emptied the federal funds into their pockets - they can be proud of their republican patriotism.

Like lawsuits, first you win the case than you sue.  Global warming is no different, they lied to the people and said that man is the sole cause of the increased global temperatures and now they want to tax man for it.  Reality, European scientist have provided information that the earths core temperature was significantly warmer at the last global warming the earth went through.  When logic and bluffs stand by, evil plays its role.

Government ran health care has been promised every election to fools to butter them up and trick people into voting for their guy.  Realistically, someone has got to pay for the Gov. health care.  If you ever saw gov. medicare operate for old folks, or anything ran by our gov. you'd be thankful they don't control our health care.  Medicare as well as Soc.Sec is a mess.  2016 Gov. sponsered health care motto: "Don't get sick in America, you'll die".

The best plan is the one you pay for yourself.  you have control over it and never have to worry about burdening anyone else with your problems.  As for the other groups you mentioned; They can help themselves.  It is not the government function to take care of people unless they are invalid or something.  Then the govt can step in but 99.999999999999999999999999% of the time people are more than capable of taking care of themselves.

Probably neither will really provide healthcare where someone like me , a nurse of 40 years, taking care of every illness you can imagine, will actually have insurance to get a physical or blood work or check-up myself.  It's all just lies, but especially McCain, with 13000 pages of health reports in, whatever, 8 years, more than ten nursing homes would generate in health pages health over that time span, won't care that I don't have one paragraph of a health page for 30 years.  He is either ready to be dead or a hypochondriac to generate 13000 pages over a few years, while the rest of us trot our bodies out over ice on New years and every holiday and day of the week without a single checkup.

Unfortunately, health care is too screwed up in this country for anyone to fix it any time soon. And the things that would actually improve the quality and cost of care are so politically unpopular that no mainstream politician will even mention them.



Ask yourself this question: Suppose a 92 year old retiree with $75,000 in the bank had some disease that could be cured for $1 million (say it actually costs that much to manufacture a dose of the cure). Without the cure, they will die in a week. With the cure, they will likely live for 5-10 more years. Should they get the cure? And if so, who should pay for it?



The big problem in this country is that we have decided that there must be one and only one standard of care, and everyone must either buy that standard of care or have none at all. Imagine if we decided car safety was so important that everyone had to either buy the safest Volvo there is or not have a car. Well, the average car would cost a lot more than it does now, and a lot of people couldn't afford a car. And a government plan to give everyone a car would cost a hell of a lot more than it should.



Until we have the political will to confront those kinds of issues, our health care will be totally screwed up.

The government can't guarantee the money.  They are proping these banks up by printing money out of thin air and eventually taxes us into oblivion.

Debt - the dollars in our hands loosing value, basically being sliced into smaller pieces.



The federal governments tax collection barely affords each years problems. You can only tax up to 100%. With the fed, and the printing of money, the tax rate is not limited to 100%. Also, the inflation tax is fairly hidden as it requires you surrender no paper dollars because it simply removes value from them.



The national debt is about $11,000,000 Million. There are only 140 Million employed americans to pay for it all.



When americans - if americans - realise this before it is too late, they will be calling for a massive reduction in the size and cost and power of government. However the dollar will most likely fail first - pushing us into some sort of new north american currency.



We have done about $1,500,000 Million in bailouts this year. We wont see any visible tax increases - that causes americans to realise the cost of the hundreds of thousands of unconstitutional governmnet activities. Instead, it will be added  to the national debt, and paid for with the invisible tax - inflation.

Oh, they can print money out of thin air, at the cost of devaluing every dollar already in existence.  That is why Ron Paul was saying the price of the many bailouts is too high - it will destroy the dollar.

The majority of people in my area are democrats.  They hunt, they shoot at the rifle range range, the display their guns in their gun cabinets where they are proudly show off their guns.  In short, the gun is a way of life for many.  We seldom have crimes comitted with guns,

Depending on the election outcome, can the Dems seceed from USA to form our own country with our own leader?



My question is that the GOP is so good at cheating and doctoring vote results...that they can pretty much do whatever they want like last election.  If they allow the election to be close -like last time, and the GOP steals the election again -like last time, what would happen if the Democrats seceeded and formed our own country with the rightful winner, Obama?  Could we even do that?



I'm scared that the elephants will apparently do anything to win...including intensely training Palin with a week-long memorization bombardment in the party-line verbage so she could spew it out well at the debate and look good, (regurgitation of facts does not an experienced leader make) and including keeping press focus on Palin and not McCain (sound byte central we are not electing Palin for Prez!)...and these are just two recent examples.....I am truly scared for my country. Bush & Cheney were scary enough and I know my friends and I would prefer never to go through the last 8 years again!



i know i'm opening this up to some nasty answers, but thats to be expected in such a heated topic.

Wow. Just wow.



I'm sorry to break this to you, but there really are people who disagree with you. Nearly half the people in this country disagree with you.



There's no conspiracy where you're obviously right and small number of very powerful people somehow control the country even though 99% of the people disagree with them and want something else.



The last time people insisted on the right to secede from this country and refused to accept the results of the Democratic process, it was to defend the right to keep slaves. Somehow defending the right to raise taxes seems eerily similar to me.



Believe it or not, there are actually a large number of mostly rational people who are Republicans.

No. Because Dems try to take away everybody's guns. Since liberals don't have guns (right?), how could they succeed?



Plus a nation full of Democrats wouldn't last very long. Between allowing homosexually and abortion, the population of this nation wouldn't grow at normal levels. It would have to have massive immigration, usually from more conservative countries. The immigrants would eventually outnumber the Democrats (since the immigrants don't kill their unborn children) and then reverse all the liberal laws that the Democrats made, effectively destroying the liberal nation.

Those of you that voted for Bush..?



If you are even willing to admit you voted for him, do you take any responsibility for what he has done, what your vote allowed him to do to this country?



Is he part of the reason for your vote in this election?



</question>



<additional details>



So Sophi, you honestly think that he has done right by this country? Even after he admitted his reasons he gave to go into Iraq were incorrect? Also, you are aware like the rest of America that Iraq was not where the people that caused 9/11 were from aren’t you? The war in Iraq is over oil, even our politicians have stopped trying to hide that fact.



And where exactly is this radical Islam in Iraq?



History will show him as the most hated by his own people and the worse president in our history. He got in office because his brother handed him Florida, his activities while in office have been criminal. Those of you saying you’d vote him in again, you are part of the reason our country has gone to hell. So glad to see how proud you are of that.

Yes, he went after radical Islam finally.  It should have been done years ago.  They've been attacking the Western world for decades.  Your children and grandchildren will have him to thank for not having to do it themselves.



Yes, I'm aware that Saddam didn't do 9/11.  I'm wondering when people like you will realize, after 5 years, that Iraq is part of the *global* war on terror.  Al Qaeda is not the only radical Islamic group.  They are all over the world, in China, Russia, Indonesia, everywhere.

Yes, I'll admit it, and I would vote for him again if I could.  History will prove he was right on a lot of things.  He's had a lot to deal with and done a very good job.  This financial mess has nothing to do with him.  It was the policies of previous administrations.

terrorist in iraq is lie.



think logically. if you were a terrorist would you magically move to Iraq so as to face our military?  or wouldd you simply not go to iraq. and stay alive?



better to avoid iraq than to go there.

i'm a stay at home daddy.  i also home school.  i also babysit.



some of the kids are the same age as my oldest (3rd grade).  part of my deal is to have the kids do their homework, the minute they get home from school.



HOLY CRAP!!!!



1st-the stuff these kids are being taught is absolutely inane!!!!
it's like they're being trained to work at McDonalds.  disturbing, to say the least.  and when i ask them what they've learned in school today, they ALWAYS, and without fail, say "nothing".



NOTHING?!?!?!?!!!!!



WTF?  so, WHY does public school even exist?
and what he heck is wrong with these parents?  do they not know their kids are not learning anything?  one of the parents even told me that she does her son's math for him.  i make him sit at the table, and if it takes an hour, i make the kid learn.  he's tough to teach too, because he's used to having it done for him.  i may take it too far (by taking so much time, and being strict), but he'll thank me later, when he learns to think for himself(and i'm not letting MY kids learn that behaviour-especially from some other kid).

Is Terrorist professor Ayers an indication of what is wrong with higher education today?



Terrorist bomber Ayers is now a college professor at UIC.  This somehow excuses his recent wish that he bombed even more American buildings.  What do you think he is teaching his students?  He is an education professor, so I guess he is teaching the next generation of teachers how to corrupt the minds of children in public schools that are now left wing madrassases

No, it is a indication, what is wrong with the people who can only see one-dimensional.



Just remember: Ayers is only a professor. And it is very unlikely that he teaches spaceflight technology or chemistry.



The former German Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, who also teaches as guest professor inside the USA, was in his youth a radical left-wing protester, attacking policemen. Does not stop people in Germany from considering him one of the more popular politicians here.



His party is still full of people with either terrorist background or good connections to the German terror groups (Red Army Fraction). Does still not keep people from considering the party main stream and government-capable.



It is 30 years in the past. And like Ayers, they all distanced themselves from their radical past, even to the point of considering it a path to nowhere.



The weatherman group is a joke in terms of criminality, compared to the two major terror groups active in Germany from 1970 to 1990, Red Army Fraction and Operation Gladio.  The RAF alone caused 34 deaths (The weathermen only 1.5).



The real problem of the society are people, who commit crimes without even feeling a bit of guilt. Who are convinced that they do something good, when they send out soldiers to fight illegal wars for them without proper equipment. Or who accept the poverty of many people, by not giving them the chance to become rich at all.



And honestly: You also read very radical. Ever thought about your own one-dimensionality?

New Bailout bill still a deception?



I can't seem to find a straight answer on this: Does the Bailout bill which was passed by the House a few days ago still contain the clauses concerning Paulson's legal immunity and "non-reviewable" acts?  And even if it does not, isn't this whole Paulson thing besides the point?



What I mean is, even though the Bill was modified, isn't it still wrong to reward these bankers when they probably should have gone to jail instead?



Also, shouldn't the bill at least address un-deregulating the issues the created this problem in the first place such as using the banking assets in  derivatives and other forms of speculation?

No. There is an oversight board and judicial review, but it doesn't matter. The Bush bailout bill will fail because it does not address the roots of the current financial crisis, namely rapidly falling real estate prices sparked by the increase in the federal funds rate that ignited a wave of sub-prime mortgage foreclosures that has brought all but the highest end of the real estate market and the market for bank-owned real estate to a standstill.



That $700 billion is headed for the trash heap. Banks will sell their illiquid assets to the TARP fund and then instead of re-lending money to qualified borrowers, which is the whole purpose of the plan, they will sit on their hands and make only ultra-safe loans while purchasing government securities with the remainder, The credit crisis will persist and this will become a very deep recession and perhaps a depression since asset values will continue to fall which will further constrict lending which will cause greater unemployment which will further reduce consumer demand for products and services which will further damage the real economy that the financial economy will not lend to on reasonable terms.



The Bush bailout plan will fail. The imbecile running the Treasury Department doesn't have a Plan B, and he should have been fired in the first place when he decided to let Lehman Brothers fail because Lehman Brothers, unlike AIG, didn't owe $20 billion to his old firm Goldman Sachs.



The Bush-Cheney administration is a complete failure on both the foreign policy front and the domestic policy front and there's more of the same in store with a McCain administration. You should be a little more concerned with the bigger question of which ticket is more likely to fix the very serious problems besetting this economy and the global economy.

How much influence has Alan Greenspan had on the current economic situation?



GREENSPAN GOT HIS START WITH AYN RAND



In 1966, Ayn Rand collected a series of essays into the book, "Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal." Twenty of the essays in the were written by Rand. The rest came from a trio of Rand's acolytes, followers who had already been writing the newsletter of her "Objectivist" cult for more than a decade. Among these were three essays from a member of Rand's inner circle; an economic advisor and dropout from the graduate economics program at Columbia - Alan Greenspan.
Greenspan was such a close friend of Rand's, that she passed him manuscript pages of Atlas Shrugged while the book was being written. He paid rapt attention to her tale of mysterious genius John Galt - brilliant engineer, physicist, philosopher, and organizer. Galt, who shows the world who is really in charge by leading a rebellion of industrialists against laws that interfere with their companies, was in perfect agreement with the essays that Greenspan was writing at the time. In those essays, Greenspan rails against the "statists" and their desire to blame failures leading to the Great Depression on greed and unsafe lending practices. Instead, says Greenspan, the economy was experiencing a "mild contraction" which would have amounted to nothing, had the government not overreacted. Greenspan also attacks the "welfare state" and its schemes to "confiscate the wealth of the productive members of society."
When John Galt leads his own inner circle of polymath geniuses to abandon the working classes and form a objectivist paradise, Greenspan must have cheered.
The essays Greenspan contributed to the 1966 collection, like the rest of the book, praised the idea of unfettered, unrestricted, unregulated, laissez-faire capitalism. Sure, there were problems in the system as it existed at the time, but those problems were not the fault of capitalism. Real capitalism, pure capitalism, had never been tried. Under pure capitalism, there would be a complete "separation of capitalism and state," and the resulting markets would be self-governing and self-correcting. It was only the intrusion of regulations into the system that brought on instability and immorality. Kick government out, and the system would not only flourish, but express the innate reasoning and positive force of selfishness.
Chief disciple Greenspan carried this torch for the next half-century and beyond. Pro-business conservatives (not surprisingly) found great comfort in a philosophy that said squeezing every dime out of the system was not only fair, but the only moral solution. Not long after the publication of his essays in Rand's book, Greenspan was invited to become an advisor to the Nixon administration. When Ford replaced Nixon, Greenspan became the chair of the Council of Economic Advisors. And when Reagan took power, Greenspan was no longer the voice crying in the wilderness, he was the very center of the establishment. Objectivism and Conservatism had united in Market Fundamentalism, and that force was on a jihad against regulation of any kind.
For the next thirty years, Greenspan would cheer the deregulation of the S&Ls and join John McCain in trying to protect Charles Keating from regulators. He would praise the deregulation of energy trading, and assure everyone that companies like Enron were pointing the way to greater efficiency and lower consumer prices - and collect the 2000 "Enron Prize" in exchange. He would urge not only the creation of credit default swaps, but applaud their lack of regulation and invisibility in the system. He would argue against oversight, against limits on CEO pay, and for the increasingly complex systems by which banks generated new instruments of credit.
No one person did more to spread Rand's message of unregulated markets, unconstrained free trade, and unlimited power for corporate officers than Alan Greenspan.

How would you like new building codes to enforce these?



solar panels
rainwater collection systems
geothermal pumps
pedestal squat toilets instead of conventional toilets
bidets instead of toilet paper
ramps instead of staircases
double-paned thermal windows



I figure they could just incorporate these into regular building codes so that all new buildings can have them. How about making new buildings that all commercial and industrial buildings have to have wind turbines and skylights to produce and save energy? I think big-box retail like shopping malls, outlet centers, and Wal-Marts, etc., should all have skylights so they won't burn electricity during the day. They could even produce some for the grid with the wind generators. A lot of alternative energy isn't taking place because the government isn't enforcing it. If they put more teeth into it and put deadlines, I think that this would be the greatest thing since sliced bread. I know my hometown Austin, Texas, has an aggressive plan to make all new buildings go solar. How does this sound to?



</question>

I've read building codes. Now every building has to have indoor plumbing and a bathroom. They can't have an outhouse by a house or building. I figure it would be awesome to enforce these, too. If anyone is interested in knowing about the squat toilets I mentioned, here is a website.

This is a great topic you have brought and I think it is one that needs to be discussed more openly. Aside from any political affiliations, it is well known that our great nation needs reform in many areas including environmental practices. You did not include this in your list but I think it is something important that all Americans should consider, instead of homes cheaply, homes should be constructed from stone. If you think about the figures an average home-loan last for about 50 years and within 30 years or less the homes today begin to fall into disrepair. But if we can reform the government with stricter environmental standards, we can develop a greener future. If you incorporate all yours ideas into my stone house you would have an environmental friendly home! Since Stone homes will last forever you won't have to worry about exterior deterioration.

Been there, done that on those codes.



Squat toilets are a stupid idea. The rest of the items you list are permitted and in some case required by current codes.



You may have read building codes, but you obviously don't understand them, or anything about the process. What YOU think doesn't matter at all unless you are in the position of being in a position of influence to accomplish what you suggest. Don't feel bad, it doesn't matter what I think either.

Should there be a cap on how much money can be spent on the Presidential election?



With the total nearing 1 billion dollars having been spent on the 2008 presidential election, do you think that there should be a dollar amount set that each candidate gets to use? Would this allow third party candidates the equal opportunity to be heard, and thus enriching the system. It just seems that  people are almost able to buy there way into office while simultaneously shutting out most competition. What say you?

Perot is a great example! He had money, and he actually led in many of the polls at the time. Quite unprecedented for a third party candidate. He dropped out of the race, and also made some terrible decisions, such as his pick for VP.

Yes and a cap on how long they can campaign. They should get a set amount of money from the government and should not be allowed to accept any other money. Then the playing field is equal. Then, they should be allowed to campaign right after Labor Day and not before.



This thing has been going on for 2 years! Further, the guy with the least money, including Third Party candidates, can't possibly refute all the lies and half-truths that the guy with the most money says.

Current even review questions??



1. What was the per share value of General Motors and Ford Motor Company Stock in early October, 2008?



2. What is meant by the statement that the U.S. Government is buying shares of American banks? Why is this controversial? What are European governments doing as they experience similar problems to those encountered in the U.S.?



3. What is the correlation between Senator Obama’s rise in the Gallup daily tracking polls and the slide in the American stock market?

The fed is going to buy stock in the banks as a way to return profits to the government while providing liquidity to the financial institutions.



Many people blame George Bush and the Republican Congress for the current situation.  Blaming them, they have associated the problem with John McCain.  The obvious situation is that they would favor McCain's opponent.

I have noticed that also.  It seems that people seem to think that the Council of Foreign Relations is nothing more than a local Girl Scouts group!



They REFUSE to go to their website and put in "North American Union" the SPP, or the name Pastor in the search engine to find out more, and the TRUTH!



BOTH Obama and McCain are nothing more than ACTORS for playing out the CFRs intention, and the FACTS stand that if they don't do what they are told, then they will be killed.

I do, and I think the CFR is also getting wise to the fact that the people are on to it.



Why do I think that?  Because I noticed quite a few documents have disappeared from their web site that were there a few months ago - with respect to North American integration and global government.



Now, in lieu of information that clearly indicated their efforts to dismantle American sovereignty, you can find documents that are clearly aimed at misleading people on the agenda.



Reading some of their newer documents made me want to throw up - propaganda does that to me.



It is no longer useful to go to the CFR web site to learn about them. Third party information is required. This article is a good start.

I do ... so ONE!  I can speak for the rest .... they know NOTHING .... to quote Schultz from Hogan's Heroes!



BUt  to tell you the truth I never realized that the CFR was the Shadow Govt until I watched that video http://www.gnn.tv/threads/27763/



That was a real eye-opener.  It should be required in school.



In fact, I'm going to pose a question about it and see how many people recognize it and how many believe in it's validity? You should see a copy of it running across your computer in a bit!



The ONLY candidate that I know of as NOT being in the CFR is Chuck Baldwin but no one has heard of him either .... except the ones that I tell about him.



Americans are ... how do I say this gently?  .... not deeply interested in the political process.  In 1960 we students used to YELL at the grups and tell them the govt was taking over and that they had to be stopped.  But it is so much easier and convenient for everyone to just let the govt handle it and not be bothered by the whole mess.



It truly is a shame.

The president actually doesn't have much power under the Constitution.  Our representative congress does and one of the biggest problems out government has is that we keep re-electing the same boneheads into office and expecting a different result.

<question>



Can someone answer this question?



At the time our constitution was written how would this case be handled?



A woman is talking to another woman.  A man comes up and grabs their money.  A woman tries to keep him from doing this.  He punches her in the stomach.  She has a premature birth and the baby dies.  What charges were brought against the man?  He caused the early birth and eventual death of the fetus?  Was he charged with murder or simply the assault and battery of the woman?



Wouldn't this situation determine the view of constitutional status of a fetus?



</question>



<additional details>



See I see abortion as murder but the choice of legality at the state level or by constitutional ammendment.  But if you are looking at it based on the constitution then this is simple.  The case was murder in the first degree.  The fetus was determined to have value of life.  That should legally conclude abortion doctors and women should be viewed by those standards.

The town would join together.... find this man.... punish him severely, probably to the point of a QUICK and painful death....  and no one would shed a tear for the violent SOB.



Then the entire community, including the area politicians,  would gather in the local church and PRAY TO GOD to help the woman, the baby, and the rest of the family that was VICTIMIZED by very very bad people.



They would all have guns, and wouldn't think twice as to whether or not they were allowed to carry them.



I'm sorry..... what was the question?

Historically, a fetus was not recognized as a legal entity separate from the pregnant woman.



In fact, abortion was generally not illegal until the latter half of the 1800s, when many states enacted laws criminalizing the procedure.



He would probably be charged with assault.

At the time the Constitution was written a woman wouldn't have any money.
It would be her husband's or her father's.
But no, an unborn fetus was not recognized as a potential victim.
The constitution affords rights to "BORN or naturalized" citizens.  Unborn need not apply.

The fetus was still considered a human child in the 18th century, as science wasn't nearly as advanced as it is today.



The man would be charged with the assault of the woman and the murder of the unborn child.



He'd probably be hanged.

It will eliminate allot of the upper middle to upper class. I don't think allot of people understand the impact of only taxing the rich under Obama's tax plan. Everyone will loose. Everyone purchases products made by companies that will pay higher tax and therefore everyone will pay more for their goods and services.

The sad thing is he's right. Obama is just not ready to be President of the United States. The really sad thing is that it is quite possible that none of the current presidential or vice presidential candidates is really a good choice for the position. I believe that whoever wins this election our country is in a world of hurt.



Obama's brand of socialism is not the answer, and from a foreign policy stand point he is completely clueless. McCain just doesn't seem to be able to remember all of the things that he knows about world politics. Maybe he really is just too old. Palin is just as unqualified as Obama, and Biden as you have pointed out is just too stupid.

In my opinion, whilst Brands and Ross' public display of arrogance and insensitivity is clearly identifiable as distasteful, issues such as fuel prices and politics are often just seen as inevitable annoyances of modern society. This should not be the case seeing as the majority of British citizens would see such issues you have raised as more important than the behavior of two childish tv/radio presenters. Unfortunately i suspect it will take more than just dissatisfaction with our traffic wardens to truly trigger a change in public behavior towards our governments neglect of certain issues.

I agree, but advertising is the key to our modern lives.  The amount raised and being spent on the campaigns is disgusting, but still not as disgusting as the attack-ads being aired to mislead all of us.  Having been a Republican virtually my whole life (some almost-50 years, since I turned 10 and started paying any attention at all to elections) I am deeply sorry to see that most (and some fo the WORST) of such ads are being created by people supporting Republican candidates.

Doesn't it actually seem a little like spreading the wealth? It gets spent on TV stations, print shops, photographers, travel, restaurants, clothing, etc, so really it gets pumped back through the economy..

Wait a second.



McCain is basically running his campaign on public financing, which gave him an limited amount of federal dollars (in lieu of private financing).



Obama broke his pledge to also use public financing, and raised over 1/2 trillion dollars in private financing (once the details of how to get/hide illegal contributions was solved).



The "appalling" amount of money being spent is by Obama, and NOT McCain.

Surrendered passport retrieval?



i reside in ghaziabad u.p. I had applied for a passport by tatkal during last year September. Post receiving the passport, I was transferred to mumbai due to change in job. Thus i was unavailable during the verification process when police officers came to my u.p residence.In the meanwhile i shifted back to U.P this august as i planned to leave in november for the uk. but This october 08, i recieved a letter from the passport office that i had to surrender my passport along with an affidavit stating reasons for my absence as the police reports were adverse. I did the same and now they are telling that i will receive the passport only after verification happens in both u.p and mumbai. I want to know, how can i expedite this process as i havent applied for my visa yet and my departure date is nearing. the passport officers are saying they cant do anything to expedite! Please help

Goodbye America...land of freedom...?



No bashing on either side...just look at the changes that will happen if obama takes over with his socialized healthcare...what Cuba has. It's true what someone said....Cuba is moving towards freedom, while America is moving the other way. Many people admire America and want to BE here...look how many immigrants, legal and illegal thirst for this land. What hurts me is that, immigrants, especially Cubans who are fleeing from a socialist regime, dream of this land of the free and will end up with the exact same healthcare they had in Cuba. They look upon America for hope....and now, if we get socialized medicine, what difference is there?



America was NEVER to take a step towards Marxism....change, change, change, go to another country if you want change. It will hurt millions more than many think.



</question>



<additional details>



Need2know: I really hope you are reading this because obviously you did not read my post. In fact, you should watch what you say and not misinterpret other people. I am hurt by you...my cousins fled Cuba. My mom was born there...and let me tell you, I have never seen someone more pro-American than they are. I KNOW America was built on immigrants..unfortunately they were mistreated. That's wrong, very wrong. All I said was, obviously knowing from experience, that immigrants look to America for hope...and we're thinking about their hopes and dreams for a free country when we have socialized medicine. I said that Cubans want here what they didn't have there. Do not misconstrue something that you do not know. That was the opposite of my question/post. And I am truly hurt....immigrants should not be treated as slaves...that's why they should be here legally to live the dream they've wanted.



edit: we're NOT thinking about their hopes and dreams...typo! sorry

First let me tell you that I'm a republican, but In case you haven't noticed, things have headed south BEFORE Obama was running for president! We've ALREADY changed towards Marxism:
You don't like redistribution of wealth, well guess what... wealth has been redistributed RIGHT under your nose to banks and large corporations the tune of $700,000,000,000.00 and still some people don't see it as a problem! People want change to steer the car off the cliff before all 4 wheels are in freefall.
We went into the realm of Marxism when we decided to engage in war mongering and nationbuilding, and taxation without representation (the bank bailout plan that most Americans didn't want) and federal take over of private banks and corporations. If you don't call these things scary, i don't know what your definition of scary is.
Plus, as a republican I'm against a national healthcare system, but why do you name Cuba as an example and not Canada, or Belguim or Denmark? All with similar plans as Obama's?
You say:" change, change, change, go to another country if you want change." Actually this is America and when things are bad, we have the freedom to change it. people who don't like this ability are the ones who need to move to another country where citizens have to put up or shut up... As Americans we don't take to shutting up and putting up real well. We (at least most of us), will kick any of our PUBLIC SERVANTS out of office if they're not serving the American people and our interests.
We're Americans, our country has been run into the ground and we've had enough.



ps, you say socialized medicine is bad and I'm not for it either, BUT imagine if we had PRIVATIZED social security as proposed by bush and mccain and our retirements were in the stock market... IMAGINE what a DISASTER that would have been! Everyone's grandparents would be in the streets! Is that what we want for America?

So you're answer is to once again "enslave" a person as a whole.What they can contribute to science,arts &culture ,medicine etc.Not one area of life as not been touched by an immigrant.Just history doesn't always want to say what all immigrants have contributed.And for your information.The pilgrims didn't step onto the shores of America,and find it uninhabited.They just took it over.Because they so happen to have discovered firepower,first.They call indians "savages"(unsavory-sound familiar).They past their judgements on how they were living their lives!Because they didn't have the SAME,(sound familiar) way of life.They were deemed "inhuman".African was raped of it's people,as other countries.Now that the "United States"of America has been built on the backs of others.Now,you ready to kick them out.But wait who exactly was it,that had to have mexican americans work their farms,be maids in their kitchens,look after their children,Chinese work railroads&children work in sweat shops,drive them in their cars.,children still on slave trades to dig for diamonds Do you ask if a hild was torn from his family before you buy a diamond .Young black women raped by someone who said they "owned" them.But had his superior wife laying in their bed alone.The blood,sweat,and tears of immigrants/slaves are all over the soil of this country! Why don't you go! Instead of helping to find a way to make sure people do come to this country legally.Their basic desire is to come to a country where they can be free.Or at least have the best chance of being free! Why not uplift ,hardwork,uplift ideas in education.Are you afraid,you can't live up to your own expectations,so you supprese others! You are the one spreading fear,hate,division with your code words-marxism,hurt millions.So it's ok for exsample that you can get a flu shot,but you can sleep at night not wanting to share flu shots or make other medical coverage for everyone.Epidemics don't know the difference of ghetto & surberbs .

Everyone prepare yourselves for the November 4th Bolshevik Revolution! ?



Unfortunately I don’t think McCain stands a chance. Karl Obama Marx is mostly likely going to be our next president.  People immigrate to the US because of their home countries insanely high taxes. You never hear of people who are born in the US moving to Argentina or Russia because of their useless socialized healthcare and 40%+ tax rate. We became the richest and most powerful country in the world because of capitalism. Doesn’t anyone think it is strange that countries whose governments are based on communism and have socialized healthcare programs just so happen to have the poorest citizens (Congo 55% tax rate, China 48% tax rate)? Now let’s look at countries that have the lowest taxes and are showing the highest increases in productivity and growth; Singapore 11% tax rate, Hong Kong 6% tax rate. Both of those countries are growing in all facets. I have visited Singapore twice this year and business is booming in manufacturing, import/export, construction and even retail.  It saddens me to see the direction this county is going in. What incentive will there be to be successful. Why will lazy freeloaders do anything if at the end of the day they are going to get the same as the go getters? What highly intelligent and gifted people are going to want to pay $250k in schooling to become a cardiovascular surgeon if they are only going to make less than $100k per year instead of the $400k they deserve? Sure our system isn’t perfect, but it’s still the best out there. I guess this wasn’t much of a question, just venting.

Hi all,



I have to do a research paper for my Politics class.. My topic is..



Is Canada's political culture destined to become indistinguishable from that of the United States in the foreseeable future?



Feel free to add your thoughts... Yes because.... No because...



I have some points.. like the right-left spectrum comparison...money politics (feeding the needs of business) making its way north.... Canada's welfare state... the privatization of the public sector... and voting.



Other ideas and points or topics of interest would be much appreciated.. I have 10 pages to fill!



Thanks guys!



*Please note: I don't want comments about Canadians being American with less guns and free health care... That's not even factual for the most part.. I'm looking at POLITICAL culture here.

Legitimate government function = function that can only be solved by the collective.  Examples:  Police, fire, roads.



Not legitimate: Schools, protection from ourselves (prohibition, smoking laws, etc.).  Anything where government oversteps its limits set forth in the Constitution, which are many.  In other words, I don't think its OK for socialists like you to say socialism is nifty simply because government has already overstepped its Constitutional authority.

To some small degree,Eisenhower,Wilson,even Ford had leanings on some issues more than others...but in the words of Nikita Khrushchev.."We can't expect the American people to just jump from capitalism to communism,but we can assist their elected leaders in giving them small doses of socialism,until they awaken one day to find they HAVE communism"....prophetic, huh?  Ooops, I forgot this is America, we're supposed to chant the mantra,'it can't happen here'.It can't happen here...it can't hap----TOTO! TOTO!!!...ARE WE IN KANSAS YET???

Not really, the government controls some things that are in the public interest.  If you look at what the government does control, it is not as good as the private options.  Take schools for example, private schools do much better with less money and larger class size than public schools.

Okay, allow me to explain. Socialism is an extreme. What people don't remember is the other extreme, and that is anarchy. In socialism, everything is controlled by the government. In anarchy, nothing is controlled by the government. Democracy is the median of that. Democracy has some socialistic ideas, such as the police, fire dept, road construction, etc. but we also have capitalism.



Now to those who think this country will be socialist if Obama becomes elected. Do you remember the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution? It is the highest law of the land! You're saying that Obama will somehow bypass the ENTIRE constitution and restructure our government to communism? I'll leave it at that!

No, I disagree, You are talking about greed. You are not talking about what Obama wants to do and that is force higher taxes and to tell you what to do with your money. He wants to take from people who do work and give to people who don't pay taxes at all. What next? Tell you that you own 2 cars so give one to someone who doesn't. and not only doesn't, doesn't make the effort to get one. a free handout. I have no problem helping people who have fallen on hard times. I do that by choice and give to whatever charity I see fit, not to be dictated to

I thought they would just shut her up & have her bat her eyes up there & burst into smiles & shake her head up & down & we would never hear that story again but just like Joe the Plumber they are taking gaffes now & making them into series.

I think it depends. If you were addressing him in person, I would not use his first name. Even though he is a pretty down-to-earth guy, it is not polite. If you are talking about him in a formal setting (e.g. you are giving a speech and you want to quote him), you should address him as Senator Obama or depending on the outcome of the election, President Obama. If you are referring to him at home or with friends, I don't think it matters.

If he were a terrific and honorable guy, then I'd say no.



However, he now has a publicist, is pushing for a recording contract, is on tour with McCain and being questioned on Fox News.



Does everyone forget that the whole premise behind this guy is based on a lie.  He makes only $40K/year, is in no position to buy his bosses business, which doesn't make over $250K.  He also owes back taxes and is now on record saying that a vote for Obama is a vote for 'death to israel'.

You can bet the Republicans are planning to run Joe the Plumber as candidate for President in 2012.  Just wait and see.  He is being made into a celebrity as no ordinary plumber ever could.  They know that by then Joe the Plumber will have come to stand for everything against Obama, and unless the campaing funding laws are changed, will stand a good chance of receiving massive outpouring of public contributions to run what will be a campaign even more expensive than Obama's.

Why is he pitifull? I don't get it. Obama went to him. He asked a simple question that is on most Americans minds. Are You Going to Raise My Taxes. Obama answered, We need to spread your wealth around. Joe is not different than most Americans. What does it matter if he is licensed or not? Or paid his taxes or not. At least he works and is not looking for a free handout as Obama wants to do. Tax the people who work and give it those who don't pay any taxes. Whats wrong with that picture.

I don't think its pitiful, I just think its not a good idea. John McCain was using Joe the Plumber to try to put a face on the people, and small businesses that would be hurt by Obama's tax plan. I think they could have done it in a better, but I think it gets the message across.



And I don't think Sarah Palin was a political stunt, or was not one entierly. I understand she didn't perform well in her interviews, but she has done some pretty impressive things as Governor of Alaska. She got the Natural Gas Pipeline settled, she cut taxes on gasoline, When oil companies profits went soaring she raised their taxes and spreaded the profits equaly amung all Americans, She cut millions of dollars in wastefull spending in construction and sent that money to schools, and she cut her salary. Sure, she talks funny, and she might not know much abut the Bush Doctorine and some of the bad supreme court decisions, but you don't need to know every statistic and how to talk fancy to be the Vice President. You need leadership skills, and the ability to lead this country, and judging by how well she did as governor, I think she would do well and actually be able to do what she promises.

I think this song from a film I saw in the first grade back in 1947 describes the way Americans used to  feel about their country.
It seems Patriotism has gone out of fashion in this country since the 60s ,but this is still a great country .
This song "The House I live in" by Frank Sinatra pretty well sums up my feelings about it.



What is America to me
A name, a map, or a flag I see
A certain word, democracy
What is America to me



The house I live in
A plot of earth, a street
The grocer and the butcher
Or the people that I meet



The children in the playground
The faces that I see
All races and religions
That's America to me



The place I work in
The worker by my side
The little town the city
Where my people lived and died



The howdy and the handshake



The air of feeling free
And the right to speak your mind out
That's America to me



The things I see about me
The big things and the small

Patriotism is the positive feeling of ones country.It's basically love and devotion to one nation.



In our modern world,the idea of countries on the line of ethnicity,or just for the sake of being a nation is kinda outdated. That's because nowadays,many nations have intermixed cultures,many different ethnicity,and many different people.



So nowadays,nations are more about ideals such as Democracy,Freedom,Rights etc. Would I feel patriotic for a nation that supports one ethnicity,only one culture,only one idea,of course not.The largest empires fall because they fail to adapt to changing times and evolving culture. The Roman Empire couldn't adapt to Christianity, that's one example.



But the U.S., despite some bigotry has been able to support a vast amount of cultures,people,ideas and religions. That kind of tolerance is the key to success of any nation,and the ideals of a country that supports something like that should be defended to the death.



In this globalized world,things aren't too centered on nations,they are more about trade,capitalism,finance etc.Nations only represent the ideology,that's what makes them worthy of defending.



So why do I love America?Not because it's the most powerful,not because it's not the underdog,and not because it's the most wealthy,but because it supports the idea that everyone has the right to that.

Would you stand by your country even if it was doing something wrong? - Of course, but I wouldn't try to pretend or stubbornly try to deny there being a problem. That is Nationalism. Don't confuse that with Patriotism.



Patriotism - the love of one's country I think means that you love and care about her enough to see when things are going wrong and try to steer it back on track. Think of a parents love of a child. The parent who loves their kid enough to scold them and teach them right from wrong, who loves them IN SPITE OF sometimes disappointing behavior and through it all never stops hoping for the absolute best, never stops striving for success. Thats patriotism.

What a load of garbage. When the Republicans get in office, the Dems are supposed to just shut up and support our president--and we largely do accept the fact that this administration is in power, whether we agree with its policies or not. Then when the tables could be turned, they cannot accept defeat as law-abiding citizens. They have to talk of riots and revolution.

Prepare how?  What do you mean by revolution - a war? That's so unrealistic. But, I do believe that democracy is a farce.  What is supposed to be a superior form of govt basically is just bs - we do not govern ourselves and we are not much better than we were with monarchies, or any other type of past governmental system.  I always wonder what type of government would be better...Actually it's a question I think about quite often.

There is probably a lot to this.  The US government has totally lost sight of its function, and one serious problem is the overseas meddling in the affairs of other countries and the unending wars we have been fighting for the past 50 years.  There needs to be a Second American Revolution, in which the notion of US interference around the globe is scrapped once and for all.



Ron Paul was right when he said that if he were president he would order the closing of ALL US overseas military basis, and bring ALL the troops home.  Just imagine how weird it would be if there were huge foreign military bases all across the US, with the presence of hundreds of thousands of Congolese or Hungarian troops permanently stationed on US soil.



The US has lost sight of the purpose and intent of the framers of the Constitution, and the problem has become so bad it almost defies belief.  Yet most Congressmen are totally oblivious to the problem... after all, they created most of it.  The people need to rise up and take their country back.  Unfortunately, whoever wins this election will merely be a continuance of the problem and nothing will really change; that's how bad the mindset has become.

Odd it seems like the 2nd amendment is the only one that you notice slipping away.



Yours would be a different revolution than mine.



I want habeus corpus restored, the impeachment of criminal leadership on the table, a guarantee that I retain freedom of speech, no enforced religious doctrine and the removal of corporate/military secret government from the white house.



I guess we'd be on different sides, with you all hugging your gun and me wanting real freedom. I suspect you are more afraid of a black president than 'losing your freedoms', since you don't seem to really know what your freedoms are...

I think a lot of people are considering Revolution, however, our Government has been preparing for a coupe a lot longer than we have been considering one. Right now in the United States, there are over 800 FEMA Concentration Camps set up throughout the nation, each capable of housing as many as 1.5 million people.  All it would take at this point, is for any kind of cataclysmic disaster, to cause the standing President to declare martial law.  That's about the time all hell would break out, and we would have chaos everywhere from NYC to Small-town, America.  Some would rise up in complete disarray, with little or no organisational leadership, and be quickly and quietly extinguished.  Other more organised groups, such as the White Supremacists, The Blacks, and others would ban together, but would quickly be pitted against one another, thus creating even more pandemonium.  All these splinter cells as they would be classified, would be rebels, put on Government Extreme Prejudice lists, and dealt with accordingly.  Money won't be worth anything.  NATO will be called in to help control the civil unrest, and from there, who knows.  It is an interesting time to be alive.  "When you see these things coming to pass, look up and rejoice, for your redemption draweth nigh."

Under Age Law destroying our community!?



I'm mad about the under age law, who made that law? the devil's worker?
You see these kids just can do anything they want. They throws lots of eggs at my house and
other people's house before halloween, the worst thing is they gang up, screaming outside of the



street, throwing fruit at people's head. They got away fast, and even laught about it then pull their pants
down to show on the public streets. ofcourse we called the police, and police can't do
anything about them.  Before one of them was arrested for beating up another kid and threatend
the kid for money.  what happen to him? well he's back walking on the street with his gang.
Our communtiy was also mad, they causes lots of damage to our property. I'm very tired of this.
What in the world this features has becoming?I read many news ariticals about under age 10,12,
kids killing , robbing, beating, gang up on people and they found not guilty. There was 12 yearsold girl



who was raped by 3 other 10,8,9 yearsold boy. she was afriad to tell her mom. Her mom found out bloods
on her panty and that's when the police arrested the 3 kids. What happen to them? You know the answer.
I believe there are many crimes out there involving with kids under age, it's happening in school, on the street
and many other places. I also believe there are many crimes that are not been reported. The statisti show
on police records are not actual. The crime rates are growing, people can see that!
About the kids in my community, what should we do? Find out who's parent they were?Consult their parent
and files Bad Parent Profile on Them? Well, The true is their parent were these kind of people when they
were teen and they probally got away because of the Law. Now they telling their kid to do whatever they
can to bring $ into their pocket.  we all hate to see our world sink into the age of darkness. I and you need help,
how can we bring down the under age protection law, just like the death penalty on NJ. We should go on strikes?
If so. we need everyone's power to bring down this devil's art.

he may well have been born in hawaii, although they cannot produce his origianl birth certificate from the hospital he was supposedly born at.  they do produce a copy of a birth certificate with official seals from the state on it but the water mark is from 2007.  state officials there say it is "authentic" and pass it of as so.  the scuttlebutt i hear is that either, obama was actually born in kenya, or, that obama is actually an indonesian citizen because that was the country of origin of his adoptive father.  either way, he gets disqualified from running for president as he is NOT an american citizen.  but, the fix is in for obama and whether or not we can break it, remains to bee seen.

According to the rally in Ohio I just went to awhile ago, McCain has to win Ohio to get the presidential election. The last time I checked, about a week ago, Obama was ahead by 6 or 7 points in Ohio.

I believe it is within two points in OH (I live here). I think McCain needs both states to win but I don't know everything bout the electoral college. I'm pretty sure if Obama wins one it's pretty much over and if he wins both it's definitely over.

You are getting caught in the whirlwind of media outlets that are dying to predict the winner. They are exploring any and all polls (no matter how contradicting) to try and "mathematically" figure out who will win. They have no clue. Just be patient - and vote!

You will never know who wins until it is over... just look at the Dewey Truman race. they had papers printed that said "Dewey defeats Truman" and it did not happen. The media is biased and they will never tell the truth no matter which candidate they support! they are worse than politicians.

As Obama supporters are much more "out there" in sense, as they are oftentimes louder with their views, so it appears as if Obama has mass support, while it is merely the conservative viewpoint of the Conservative party that such support should not be flaunted, like the Liberal party does.  Additionally, one must view the polls with caution, as many people will not vote for Obama due to racial issues, which I myself would not do as I support McCain's policies.  In sense, it is still not over for McCain, and Obama should not start with the victory parties.

Where is Obamas money coming from for?



He has a channel on satellite TV that runs constantly. Where is he getting the money from to be able to afford that whole channel and the ads he has on regular TV. I find this very disturbing. There needs to be questions asked.



</question>



<additional details>



Brandon Y, how do you know where it's coming from? How do you know it's not coming from a certain place? I really want to know.



If McCain were running ads the way Obama is, there would be mega questions asked about where the money was coming from and it would be on the news.

NO NO NO, all obama is going to do is take all the tax money he gets from tax hikes, spend twice the amount, and have the gov't in control of more of our freedoms.

Oh yes, both of them are. It's the game that is played by every politician. "Promised them the world, deliver as little as possible" Actually the president is more of a figure head than anything else with the exception of having executive veto power. Which Bush used more than any president in history. With a dominate democrat House and Senate some have the gall to blame the republican party alone when there is more than enough blame to go around. The other night one of those Obama commercials was on asking if I was better off today than I was 8 years ago. My answer is yes...I am much better off today than I was 8 years ago and I am a small business person in the transportation area. The financial area of the country is in choas because of the deregulation in the stock market which in turn allowed those investing into commodities to wager against the mortgages...which in turn the mortgage companies were allowing folks that had no business purchasing homes they couldn't afford at variable interest rates.......now if I remember right the democrats were all for this deregulation.......THINK ABOUT IT BEFORE YOU VOTE! RESEARCH IT!

1. No.
2. Because of judicial activism. Nearly 8 years ago the Supreme Court issued a ruling that they will not allow all votes to be counted. The Court has been sticking its nose into far too many issues, including abortion, "sodomy" laws, marriage, issues of "discrimination" that the ratifiers of the Constitution never imagined that they were addressing at all, and so on. Every time the Court "strikes down" a law with a lie about what the Constitution means, it is committing murder against that law. It has happened so often I can't keep count. And the cherry on top of this very ugly ice-cream sundae is the ruling in Bush v. Gore.
3. No.

It depends.  You don't HAVE to, but if it's a requirement for school, they would be in the right to give you a lesser grade in school.  Basically like everything you have the choice not to, but you have consequences for your actions.



In private schools this is especially true.  Just suck it up and do the community service.  It'll be easier for you to get into college that way.



Just assuming this is the situation.  I apologize if I'm wrong.



Edit:  Funny, there are already private schools around the country that explicitly require this of their students.  I will require my child to do the same, regardless of whether or not a "law" is passed.  I'm surprised people would be so against it.  Just like the other guy mentioned the draft is just another form of community service that all men have to apply to.  I would think that if you aren't a soldier you should at least serve the community in another way.



You do realize that you get to choose how you serve the community.  It sounds like a lot of you haven't done community service before.  That's sad.

I assume you're referring to Obama's plan to have 4th and 5th graders have 20 hours of required community service?



Of course it is a violation to require someone to donate to charity.  However, if you will note- the democratic party is all about interpretation and violation of the constitution and the rights it gives us as Americans.



I, as a parent, would NOT want required community service for my children.  I will let them volunteer on their own time for their own chosen endeavors.

So far as I can tell it wouldn't be unconstitutional directly.  A law against abortion (I am just using the example and not trying to open that bag of worms) is not unconstitutional directly.  The Supreme Court determined it was unconstitutional by taking several amendments and using them to infer that there was an additional and unspecified right in the constitution called Privacy. Then they defined this new right to privacy as applying to a woman's body instead of to papers and effects and homes which actually was protected in the constitution even though they are not well protected now after the patriot act. Then they said laws against abortion were unconstitutional because they conflicted with the right to privacy which actually never existed before they decided it was there.  So this is how something that looks like it doesn't violate the constitution can end up doing it anyway. If they want to badly enough they can interpret the constitution to say pretty much anything they like by ignoring the idea that its a whole document with an intent and calling it a "living document" that must adjust to the times.



But all that aside the truth is that while it probably isn't unconstitutional, no politician would pass something like that because they wouldn't be re-elected. Actually the constitution might support the idea since it intended for states and cities to maintain militias which are a community service organization that would drill every week.  One concern is that for it to be constitutional it would have to apply to everyone.  You couldn't make just some people do community service arbitrarily as that would be unconstitutional.

I am honored to be with you and with leaders from across this great country — leaders from different faiths and political parties united in a single voice of outrage.



Tomorrow, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will come to New York — to the heart of what he calls the Great Satan — and speak freely in this, a country whose demise he has called for.



Ahmadinejad may choose his words carefully, but underneath all of the rhetoric is an agenda that threatens all who seek a safer and freer world. We gather here today to highlight the Iranian dictator's intentions and to call for action to thwart him.



He must be stopped.



The world must awake to the threat this man poses to all of us. Ahmadinejad denies that the Holocaust ever took place. He dreams of being an agent in a "Final Solution" — the elimination of the Jewish people. He has called Israel a "stinking corpse" that is "on its way to annihilation." Such talk cannot be dismissed as the ravings of a madman — not when Iran just this summer tested long-range Shahab-3 missiles capable of striking Tel Aviv, not when the Iranian nuclear program is nearing completion, and not when Iran sponsors terrorists that threaten and kill innocent people around the world.



The Iranian government wants nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency reports that Iran is running at least 3,800 centrifuges and that its uranium enrichment capacity is rapidly improving. According to news reports, U.S. intelligence agencies believe the Iranians may have enough nuclear material to produce a bomb within a year.



The world has condemned these activities. The United Nations Security Council has demanded that Iran suspend its illegal nuclear enrichment activities. It has levied three rounds of sanctions. How has Ahmadinejad responded? With the declaration that the "Iranian nation would not retreat one iota" from its nuclear program.



So, what should we do about this growing threat? First, we must succeed in Iraq. If we fail there, it will jeopardize the democracy the Iraqis have worked so hard to build, and empower the extremists in neighboring Iran. Iran has armed and trained terrorists who have killed our soldiers in Iraq, and it is Iran that would benefit from an American defeat in Iraq.



If we retreat without leaving a stable Iraq, Iran's nuclear ambitions will be bolstered. If Iran acquires nuclear weapons — they could share them tomorrow with the terrorists they finance, arm, and train today. Iranian nuclear weapons would set off a dangerous regional nuclear arms race that would make all of us less safe.



But Iran is not only a regional threat; it threatens the entire world. It is the no. 1 state sponsor of terrorism. It sponsors the world's most vicious terrorist groups, Hamas and Hezbollah. Together, Iran and its terrorists are responsible for the deaths of Americans in Lebanon in the 1980s, in Saudi Arabia in the 1990s, and in Iraq today. They have murdered Iraqis, Lebanese, Palestinians, and other Muslims who have resisted Iran's desire to dominate the region. They have persecuted countless people simply because they are Jewish.



Iran is responsible for attacks not only on Israelis, but on Jews living as far away as Argentina. Anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial are part of Iran's official ideology and murder is part of its official policy. Not even Iranian citizens are safe from their government's threat to those who want to live, work, and worship in peace. Politically-motivated abductions, torture, death by stoning, flogging, and amputations are just some of its state-sanctioned punishments.



It is said that the measure of a country is the treatment of its most vulnerable citizens. By that standard, the Iranian government is both oppressive and barbaric. Under Ahmadinejad's rule, Iranian women are some of the most vulnerable citizens.



If an Iranian woman shows too much hair in public, she risks being beaten or killed.



If she walks down a public street in clothing that violates the state dress code, she could be arrested.



But in the face of this harsh regime, the Iranian women have shown courage. Despite threats to their lives and their families, Iranian women have sought better treatment through the "One Million Signatures Campaign Demanding Changes to Discriminatory Laws." The authorities have reacted with predictable barbarism. Last year, women's rights activist Delaram Ali was sentenced to 20 lashes and 10 months in prison for committing the crime of "propaganda against the system." After international protests, the judiciary reduced her sentence to "only" 10 lashes and 36 months in prison and then temporarily suspended her sentence. She still faces the threat of imprisonment.



Earlier this year, Senator Clinton said that "Iran is seeking nuclear weapons, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is in the forefront of that" effort. Senator Clinton argued that part of our response must include stronger sanctions, including the designation of t

<question>



What type of executive government job could I apply for with, lets say 143 days of experience in government?



You couldn't get a job at McDonalds and become district manager after 143 days of experience.



You couldn't become chief of surgery after 143 days of experience of being a surgeon.



You couldn't get a job as a t eacher and be the superintendent after 143 days of experience.



You couldn't join the military and become a colonel after a 143 days of experience.



You couldn't get a job as a reporter and become the nightly news anchor after 143 days of experience.



BUT....



'From the time Barack Obama was sworn in as a United State Senator, to the time he announced he was forming a Presidential exploratory committee, he logged 143 days of experience in the Senate. That's how many days the Senate was actually in session and working. After 143 days of work experience, Obama believed he was ready to be Commander In Chief, Leader of the Free World .... 143 days.



We all have to start somewhere. The senate is a good start, but after 143 days, that's all it is - a start.



AND, strangely, a large sector of the American public is okay with this and campaigning for him. We wouldn't accept this in our own line of work, yet some are okay with this for the President of the United States of America? Come on folks, we are not voting for the next American Idol!

France's longest, closest, and most consistently enduring ally is America.  1773 - 1785.  The War of Independence.  America is fighting the British, and France shows up to help the American colonies.  Next come Spain and then the Dutch.  Not until after 1812 did England begin to accept the idea of a free nation called America.



France and England have had moments of peace in their times.  But they have also had far too many wars to be called long lasting allies.



So who now are France's allies?  You won't hear this uttered from the lips of a Frenchman anytime soon, but America still stands as their closest and biggest.



Enemies? From my lips to your ears, everybody in the world except Johnny Depp.  I direct you to this site for an example of their weenyness.

Nope.



People choose to do what they want.  It's their choice.  Once you pay your taxes it is not up to you how they are spent.  They are no longer "your" tax dollars.



I think it is wrong for people who need assistance to be on drugs.  I also understand that part of the reason they need assistance might be that they are addicts.  Having been around addiction my whole life I feel some empathy.



I don't mind if poor people choose to do some things and make purchases which might bring them the slightest bit of joy in an otherwise incredibly stressful, dismal life.  I don't mind that someone on welfare carries a cell phone or even has a decent TV.  That's nothing compared to some of the enjoyments I can have in life.  Being poor does not mean one must be unhappy.  Again, this does not mean I support them doing drugs, but i view them as being no different than the rest of society.  Many middle and upper class people are on drugs, whether it be marijuana or prescription meds.  People are people.  Denying assistance to someone for failing a drug test will basically ensure that they will never make it to the next level.  There aren't sufficient programs in place to help every drug addict overcome their addiction.



This is not a simple issue.  There are no easy answers.

For some things they do. Like section 8 housing, you and your family lose it if one member tests positive.
Now lets do a little practical thinking.



If we don't give subsistence money to druggies what happens, the rob, steal, shoot and end up in prison.  If they could make good choices, they wouldn't be on drugs or welfare in the first place.  How many people would employ a felon?  Its like daydreaming to think these people even if they got off drugs will get jobs with records.
We don't have efficient methods of keeping or rehabilitation for drugs, in fact those would cost much more than the six hundred or so dollars most welfare families get a month, most of which goes for rent and food stamps, which they have to buy.  I think of it as a way for us to keep them off the streets, at least part of the time.  Until we can find a better way, its going to have to do.

I do agree. There should be at least some accountability for government assistance rather than just a free handout. I could buy in to the person getting continued government assistance following a positive drug test IF they participated in some sort of state sponsored rehab program, but to just give them the money when they are pi$$ing it away on drugs... Definitely not!

Yes anyone receiving any type of assistance should be obligated to take a drug test....I think hair test is better. Since I do work closely with these individuals I do see a great majority of them that appear to be using drugs. And it is disturbing for me to see this knowing my good hard earned tax dollars are paying for these folks. I could go on and on about this. But they will holler it violates their civil rights and it will never happen till the people stand up and stop the abuse.

Do you believe in Birth Control pills and Morning after pill? Or Just BC?



Okay, I am asking this question because it came up on the Colorado Ballot, about banning the Morning After Pill. The thing is that they are one in the same, but the morning after pill is just a stronger dose of BC.



Birth control pill can work in 3 ways to prevent pregnancy: 1. It will prevent ovulation 2. It will create a mucus that make it hard for sperm to go through the cervix 3. It prevents the zygote from connection to the uterus wall.



Morning after pill works in 2 ways to prevent pregnancy. 1. It will prevent ovulation 2. It prevents the zygote from connection to the uterus wall.



So, why do some people agree with BC, but not the morning after pill? Is it uneducated people? It is so easy to google. Please let me know how you feel on this topic. Thanks!

Prop 8, are you for or against and why? NO RELIGION PLEASE?



I was approached by 2 men from a church at my home a few weeks ago, they were trying to promote voting yes on prop 8, I told them I was agnostic and didn’t believe in passing laws based on the bible and “god’s word” they argued with me telling me atheism is a sin, then I made them feel REALLY stupid when I explained the difference between agnostic and atheist, I told them that I would give them my word to vote yes on prop 8 if they could give me ONE reason why prop 8 is going to ruin the country that DOES NOT involve ANY religion what-so-ever, bottom line is after a while of stumbling they could not give me a reason, especially when I told them that the divorce rate is ALREADY over 50% so why can’t the gays suffer like the rest of us? I told them that even though I don’t know much about the bible I know that god is supposed to love all of his “creatures” because he CREATED them so why would he hate his OWN creations? Once again, they had nothing relevant to say, I told them to please leave my doorstep and to maybe think about having an open mind and to stop hating and discriminating against people for their life choices especially since it does not affect them in any way shape or form, not to mention that prop 8 has nothing to do with teaching children about gay marriage, but don’t you think it’s a good idea to teach them young? Maybe if our children knew more about the subject we wouldn’t have gays and lesbians beat to death and discriminated on all around the country.



Why are the Jesus freaks so concerned about prop 8? How come it’s ok for a gay couple to be together for 13 years but it’s not ok for them to get married? Why is Jesus the one who says he loves all of his creatures yet these people are promoting hate and discrimination? Why can’t we just let people be? If we ban gay marriage we might as well start up slavery again right? We might as well open up some concentration camps and kill Jewish people again right? If we are going to hate and discriminate why only chose gays and lesbians? I think it’s so extremely unfair to treat people like this when they aren’t doing anything to hurt anyone, if they’ve been together for 20 years who cares if they marry? It’s not going to hurt me any!  I’m not gay, and I only know a few gay people but am not close to them and even I feel this is wrong, I would like to hear YOUR point of view on the subject WITHOUT ANY and I repeat ANY religious background.  I want to hear 2 sides, you’re for it and why, or you’re against it and why, if you’re against it please do not include ANYTHING based on religion or the bible, I want to see if there is ANYONE out there that can REALLY justify why we should blatantly discriminate against people for the way they were born.



If gay marriage is allowed to stay legal, how will it affect you financially? How will it affect ANY emotional or physical aspect of your life WITHOUT INCLUDING THE BIBLE, explain yourselves! I want to see how people think, but please if you are a crazy religious nut, please keep your ignorant bigotry at the door, or don’t answer at all.

I am against it.  It is constitutionally wrong.  If their church doesn't want to perform marriages for gay people, that's fine, no one is trying to make them.  But to deny consenting adults from the civil institution of marriage is wrong any way you look at it.

I'm against prop 8.



If you remove religious reasons, there is no reason to vote for prop 8, except if you're a bigot.



Come to think of it, bigotry is probably the real reason people are voting for prop 8, hiding behind a cloak of religion.

I still maintain that the government should get out of the marriage business COMPLETELY.  Wills, power of attorney, inheiritance, child custody can all be taken care of as legal documents outside of a marriage right now.  I could pass everything along to my girlfriend through a will, without being married, if I wanted to.  I don't need a marriage for that.  If a church wants to 'marry' it's members, fine, but they would still have to get all those legal documents seperately.  A marriage license provides these things automatically.  Leave the religion in marriage.  Take the LAW out of marriage.  In the eyes of the LAW we would all be single individuals.  If marriage is sacred, then don't take the religion out of it, leave it as ONLY a religious institution.

I am religious, but not biased.  I do not look at this as right and wrong and who should do what, I approach this problem as one that needs a solution, a compromise really.  I have gay friends and they're usually really cool people, so I could go either way with this answer, being the "religious nut" or an open-minded individual.  I prefer to be open-minded however this problem, while not truly an issue, seems to bother a lot of people, so I propose a compromise:  Let it happen but dont call it marriage, pick a different name perhaps.  I'm not saying that I would fight for this policy, just that it is truly a compromise giving and taking from both sides.  After all, while it is two people in love, it's not EXACTLY the same because, as small as the difference may be, two men together is different from a man and a women.  If we really want to get technical we can have a different name for all gay men, straight couples, and lesbian women.  Then the religious nuts have no ground to say "well that's not what marriage means" because technically, it wouldn't be marriage.  I have two televisions, one Sony and one Toshiba, they are still both TV's but I can't really call the Sony a Toshiba.  Same concept.  It's a compromise that I offer just to quell the fighting.

If I were in California, I would vote against it.  I'm in favor of our homosexual citizens being allowed the same liberties as our heterosexual citizens.  I agree that if individual churches don't want to perform marriages for gays, fine.  They shouldn't have to.  But it should not be illegal for gays to have the same freedoms that straights have.

I am voting no on prop 8 for a couple reasons:
1. The government has enough on its plate, and always will. Until there is no poverty, unemployment and under-educated people, government has no absolutely NO right to waste my or any other taxpayers' money in order to determine/regulate/enforce if a marriage has exactly 1 penis and 1 vagina.



2. Our legal system should not promote bigotry in any way shape or form



I agree with your inferred proposal mandating tolerance training and teaching to your people to allow for a more harmonious, conducive, and productive society in the future.



By the way, isn't "marriage" a legal status as opposed to some divine duty to appease a deity? So please stop pushing your "church" into all of our "state"

I hate to tell you but you can't discuss why people find homosexuality morally abhorent and keep religion out of it too, since western civilization was always influenced in this topic by Judeo-Christian beliefs in the Bible. You simply can't write out of our laws the influence that Judeo-Christianity has had. Just because you want these religions to have no influence NOW does not mean you will succeed in ignoring the historical impact those religions have had. You can't ignore the historical fact that, as of 50 years ago, *every* *single* *state* *in* *this* *country* had a law banning "sodomy. You can't ignore the fact that "sodomy" (between gay people) is still banned by the federal government in the military. You can't pretend that these laws never did have anything to do with moral values that people have learned from their religion.



I used to live in CA, but not anymore. I am against Prop 8 passing because I believe in gay equality. I am in favor of progress. I am just not in favor of ignoring history.

How can you put "NO RELIGION PLEASE" in the subject when all you write about has religious implications?



You can't answer this question without some kind of religious explaination.  Atheism is a religion.  Agnosticism is a religion.  Christianity is a religion.  Islam is a religion.  Whether  you want to say our religion shapes our beliefs, or our beliefs determine our religion, one way or another you can't talk about this kind of topic without religion.



Marriage is a religious institution.  So, if you really take all "religion" out of the conversation... there is no coversation.  It is a moot point.  It doesn't matter.



Your view is religiously based.  You believe God "loves" all people and doesn't really care about how they act because he "loves" them (at least that's what I gather from your statement).  So, since God "loves" his creation, he would be just fine with homosexuality and same-sex marriage.



You asked "Why can’t we just let people be?"  Because people do terrible things like slavery, genocide.  I have a hard time believing that God was okay with this just because he "loves" his creation.  I'm sure you would agree with that.  Not that these things are at all comparable to homosexuality and marriage, but you compared them, so I thought I would speak on the topic.

Funny stuff here. States "NO RELIGION PLEASE" then proceeds with a diatribe against religion.



I am afraid religion is a very bg part of homosexual marriage because homosexuals would sue churches if they refuse to preform homosexual marriages.



Homosexuals want you to be tolerant while having no tolerance for others who know homosexuality is wrong.



If you do not think they will fell even more empowered to indoctrinate your innocent children in the schools, think again. There have already been attempts to eliminate words like mother, father, husband, wife

Ok.. This may sound strange.. Really LOUD Street Lamp outside of my house, Who do I talk to?



I've tried asking around but no one knows who I am supposed to talk to so this problem can be resolved. It is pissing me off. All hours of the night, there is a loud hum from the street lamp. I have to sleep with my fans on just to escape it. Decibel Meter read it at 90-120 db, that is the range of the sound over a 20 minute period.



I am just about to shoot out the lamp with my .45 if this doesn't get fixed. It's been humming since we moved here, but it hasn't been this loud, it's gotten a lot worse. When we moved in it could barely be heard.

Honestly - you are probably better off shooting it then getting results in the matter.



The street light would be delt with by your county or city workers - you'd have to report the problem and then they'd have to find the time to go out there and 'fix' it.  When they get out there and see that the light works (most likely forgetting about the initial complain of electric humming noise) they will say "problem fixed" then move on to something else.



They get a lot of calls with a lot of issues just like this.



So grab your gun.

because she never said or did any of those things. That is a complete lie from the secular left that hates and tries to marginalize Christians. I just heard Richard Dawkins say he believed life started when aliens planted seeds on this planet....give me a break that is science? Darwinian Evolution as the origin of life is a religious theory with no scientific support. Evolutionists don't know how life started, they can't prove how life started all they can do is show micro evolutionary changes to try to prove a theory that is riddled with holes and inconsistencies.



Bottom line is people are allowed to believe whatever they want to in this country. We have freedom of religion and that is what Darwinian evolution is. And when you are speaking of origins of life, all sides have evidence, its just the only ones really afraid of the competition and debate are the atheists. They want to keep their monopoly on the schools so the reality that evolution is totally unproven doesn't slip out to the rest of the world.

Just to let you know that because millions of Americans are dumb as a bag of rocks and will probably put you in the White House, I will never support you or any of your goals. You are a liar, you are tied to terrorists, and you are using false campaign donations as funding for your new "change". The fathers that started this country years ago knew that GOD needed to be a part of this nation. We took prayer out of schools and children started killing children. We opened up our country to people wanting freedom and we now have tremendous immigration issues. Small things such as changing the logo's of the presidential seal and not respecting the playing of the national anthem let me know that you are more of a Hitler type dictator than a person that is good for ALL Americans and not just the African Americans. You and your Muslim heritage will never be supported by this old school GOD fearing American! Go to hell and meet Allah!

Thats actually misinformation.  McCain never gave the PLO anything ... it was some group headed by that former PLO member about education re: Palestine or something stupid.

Why is one a hate crime with a racial undertone but the other is funny and making people laugh?
Do you detect a double standard here?



</question>



<additional details>



What I'm concerned about is if Obama wins the election and is President for 4 years are we going to have to listen to how racist everyone is everytime they say they don't agree with his policies?



Instead of addressing important issues as we see them are those issues going to be turned into issues of race thereby diminishing the importance of Obama's Political system?
That is the #1 reason why I voted for McCain.

You are completely right about this. People need to be questioning Obama and questioning his past and who he will appoint and whos interest he really has at heart.



Also, what about the health records that should be confidental... that the media bullied out of McCain?



And the damning Obama video the New York Times has, that they refuse to release. If it was a McCain video it would have been out months ago.

Rome.



Ceaser has the ability to print out its own currency (which is unconstitutional not to mention tyrannical)



Our leaders are all corrupt and greedy and lovers of entertainment.  By extension the people are becoming disenfranchised by their leaders so they turn to drugs/sex/entertainment/violence which is being offered by our "benefactors".



Our water supply is fouled with pharmaceuticals and heavy metals, our infrastructure is failing, and our military is consuming our self created budget.  Our law makers are drunk on their own power and too weak and spineless to actually see they are the problem.



Germany is a copy of Rome, England was another copy, France was another copy, Russia will turn into rome and fall apart again, China has a very corrupt and nearly ineffectual centralized government.  America like the world is addicted to repeating everything Rome has done, and they are succeeding.



Israel is a powerful corrupt nation that lusts for war and power.  They lie to the world, America uses them as a fleeting state of power in the middle east, if our leaders dont wake up Israel will screw us over.  They could care less about anyone that isn't Jewish.  Don't believe me?  Who ruins every cease fire peace deal in the middle east?  Israel.



Israel is a fascist nation and has turned into Nazi Germany.  Rome is more socialist then fascist, just like America in how its congress is buying out its failing businesses.  America cant control the rate of immigration so it reverts to racial discrimination (just like Rome), we pick fights with everyone in the world until our massive standing army is stretched across the known world (just like Rome).  The President has the power to lie to the people just so he can stay in power (just like Rome).  According to the federal reserve the top 10% of American households hold 72% of American wealth, that's just like Rome too!)



The rich people write the rules and damn the rest of us into slavery.  The only sad thing is, if Jesus were to come back like he came to Rome the country would be too ruled by propaganda to recognize Him.  Without going into spirituality, we have transgressed us being a Roman Republic and now are into the final states of the Roman Empire.



Now we wait until the rich people run away to their version Constantinople when borders are over run and the country is reduced into a anarchy.

he left one college and was practically broke and then goes to Harvard which gets paid for without regular loans or scholarships that we know of, gets pushed to be a state Senator and in just 2 years, draws hundreds of millions to run for President. No birth cetificate ever shown nor what work was really done as a community organizer? Nothing significant ever accomplished?

No one will ever know the truth about his history.  With the internet in the sad state it is, people will create blurbs they can spout off as fact but meanwhile feed into a the delusion that there are only two parties running for president.  Neither McCain nor Obama want anything to change in office, and they dingle tax incentives and false promises in front of our faces.



Both parties are responsible for this financial crisis and neither party wants to take responsibility and actually change America, because they part are the wealthy elite that is ruining the middle class and turning the workers into slaves.  Obama is blinding people by saying that the problem is in Republicans and not in the unethical behavior of our policymakers who have done more to ruin the constitution than any single man ever could.



McCain and Obama have no real answers because they are wealthy and will never speak the truth about the Federal Reserve and how it came to be.  The Federal Reserve is not part of the government and its very existence pees on the graves of every soldier and true patriot who has given their lives defending this country from Tyranny.
Keeping the Federal Reserve is like keeping a cancerous tumor attached to your brain.



Instead of our leaders being the good people and actually trying to fix the problems they make us drink pharmaceutical water with large amount of heavy metals and other carcinogens.  We are dumping silver iodide in the air to seed clouds because for some reason the Earth cannot produce clouds as much as it used to.



McCain is lies, and Obama is a false prophet of hope.  He will do nothing but exacerbate the situation and there is a high chance America will erupt into a civil war if the politicians keep ignoring the real issues,  all they want to do is win votes and hear themselves talk.  Fools!

I'm in the same boat....I'm on do not call number, Obama sheep are stalking me via telephone.



I'm a registered DEM, and made the mistake of being honest with them.  They called last week and said "We would like to double check that you will be voting Obama" and I said no I won't...the woman said "WHAT?  YOU WON'T???"



Now they are calling me 3-4 times a day, leaving messages, etc.

Of all the other really fun Halloween decorations, I find anyone hung in effigy to be repulsive. Just yesterday I passed a decoration that was as disheartening as it was macabre. It was an imagine of a teen male hung from a tree and a ladder next to it positioned as if it had just been kick out by the person hanging. A complete glorification of suicide.



Halloween isn't about killing anything it is about spirits and allowing them to live on this plane again for a short time of remembrance.
Sadly, We have become a culture that glorifies death and violence. But to your question. I would find Obama's image hung in effigy as appalling as was Sarah Palin's image!

According to the news it was done today in Missouri and of course it did not go over well. I heard a blurp about it on the TV.



I don;t see how this is any differenct that Palin being hung in effigy, or for instance Clinton (Bill) maxk Nixon masks and any other that is used to celebrate halloween. '



The cry of racism will no doubt be thrown out there though, then tomoorow the came screamers will talk about how far we as a society have come. Until both Palin and Obama can be equally hing in effigy, we are still in the middle of race problems.

Punishment sends warning/signal of what is right(acceptable) and what is wrong(unacceptable) in society. Education can tell someone the rights and wrongs, but it doesn't ensure that everyone will abide by it.



Criminals should be given a 2nd chance, but only after they have realised their mistakes through some form of punishment eg. jail term.Sending them to school without further consequences may embolden them to commit more crimes since they can get away with the crimes easily with little punishment.



A fair education system educates. A fair punishment system also educates. Punishment in itself is an educational tool. Just as you can reward one for good behaviour, you should punish for bad behaviour.



Some hardcore criminals are a danger to society. Until they are reformed, confining them to jail would help ensure the safety of the general public.

What you need are not "arguments. What you need are facts and figures.  Specifically: findings from studies conducted by social scientists and rehabilitation professionals that show that education, rather than punishment, correlates with  lower rates of repeat offenses.



You can find such studies in a variety of social science/psychology/education databases.  Any university has them--or use a school or library Internet portal to a university library database.



"Arguments" that aren't backed up by evidence are not arguments--they are unsupported opinion s and that is all they are.



Good luck to you!

If Obama had responded in the same way to the 9/11 attack as Bush by starting a war with Iraq, not finishing the war he started with Afghanistan, allowing torture, and a laundry list of other misuses of power, Obama would be hated the same way that Bush is.



Following the 9/11 attacks, Bush had the unanimous support of this country and most of the world.  He frittered it away for political and personal purposes.  He deserves the disdain that people feel toward the Bush administration.

I am so sick of people blaming Clinton for 9/11. First, the FBI knew about the attack before it was going to happen. They had friggin documents IN THEIR HAND and they did nothing. Second, attacking Iraq for 9/11 is the equivelent of attacking Mexico for Pearl Harbor. There is no connection between Iraq and 9/11 but Bush needed a way to get in there and get Sadaam because he made his daddy look bad. And it's kinda funny to note that Bush is quoted on video saying he found out about the attacks BEFORE he went into the school, yet the press video shows him being told about them while he was doing the reading. Uh, conspiracy? He either knew about it before or he's just dumb. Since this is Bush we're talking about it could be either, or both. Take your pick. I think if anyone else had been president at the time, Obama included, we would have been in an entirely different predicament than the one we're in now. Instead, the world hates America more now than ever. That man, and I use that term loosely, is the worst thing to ever happen to that country. I pity the fool that has to go in there and clean it all up now.

How do you feel about the bailout plan NOW?



Doesn't it give you a warm fuzzy feeling to know that the average financial sector executive end of the year bonus was lowered by aprox. 1/4 to "only" $685,000.00? That's down from $1.1 million. This is a bipartisan issue. I don't recall any polling of constituents in my district. WE are the people, and the majority of THE PEOPLE didn't get a say in this bailout BS. All those people who lost their retirement, I feel bad for you, however: INVESTING CARRIES RISK! If you are retired , or close to it YOU SHOULD HAVE HAD YOUR MONEY IN LOW RISK/SLOW GROWTH BONDS AND BILLS!

Chris, I couldn't agree with you more. I also learned some other disturbing news about the bailout the other day . When Europe passed their version of the bailout there were provisions placed in it so that banks could only use this money to stimulate the economy via loans to consumers and businesses and could not hoard the money nor use it to give dividend payments to their stock holders. NO SUCH PROVISIONS were placed in the American version of the plan. It has been suggested that banks could use as much as half of this money for dividend payments to their stockholders. Hows that set with you being that lawmakers told us this bailout was not a bailout of Wall Street ? Is this government just asking for a civil revolt or uprising or what ?

In all military technicality, yes, even the president, as Commander in Chief of the military, is expected to salute the flag.  The flag outranks everyone, even the president (though "flag" is not capitalized, as it is in your question).  Has Barack been schooled in military protocol?  He was a lawyer at Harvard, not a cadet at the USMA.  Has he failed to salute the flag at moments when you think he should have?  Well, he isn't president yet, and civilians do not (and are not expected to) salute the flag.  You must admit this, and gracefully accept my reproach.  Barack has done no wrong by not saluting the flag thus far because he is NOT Commander in Chief and to have saluted the flag as a senator would have been presumptuous and, frankly, rude.



Would you like to see him salute the flag whenever he passes it as president?  I think that would be neat.  Once he is president.  Not before.  Did George W. Bush always salute the flag?  Did you monitor him to see if he did?  Was he being unpatriotic whenever he didn't?  I get the feeling you don't care so much about what George did as you care about what Barack has not done to your satisfaction, even though what he has not done he was never supposed to do.



Civilians do not salute the flag.  Only people in the military do.  That is as it should be.  Presidents are in the military.  Barack is not president yet.  For him to salute the flag as a civilian would have been utterly ridiculous.



(Quick aside: as Commander in Chief, he is one of the few people not in uniform who may still correctly salute a flag-- MAY).



But as has already been said, this question is "old and boring."

Thank you for sharing your patriotism, and more importantly for having patriotism.

Now for all the numbnuts that naysay you in their answers, they lack the courage to stand up for the freedom of speech and press that they're taking for granted in this forum.  Oh well.

Religious differences is the number cause for a country to progress.
Looking into US, China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Russia, Germany, France, Canada and many more. They are diversified, multi racial but they don't seem to have so much as we do. Why ???
What do all these countries do differently than INDIA that we could adopt.



I'm sure to expect, our politicians are the ones who create this racial issues. So with the Lok Sabha elections fast approaching, name one party that every INDIAN could follow with enough justifications on stability and progress.

You and me. If you want to change it don't look for Government to do it. And what is Government you and me. That's why I say don't look for other if you want to change and the change starts from you & me. Don't care what other say do what you want do to, do it.



Lok Sabha elections for the nation not for region or religion or cast it is for the nation and elect from two national parties not from regional national party.(you know what is this no NDA  or UPA just Congress or B.J.P.) Make center strong,  Strong  national government can do things not like this NDA or UPA. they are just doing five years doing nothing. If one wants to do other party don't want. We have seen it. Thing in this way in your house your father is the boss what ever he says every body fallows. And things go wrong blame your father only. And if your father says one thing your mother says one thing and your elder brother says one thing then what will you do. When things go good no body blame any body and things go wrong every body will blame each other. No body wants to take it. Government is also same.

It is not only our politicians and political parties that have caused the religious divide in our society but the people also have contributed to this malady.While swearing by secularism on one side,our politicians rely heavily and extensively on the religious vote banks which is what is causing rifts and ill will between different communities.I am told that in the days of yore,religion was a very private affair and practised exclusively within the confines of homes.But religion has not only reared its ugly fiery head but the fire is being fueled and stoked by the very religious heads who have begun using politics and politicians in



the furtherance of their mission and activities.In India we have various brands of politics such as politics of caste,region,linguistics,
opportunism and the virulent type  viz.religion.And so long as these divisions thrive our politicians will milk the situation for all its worth because their very survival depends on them.Unfortunately,there is no single party that can be said to rise above all these considerations.
Sad but true.

Against Obama's tax plan, are they being greedy?



I would like to know why people who make "good money" are against paying higher taxes. If I had reach a certain level of "comfort" I would not mind paying higher taxes to help those in need. There are a lot of people that cannot afford medical bills because insurance is not only too costly but does not cover everything. I know a business owner who is against Obama's tax plan because he refuses to pay higher taxes even though he happens to have 4 luxury cars 2 homes and 1 vacation house. So I guess he rather have people dying unable to pay their medical bills rather then him helping his fellow Americans by paying higher taxes. Now that I do think is "unpatriotic". In my opinion I believe that just like it is your job to be a good neighbor, it should be your job to be a good American. Please give me your opinion, I am a grown woman so I don't need any insults I am just stating my opinion and I would not mind to hear your side. To repeat the question; Are they being greedy?

"that government is best which governs the least," what does "least" mean? It means that government should be rigidly limited to those functions that only the government can perform. Otherwise government will inevitably expand until it runs everything. That is why Thomas Jefferson described "a wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouths of labor the bread it has earned."

Maybe it's because they already pay the highest taxes in the free world. The greedy ones are the socialist democrats who want to steal this money from people who earned it and then give it to people who don't deserve it (a form of buying votes- that is the democrat party). It's the democrat party that is greedy for power. The sad thing is that they don't know what to do with the power once they have it but to destroy  the country.

"Sweetie". Um, excuse me, do we know you?
Why would you choose to use a term of endearment when you speak to females?  That is quite sexist to reduce a college educated, professional, intelligent woman to "sweetie".
By the way, the "ranch" you refer to, is HERS, that she, Mrs. Palin, worked for and bought HERSELF.

I am sorry, my dear, but despite your protest at the end of your "question" it seems you have done a number of things wrong.  You will need to start taking responsibility for yourself: getting up in time for school ON YOUR OWN would be a nice start.  Not stealing would be another.  "Really good reasons" for being truant from school are seldom "really good."  If it's a 45 minute walk to school, you will do it if you yourself are to blame for missing the bus.  School goes all day, you know, even if you are late.



What's going to happen to you?  I have to tell you that from what you've written here, probably nothing good.  I don't know exactly what "Dan Street" is, so I can't tell you your chances.  It sounds like your repeated experiences with the law are not causing you to change your behavior much.  You will need to learn to keep yourself in line-- that is part of adulthood.  Scary, I know.  Taking responsibility for yourself can be very frightening.  You aren't too young to begin.  Good luck.

It's kind of hard to understand what you're saying, what is Dan Street? If it's jail, I really doubt you'll go to there for just not going to school. You are a minor so it is your parents' responsibility to make sure you get an education. If you just want to graduate school early and become emancipated, so you can work or attend college, there is a State Proficiency Exam that you can take. It is the equivalent of a GED.

Some points;



You say, "she was only one who could keep me in line ".  That's not true.



You're old enough now that you can start taking responsibility for keeping yourself in line.  If you sleep in, then go to bed earlier.  When you think about stealing, just tell yourself not to.



The fact that your mother is signing custody over to your friend's mom should make everything work out okay, so I don't see any reason why you should go to Dan Street.



But you've got to play by the rules to make this work.  That means that you do what your friend's mother tells you to do, even if you don't agree.  She's smarter than you are because she's not getting caught and sent to jail.  so don't give her any backtalk and do what she tells you.



Remember that.

Goodbye America...land of freedom...?



No bashing on either side...just look at the changes that will happen if obama takes over with his socialized healthcare...what Cuba has. It's true what someone said....Cuba is moving towards freedom, while America is moving the other way. Many people admire America and want to BE here...look how many immigrants, legal and illegal thirst for this land. What hurts me is that, immigrants, especially Cubans who are fleeing from a socialist regime, dream of this land of the free and will end up with the exact same healthcare they had in Cuba. They look upon America for hope....and now, if we get socialized medicine, what difference is there?



America was NEVER to take a step towards Marxism....change, change, change, go to another country if you want change. It will hurt millions more than many think.

McCain didn't make that much because what he stands for is not as popular.  So his shortfalls in campaign donations should give you an idea that if he were picked as president, there would be lots of shortfalls there as well.

Wealth, as mentioned is a philosophical concept, if you hoard your dollars they become worthless, they are notes of market merit or debt. You have acquired currency from contributing a product or service to the 'market place', dollars are not a commodity no matter how a loan officer tries to sell you on the concept, dollars are currency.



The funny thing to me about all the railing against socialism is that we already collect and spend taxes with that agenda, but only outside America.
Which actually circumvents the problem with socialism, that being that it is the government which decides how the funds will be spent and that leads to communist ideology.
Unfortunately that means Americans are willing to send their taxes dollars through the 'world bank' to Iran to teach their farmers global practices (regarding irrigation) but not spend it on American needs.
