Please Help! I need good music editors!?



Okay so heres the down low. I need a awesome music editor. (CAN BE MORE THAN ONE DIFFERENT MUSIC EDITOR)

I need to be able to do a few things with a song. (If some of these are even possible)



- Take out vocals in song
- Take out instruments in song (So only vocals remain)
- Edit the pitch of voices
- Edit speed of voices
- Edit speed of song



And so on. Other regular effects that come with music makers I would use, but arent as important as the ones I need.



So if anyone knows any awesome music makers, that could do all (or atleast some) of those effects can you please tell me the name of the music editor or send me a link so I can download. It would mean so much to me, thank you very much.

Cool Edit Pro 2 will do the majority of those things, Acoustica MP3 Audio Mixer or Acoustica Mixcraft 3 will also do the pitch and rates as well! Some ppl like Audacity but i dont really have any experience with it tho! Oh and AV Music Morpher Gold! most has demos for download on www.download.com
