<question>



My ex wants me back.....?



We broke up late last year. I ended things because we fought too much.  A month later he seemed to really be improving and I suggested we get together and talk about a reconciliation.  He declined, and then we didn't speak for 3 months.  We've been friends for 6 months, and he admitted last week that he refused to reconcile with me because he had another girl.  He assured me that going out with this girl was the best thing because it made him realise how much he loved me.  I feel hurt, angry and duped because he didnt want me back then because of another woman. Ever since this revelation, I've been feeling very depressed and insecure.  How do I overcome these feelings?

Please DON'T tell me to move on, I'm trying to move on, but I need some help on how to deal with this feelings.  Thank you



</question>



<additional details>



By the way....he was not seeing this other woman before we broke up. I know this because of my gut feelings at the time.  They are always right.



Wrong Joy....wrong.  Gut was working just fine thank you



Polly you are talking about yourself, you've been standing in front of a mirror far too long.  I don't stalk, and I don't have sex with the ex either.



Polly, please.  I did not say everyone else was wrong, and I'm only insulting the people who were abrupt and rude.  I am sober, but you are right I am terribly confused, and I am blinded by that.

my dear gal, 
I have a strong feeling we have rowed in the same boat!
sorry, didn't realize it was contagious!
Just breaking up with what needs to be a real break, because that is why we call our hearts 'broken' I think....what has helped me in this feeling thing...is to make a list, after being VERY honest with myself...and list all the things that you can recall about him that made you all argue...and what are all the things about him that made you mad, nuts, angry, irritated, or just hurt...was he rude....was he mean, there are so many things to consider and you may WANT to be a little irked when you are writing this list. That way, you will be clearer to yourself, IF you are really wanting to move on.  I've had to do it! I think it was some of the best most stringent therapy that I've ever had with myself!
Would you really want to go back to the arguing times if that is all you had to look forward to? When you feel so melancholy about the 'good times' get out this list and remind  yourself, a little smack upside the head, so to speak, and tell yourself "WHAT Was I Thinking???"
Don't focus on his moving on...take your own journey, in your own time!
Take care of YOU now, honey, let the bum go his way, and focus on being the best you that you can be...there are so many wonderful blokes out there that are waiting for a sweet new gal like you!
Good luck! Keep your chin up!

I would go out with him a few times and see if your feelings are truly what you think they are.  I would also explain to him your feelings and what you are thinking.  It will not be easy but you need to ensure he basically makes up for everything that happenend in the past.  If you find that your feelings with him are not matching then you may just have a good friend.

If you don't want to hear "move on" then try this.  You SHOULD take back someone who you fought so much with you couldn't keep a relationship going.  Falling in love all over again when you think about the other chick he was bangin away on and couldn't be straight with you at the time.  It sounds like you, like so many people can't figure out why you keep burning your hand on the stove.  Match made in heaven I say.

Your feelings are understandable. I hope first that you realize the "other girl" does not reflect badly on you, but on your ex. It would not matter if you were a rocket scientist, Perfect 10 -- your ex has issues and is just using women to attempt to increase his own self-esteem/make himself happy. He is using you like people use TV -- to keep himself entertained. I know you are not falling for his rationalizations. You deserve better. You were right when you left him the first time. He is an unhappy man who will make the women he is with unhappy. Please realize it is not about you.



With that said....self-esteem/self worth cannot be based on other people's actions or feelings, so it must be based on certain truths you tell yourself. If you were happy with yourself and confident in your path, then he could not shake it.



Take a look at your life (with or without the ex) and decide if you are happy with yourself, where you are and where you are going. If not, this period of feeling insecure is really just your inner signal going off to let you know it is time to step up and challenge yourself to a better life. What is it that you need? It is time for change and more than likely, change that has nothing to do with the ex. Hang in there.



Good luck. Hope this helps.

well i think he is a very good guy to not get back with you while he was seeing someone else. and i know its hard but you are the one who ended. he wasn't going to stay single forever. and him seeing how much he missed you by dating the other shouldn't make you self conscious, think of it this way... you are so great that he couldn't stay with her because you are so much better. but i know hoe you feel. it hurts. but i think if you still care about him you should give him another chance. odds are he only started seeing the other girl to get over you. and it obviously isn't work. but i also think that it is very important that you tell him how the other good made you feel. good luck.

Sit down face to face and have a "real" talk straight from the heart.  No fighting allowed this time.  Make a list if you have to but talk quietly and gently.  Communication is the key here.  Sounds like he really does love you to me.  He didn't lie to you.  He just didn't go back with you because he had someone else for a short time.  Not a crime is it?  Don't be depressed or insecure.  Depressed because he now says he loves you?  Insecure because he had someone else for a short time?  Don't let him slip away because you feel jilted.  Your are not.

Your gut wasn't working because he had plans all along and you know it. You just didn't want to admit it. Your husband can not take you back just because he doesn't have this other women in his life now. You have to be the one and only and i am afraid that he will keep on looking because you don't seem to be serious enough to make him think about what he has done.

Of course you are depressed, rejection is a hard emotion to deal with. However you can get over him. your not the only person who has gotten over  jerks like him and you can do it too. Stop telling yourself there is hope because there isn't. He would have to prove to me he is worth your love and that you can trust him again. that will take time. Keep telling yourself that your worth more than allowing someone to treat you anyway they want to. Love yourself first. Distance yourself from him and don't contact him until YOU want to. That may never be and if it isn't, that's fine too!

i would feel angry & hurt too !, i would also be flattered that he considers you much better than what he experienced with another girl.  on a positive note, he was completely honest with you, which is much better than being creepy and trying to sweet talk his way through.  have you experienced other relationships so you can tell him the same? maybe you should play the field too.

btw there is no need to move on right away but i would weigh your options to see if having him in your life would be more harm than good.  maybe a third time try on this relationship is a charm! take time and don't feel like there is a right and wrong answer, follow your intuition ! :)

I would agree with Joy...  "We broke up"?  I don't think so.  You got dumped.  I know this because "YOU" suggested a reconciliation.



I know it's difficult, but you must leave this man be.  He's not interested in you.  He may sleep with you occasionally.  What single man wouldn't.  But I don't think that is the type of relationship you seek.



And frankly, he doesn't want you.  Therefore, find some new guy to stalk...  OK?

EDIT:  OK fine your not having sex with him.  So?  Now you're the brilliant one and everybody else is wrong....  Don't you see?  You're stuck on stupid, and insulting people that are trying to help only makes it worse.  If you would sober up, you might be able to see things straight...  However, until then, this guy needs a restraining order against you...  Because you're stalking him.

<question>



How can I tell my partner I don't want anything to do with his ex-wife and her boyfriend?



I have been living with my partner for almost a year we have been together for 2 years.  I am now living in the marital home half of which I now own and pay half the mortgage and bills, whilst I did not feel comfortable living in the ex’s house at first it is very convenient for the time being albeit I understandably want to make the house “my own” by redecorating from top to bottom.  My partner is in the process of getting a divorce from his ex-wife as she left him because she was having an affair with their builder.  She and my partner have been apart for approximately 3 years and she has recently (since January) started seeing the builder chap again although they are not living together.  My partner and his ex have a 15 year old daughter with whom I get on very well who lives with her mother.  I have no relationship with my partner’s ex-wife apart from when she drops their daughter at ours or if we get invited to parties or dinner etc by mutual friends.  This suits me fine as his ex is not really my cup of tea, but I am always polite and courteous when I am in her company but I don’t particularly like her.
The other day my partner asked me how I would feel if he got his ex-wife’s boyfriend (the builder who she unscrupulously chased, seduced and had an affair with) to give us a quote for the building work we need doing on our house.  I thought he was joking and said I did not want that man anywhere near my house!  My partner explained that he’s actually a good builder I said I didn’t care if he was the Lord God Almighty of Masters Builders he’s not touching our house.



So imagine how I felt when the other day when he said to me that he’d spoken to his daughter about the builder doing the work on the house and she thought it was a great idea.  I was so incensed that he’d gone over my head and mentioned it to his daughter. How DARE he do that!!



When I confronted him, he said, well if I can let bygones by bygones, why can’t you?



The simple fact is I do NOT want his ex-wife or her builder boyfriend in my life.  In fact I find the whole situation very incestuous and uncomfortable.  I accept that our paths will cross if we are invited socially by mutual friends to parties etc or if she drops their daughter round our house, but I am certainly not inviting him or PAYING him my hard earned money for him to do work on our house.



Am I going completely crazy or am I the only one with any morals or scruples here?

Completely understandable, this man really did cause a lot of pain for your hubby at one stage in his life, and there are plenty of other builders out there that are probably equally as good.

It's your property too, so you have a right to disagree. Maybe you should look up some other builders and suggest them. He may feel fine about letting the bloke who broke up his marriage into his house, but that doesnt mean you have to.

Stay staunch, and he will eventually come around.

Good Luck

What's he done to you, exactly? He's not been in a relationship with your man, has he?

Bear in mind that your boyfriend may be trying to keep things friendly for the sake of his daughter - in which case, good for him.

His ex and her man are no threat to you - so be magnanimous. It's not like she'll be round every day doing a bit of plastering for him, is it.

I see where you're coming from - but there's a bit of an over reaction here, I think.

I agree with you - why should you have this man in your house? He has nothing to do with your life. He's not even the father of your partners child.

I would however question why my partner would want to do this. Is there a deeper under current to all of this.? Is he still carrying a torch for his ex wife - you need to ask him these questions. If he gets defensive I would say that there is something amiss.

Don't budge on your decision - you are entitled to one after all. Get other quotes and put them under his nose and settle for one of them and nothing else. Best of luck :-)

You are right, letting the builder so close to your common life is a bit weird, but the same time you make too big matter from this question. The builder should disturb mainly your partner and not you.  With some malice I would say that you may even find the builder a tempting man, and cheat with him on your partner, if your partner finds that men so perfect and wanted around you two. So I think, you a bit overact this problem.  That is an other question, if you also put your own money into that renovation than you have to have your "voting right", too, how to spend it.

No i totally see your point so therefore i'd play him at his own game & go over his head & get some independant quotes myself! He will then question what you have done only to be replied of 'exactly what you done my love'!!

You might want to meet him in a public place to *ahem* hand over the kids.  He's less likely to act up in public.  Abusers, if nothing else, are aware that their behavior is socially unacceptable and go through great pains to cover it up.  I would encourage you however, to really talk to your kids, if possible bring in a mediator or 3rd party, to see if they are not suffering the same abuse.

you should stop all contact with you ex.  BUT with that said the kids should not.  when he is (and I'm guessing here) to pick-up the kids then you two need to meet someplace public IE. police station.  this way you don't have to hear him. and the abusive behavior should stop (at else towards you).  now if your kids are old enough they can choose not to see him (16yr old) so they won't have to go thru that also.  good luck your ex IS NOT a real dad yes we all get mad but that no reason to degrade your kids in the middle of the street

MY ex did the SAME stuff. Do what you have to to make it stop. It can get alot worse. We have 3 girls together,they where 11, 6, and 3 when I left. They are 23 18 and 15 now.He NEVER stopped acting this way and telling my kids lies about me when he had them,  he tried getting to all of them but only got to one. IT WAS HELL. Five years after our divorce he remarried and took us through a three year custody BATTLE. That's when my youngest and oldest FINALLY told me what was going on. You would not believe the stories he told my girls about me. OK, Long story short, He did not get custody, The two that figured out what was going on, just did not want to go with him, I did not make them. my middle child, He till this day has her brainwashed. She hates her sisters, me, my entire family. For some reason she believes everything that comes out of his mouth. She even does not believe he abused me( I have police reports, the girls saw it , and witness. He told her I paid them to lie. She is 18 now, she believes him, Very sad, it brakes my heart. I cry for her. I have gotten really close to God through this. Look, Do what you have to, don't take this lightly.

Fortunately I have never beeen in your situation but have you tried perhaps having him pick up and return the kids to a friend you trust? Or some other impartial third party?
From your post I get the impression it is your he abuses and not the kids, although his comment about the 16 year old is, to my mind, out of order and might damage his esteem. But, at 16 he has the choice of whether he visits with his father or not. 
So, I suppose my thinking is that as he clearly takes no notice of solicitors letters then maybe you have a few choices..........depending on the ages of the kids. I don't think you can stop a 16 year old from seeing his father if that is his choice. But if younger children are involved you could try to stop contact, but at what price? If impartial collection and return (sorry to make the kids sound like parcels, not intnended) is not feasible then what about supervised visits? Again that may, or maynot, be an option.
If you decide that he must stop visiting because of his behaviour towards you and the kids then maybe it is time to stop the solicitors threatening letters and moved toward obtain an exclusion order..........not sure if that's what it is called. But the courts can order that a person is not permitted to be within a certain distance from you and the kids. If he defies the order it is punishable by the courts.

I am mad of my husband, is it good to entertain my ex-boyfriend chatting and to express my problems?



My ex-boyfriend is a foreigner and still willing to accept me anytime I broke up with my husband. We have 2 kids, and so far, my husband is doing his best for the family. My husband is working abroad but everytime he mentioned his co-workers wife is already there, I feel mad of him, why others wife is there, why others wants to be together and my husband wouldnt? and with this, I have no choice but to chat my ex-boyfriend just to express the madness. Actually, I am a very secretive person. No one of my family and friends may knows whatever my problem. My intention of going there just to work to help for the income of the family and also for us to be together, I feel bored living far from my husband. Is this right guys that I warned my husband if he don't decide to bring us there where he work, up to my youngest reaches 7 y.o, then I will leave, to go anywhere I may be happy. I really feel mad at him.

I guess the problem is stuck on the "not going well" communications between u and ur husband. Tell her strongly and convince him that u have problems with the way u both live in a distance for frequent times, even though for the reason of financial support.  Both of u must find the solution, whether u go there follows where he works, or he find other job where his wife and kids live. Calm down a bit, think over, open good ways to communicate and dont ever think about getting cheat even just chat with an ex bf coz it doesnt worth that much u think! good luck.

Chatting with an ex-bf about problems with your husband is asking for trouble and I think you already know that.  The person you need to talk to is your husband.  You say you have no choice but to talk to your ex-bf and that you are so secretive that none of your friends or family know of your problems... that's just a cop out... sounds to me like you're looking for a way out of your marriage and you want to put it on your husband.  If you gave your husband an ultimatum of you going to where he works to find a job so you can help add to the family finances by the time your youngest child reaches 7 years old that you will leave and go somewhere else where you can find happiness is fine but don't bring someone else into the picture before that time is up or you will be guilty of adultry and not be able to hold your head high that you did every thing right to keep your marriage together.  Say goodbye to your ex-bf.... do not complicate your already complicated marriage and start taking one of your friends into your confidence (a female friend).  Good luck..

Your children may already have learned that abuse in a marriage (or rudeness) is acceptable behavior.  Your children deserve a happy mother who is not beaten and put down by their father.  If you can manage it, try to get out.  Get child support from him and he can have visitation, but he doesn't deserve someone he doesn't respect.

Girl! you better pack your bags get your children and leave ASAP!  before it too late. Don't worry about your kids! They will be happy when you are happy. They don't want to see their mother bruised ans unhappy. You can arrange visiting times for the father so that they still have a contact with him.. Your kids will think that violence in the family is a normal thing if you don't take action immediately and teach them that's wrong. Do not for a second think that he might change and things could get better. once a beater always a beater!! Run for your life! take your kids with you for their safety!! I have lived in a violent relationship for longtime and never gets better!! Trust me. NOBODY DESERVES YOUR TEARS AND YOUR BLOOD. Good luck and my heart really goes out to you and your children.

Your not wrong for looking after yourself because that's what you will be doing if you divorce him.
You can't stay together just for your children because your children will start to see that.
Your children will respect you more in the long run if you did divorce.
When there old enough to understand that's when you can tell them why you had a divorce they will understand.
Your life is not happy if your thinking this and life is short for all this, you are wasting your life being sad when you could be happy with your children.

Call the domestic violence helpline as fast as you can. The thing is you have lost your confidence due to abuse and you think you can't get any better. The shelter will solve your financial problems and the counselors will help you gain your confidence back. It's much better for the children if you are strong this time and get them what they deserve. A happy mother and healthy children. It's not healthy the way you are tolerating for the sake of children! You are not doing anybody a favor by staying. Get out fast!

NO your not wrong. you should have called the cops when he hit you. document it though, date and time and issue going on.... if you have brusing then take pics. and go file a report with the police, take out a protection order, hire a lawyer and kick him out. you question about the kids.. do you want the kids to continue to see their father abuse you? I waited too late, my kids were 11 and 14, and they had already learned that their fathers abuse was in their eyes "normal" and how you treat your mother... and they still do so to this day, they think their father was/is the victom because I divorced him. dont ask him for a divorce, you GO GET A DIVORCE.. its an attitude diff.. if you hem haw about it he will abuse you worse and walk all over you. stand up for yourself and your kids!!!!!!!!!

Omg, I was in the same position as you !
Get real and get a divorce, your kids are suffering already cant you see that ?
I truly believe that certain people should not be in a relationship at all as they have no relationship skills, this man is one of them.
Forget that you loved him once, forget that he gave you sperm, think about yourself for a change.
Your kids must see him of course, but you should cut off all personal ties to this animal.
Get down to a solicitor and get some legal advice.

If your husband hits you, get out. Most domestic situations only escalate until someone is seriously hurt or killed.



Your children will eventually know what is going on if they don't already. If they see the way your husband treats you, they will accept that as the way they should act and will do the same in their relationships. You not only owe it to yourself, but to your children and their future partners to get out of your marriage now. If your husband hits you, call the police, obtain a restraining order and have him removed from your home.

Good Luck

Yes.  Emotional and physical abuse are causes for divorce.  Your children will be fine.  They will probably go through the normal things children of divorced parents go through...but it is better that than believe how you are living is how a man and a woman should live.  I am sure you want better for your children.  It is more harmful for them to see this and think it is how things are, than to divorce.

Part of me wants to say that for such an important decision you should not be relying on the advice of strangers who have nothing better to do than playt Agony Auntie - but on the other hand, I know from experience what great therapy this board can be, and just by asking your question you can make your own mind clearer to yourself. 
Children should not be brought up in an environment where one parent gets away with abusing the other. Of course, kids are brought up in this kind of environment all the time, but it;s not good for them and makes it hard for them to establish healthy and respectful relationships when they grow up. If you have sons, they must learn that women are not to be treated in this way. If you have daughters, they must see from your example that there is no need ever to put up with abuse. 
The way he treates the children will determine how much access he should have to them. If he is a bad husband but a good Dad, then you ought to split custody 50-50.

You shouldn't put up with abuse and violence for anything.  What happens if he really goes overboard?  What is going to happen with your children then?

Besides, children grow up and leave home, and then it leaves you on your own with this horrible man.  In my view, you have put up with this for too long.  Just make arrangements, and leave.

Other than the obvious reasons of physical and emotional abuse, the main reason you need to get away from your husband IS because of your children.  It will be a lot better for them (and you) to get away from the violence and hostility.  Do you really want your children to grow up thinking it's all right to abuse (or tolerate abuse from) their spouses?  Get yourself and your children away from your husband, and call the police if he hits you again.  Finally, get yourself some new friends.  They should be supporting your decision instead of convincing you and your children to stay in a dangerous situation.

You have to remember, they are YOUR parents, you aren't THEIR parents. They are adults and have been married for enough years that by now they should know how to communicate properly with each other. You can't help your parents, only they can do that.



I would suggest they get marriage counselling, unless their marriage has reached the point that the only thing they still have in common with each other is fighting.

I wouldn't worry about your parents, they certainly aren't worry about your feelings and how their fighting affects your life. If they cared, they would do what ever it takes to behave like adults when they are around you and save their fighting for the privacy of their own home when they are alone.

Tell them it hurts you when they fight in front of you that you and your husband would never behave that way in front of them. They need to get married counselling and if they don't care about their marriage, then at least they could show they care about you, by not putting you through their constant fighting in front of you anymore.

If they feel they can't do that out of love for you, then you tell them you can't see them "together" anymore until they do.

yes, or you could lose your kids.

if it is something you have always gone along with you are going to have a hard time getting him to stop.  if it's something that just started i would just lay the law down.

tell him, point blank, i don't care if you get high as long as it's not around the kid or in the house.  as far as going to get it for people you are going to get caught, it's just a matter of time.

Oh, h3ll yes.

I don't have kids.  Kids DO NOT need to be exposed to this!  They have enough challenges in this world as it is.  They need to have straight parents who concentrate on raising THEM.

I used to be a heavy doper.  I got tired of living my life in a fog.  I got tired of it getting in the way of our relationship.  This is what I said to my ex, "I don't want it in my house, I don't want it in my life.  If you are going to smoke dope, don't bring it here."

He said he was going to quit but he didn't.  Ultimately, he chose pot and partying over me.

I would for sure leave with my kids. Simply because I wouldn't want them to be in that situation.  But I am sure you love them so maybe give them the chance to change to be a part of yours and your kids life.  If you mean anything to them they will change.  It may be a little while for them to get clean but it can happen.  Remember to be there with support and love.

Wow.. you really put up with that? Ever hear the saying, "you are the company you keep"? Unless you're keeping him around to feel like a better person by comparison, you have nothing to gain. Even if you are keeping him around to feel better about yourself because he's such a loser, that makes you look pretty shallow and indignant.

I'm a subscriber of the belief that whatever you do in the privacy of your own home is your business. in this instance if you want to smoke the occasional joint now and then so be it. however not around the kids. That's verbotten.

In addition, people coming around and either asking you where they can cop or his even selling alittle weed to someone will attract the attention of the local police. Nothing worse than watching TV, kids on the floor sipping milk and eating cookies when the door shatters and seven or eight narcs rush through the door, guns drawn.

Dopers will always sell someone down the river. Why? They're under the thumb of the police already or are getting thirty or fourty dollars for each controlled buy they do for the police. So...who cares about you and the kids. They got their money to go buy their dope. And at your expense because dipshit hubby/boyfriend conducts business like that under your roof.

So....does this open your eyes for you and make your decision a little easier?

what children grow up seeing they will bring into their own lives later.u need to confront him, give him an ultimatum, and if it continues, get out of the marriage because it usually doesn't get any better.its one thing to smoke in the privacy of ones home, not around the kids, but when u bring others into your home, u run the risk of loosing your kids,getting arrested,not to mention the association with people u don't want in your home or around your kids.

A change in her patterns is one possible sign, yes. Taking her kid to the babysitter could be another sign, yes. Calling her hubby to see where he is... that's a big something... not sure what. If she is calling to say I love you... that is one thing. However, if all she does is ask where he is... that is fishy.



It's not hard to catch a cheater. All he has to do is lie about where he is and follow her. If she is cheating... she will get caught. It don't sound like she is very good at it.

It's hard to tell and you don't also want to be too presumptious. I mean maybe she wants to impress her husband with her sexy lingerie. And maybe she wants to spend more time shopping and hanging out with friends on her day off. So, it is hard to judge based on minimum evidence. But if you are really concerned you need to wait for bigger proof, like if you see her repeatedly with another guy and she avoids talking about him. Or if she is buying expensive gifts which are not intended for her husband. So, you need more evidence before coming to a conclusion. But yes sudden changes are always suspicious, but remember: innocent until proven guilty. 
Hope this helps,
Take care

How can I get my husband to understand that I don't want sex when he's been drinking?



Alcohol has always been a sore spot in our marriage, but I'm NOT using sex as a bargaining chip. I don't mind if he has a couple of drinks a night, but it IS a problem because he drinks 1/2 a bottle of vodka or moonshine (yes, moonshine) in a night. He slurs his words, is a lot more rude than he is when he's sober and really clingy among other really annoying things, like grabbing my boobs or butt trying to "get me in the mood". He also totally reeks of whatever he was drinking that night. I feel really bad because I love having sex with him, and when he's not drunk I LOVE it, but having him wasted during sex makes me feel - well, awful. When I refuse him because of it, I feel bad too. He gets frustrated and a little upset when I refuse. I've tried gently letting him know that seeing him drunk turns me off, but he just rolls his eyes. He knows I don't find it sexy at all, but he still does it. I'm tired of it. I want sex, but not floppy drunk man sex. How can I finally get it through his head??



</question>



<additional details>



Any time I bring up his drinking and the fact that it bothers me, he gets defensive. If I did it while trying to turn him on he'd stop me, get pissed and go play video games.



Sorry, in the details above, by anytime I meant even when he is sober and in a good mood.

And calls me the B word.. I am 21... Seriously? My dad is a stupid alcoholic. You need to tell your husband he is an alcoholic and get him help. That sucks! I hate my dad when he is drunk. So I feel your pain, (In a way) my husband barely drinks. I drink more. Which I try really hard not to. BUT I Think you need to get him help. That is soo much booze and it hurts the relationship.

Making love/sex when one partner is super-drunk is definitely a turn-off!!

Since hinting to him is not working idea.. why don't you try an alternative way.

Perhaps you could dress up in really sexy lingerie (when he least expects it and not drunk) and turn him on. Casually mention to him that you love having sex with him and praise his ego. While you're teasing him, tell him that him drunk sex is a turn-off for you and that "this" (not being drunk) is way much better. His mind would be alert during this moment and hopefully, will sunk in. This is somewhat like a reinforcement for "good-behaviour/performance".

Alternatively, ask him to use a spare bed when he's that drunk. It shows you don't want to either sleep or have sex with him.



Good Luck!!

The issue here is not about not wanting sex with your husband when he's drunk.  It's about him getting drunk period!  You pretty much spelled that out in your opening sentence.

Alcohol has destroyed many marriages.  Wives have ended up being beaten up and emotionally scarred for life.  Children have been emotionally scarred for life.

You need to sit down with your husband when he's quite sober and explain to him in no uncertain terms that he has a serious drinking problem.  What you are experiencing with the inappropriate behavior during his drunken binges is only a symptom.  Things will continue to get worse.

You want to be in a full time marriage and you should not be content settling for less.  You need to explain to him that he is going to have to make a choice.  It's either you or his moonshine.  There is no in between on this.  Give me one good reason how there is any contentment being married to a drunk?

I'm sure you love your husband but unless you put your foot down and play hard ball you are enabling him to become more disabled.

Explain that until things change you will no longer be making love to a drunk so he may as well forget making it with you when he's been drinking.

Explain that you want a full-time loving husband and that marriage does not mean sharing one's life with a part-time drunk.

Explain that you will walk along side him and support him but unless he's willing to make the necessary changes you and he will have to spend some time apart.

If you don't do this then you will continue to make excuses for him.  Good luck.

How to get over an ex?



I finished with my b/f on Friday of 3 months.  We were compatible on every level and had really brilliant times, no arguments but he has an ex and small children and admitted he was not over her.

Things came to a head and I finished the relationship as I dont want to be second best.  I tried ot finish things a few times before that but he always talked me round.  He was upset and angry and told me he will never contact me again.

Now I feel gutted.  My logic tells me I did the right thing but I cant sleep or eat and I really miss him.  I have not contacted him and have used all my willpower to keep busy.  I have things lined up for the next two week-ends.



Sad thing is I am in my mid 30's and my daughter has grown up and I have met some real j*rks over the last 5 years.  He was the closest to what I have always wanted but there is his ex and young children.  His ex is not at all interested in him but he cant move on.



I dont want to be a rebound relationship and he assured me I wasnt and that he really cared for me.  Its so frustrating.  Should I just wait for him to contact me.  Why do I feel so crap?  Please help, any advice would be appreciated.  Is it normal how I am feeling?  xx

When we broke up i was devastated and my present girlfriend dont know it but i am not completley over my ex either i dont think there is anything she can do to change that or my ex i think it would be up to me to change it if it ever will. it sucks but i think if your guy you just broke up with is not over his ex your going to be second SOMETIMES! I dont think it means he dont want to be with you and love you or anything just maybe he is not over the lifestyle he had with her it may not even be the fact that he loves his ex just the lifestyle. so maybe you should find out what he is not over actually. he might not even know! lol

Sounds pretty normal how your feeling. Try to focus on positive things in your life, be kind to yourself, if you rent a movie get a feelgood not based around relationships, make sure you exercise regularly, only call up friends who make you feel good about yourself. Pretty obvious i know, but when your heads all over the place, you can forget the obvious. best of luck.

He sounds like a good guy, maybe you should try to make things up with him. Maybe you need to relax a little more and concentrate on having a good time. If you were fun to be with he would soon lose the attachment he has with his ex.

I know how he feels as I was in a similar relationship and it took me a few years to get over my ex, but now I couldn't be happier with the woman I'm with.

I'd give hinm another chance, if you can patch things up.

You are doing all the right things and the feelings you have are normal.

I dont think you should take him back.  He is not over his ex and why should you stick around being his nursemaid?  You should be in the throws of passionate exciting new love not having to think about all his baggage.

In time you will get over him and find someone who hits all the right buttons.

Good luck and DONT look back!!!!

In no way should you be second best in any relationship, I separated from my husband  over 5 yrs ago and in the past 5 yrs we have tried at least 3 times to try to reconcile, unfortunately  that has not happened, I so understand how gutted you feel, I still love my husband with my whole heart and the thought of him with another woman makes me sick to the stomach. I am 40 next month and I expect I will spend it alone, whereas I would love to be spending it with him.

Sad thing is he only wants to now be friends, the advice I can offer to you is that if you truly care and love this man then be with him and help him to get over his ex, there is nothing worse then sitting there wondering what they (him) might be doing, who they may be with, even are they thinking about you at all. Don't wait for him to contact you, as he won't, men never think about those things, you make the first move, sit down with him and tell him what you are feeling, they cannot read our minds no matter how much we want them too. Be brutally honest with him, discuss with him ways to help him get over her, but you have to remember and understand that they will always have a connection with the 2 of them having a child. What you can do there is make things allot easier for both of you, suggest ways to spend the time together with the 3 of you (you, Him and Child), and enjoy the time you all have, I know that my daughter has a wonderful time when she is with him , even though its only the 2 of them.



I also so understand what you are saying about the j*rks out there, I have tried and after a couple of attempts have decided that I need to spend more me time and work on trying to sort my things out and I am busy everyday, but the nights are lonely and hard alone, and thats when I think about things.



If he is telling you that you are not the rebound girl then believe him, most of the time they will tell us what they are thinking. It is so normal what you are feeling, and nothing will change until you take that step that feels right FOR YOU!! As you said he is the closest to what you want in a partner.

I truly hope that things work well for you and your man, because love is something that we all want and need in our lives and when we find it, we need to grab it with both hands and cherish it so much. Enjoy what you both have had and possibly what you will have in the future. When it comes down to it you are the only one to make the right choice. And I am sure that you will. I hope to hear from you what decision you make and what happens with that decision.

Best of Luck

I feel for you Lauren. I am almost 30 and have just come out of a 5 year relationship so I know how you feel. What I can tell you is that you are doing the absolutely right thing. I hounded my ex when she dumped me and have only realised lately that you can't argue your partner to loving you or even liking you. There are things you can do that will make them amenable to you but ultimately, emotions of the heart can only come from one person - them. I would communicate with him once either through text or leaving a message telling him that you are sad at what has happened but that you understand his situation and are willing to give him space but let him know it is not open ended and that you will not wait forever. This will make you even more attractive to him and he will appreciate your understanding. I know when you get to your 30s you start to wonder if you will ever meet Mr or Miss Right but believe me girl, you have done the right thing up to now. Good luck.

I have always found it strange also. It is not as if when you die your spouse is coming with you. (wait for me honey I just kill myself so I can be with you!) I would rather die alone than be trapped in a terrible 
relationship for years just so I can say well at least I won't die alone.

Men, can you ever truly stop cheating?



When my husband and I were dating many years ago, he cheated on me.  I never had actual evidence, but ladies, you know when you have that nagging feeling, the **** is usually true.



Fast forward, 13 years later , he travels alot for work, and i have no actual proof, but my instinct tells me he has been with other women.  Plus I answered his phone once and a girl called and when she heard my voice said oh wrong number, but the number was programmed into his phone as "Kcell".



Is it hereditary?  His dad cheated on his mom.  You would think seeing his mom upset would make him say i would never do that to my wife.



So is the old saying true?  Once a cheater, always a cheater?

My answer is that most men are not cheaters but animals in need for new things and that will always be that way. I am sorry to say that but I think nature has made men this way for a good reason and my advise is that you should keep looking until that special, indeed super special guy appears.

First, you need solid evidence. Women's intuition, though I agree is usually correct, has sometimes failed. Have you ever discussed this with him? Yes, it seems like I'm crazy, but he might have a damn good explanation, or would he stammer? Either way, talking to him face to face can give you some better answers. And if he really did cheat, chances are, it's hard not to again, unless he was so serious about staying with you. Personally, as a guy, I wouldn't trust me again if I ever cheated.

I think you know the answer that your asking here...i mean a "strange" woman called but hung up when she heard your voice....but was programmed into his phone....cmon sometimes love can make you blind but you have the evidence....your gut isnt lying this time i bet, now you just  have to figure out what to do about it, which unfortunatly can be pretty hard as you already know.

Sorry hun you wont want to hear this but people only treat you how you allow them to. You cant change him unless he wants to change, you can only change yourself. Say what you would like him to do. Dont say "you never" or "Why dont you". Say "I would like" or "I would be really happy if" etc. Not easy I know. Dont lose it with him, as then he will then get out of it. I think you have been letting him get away with it so long now that he is conditioned to his way and he needs to be given a wake up call. I guess you would have left him already if thats what you wanted to do. Good luck

He is not "the one" so give him his walking papers and find another man to spend your time with.



These little things that bother you now, only get worse with time, cause he probably doesn't think that anything he is doing is wrong.  If you want a 50-50 relationship then go out and find your other half, cause he is out there.

My husband and I share the housework and the money; we both work.  If one of us needs extra money from the other; then we get it and we are not expected to pay the other back.  I don't think most guys are like yours.  If you're not married you don't have to give him your money and you can move out or make him move out.

if you are unhappy at all, leave this guy. Me and my partner are happy at present after 20 years but she has put herself in a situation where she hasn't worked for years while I've built a career and now would be totally lost without me.

We talk some times and she know that if I ever find myself unhappy or she tells she no longer feels for me then I'll go. life is too short to condem yourself to an unhappy life.

I still have a lot of years in me and I won't spend then unhappy if I can c hange it and I hope in this day and age you won't either.

Is it just my boyfriend, or do ALL men use a new plate/cup/cutlery/pan etc?



for every single thing that they eat or drink?
I just asked my boyfriend to get me a cup of tea. I had already done myself a cup of tea a while ago so the empty cup was sitting next to me. He walks out of the front room, past the empty cup and despite me calling him to use a new cup, he ignores that and brings in a new cup, thereby creating more washing up. What is it with them.



</question>



<additional details>



coco - at least you get where im coming from

to everyone else, I suppose the fact that I was driving him around all day, even though I had a migraine, constantly have to clear up after him, tidy up after him etc etc, and I asked for ONE cuppa and suddenly I should be grateful????

Hahaha - I'm female, and I actually get complained at by my boyfriend for doing the exact same thing!

He'll reuse his mug/glass/plate etc - whereas I'll go get a clean one.

But I've got a feeling it could be to do with who washes up. My boyfriend does the washing up as I cook - which sounds vice versa to you're situation, which is why he probably does it.

Its purely unintentional, and the whole ignoring part could be just purely a man thing, they go blank to any thing you say once they've got a mission to do something else for you - they cant think about doing two things at once, let alone do them...



So my solution would be to ask him to do the washing up for a day, and you keep using another glass or mug or bowl for something - and then he can realise about reusing.

How to forgive and forget my bossy step daughter?



I love my husband.

However it is so difficult to get along with my step daughter.

My husband and his daughter (16) had been act like a partners so long time. 
You can see in some movie -single father and the kid act like a his partner.

It was so big pain to me. They never understand my point about 2 years.
My husband almost admire the daughter and she got over confident .



I did not want take this deal ,but I loved him and he said that "I gave my 10 years to her .I want be happy with you. We don't have to her in here all the time".

Then I agreed to get marriage with him. 
But I made a condition. We can have his daughter 50% 0f the year .
She can stay with mother other 50%.

However she did big fight with own mother and staying with us last 1 year .

It is so hard to me.
She made all kind of problems ..steal my money and I asked question then she said "Are you saying I did it!!!!"
She did physical fight with her best girl friend ,got suspended for 1week.
She suspended with other things,too.
We got phone call form Police twice last one year. And so many other problems.

Every time she makes some problem, I am the one got yelled form my husband.
Because he never scold to her. Of cause I ask why you don't? You have to teach her bad things is bad. may be I said too much ,But I am the one always got his frustration.

I become really dislike her.
I try so hard try to nice to her as a step mother.

Now my husband got bad result of heart check.
I really want get rid of stress form him. I know he want be happy with his daughter I mean he like to be happy 3 of us as a family.

I know I have to love her like a own daughter or try to be nice friend.
But my emotion doesn't go that way.

In honestly I really dislike her.

I am ashamed of it.
But I can't help.

Please help me how to forget and forgive ?

</answer from>



<answer>



you just cant get over something like this just like that
she is bossy,she will always remain like that until her father scolds but he never does that ,so she will continue getting into  trouble
i know its hard to disregard all of that and keep on being a victim but if you really want to wind off the stress of your husband then you should abide by your ongoing problems
dont pay any attention to her,let her get in trouble cause she deserves it since she doesnt get any punishment from her father and always hide your money so she doesnt steal it

i know this may sound wrong but once your husband has got rid of his stress you have got to do something about this situation otherwise the rest of your life is going to be miserable as long as he stands up for his own daughter instead of you

One day when he comes home from work, you tell him you have to leave the house for 2 hours. You will come back and all he has to do is watch the kids. Have dinner ready so he cant whine about that.

As soon as his feet step in the door, yours should be out the door.

Your kids will be fine with Daddy for 2 hours....but I bet Daddy will have a new respect for what you deal with ALL DAY LoNG.

I have 2 under 2 as well...its a rough job my husband NOW says he wouldnt trade me for twice his salary.

if its not work it must be a vacation.  so the next time your husband wants a vacation, he can stay at home 9-5 alone with the kids, and you go get a job as a cashier or something at the supermarket or such.  lets see how long he lasts.



keep a list of what should be done, by the time you get home.

He is a young father I presume.This all comes with maturity.Being a mother is the hardest job in the world.I grew up with a father that worked and slept.Thats what I thought Dad did because that was what I knew.I got married young and used to be like your husband out of ignorance.I never knew until my wife decided to work too and I had to do things while she worked.Thank God I woke up.If there is any way you can talk to him about it that he doesnt feel attacked do so.It is hard for us to say we are scared.I was.I didnt know how to baith a baby etc.I fianally woke up and started asking my wife to teach me.Some men are;nt mature enough to realize mommy needs a break and deserves one too.Tell him you want to go to work too.He thinks you got it good give him a couple nights or days you work with the kids and it will open his eyes.Some of my best memories are changing my kids diapers.Find out what his dad did when he was growing up,Maybe he has precedence.Good luck to you.Its funny because I see couples like this now and think "That guys a jerk,he doesnt know what he is missing.IT TOOK A RUDE AWAKENING FOR ME TO WAKE UP AND SEE.

Sounds like your husband is very immature, selfish & self-indulging & needs a rude awakening! Make plans to get away for a couple of days (a weekend) with a friend or other family member & let him take care of the children & fend for himself. Bets are on that he may change his tune once he sees what it is like to take care of children all day, actually be forced to change diapers & have to figure out how to get his own meals. Best of luck to you!

What a marriage treat me like an equal,we are in this together.Why do you want to have sex with me and then treat with no respect? men tend to want to be in control,but you have a chance to slow his roll,by communicating the issue whit him,and if he don't comply seek a marriage counsel.Help yourself to help him understand,that you just can't single you out here,the kids are ours kids,the food is ours food,the place we stay in is ours,so try to be apart of our life.

i totally agree that staying home with two children under the age of two is a very big job. i've been there and done that. but i agree that you should cook dinner every night. (and keep the house clean) but i also think he should change a diaper every once in awhile. i think you should sit him down and talk it out. and don't be ugly or hateful. just let him know how you feel. communication is always the key. good luck.

He didn't become like this overnight.



If you had told him when you met that you didn't want kids, what would he have said?  I say this because it sounds like he's some place that  he does not want to be and is resentful.

If a guy has a decent looking wife/gf, the last thing he wants is the same girl, heavier and with a kid in each arm.  That's not what guys dream of.

Hey I am a woman and would love to be a stay home mom.



However this is my view point.  Absolutely Monday through Friday you should do it all cook his dinner take care of the kids if you maintain your house everyday it is not that much of a job to do during the day.  The weeksends he should be taking car of the yard and the outside things he does and cars or what every responsibility he takes care of you should still be taking care of the kids house and all....



On Sundays you ALL relax the things that you have to do dinner dishes you do as a team and relax the rest of the day....

If this is the way you want you family set up that is the way it should be I think anyways.



In my family we all work as a team everyday I even work in the shop on cars with him and he does dishes but if one spouce does not want to work the they should do it all at home..



This day and age I have seen it over and over again women want to stay home with the kids problem is husband comes home to a pig sty and no food to eat.



If you wanna be a housewife be a housewife...

I do have children so I know how tough of a job it can be.

Athough he should not talk down to you either...

I was in the same boat, except working 3-4 nights (7-8 hours) a week.  My husband acted the same way, minus the dinner because he's a god cook.  He would come home with that same attitude.  The house wasn't clean enough.  If I had cleaned that dy, he would complain about something else.  I was really perterbed at how darn cliche he was being.  I don't get how guys seriously don't understand that women do not want to screw around with guys that act like that.

Well it depends on the situation.
Just because theres an argument going on, doesnt always mean it has something to do with the bipolar, if there is good reason for why you fiance wants to do that,t hen you will just have to deal with. However, if this is to do with the bipolar, then you will just have to be supportive.

Maybe they need to seek help.I guess all you can do is go if that is what they want.And hopefully they come to their senses and get help.It may not be the bipolar talking either.

If I were you, I would get another fiance.  Bipolar is a serious mental illness, typically, schitzophrenia, and parnoid delusional, which only gets worse with time.  The main problem with bipolar syndrom is that when they do not take their medication, they can completely loose touch with reality.  They can be violent and cause domestic violence problems.  It's not their fault that they are mentally ill, but the only thing which keeps them in check is the medication.  The reason why bipolar people stop taking their medication is because the medication allows them to calm down, slow down and attain a level of moderation and normality in their lives.  Then, as a result of the normality, they think they don't need the medication any longer and they stop taking it.  Or, the medication makes them feel tired and lethargic and so they stop taking it so they can "feel normal."  It doesn't take long for them to revert back to the schizo tendencies again.  Bipolar people often have multiple personality disorder in which they assume various roles, usually opposite of their "normal" role.  Quite often, there are voices in their heads talking to them, actual personalities they have created which they speak to.



This is a very serious mental illness and if you want any kind of "normal" life other than constant turmoil, disruption, and craziness, you will find another person.

Leaving a bipolar person can be very traumatic, they can go out into outer space, even become violent and quite frequently they can mix drugs and alcohol together into a toxic brew which accelerates the other problems.



The problem never goes away, it can only be managed with drugs, and it becomes progressively worse with age.

I think you need to understand exactly what is happening to him or her and why.  You had better read a book or do some net surfing to specific sites dealing with bipolar disorder and get a complete picture of what you are getting involved with.

She or he will deny they have a problem, deny that they need medication, and they will be very convincing to you that the people in the walls are listening to them, they are being followed and all other kinds of delusional things.

It would take a very special and very understanding and compassionate person to love a person like this and adequately deal with the serious problems these people create for themselves and others.  So if you are not prepared to handle these problems, you had better think twice.

Fiancee being female right ? fiance is male so not sure if you made a spelling mistake either way.
Anyway if you live with someone like this, the easy question is why are you living with that person ?
Bi-polar is something my ex husband suffered from and in turn I suffered too, its not healthy and it does not make for harmony.
My ex was on tabs from the doctor but his personality still made me unhappy as I could not take the strain.
Choice is yours, live this way constantly accepting the defectiveness in their personality and you suffering because of it or move on and live a "normal" life.
Good luck.

I hate to say it but MOVE ASAP... Is that your place by the way? If not get your things and go. Your BIPOLAR mate thinks you love them one moment and thinks you're against them the next. The BIPOLAR brain has different thoughts than we do. You can find these people at mental clinics or even at work in the office. They live a regular life and have fits every once in a while. So if you stay, when obstacles lightened out of the blue it will happen again.

Many of the problems you may be facing could be just the tip of the iceberg 
on what is really happening in your marriage. I dont mean to scare you but 
many problems when they either first show up or if they keep reoccurring 
could be just whats showing from a larger problem that either you or your 
spouse cannot even see. One of the only things you can do to help is to talk 
honestly and openly with each other in the marriage. If things become more 
serious more serious options need to be looked at as possibilities. I have a 
blog that has more information on some of what I've been writing about. If 
you feel like checking it out I would completly suggest it.
http://howtogetmyexback1.blogspot.com/

Love is a choice that is made everyday when you wake up and every night when 
you go to sleep. Some days you may not feel the original feeling but love 
isnt a feeling or an emotion. Its an action a verb. Falling out of love may 
just mean you need to spice things up a little or that you were never in 
love in the first place. Don't just get out of a marriage just because you 
don't think you like the person anymore.

Divorce is devastating. Nightmarish.

The only thing that could be worse would be not being able to get a divorce and having to live the rest of your life with someone who hates you.

Not so, I was so glad to get my divorce finalized, it was better even that when I kicked my exes worthless lazy *** out of my house.

Hey there. Divorce sucks and don't let anyone tell you different. That isn't to say its great when its over but the lead up to, and the courty proceedings and the inevitable fighting ar e really bad not to mention the $$$ you will lose out on in legal and alimony  costs.

I must say though that the reason you get divorced is that you cannot see a way forward and cant survive, love or stand being with someone so much that you just want to run away so the outcome is usually wonderful and the freedom after the divorce is like having a load taken off your shoulders.

But the hurt, nastiness and fingerpointing and the loss of so many friends that you have both built up over the years and the way the court and legal system is structured makes life up to the divorce hearing a real pain and the worst experience for most people they will ever endure.

hmmm my parents got divorced when i was 6. It really sucks for the children me and my sister were confused as to what was happening because we were both really young. My mom didn't want a divorce and was crushed when my dad did. Then theres that whole custody thing which sucks. Spending time between parents when they are supposed to be together, but i must say my parents are alot happier. they also are both really easygoing when it comes to custiody and stuff. But overall divorce sucks its been like 7 or 8 year since there divorce and i am still not over it completley. Yea well hope this helps.

As far as I was concerned, very distressing. There were children involved and I put their needs first to help them through it.  I determined that they would never have a step-father or a series of uncles and they never did.  Consequently I have been alone for a large part of my life but I wouldn't change it.  I gave birth to them and I consider it my duty to ensure their happiness.

i think getting a divorce is upsetting, at least at first..i was only married 3 years and my daughter was 2 when i threw my ex husband out...living with lies, drugs, deceit and not being supported (i worked and paid ALL the bills, even took care of his young son from a previous marriage who lived with us) wasnt worth it.  I wasnt happy.  I never felt married, I felt like I had 3 kids.  I lived in NY so divorce wasnt hard to get..basically filed the papers and 6 weeks later, they were signed and a divorce was granted, we didnt have any property and it was uncontested, so it went pretty smoothly...never even had to step foot in a court room.  Im glad I was in NY at the time, I now live in NC and here you are forced to be separated for a year and also attend mediation, which i dont think should be forced upon ppl...i dont think its the states place to dictate that you have to be separated for a year and attend mediation..if you want a divorce that should be it.

Divorce is hard because most of the time you still love the person whether you want to admit it or not. Plus, divorces are usually nothing but fighting and arguing until it becomes final.
If one person wants a divorce, and the other doesn't its considered a contested divorce which makes things EVEN more difficult.
Bottom line, make sure you're ready to marry. Don't just marry knowing that you can divorce, its hard as heck and not the most fun thing to go through.

get the book "getting the love you want" and rejuvenate your relationship.  you can change it - yes by yourself - to be much better by changing what you are doing.  you can prime the well.  you can revive the relationship.  also get marshall rosenberg's book "nonviolent communication" and use the techniques.  the well is dry because you are not putting enough in.  try new techniques.  good luck.your gf probably wants to talk and have fun too.  you have to figure out how to do it with each other - again.

I feel your pain.  I couldn't live that way any longer.  I left him and never looked back.  I tried to just live in the relationship and just survive, but there was no happiness, and it was killing me.  I knew I had to go when suicide actually seemed somewhat appealing, and I'm not that kind of person.  That scared me so bad, I had to get out right then.

You only live once, whats the point of living in misery. You can still be a responsible dad away from the kids. What I hate about society is the way it preaches this standard for everyone. It's a standard thats contradictory and most people would be hypocrites and go against their soapbox faced with the same dilema. Under some circumstances, you have to put yourself first.

This is a hard one --

I was so miserable, that the kids were better off with us being divorced.

Only you can judge your relationship. Make a list of pros and cons and how you feel. No snap decisions !!



Did you really forgive or was it only for the kids?  Examine your emotions/feelings. Bringing it up makes me wonder.And if she is tired (tired of what??? relationship? work draining? what?)



Cant tell you what to do, you need to trust your instincts !! trusting  your instincts, this is hard, but try.  If you and her are happy, so will the kids be. 
If you and her are unhappy, the kids will know it, have stress, and also not be as happy as they deserve.

Good Luck

I have to wonder if her cheating has something to do with your lukewarm feelings...  If you're going to stay with her, it has to be for more than the kids... You & she are going to have to find a way to reconnect in spite of all that's happened...  Forgive her and let the past go... Then start making opportunities for the two of you to reconnect...  Take her somewhere you can laugh & have fun together, without the kids if possible...  And work on rebuilding good feelings between the two of you... Talk with her about the good things you've shared... If you want to save your marriage, focus on what was good, what you have to build on...

erm, it takes two to tango... and two is easier than one, when looking after kids... ive been here, i walked, and had a whole other life,lfet the wife with 2 kids and got on with it..



i saw my kids on their birthdays and at christmas. and i missed their whole life. (now theyre 27 and 25 with kids of their own) we get along fine, its all very polite, but my son is a stranger. im sure it wouldnt bother him if her never saw me again... but i keep trying...



and my partner of 26yrs treats em like our other two, 18 and 13. 
the point is this, you work at it, you get on with it, and realise the kids need two parents. you should sit down and talk to your missus...  shes looking after your two kids and you.. and the house.... blah blah blah... when did she last have a break, a night out, adult conversation...



for us guys its easy... see ya babe' and your off down the pub (without a bcakwards glance) wifes and girlfriends dont stop being people in their own right just coz they have squids. theyre still the person you love...



and dont give it i too her back because... its your fault she felt the need to look elsewhere for her affections. and illbet she didnt plan it, an dsome lothario, sensing her unhappiness, smiled and took advantage... get a grip, this woman, and these children are probably the best thing that willever happen in your lifetime... dont pass it up on a whim... nothing good is easy.

Man you're just another person who doesn't know what they want. Your question was short as if you didn't know beyond boredom . What the problem is in your relationship. Bailing out when times are tough. Changing the partner will be a short term fix. Stop looking for a easy solution.You gave up she also gave up. Don't set a bad example for your kids. Try and work it out. Show her and your kids  you can be fun. It's gonna be work  People have got to stop giving on people

OK, lets look at this issue closely:
1. she has cheated on you before, but you took her back for the kids: BIG mistake, once cheating happens, the relationship will NEVER be the same. you have nothing to feel bad about you did your part to maintain the relationship
2. you need someone else to talk to: talking may lead to an affair, hope you are aware of that!
My solution: divorce, THEN start looking for a new gf/so-- not before. and try to manage the divorce so that the kids don't get involved, don't have to *pick* from parents and you BOTH take care of them... (they need both mum and dad's love to grow up in a decent way). and if you do find a new woman, never place her ABOVE your kids... ever! they will always be a part of your life and past, they'd hate it if they saw that you don't love them as much as you used to because of "someone else"
good luck! be strong.

Sex after marriage stops?



(not mine)
Two phone calls this afternoon:



Me: Hey sweetie, my mom called and she wants the kids to stay over tonight. What do you say I pick up a bottle of wine and we open up the hottub. 
Wife: No, John, you know Tuesdays are difficult days. I had carpool this morning and I'm just too tired. . . .



Me: Hey sugar, you want to get a drink tonight after work? 
Girlfriend: Why don't we just go to my place?



Prior to marriage: Real sex is unequivocal to anything else, including food and oxygen. Porn is only there if you're in-between girls. Up to four years of marriage: Sex is great and when you finish with the foreplay (usually 30 minutes of begging), you have a pretty good time. Porn is okay 
After four or more years of marriage: Sex = Been there, done that, nothing new. Porn is now the better since at least you're seeing something new and fresh. Sorry girls, we love you forever, but even eating steak and lobster gets old if you do it too much.

i think my sex life is great, even before i was married. we are always going to the sex store to find new things to try. we even play games that lead to getting to know each other more, and then leading to some type of sex. we even do it in places we shouldn't to keep spicing things up. ours is never boring i can tell u that much.

as for u try to spice things up...take a trip to the nearest sex shop and buy something u two can use together. its interesting to see what ur partner likes that u don't know about. u may think u know everything about them but the truth is there is still things u don't know. there's couples who have been together for over 50 years who still don't know everything about each others sex thrills. talk to her and see what else u two can do to make things more interesting for the both of u.

Arrange to have your mom take the kids on a Friday when she's not tired.  She's telling you she's tired.  It means she's tired.  She didn't have kids and responsibilities to make her tired before.  You have to believe her.  If you lay a guilt trip on her about how she's too tired it will mean to her that you don't take her seriously and don't care about her feelings.  That's not hot and it doesn't make a woman desire you.  After a guilt trip she will be tired and crabby.  Your plan sounds great!  Just do it on a Friday.  And make sure she knows she can sleep in the next day.

Should i leave him because of his ex?



My partners ex-wife is sending me abuseive text messages and causeing a lot of trouble in our relationship. Unfortuatly as they have a young daughter he cant just cut her off completly. he understands the stress its putting me under and has resricted contact with her to just through the solicitors but she is still determined to split us up. Im 5 months pregnat with our first child but have already had a string of miscarrages and im scared that the extra stress of this on top of my stressful job and nursing my gradfather through his final weeks is going to cause me to lose this one. any ideas

Go to the courts and ask for full custody ...shes obviously not a capable mother if shes so immature to be sending abusive texts messages to you. That is a very childish act. If thats too much action against her, you could go to the police and have her fined for harassment!

She is lucky she is not my husbands ex because I would have already been at her house to resolve the matter. I would just have you husband tell her to leave you two alone and not to use the kid as a lever. There are courts that can resolve this issue. Good luck with your pregnancy and don't worry about this too much because this is exactly what she wants.

Is your husband aware of this? Is his ex aware of this?
Your husband needs to put his foot down and tell his ex to leave you alone. Get a restraining order if you have to, that's ridiculous, and it's destroying your chances of not only having a child, but also a happy marriage, and that's not right.

If he really cares about you then he needs to stand up to her and say "Look, we have a child so I can't cut you out of my life but if you are going to keep treating me and my [gf, wife, fiance] this way then I will seek legal action for full custody of our daughter and only contact you when you need to be".  You should change your cell phone number and make sure that you don't delete the texts she sends (so as if anything goes to court you have evidence).  You don't need extra stress especially if you are being caretaker of an elderly family member.  Your husband needs to get that you two are a team and you can't handle the stress and if he won't stand up and fight for you then he wasn't the man you thought he was.  At that point you can decide whether or not you want to leave him, seek counseling, or just put up with it.  Good luck to you and I hope it works out for the better.  I'll keep that baby in my thoughts!

I'm sure there is a way to limit her contact to it just being between your husband and her!  Change your number, your e-mail, whatever you have to do so you won't here from her!  If you leave your husband your doing exactly what she wants you to do!  Be strong, don't take that crap from her, show her you and your husband love each other and have a strong relationship that she cant ruin!  Don't worry about her and her abuse, why do you care so much what she thinks of you?  Its your husband and your unborn child you have to worry about, not what she thinks of you!  You should care less of what she thinks and says to you, be stronger than that!  Above all this question is so easy CHANGE YOUR NUMBER!!!!!

I dont know where you live but in UK you can get a solicitors letter sent to her warning her that if this continues they have been instructed to take matters further.
I dont know what this comes under but harrassment may be right, please keep all of the text messages and make sure you either dont reply (which in your interests would be best) or if you do that they are not insulting and are merely defensive because if you send texts back she can show yours too.
Check this out legally and see where you stand, she is obviously a nutter if she thinks she can get your partner away from you and back to her - who wants that ?
I wonder how his daughter is coping with all this going on, nobody thinks of the kids in all this kind of stuff, maybe your partner should have access only through a contact centre that way he need never see his ex again. Get the access set up and FGS tell your partner not to let his daughter down not even once, this will only fuel her aggression.
Please take care of yourself and your baby-bump there are good things waiting out there for you and your partner.

The only thing that I can probably tell you is to not split up with him cause it seems to me that the real problem in your relationship is the other woman trying to get between you 2. I suggest that you change your phone number so that she can't contact you.

Hi, I don't think you should leave him as like you said he has cut any Com's with his ex. really why do you have to read the messages from her it seems she is more bothered about you 2 being together so i would say it seems you have a advantage over her. yes stress is a big problem and with your problems you already have you don't need these. I think from now you should concentrate on the important things like your relationship your grandfather/ job and think every time you get a message from her just laugh as she must have such a dull life to keep thinking she can bother you as it would seem you have something that bothers her.  hope you sort it out

Life is what happens when you're busy waiting for something to happen.



You are living your life.  You aren't doing the "enjoyable" stuff because you feel you can't because you have these other "things" on your plate.  Stop.  You are already paying off the debt and all the other things that are "preventing" you from living.  So why not start doing some stuff that makes you happy?  The debts will still need to be paid whether you're having fun or not, right?

No way are you too old to start enjoying life.  I know what you're saying, a lot of people are in your situation.  I am one of them.  But I look to the future and not the past.  You can change things if you work hard enough.

SNAP out of it!!  Your a bit down in the dumps (who isn't?)  Develop a financial plan to get your bills in order and take it one at a time.  Once your debt is down treat yourself to a trip and pick one room at a time in the house to decorate.  ENJOY the fact that your alive and enjoy your child.  Life is never going to always be smooth but what counts most is how you handle yourself during the rough patches.  G'luck!

Can you do math?  You're 14 years into your adult life.  If you live to age 80, you have 48 years left.  I suppose if you think 48 years isn't enough time to do anything with your life it might be too late to enjoy it, but where I come from, the idea of "quitting" after only 14 years is a cop-out.

First of all - it sounds as though you are depressed and might need professional help (as most Americans do).

Talk to your doctor and he can prescribe something to help get you out of this rut.  Once you feel better, take one task at a time to complete.  Accomplish a little at a time, and feel good about what you are doing.  As far as the debt, there are quite a few companies that will help you achieve a workable budget to get you out of debt.  It should include a vacation fund.  I know how you feel, I have been through it.  There is light at the end of the tunnel.  And you need patience.

It is NEVER to late to start a life - and at 32 you have a whole lot of living left to do.

Have you got a successful relationship?



How do I hook my man where he will want to text & email me lots?
10 points to the one who can tell me how or what to say or do that will make the man constantly enjoy communicating. I am rubbish at communicating with men I always mess it up & I am bored with it.

What have you done or said that seriously makes him WANT to constanly text etc., (This is tricky as I cannot see him, it is a long distance thing).

Why not try acting like a mature woman.

You see a man would not be interested in:

(A) hook my man where -- hook or hook up, nasty to a man
(B)  he will want to text & email me lots? -- that just silly
(C) 10 points to the one who can tell me how or what to say or do that will make the man constantly enjoy communicating. 
(D) makes him WANT to constanly



That sounds like a good way to get a horney boy but not so much a man.

Yes I did leave, but it took a while. I did not see the control issues until we were married for about four years, divorced at fifteen. I could not change him because it was a part of his personality and he saw nothing wrong with it. We went to counseling, he pretended to try to change but in the end, I did most of the compromising. Put self first, that would be my advice.

Well my ex was one of the biggest control freaks. After we had been together for 1 year and i had fallen pregnant to him he started changing. First it was i don't like your friends and i don't want you to be friends with them after that it was my family i had to chose him or them then he started hitting me and i was to scared to leave him as he said if you leave i will kill you. Once my son was born it got even worse and i kept trying to leave but he held a knife to my neck and my newborn and said this is how easy it is for me. I was lucky because i ended up having my parents help and they got me out of there he does not no where we are. Be careful and always have a say. My new husband lets me do whatever i like and the same with me. We have been together over 8 years now..

Get out of this unhealthy relationship men like this dont change, they have problems in their personality and they try to make you compensate for their inadequacies.
You will never be right, you will never have an opinion and you will never be able to do anything.

i went out with many control freaks.  Yes i had issues.  My father was very controlling and continues to be controlling with my mother so i dated alot of guys who were liek this.  Now im 41 years old and finally have my act together and stay away from men like this. As soon as i sense "red flags", i now listen to them and end the relationship immediately. I broke up with all the men who tried to control me in the past.  The funny thing is that i let the relationships go on for awhile before ending it.  I dont know how iput up with such crap but i did.  Most of the men who tried to control me were jealous either about other men, how i dressed, being with my friend, money, etc...Ive been in about three controlling relationships and i ended all of them.  Even when i was married to my ex, he controlled me financially by never giving me any money and never shared.  I eventually left with my son and got a divorce.  Its been six years and to this day, im proud that i got out.  Now im dating a great guy who isnt controlling and is very normal and decent.  We have our moments and we have ups and downs but our relationship is healthy and not controlling.  Its so much better.  I can breathe and be myself.  I can come home to him and not worry about arguing or having to explain myself.  Control is a form of emotional abuse. Its degrading.  Eventually, your self esteem goes down and you start to not trust yourself. This is the time when the abuser gets even worse and may even start to get physically abusive.  It always starts with emotional abuse and gets worse.  I hope you get out of the relationship or you both get therapy.  But men like this do not change.

How can i tell my mum i'm in a three-way marriage?



I'm visiting my mum next weekend for the first time in three years (we lost touch). I told her i was married and she wants to meet my husband and i said fine.
Thin is, i'm in a three way marriage. I'm actually married to my partner Tony, but my other partner Nick lives with us and refers to us as his husband and his wife, and me and Tony call him our husband as well. Should i take them both along? I love Nick with all my heart, and i dont want to deny our relationship, but i dont want to lose touch with my mum after so long apart. what should i do??

P.S - i am well aware my situation is a little unorthadox and not to some people's taste so please dont leave answers like 'eew' or whatever. Thanks.

I don't see her being thrilled with it, and it wont hurt anyone if you do not tell her so what is the point.  Your mom will not be around forever, and you don't want to be estranged from her again.  She probably always knows you have an unconventional lifestyle, so there is no need to give her all of the details.

I think you should bring them both. If your mom can't accept your life style then screw her! Don't spend your life trying to please other people or hide who you truly are. As long as the 3 of you are happy that's all that matters. Good Luck!

I don't think that after a three year separation you should be hitting your Mum with this news.  I think you need to talk with your Mum first, get your relationship back onto solid ground, spend some time with her and build up the trust.



I wouldn't even introduce your husbands until you can be sure of her reaction.

If it were me , I wouldn't tell her. Why does she need to know ?  If you only see her occasonally, why hurt her?  You know that generation especially won't understand and will be very hurt.  I'd hope Nick would understand my decision to not hurt my Mom.  Just what I would do.

I believe in honesty  but some things are better not said.

I think polyamoury might be a bit much for your Mum just now. Might be best just to concentrate on your relationship with your Mum just now before introducing your unorthodox home life. I think the ground will need some careful preparation.

Well, you're right, it's a little bit of an odd situation, but if I were you, I would gently explain the situation to your mom BEFORE you introduce these two men to her.
Dropping them both in her lap at the same time, in person, is a disaster waiting to happen.  It would hurt more than just Nick, but your husband and mother too.
Ask to meet up with her BEFORE the arranged visit, or at least talk to her over the phone or write her a letter.
However, I think if Nick loves you as much as you love him, then he should be adult enough to appreciate how hard this is going to be, and respect the fact that you and your mom haven't seen eachother in 3 yrs.
Talk to Nick first... make him understand that it's nothign to do with being ashamed of him or denying him, but that you need to get to know your mom again, and that eventually, he will get to meet her.
After all, he is not your legal husband, and hubby is the one with the most rights.
Think of everyone's feelings here... not just Nicks.

if it bothers you that much, leave the house and stay with a friend, that way he can really evaluate how he feels. if he doesn't call you to come home or says that he misses you in a couple of days, that means that he's enjoying being away from you and it won't work, if so you need to pick yourself up and move on.

Try and give him space, after all absence makes the heart fonder, I know its not easy because you need to know were you stand, but then you don't want to end up in a relationship were someone is with you only to suit you not him, it has to work both ways. It would hurt more knowing that he is with you not becuase he loves you or wants you but becuse he was pressured.

Give it some time, and if he leaves it too long, then you know were you stand, then you move on.

Give him some time, but it not fair for him to keep you worrying about this for too long. Sit down and talk to him. Say you've given him some time but now you need at least an indication of whats bothering him. It takes two people to make a relationship work so you need to know whats the problem.

The only two solutions are to stick around, wait and see, or dump him first. If he doesn't want to talk to you, is pulling away without explanation, and is dropping hints that he's "thinking" about the relationship, sounds to me that he might want out. One way to find out would be to move out and move on; if he doesn't pursue you, you will know he wasn't that interested.

Prepare youself for the worst, financially and emotionally. You never know what he is thinking, but soon you'll find out or should be interrogating him soon. Be ready to stand the pain and hurt if he does confess to wanting out of the relationship. Don't let this go on as if it nevered happened. It'll just grow like a tumor. Find the right time to communicate about it.

if you cant be truthful and honest with him then wat is the point of being with him. if ur just going to keep everything inside ur just as good as not being with him. he should be open with you about everything and not keep things from you or make you feel like you have to keep things from him. you should talk about it and if he wont talk about it hes probably not the right person for u, even if you think he is now, it doesnt seem like your that happy now and im sure if hes not the one ull find another to make you happy.

Move on, he is having second thoughts, most likely another woman has been flirting with him somewhere and he is considering you and her. 
He is weak minded towards this relationship, and why would you want to settle for anything less than 100%?



Leave him, and next time don't move in with a man until there is a ring on your finger, this will keep you out of the mucky situation where your bound to a guy in life because of bills, living situation, etc..

It sounds harsh but I think he has doubts but just needs a little more time to confirm this in his own mind before he ends it.  He is being selfish - keeping you just hanging around while he makes his decision.  My advice is to get in their first and end the relationhip.  Take control and you will feel better.  I have wasted time in relationships like this - holding on, giving them time, believing they will see how great I am only to be dumped - how I wish I had got in their first.

It might not be as serious as u think - ask him when he's in a good mood if u can talk about his issues (if he has any).

Why are people so shocked to hear that I'm not ever going to marry. ?



It seems that everyone from my mom to fellow co-workers are so surprised to here me say that I have no intentions of getting married. The reason being is that I'm a very quiet person. I don't think I am mentally capable of living with another person. Plus women aren't attracted to me at all. As nice as it would be to have a loving women in my life, I know that it is beyond my reach. So I just accept it for what it is. Why can't other people accept it as well? My mother is always saying that I would make a terrific husband, but I know she is just saying that to make me feel better.

Marriage isn't for everybody it's true. But  promise that you won't totally rule it out  :)  I was happily single for  most of my 20's and 30's and it used to amaze me how  defensive some people  got when I told them that I was  perfectly happy  and not desperate to drag some poor bloke down the aisle before I hit 30.  That all changed when I met the man who is now my husband at 36. So if  being single is what you want, then don't feel the need to explain your choice to anybody, but never say never...you  don't know what life has in store for you, none of us do.

Maybe there just shocked at how negative you are not necessarily because you don't want to marry. I'm sure women are attracted to you, you just need to work on your confidence. Also, you sound young so that could be a factor to why there's so shocked.

I don't think you should rule out the possibility of marriage.  Just because in the near future you can't see yourself taking that step doesn't mean that it wouldn't happen around the corner.

I guess the shocked feelings everyone is feeling when you tell them that you are never going to marry is shocking to them because of how you are defeated by the possibility of it happening.

If you personally didn't ever want to get married because you think that marriage is another process that is not truely meaningful anymore, that;s one thing.



But to say your never going to marry because you feel that women aren't attracted to you, then that is just a cop out.

Marriage is an American institution and society's expected goal in life.  If you decide not to marry you are seen as peculiar.  Man is supposed to procreate and according to the Bible that should only happen between a man and a woman bound in marriage.  Two thousand years of custom is hard to dispel.

They could be surprised because they see you as someone that could easily get married if you wanted to (in other words, they don't share your opinion of yourself as someone women are not attracted to). You are quiet, but many outgoing women LOVE quiet guys, because opposite personalities tend to attract. I don't think it's out of your reach.



However, I am not trying to convince you to get married. I just want you to be happy. I think others (who try to convince you to get married) have an underlying assumption that a young guy can't possibly be happy without a girl in his life. This assumption is not true for all people. Some guys are MEANT to stay single and can be happy single, even though they like girls. If you are happy single, stay that way. (But if you really like the idea of having a loving woman in your life, you don't have to resign yourself ot the idea of being single for the rest of your life.)



The best thing in life to do is to try to be content as you are. If you can reach that point, no matter what happens to you - you have the resources in your life to be happy and to go on. Contentment isn't just resigning yourself to what you feel like is inevitable. I don't think it is inevitable that you will stay single for the rest of your life, but you have convinced yourself that it is. That is definitely one reason that people argue with you when you say you'll never get married. I have seen some people who are married, whom I would have thought would not find someone; and I've seen some people stay single, who seem like they could easily have found someone.



Life doesn't usually go as we expect it will go. I have to agree with the others who have said this, because just observing other people's lives proves that. (Even models and hot actors/actresses sometimes can't keep their marriages together; if looks were all it took, or popularity, or a charismatic personality, or wealth, or whatever, these people would never have any problems in their lives....life doesn't go as we think it will go. I think you need to re-think what it takes to be a desirable guy or good husband...your mom probably sees character traits in you that she thinks would make an ideal husband for someone. Yes, she wants you to feel better - she's your MOM and she loves you! - but it also is likely that since she knows you well, she knows your character and knows that you really WOULD make a terrific husband to some girl.)



Contentment is being thankful for the good things in your life and focusing on them, instead of feeling sorry for yourself about the bad things in your life. I believe contentment comes from having God in your life - but not just that - you have to learn how to find all your happiness from Him. That can take time. This doesn't rule out bad things happening to you, but you can feel like you have what you need, to be happy in life, without your circumstances having to be ideal, if you have God. Both single people and married people have bad things in their lives. Marriage - or dating a girl you love - is not equivalent to happiness. Contentment is a hard thing in life to find - once you find it, stay there. If you're content before you get married, you are likely to be much happier if you do get married, than people who enter marriage expecting to find their contentment FROM marriage. Marriage doesn't make people happy but it can make contented people happier. You get out of marriage what you bring into it. That's my opinion.



I'm single too, and people try to convince me to get married. I know what you feel like, so I think you can trust what I have told you. I am not really anxious to get married even though I'm naturally boy-crazy. If I meet the right guy, I know I will fall in love with him right away, but I haven't met him yet. And I happen to think that if I did meet him, I wouldn't meet up to his qualifications for an ideal wife. So I'm still on the road to trying to be content as I am. Once I'm there, I think I will be ready for marriage (if it's meant to happen). If it's not meant to happen, I will already have the resources in life to be happy without it.



Basically I just think you shouldn't worry about what others think of you. They will not accept it because they're either convinced that you can't be happy without getting married, or they are sure that girls would like you if you would just give them a chance. Let them be surprised. Ignore their opinions. Just focus on being content and finding happiness in life that doesn't rely on having a romantic relationship with anyone. And also, don't feed yourself a lie that you have no chance of getting married. I can't convince you that women would find you desirable, because you'd be able to mentally contradict everything I say by thinking that I've never seen you and I don't know you, so how can I be trusted? Yet there is one thing I know for sure, that applies to you: life has a way of surprising us...you may meet your future wife tomorrow.

He has someone else. Only you can now if he really loved you in those years and why he left. If you are really sure that he loved you and suddenly left you (for someone else), maybe that person casted a love spell or something like that. Remember that the magic is real (even it's sounds crazy).
But you should try to continue your life. Don't forget: Love is infinite.

Is it normal to feel guilty when you first start dating after a divorce?



OK, I know I have Absolutely no reason to feel guilty....I was the one who got left in a very bad way but I went out on a very non serious date and I could not get over the feeling that I was being unfaithful.  Is that a normal feeling after a divorce?

That's a normal feel for inadequate self esteem/worth folks who do not believe in them self and are insecure.  Are you sure it's 'quilt' and not some other kind of emotion/feeling or a combination of feelings?  Maybe you were feeling FEAR that you might be punished for going out without someone's permission?

Yes, especially if your ex was your first sexual encounter, if you two dated in school and the relationship was a long one, if you have religious ties to him and your bond was very  spiritual and emotional. These are all situations that take a long time to overcome and it is probably best to just keep trying to date guys; but, keep it light, look for a friend first, more serious things between you two should progress slowly to give your emotions and mind time to adjust.

You feel the way you do because you were serious about your marriage vows and never intended to be with another man ever. So, the rules have changed, just as the wind of life blows us different ways. Now, you have to adjust and become more pliable to the changing winds of life. Lean on yourself the most and look for a male friend who will understand that you have been through a lot and you just need time to have a serious relationship. Good luck.

You made a commitment to your husband.  Even if he broke his promises or abandoned you it doesn't make your marriage vow less valid.  Each of you made vows to be together until death.  I know that some people get divorced and they continue to remain single for a period of time or for the remainder of their life.  Maybe you aren't ready to date and that's okay.  Give yourself some time.  Have faith - the right guy will come into your life when it's time.  Check out the links below about Chastity and dating.

Should I have sex with my husband?



I'm 22 and married I have been married 2 month and known him 2 years, he's 25 and I know he's the one. we love each other deeply, but the thing is I don't want sex since it's against my morals but I do want a family without the intimacy of course, but the thing is that my husband complains all the time about no sex, but he can satisfy himself and he **** other women if he wants to. I mean a marriage is not about sex, and my husband is always complaining about me not wanting it, and I told him b4 we married that it's not important to me. but I do touch myself down there. and we have of course seen each other naked? but what should I do?

omg this has got to be a fake question! Are legit or are you trolling?!?!? and if it's real then you should have sex with him because marriage is based on sex!!!! Unless you evolve and become asexual then you're not gonna have a family... unless of course you adopt a child that was produced through sex!!!

You shouldn't have gotten married if you're not going to be intimate with your husband. That's just wrong. You can't withold sex from him! You don't get married to have sex, but you don't get married to not have it either. Geeze, you should have told the poor bastard what he was getting into before he married you. I'd give anything to have sex with my husband, it's been 11 months! GO **** YOUR HUSBAND GIRL! GO GET IT!

If sex is against your morals... WHY did you get married? No, really. Your question really confuses me. Is there some medical reason for not having sex with him? If you're already married, your "moral conscience" should be cleared, right? Having sex should be a non-issue. I'm really confused.

If you have no interest in ever laying with him as man and wife then you had no right to marry him... approving of adultery does not make you a saint. You have serious issues and I would hope that you would not bring children into this world with a man in this situation. You can say that a marriage is not just about sex but sex is a huge part. Your marriage will eventually fail because even if you are happy and content he is going to fall for one of his girls on the side... before you mess this up by sharing children together I suggest that you really decide what kind of game you are playing and what you really think a marriage is about. You are missing something here. Good Luck. You are far to young to think things will last with those kinds of expectations.

Sorry, but this is weird. What kind of relationship is it if there is no sex at all? 99.9% of couples in the world are having a proper relationship, which includes physical and you're saying that you don't want anything physical with this man.



What kind of morals say that you can't have sex when you're married? The Bible condones it for couples when they're married, and it's the ideal family set up for couples to create children. It's not against any religious morals. I think that's kind of weird what you're telling us. You're making your husband feel guilty for asking for something he naturally thought you'd expect.

There's a difference between saying sex is not important to you and actually refusing to have it at all and putting the poor guy through agony. It's biological for him to want to be with you intimately. He can't force you, but at the same time you're not being fair to him saying you love him and not feeling any physical urge to consumate the marriage. I hope you guys work it out.

I don't know if you are religious, but in the Bible, sex is referred to as God's gift to married couples...why would you not want to take advantage of that?  It would be like taking one of your wedding gifts, never even opening it to see what it is, and just leaving it in the back of your closet forever.  Do you really want him to go out and have sex with other women?  Honey he is a man, and he may love you, but if he is being intimate with other women in a way that he is not being intimate with you, he will eventually fall for one of them because they can connect in a way that he cannot connect with you.

I think it would be interesting if you explained why sex, even in marriage, is against your morals.........

but hey if you really don't want to have sex then don't, don't just do it because someone is complaining about it, he knew what he was getting into when he married you correct?

although if you do seem to be coming around to the idea because maybe you really do want to have sex and not just because he's complaining then I would strongly encourage you to have sex because sex is a very healthy and happy aspect of marriage, I strongly believe it would be better to have sex, UNLESS you know for sure you will feel guilty afterwards! =)

not only is sex good fun, but it is a natural way to share intimacy and love with your partner.....marriage is not about sex, but it is about trust and love and intimacy..........whatever morals you have that disallow sex will ultimately mean a very disfunctional family..you can't have children without having sex, and you can't raise them well without being able to provide a secure loving environment ....where intimacy between parents is healthy and normal.......and allowing your husband to seek sexual gratification elsewhere is absolutely going to destroy not only your relationship and also affect any future children you may have....
It is natural that some women may not have the desire to have sex, or particualrly enjoy it, but there is counselling and medical help for those women..........if you love your husband you should investigate this further.......but no-one can change your morals except for you..........
YES&gt;&gt;&gt;YOU SHOULD MAKE LOVE TO YOUR HUSBAND!!!!!

Girl...#1 rule in marriage!  ALWAYS take care of your man in the bedroom! I beg to differ, SEX is 80% of your marriage if not more. Its very important! You need to see a DOCTOR he will be able to give you something to boost your sex drive. SEX is wonderful specially with someone that you love. Could you put yourself in your husbands  shoes for a moment. He must think you don't love him. If you truly LOVE someone you would want to give them EVERYTHING they wanted. Don't make him feel inadequate or not wanted. 
NEVER bring in a third party into your bed. Marriage is between two people NOT three !!!

Your married so your allowed to have sex with your husband. I would applaud your morals if you weren't married to him but you are. God gave us sex for many reasons. To of course be fruitful and multiply. But also to be closer to your spouse and it is pleasurable. If you touch yourself down there then you obviously can get in the mood. I'm shocked that you allow your husband to have sex with other women. If you really had morals then you would NEVER of agreed to that. Obviously a marriage isn't ALL about sex, but a healthy sex life is very important in a marriage. Maybe you should see a hormonal specialist doctor to make sure your hormones are in balance. And go to a marriage counselor.

I understand that if you have morals that you want to go by them. But, keep in mind that your husband loves you also. I know that men can satisfy themselves but put yourself in his shoes, think for a minute maybe, he would like to express himself to you, through sex. It is actually nice sometimes to have the love, warmth, his touch, and just to know that you are secure in his arms. Sometimes I don't to have sex with my husband, but I also try to put my self in his shoes and try to understand how he feels. I think that the two of you need to sit and have a heart to heart talk and get to the bottom of the problem. I would ask your self if you have the problem with him, or  with the thought of having sex with him, or are you scared of having sex and the way that you will feel after the fact, and question how did you feel about you seeing him naked? Did you get happy seeing him like That? Did you like what you saw? Also, one more piece of advice I have been married for 7 years and I felt that way also, but I'm also afraid that if you do not talk and try to give in a little bit, and understand his side you may lose your husband. So God Bless You and him both.

How do I ask my fiance/wife to loose or keep weight off?



By no means is she fat. By NO MEANS! However she does have a little bit of extra flab around her stomach, and sometimes it shows. She's such a blessing to me, and I love her very much. She is very very attractive to me, except in this area. She used to be between 180-200 lbs, and I'm kind of concerned about her getting back up to that --- she doesn't want to, and won't. But I think she could afford to loose 10 pounds. I know I'm being selfish, and the love I have for her does not depend on how much she weighs. HELP!

My husband said to me one evening after I was complaining about feeling and looking so fat and I was going to for the 100th time loose some weight--"OMG, you are the most beautiful, sexy person in the world, if you lost weight, I would go insane.  I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off of you, every man in this world would be so jealous of me!!!  Every man in this world thinks you are hot now....if you lost weight imagine what they will think!"  Well, that statement gave me all of the will power that I needed to for the first time in my life loose weight.  I lost 40 lbs in 6 months.



AND my husband supported me and helped me all of the way.  He ate the crappy diet food without complaining, worked out with me, and told me everyday how beautiful I am and how proud he is of me.
This is all you need to do.

Very touchy subject. Don't tell her. Try to get her to join you in a diet or a workout program. Make her think it's all about you getting in shape and that it's a way for the two of you to spend more time together. If you mention she has put on weight she will get mad at you for a long time and probably rebel against what you want.

Obviously the love you have for her is measured by her weight. How would you feel if she felt the same towards you as you do in regards to looks because as you age , she may face the same dilemma towards you. If it concerns you from a health perspective, get out there with her and exercise together it will help rather than divide your relationship. Tell her she needs to lose 10 lbs and you are a goner.......

Frankly, I think you're being a pig. This woman is a joy to you and you're worried about ten extra pounds AND posting the question online? Dude, if she finds out that last part you may be single soon. Her weight is her business, not yours. Even it it was your business, do you think she is not aware of it? Do you think that she hasn't tried on clothes, weighed herself or looked in a mirror lately? You are being selfish - perhaps you could work on that problem in yourself, it's certainly more important than ten pounds.

And FYI, she is not going to be fooled by "Let's join a gym together!" unless you are really interested in working on your own body and weight, which I am assuming are perfect.

If your love does not depend on her weight, then what is the point of this question? Obviously you are critical of her weight. However, sadly the statistics are that very few people who lose weight keep it off permantly. Most people gain it back + some! So if she only has 10 pounds to lose - it would be better to do it now before it becomes 20 pounds.

You can not however ask her to lose weight. That won't end well for your health!!  LOL!! But you can suggest activities that get her active. Instead of going out to dinner, eat at home where you can control portion size/fat content. Decrease daily calorie intake and increase physical activity - that is what is going to work to lose those 10 pounds. Do you belong to a gym? If not, join one together and go together.

But please do not tell her she needs to lose weight.

If it bugs you that much already, then I would call off the wedding, because it's sure to bother you later.  I'm not fat at all and never have been, but people have always thought I was pregnant, even in high school.  The stomach area was/is/will always be a problem zone for me.

You are not being selfish, in my opinion, you just know what you want, so please make sure you go get what you want!

if you don't care how much she weighs then why do you want to know how to help her lose weight. she is your wife to be and if she is 300 lbs you should still love her. if she wants to lose the weight then she needs to post a comment and ask how to lose weight. i think your just one of those guys that thinks your wife has to look just how you want her to. i think you being a pig, but that's just me. sorry

You were right about one thing... your being selfish... What i want to know is how you got so damn perfect, that you can complain about others... Do you not think she knows what she looks like. you said at one time she was a lot heavier and has lost the weight.. why don't you look on the bright side of things at least she is trying... Now for her. I hope she does read this and finds out what a PIG you are and leaves you in her dust. you talked about her being a blessing to you... ever tried of being one for her ... OH MY GOD ... I FORGOT  YOUR PERFECT RIGHT...  I hope she finds out soon that she deserves better than a selfish jerk like you... Good luck to her....

Any ideas how I can get her back and have her forgive me? Thank you.

Expect the hate to flood, but you won't get it from me. I've been there, I know how it feels. You need to speak with her, give her time to chill out and let the flames die down a little. People make mistakes, if you can work it out, find out what was lacking in your relationship to go outside of it, if you can't work it out, take what you have learned from this to your next relationship. Marriages run into snags, this is COMMON! People on this board ask all the time what to do, and most I've noticed just rip on the people asking. 
Try to talk to your wife, tell her your sorry, offer what you can, therapy, whatever it is. If you both choose to work it out, then work it out, but keep in mind, she has to trust you, and you have to trust that she will also work on what made the marriage fall apart to begin with.

You can't do anything to make things up to her after cheating.  It is just going to take your wife time to figure things out and determine whether or not she wants to work things out.

The only thing you can do is keep the lines of communication open and let her know that you do want to work things out and are willing to do whatever she asks of you.

That said, if you really want her back, you better clean up your act. That means no other women even while you're separated. Don't make excuses for your behavior.

yes u did a horrible thing, and will have to show remorse, but don't expect her to come around right away, as this is some heavy duty pain, and not easily forgotten. seek some christian counseling, with a man councilor, who can show u what u would need to do to win her heart back. words are cheap, promises matter little, the proof of your willingness to get her back will show in your actions. patience is important now, because she isn't automatically going to fall back into your arms as if nothing happened. do the therapy, and communicate with her what u learned from it. twice a cheater is bad, seems as if the desire and opportunity were there for u. everyone has marital problems but u didn't have to cheat on her. her world as she knew it is now shattered, and trust has been lost. its up to u to regain it, any way u can. being accountable is a start, taking blame also.

WELL, I wont attacked your character like everyone else did but the truth of the matter is how do you expect her to forgive and FORGET TWICE. If you do get back with her you have to be prepared for things like your wife maybe constantly reminding you of what you did this happens during the healing process so you have to decide if you want to endure that. Gettn back together isnt always easy. You may have the face the fact that you lost your wife and its alll your fault, then begin to seriously work on you to fix whats going on in you so this type of behavior doesnt continue with someone else. For now give your wife her space and stop calling accept whatever decision  she  makes and like I said work , work work on yourself too many times men walk away from situations like this and think it is normal.

You cheated and now you want her back. How did she find out. You should have stayed home and maybe she wouldn't have left you. If you really want her back, then you need to go get some help with your marriage. You also need to let your wife know that you are finished with your cheating and try to get her to trust you again. This will be the hardest thing to do. You have done something that will take her a long time to get over it if she will. Beg her to at least talk to you and then stay home and be a good husband.

Ive been posting here a bit this past few weeks and most of the men on here are really something else,and not in a good way. Are they just insulting women for attention or do they mean it? every time I defend womens rights or say cheating is wrong or give a polite and helpful answer to a question I get a load of thumbs down. Men on the other forums arent like this,its just this one. If these men are really married I pity their wives I really do.

OH do I agree with you. I don't care how they vote for me. I'm not in this for a popularity contest. I'm TRYING to help people. People have always said that men mature much slower then woman. And I agree!!!  I'm sure your finding some wise guys too that are answering the questions. But like I said, I really don't care if they vote down on me. I feel good when someone emails me thanking me for my advice. And I think the older we get, were able to give better advice to people because chances are we've been through what their going through. And we can better advice them. Who cares what the others think. If they want to disagree, then let them. We're here to try and help people and get help ourselves when we need it. I've always thought that woman were much smarter people then the guys. it's too bad that alot of woman don't view themselves that way. If they only took a long hard look at themselves, they would figure out whos REALLY the smart ones.

A lot of the answers you see are from very young and immature men.  Boys I should say.  Just look at how many questions ask about things that most men know already.  Maybe they are very unhappy in their lives.



But believe me, this is not a good representation of all men!  I have so many male friends who are wonderful men and of course, the one I married is the best of all.

There are a lot of men on here that are real jerks.  Many of them profess the attitude of "what ever it takes to get some".  Based on many answers I have seen, there are many who are basically amoral, and it's not just the guys.  Don't lose heart, there are still  many good men and women offering good answers that could really benefit those asking questions.

Keep up the good work

There are some like that.  I hope most aren't.  I'm not here to bash women or marriage.  I love women, especially my wife and I feel lucky to be married to her.

I do support all the things you've said here, cheating is wrong (for both sexes of course), women should work if they want to and deserve to be paid the same as men, askers deserve a polite helpful answer (unless they are trolling).

I think it is mostly women here.



But, there are some guys posing as women and there are also some immature boys posing as men.

How should I punish my disobedient wife ?



My wife and I recently came to an arrangement whereby she would not watch daytime TV and we would watch an hour of quality TV in the evening together. However, I arrive home after a hard days work this evening, check the TV's for heat and it was apparent two of them had been on. Should I confiscate the TV sets entirely or cut her allowance?

You should buy On Demand cable box from Comcast, with the recordable feature.

You can block the shows you don't want her to watch and put a restriction and password on them.

Then, you can record the wholesome shows you would like her to watch and have her watch them during the day.

<question>



My boyfriend constantly lies to me?



im asking this in 'marriage and divorce' because i want more mature answers. (even though this is an immature question).

and it's long - sorry.

back in july my live-in boyfriend trained for a job, and exchanged phone numbers with the girl who trained him. we share a phone bill, and one day as i was looking through the bill, i noticed they had been texting for about an hour one night. i asked him about it, and he deleted her number immediately, saying nothing happened and he was not interested in her. (note: her name was programmed as PAUL in his phone!!).

well now, my boyfriend started a new job two weeks ago. he exchanged numbers with a co-worker of his and i wasn't mad about it because they rarely talk. (never on the phone, just text messages. sometimes he doesn't respond, sometimes she doesn't). well, he told me this girl was married, nothing to worry about. one night we were out with a bunch of friends, and i asked two of the girls he works with about her. they both told me she wasn't married, so naturally, a fight broke out between him and i. tonight it dawned on me that ITS THE SAME GIRL WHO HE WAS TALKING TO IN JULY!! i called him, crying, and asked him what was going on. he tried LYING to me, saying it was a different girl. when i told him the phone numbers were IDENTICAL, he then confessed, saying he worked with her, but NOTHING is going on, blah blah blah. eventually he turned the fight around on me because i shouldn't be looking at the bill. (but when it's $40 over what it should be - i have every right!)

i mean, i know i can be jealous, but what do i do? 
believe him?
or leave him?

He tried hiding his relationship with her from the start and then again when they got back in touch with each other.  That is already two huge lies.  He has and always will have something to hide with this other girl.

His guilty conscience is making him turn things around on you considering you two live together and share bills.  He is only acting this way because he got caught!



Sounds like you have become a wreck over not being able to trust him.  And it sounds like he is more likely to cover his tracks better than start telling you the truth.  I think you should leave him!

some people dont learn so you have to teach them the hard way...
It was different if we would have worked past it but sh had too much pride

I say leave him
Picture yourself marrying him
and he lies to you about the lipstick on the shirt, the hair in the car, the late night store runs, etc....

if he's lying to you there's something more to the story that he's not saying. if there wasn't anything to worry about, he'd be telling you the truth. he's being very disrespectful to you and you deserve someone that would treat you right. let him go, he won't know what he had till its gone, maybe then he'll learn from his mistakes.

Leave him. He has been lying and finally admitted it. It does not matter if NOTHING is going on (although if that were true he wouldn't be lying about it, would he). He will do so again and again if you let him off the hook. One thing is for sure, he will not change his behavior.

If you can't believe this guy then leave him. He seems to be jerking you around and you deserve better then that. This guy is already cheating on you so it's up to you to decide now what you need to do. I don't think he has any plans in changing his life around and that is why he's still cheating and lying to you. Don't wait until you're too involved with him because he's not worth it. This guy must really think that you are that dumb. Don't waste your time with him because he really has nothing to offer you but lies and heartache. Run and run as fast as you can.

There are two answers to this :-

1) He programmed her name in as Paul and didn't tell you about her and then lied about her being married because he thought you'd be worried about him cheating on you if you knew the truth.  Weird logic I know!

2) Something is going on with him and this girl and he is lying to cover his tracks and by turning the tables on you is trying to push the blame on to you for 'prying'.

Either way, the fact he's lied to you more than once would concern me.  If he can lie with such ease, what else is he capable of lying about?



Find out the reason why he's lied and then decide your next move.

Girl, wake up, when a man does suspicious things and get caught in a lie....you need to think about leaving. He is dirty and you have no idea what is really going on with them...no matter what he said. Like he will be truthful. The way you start out with a person is the way you end up. HE IS DIRTY. YOU ONLY SAW THE PHONE RECORD. YOU HAVE NO REAL PROOF THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TOGETHER, SINCE JULY. IT IS EASY TO HOOK UP WITH SOMEONE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO. AND YOU WILL NEVER KNOW...MOST GF/WIVES ARE THE LAST TO KNOW, YA KNOW. GOOD LUCK WITH COMMON SENSE.

As long as the both of you are happy with the situation that is all that matters.  When the cuddling and kissing stops, the flowers are no longer....will you feel the same way.

Hoping you always have that...and congratulate you on your happiness.  Not many can say that it seems anymore, me being one of them.  Sex once a month (if that), kissing only when I ask and cuddling seems like a chore for him.  Its been this way for 27 years...happy (NO), comfortable (sort of), lonely (hell yes!).  I am also menopausal and my sexual drive has shot up...go figure!

Again congrats on your happiness

In your 40's you both should still have a great libido (menopausal hormones excepted - but sometimes menopausal women are more horny- I speak from experience!)- and men are at their prime!  I would say it is unusual that sex is not a priority for him.  It's how a loving couple usually can express themselves to their partner.  Why should you have to have learnt to go without?  He could pleasure you in other ways if he didnt feel like sex himself.  That's selfish of him as you have your needs too.  If both your bodies are in sync in that you are happy as you are, then fine.  However, just by asking the question must mean you have some doubt in your mind.  He's a good father, provider, you trust him etc etc - so what's missing?  Are you happy he is happy?  So what about you?

I've had enough and I quit this relationship!!!?



I've posted before about the abusive relationship I'm in. I want to leave so bad but leaving with no money is very hard. I'm starting a new job and I want to wait till I have enough funds to move. I don't want to go to a shelter I did before and my spouse just threw it in my face, that I was useless that a shelter is where I belonged.



So for now I am enduring his crap, his put downs, everything is my fault. I don't even talk back to him, its like two people in the same house with no communication. He calls me lazy, fat ugly yet he says he's so jello of me?? w/e Then he asks for sex, I don't even like looking at him let alone have sexual relations with him.



I'm so sick of his put downs I've stopped doing things for him, stopped cooking, laundry, everything. He yells more and I just sit there and take it. No matter how hard I try nothing is right, he's crabby about billz but for him to drink up $500.00 thats not a problem. He even asks me for receipts, from groceries and other billz. He says oh I'll buy you this and that but if he does buy me something nice, he complains later that I'm ungrateful and he spent this much money one me. So I accept nothing from him any more.



He's on probation for pushing me 4 years ago (finally went to court) but he has his P.O wrapped around his finger. To every one else he is so nice, he wouldn't be that mean. He talks about how every one loves him at work, but once he's home he treats me like sh*t. Does he really hate me that much? Cause I hate him so much I wish he were six feet under!



I'm going to leave to a shelter with my kidz, even if he makes fun of me, Its better than living in hell and misery. Did anybody out there just leave with nothing? or did you stay till you had enough to leave? How did you do it?

Leaving is the right thing to do. Go to the shelter. This time follow their advice and don't go back. They will help. If you don't go back, he can't throw it in your face. Better some short term pain for long term happiness. And it's the right thing to do for the children. Anytime you feel regrets, etc, think about what damage is being done and will be done to them if you stay.

I was in a very bad abusive relationship. I had enough one day and just left. I was a SAHM and had no money. I packed up what I could fit in my car and took off while he was at work. We went to a women's shelter and stayed for 3 months. I saved up enough to get a small place for us and things have taken off from there. It's about 4 years later. I met a wonderful man. We are in the process of buying a house and happy as can be. If you are in that situation just get out. Everything else will come to you. It's hard and I felt like giving up at times but YOU CAN DO IT! I am so happy I decided not to live like that for one more day! Good luck and email me if you need to talk :o)

The only thing to do is leave. He is just being an *** by knowing that his words and actions affect you. and you are staying and allowing him to do it isnt helping yourself. And for your children- they should not be seeing this influence. How would you like your child to be the victim or even the predator. I dont think you would like it very much. whatever he wants to say or think is his own business but only you know the truth.

bravo for you lady. Finally someone whose being tired of being ground under someone's heel.



Screw this 'making fun of you' for going to a shelter. leave and get situated. You have brass ovaries and are pretty keen to what's going on around you. that only means one thing. You'll survive. not just survive but you've enough anger in you right now to succeed in anything you choose to do once you're rid of this jackass.



You go for it. Good luck and I'm betting you'll shine.

This is a very tough time for me and I would really and truly appreciate any advice. 4 years ago I started a?



relationship with a wonderful girl we seemed instantly compatible and were very in love, however she was often too brutally honest and after confessing that she was beginning to like a good friend of mine I ended the relationship. It was very quickly lived during that time (6 months) but she remained pervasively on my mind. 8 months later she contacted me again and we ended up back together. This was the best time in my life, I rode the bus with flower, I visited her at work with letter, it was a great time. This period lasted 2 years and I remember our relationship as a generally happy one, however she remembers it as happy moments and a lot of mistreatment from my part and I do admit I many times reacted very negatively, we had multiple little separations and  mini-break ups" (probably 5 times) more on my part than hers. She told me I screamed at her I snapped at her and that she hated it but she stayed because she loved me and felt guilty for having hurt me during our first relationship. We argued a lot but we really did love each other. She suffered from depression, she had abandonment issues from her father and sometimes I just was too immature to handle things correctly. She had a best friend whom she called her sister" (a 31 year old single mother) that she worked with. I always thought that this "sister" of hers had a good personality and was happy, cheery and upbeat most of the time even through problems. I used to tell her that maybe she should learn how to handle things like her sister sometimes but she would get incredibly mad and jealous. During our most heated arguments she would accuse me of liking her sister but I really didn’t.  Then in December of last year she ended things with me via email after we had a fight. I tried to forget her but I couldn’t. Then trying to seek help I posted a comment on the internet regarding her and describing our problem. What I put in the comment was that after accusing me so many times of liking her sister I came to do it. I actually began to look at her sister in that type of light. Needless to say she saw the comment and was in shock she told me that we were through and that she felt incredibly betrayed. I tried hard to give her the space necessary again. I tried to explain to her that I didn’t feel that way about her sister anymore and all I wanted was her. I apologized and told her I didn’t want someone I loved to feel that way or to live their life unhappy and not in love with the person they were with. She refused and told me she considered it cheating, that in her mind I had actually cheated on her. She told me that the past 2 years had been horrible to her. She told me her mantra up until then had been "well, at least he doesn’t beat me or cheat one me” and that now the only thing she could say was "well at least he doesn’t beat me." When she told me that my heart hurt to know she had been feeling this way I tried the impossible to try and gain her back. I was myself trying to understand the concept that she thought I was cheating on her even thought there had been nothing physical and that just my thoughts alone were enough for her to think so. Finally I understood that I had messed up. She has constantly told me she wants me as a friend only and not a boyfriend. In the end because I love her I submitted and I swallowed and tried to bury the amorous love I had for her. She even called me once to tell me she had been noticing another friend of mine. One day, a month later she called me to tell me that she wanted to stay together and work things out. I was so happy, we were so happy. Then one day we had a huge argument at shopping mall and things just became cold. We broke up from her side but I just couldn’t let go. I tried everything I could to get her back. She told me she loved me but more as a friend now than anything else. Even though I was still madly in love with her I managed ok and I left her alone. Then 2 weeks later when talking I asked her if she wanted to give this another try and she said yes but she also said that it would be that very last time because we had been through too much. The next couple of months were in a sense amazing. I threw her a giant birthday bbq, took days off work, cooked for her, we went to the beach, I thought we were off to a great start again and that this time I could keep everything together. We once again became part of our daily routine and were always together. I was happy and I thought she was too. I was excited because i felt that I had learned how to treat her as she deserved, with love and honesty. October came and we had been planning our Halloween. Usually Saturdays were our nights out and so I had been doing laundry that morning and all of a sudden I call her and she tells me "I want to break up". I couldn’t believe it. I acted very calm at least I tried to be and I tried being supportive but then I just got angry and told her to not call me and that I didn’t want to see her at all. That weekend was

Normally I don't read questions that are this long, but after reading the first sentences I couldn't stop.
That is so sad and horrible.
I'm not sure really what kind of advice to give you, but the love you seem to have for her is rare.
And I think you should hold on enough to see if she comes back.
Have you asked her why she broke up with you or what went wrong?
Maybe she is scared.



I'm sorry for your loss and I hope she realizes she loves you and wants to come back.
All I can say is hope and pray.



I encourage you to try talking to her about what happened.
Maybe she is going through a hard time and needs some space.
Find out for sure.
Good luck.

I couldn't even read the whole question, it was soooo long and drawn out...



But here's what I think, based on what I've read.  You two have been through too much.  People don't get back together and break up multiple times and wind up having a happy life together.  Just let this one go.  You probably didn't mess up as badly as you think you did...it kind of sounds like she's got some big issues (sister-friend? cheating?  I hardly think so) and you two, no matter how much you love and care for her, are just not made to be together.  It's hard, at first, but life does move on rather nicely after a breakup.  Let her go and move on...maybe the next girl you find won't be so fickle and psycho.

There’s no point. You cheated. You clearly proved that “love” it was not. Why put yourself in a position to drag mistrust thru a relationship that already crumbled? This makes no sense. Even the slightest desire of cheating on someone I claimed to love is a substantial sign that it’s not love. To use the excuse that being pressured to cheat thru your partners assumptions is a complete lie, and that’s the truth. If you were a bit concerned of the relationship, removing yourself from that predicament in order to set forth an honest example of actually caring for yourself as well as the relationship would have been at best thing to do.



What is dignity? Cheating and lying is what I will never tolerate. It is better to know the truth then to be lied to, no matter what it is, ESPECIALLY when it comes to a relationship.

Its a form of jealously mostly. or he might think that you were having a sex dream about someone else. yet u ask any guy who speaks the truth, and while with his partner or not he thinks of many different girls in the intimate scene. so technically there is no justification to be mad. he is just trying to be superior, or be an ***. Either way, he shouldn't be mad. its nothing to make a fuss about.

Jealousy does things to people and makes them say things that are extremely hurtful.  How solid was your marriage before this happened.  Maybe he was the one in your dream. Maybe he needs to step up to the plate and pay better attention to you, or you were remembering a night that you and he lost control.  Either way, he's overreacting, and needs to realize maybe he'll have a dream like that and he'll get too.

it's not your fault honey, no way.



You probably haven't had that in a while, maybe?

It doesn't sound like your/he's cheating..
Tell him you want to talk, explain your side then let him on his views..
If he loves you honey he'll talk, listen and perhaps spend more time understanding you..



Instead of flying off the handle, doesn't solve anything..

He is insecure.  If your husband is the jealous type, it does not matter whether you have a dream, look at a wall (he will think you are looking at another man).  Jealous people have a problem.  This isn't your fault and even if you were dreaming about a man...there isn't anything criminal about that...many people think and look at the opposite sex without "dreaming."  Find a good doctor for your husband to talk to...he needs HELP ~ THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TYPE!!!  A good response to him would have been, "Well, if you saw me moaning in my dream, why didn't you do something to make it a reality for me and YOU?"  Instead of getting mad...why didn't he approach you in a loving way?  Sounds like it would have been, "being at the right place at the right time."  He screwed up and had he chosen to be "loving toward you" instead of "angry at you"...you would have been loving toward him.  I think he chose the wrong emotion to feel at that moment. Tell him to "choose to get over it."

Is he cheating&gt; or am I insecure Prt 2?



His business life isn't a legit one I can only say so much. I have confronted him about the situation many times. Hes told me that he is taken care of business, And that I am his wife....( we are not married) and nobody could take my place. He wont let me look in his phone and says that if we have no trust then we have nothing and that if I cant trust him then i should leave..... He does get frustrated when I bring up that fact that I am lonely, and when i do so, he gets upset, and in a sly way acts as if though I could be the one cheating. He does have tons of family and friends and is always very motivated. His favorite quote is," I will sleep when I die".

First of all, how are you his wife if you aren't married?  That's an oxymoron, but if telling yourself you really are "his wife" is cool with you then, well, your choice. Second, when the sh!t hits the fan and you got goons with guns kicking down you're door, whether they're cops or crooks, are you willing to go down with him?  Sounds like he's got you pinned under his finger just the way he wants.  I'd run for the hills if i were you...unless of course you want to be one of those 'ride or die' chicks. Good luck with it.

His behavior sounds suspicious and very much like what my ex husband did to me when he was having an affair.  I think your gut is telling you something and you should trust it.

If he is acting that way, whether he is cheating or not, I do not think you have a healthy relationship at all. He obviously is not interested enough to make time for you. And if he suggests you need trust then he should have no problem letting you look in his phone. My boyfriend lets me into his phone. If he gets irritated over you simply missing him, then he doesnt deserve someone to miss him. The fact that he says no one could take your place, but then he turns around and tells you to leave, shows that he is not caring enough. He is lying. And you need to find someone you are happy with. He sounds a little obsessed with work. Let work be his partner, since he obviously has more commitment to everything but you.

Would you go to sleep after an argument?



I didn't have an argument last night because my hubby decided to turn his back and go to sleep before I could say anything. He knocked out and I spend most of the night crying outside in the back yard. If you knew your spouse is upset and not in bed would you go to sleep?

He probably had no clue you were upset.  Why don't you bring it up with him gently when you're both together later?  Tell him that you wanted to discuss something, but felt hurt when he turned his back on you and fell asleep.  Then ask him if now would be a good time to discuss matters.



Don't bring up the fact that you sat in the back yard crying.  That's just using tears for guilt, and doesn't work well in arguments.

Late night is the worst time to start a fight. Why didn't you bring it up earlier? You really need to pick your arguments well. Was it over a trivial matter or was it something serious. It may not seem like a big deal to your husband, but if it's a big deal to you why not try talking to him about your issue just after dinner when there is time to resolve the issue before bed.

From the sounds of it, you missed your opportunity to talk to him. It's not that he intentionally went to bed knowing you were mad-he honestly might not have known. If you wait till bed to talk about things that are bothering you, you are basically forcing the fight to go either long into the night, or drag through the night till the following day.



At your next chance, talk about how you are feeling. Have the conversation earlier in the evening, so you have time to work through it and resolve things before bed.

Everyone has a different way of reacting to their emotions.  Personally I can't sleep - or do much else - if I'm fighting with a loved one.  But my husband sometimes likes to take some time to sleep on it or quietly reflect on his thoughts before resolving a disagreement.  It's not that he's immature or insensitive - he just likes to think things through until he's calm and collected.  Sometimes you do see things clearer the next morning.  If you're still upset tell your husband how you're feeling about him passing out why you cried alone.

How do I get my husband to stop going to the bar?



I'm 21 and my husband is 22. He's friends with a bunch of 30-40 year old divorced men who like to drink after work. They get off work at 4:30 and drink until I get off at 6:30... This is not only annoying but it is now threatening our car insurance and savings. He has been in one fender-bender and pulled over once for something else while coming home from the bar in the past year. He was going three or four times a week and I finally got him down to one night. I don't want him to go at all. He insists that he needs the male pal-around time with his friends to unwind. My argument is why can't they come to the house and buy beer on the way home (safer for at least my hubby). He says because it's not as much fun. He's not cheating on me, he's just being a man. I want him to stop going. I don't go out with my friends after work, I come home and take care of him. He encourages me to go out but then makes plans so that I can't. I trust him completely and this is in no way a jealousy thing. He promised that he would stop the last time he got pulled over when he was drinking and he just called and said he is going tonight. What do I do?

My husband separated from me?



Okay please if you have nothing nice don't comment on my question not really able to deal with mean people.



So I am 27 week pregos. My husband in Aug the week of the Olympics went in a business trip and meet another women. He came back and told me he is having these feelings for her and he wants to separate from me and try it with her. I explained that this is lust and it would go away but he said he has to try it. The other women lives in DC he live in Florida so is a long distance relationship they are having at this point. He goes and visit her every 2 weeks or when ever he has money to buy a ticket and talks on the phone with her every night for 3 hours. I am planning on divorcing him when I have the baby so don't worry about me doing the right thing. the fact that I am prego and he doing this means he does not respect me and I am not going to stand for that. My question is



They tell each other I love you already do you think this is real love or efatuation AKA lust talking and that he will snap out of this. He already has a kid with a women he had a one night stand and now having another one with me his wife of 3 years. This women according to him knows this and is willing to still try the relationship. I told him it will pass but he dosen't believe me he think it will work out. He say he loves me still but he dosen't feel that passion that he feeling with her. Can someone tell me can i be wrong maybe they do really love each other. He is in the navy and can't leave florida until June so they won't be able to be together until then. Can someone give me some insite b/c I am really trying to understand this madness.

<question>



Should i try to get her back?



I was with a girl for 2 1/2 years, from end of junior year in high school till halfway through my third semester at college. The first year and a half were great but ever since we started going to college things got a little harder, but things were still great.



We are going to colleges that are 15 miles apart, and our hometown is about 20 miles from both colleges. I lived on campus the first year and am now commuting, she was always commuting. A week or two after our second anniversary she broke up with me, and never gave me a reason. 3 days later she texted me wanting to get back together, and I said yes.



We dated for a couple more months and things were good as usual, and then the night of her birthday she broke up with me. This time she said she felt like she was getting disappointed on Christmas, her birthday, and our anniversary by me. She also said she didn't want to live her life saying "what if?"



I would always get her jewelry (necklace, ring, earings) for Christmas, lotions or candles, stuff to pamper herself with on her birthday along with small inside jokes we shared, and took her out to dinner to different restaurants on our anniversary along with a necklace. I wasn’t big on a lot of gifts though, I was more into doing small things from day to day. Surprising her at work with flowers, send her poetry in emails letting her know I was thinking of her, and other stuff.



I realize now that she never really tried showing she loved me unless it was on my birthday or Christmas when she would get me a lot of clothes and other things like that. I obviously was happy with what she got me didn’t realize until she broke up with me that she was very materialistic and didn’t care much about the little things like me.



With my question, I still care about her and she said she still loved me and cared about me when we broke up the second time, that no one could take my place, that there was no one else. I’m not really sure if I want to try and get her back or not, any suggestions?

yes, but, understand that cellular traffic can be intercepted if one has the right technology. Also understand that porn (not well defined by the courts so prosecution depends on the DA) is against the law on wire and wireless public communication networks. This is at the federal level and many states, etc. There is a further standard of "community" concerning not just porn, but nudity, i.e. it depends on the community. For example what you can get away with in California may be prosecutable in Utah or Alabama. My suggestion would be to keep it titillating, but not explicit. Also, his work may have an issue with it. Is he a fireman... Govt often has higher standards/rules than industry.

Sure it is, and you should consider yourself a lucky young woman, that your husband wants to see you and not look on the internet at all the other women.  So take off those clothes and take some erotic pictures that will have him rushing home to you in anticipation of seeing and feeling you in person.  Have fun and good luck.

You can tell if hes cheating if he acts strange plus your instincts are always right so that's also a sign! you can tell if hes texting a girl like if your talking to him and all he does is ignore you and say uh,yeah,okay...or you can check in his pockets and see if you see any receipts from a place you know he does not normally go to!

When he is sneaking around and lying. If women are calling or he smells like perfume. If you think you have a good man don't go making yourself crazy looking for all these signs. No matter what you do people will either cheat or they won't. If it happens you live and learn. Make sure they are cheating before you ruin your marriage over it.

Your intuition is a good start. Remember what made you fall in love with him? Was it a certain smell, a look or his touch? If his smell is different, there is another woman. If he doesn't look at you like he used to there is another woman and if his touch is emotionless, there is likely another woman.



Trust your intuition. That is all that you've got right now. Trust him or not then do not become so jealous that he uses that against you to go the other woman.

If you don't trust him, why are you not talking about things like this?  Are you paranoid or do you have evidence that really makes you wonder?  Talk to him and find out if anything is going on.  If he's lying to you, you will find out and decide what to do from there.

You can never know for sure, unless you snoop(which shows you don't trust him). you just have to trust and have faith that you are the only one in his life. If you are having concerns though you should talk to him. Talking to him and not accusing him is the best thing to do, that way you avoid a unnecessary fight.

I think one of the biggest signs is that he's not interested in getting intimate anymore.



If you are suspicious you can always go through bank statements and phone records. They don't think about covering up like we do so they always slip.

Do any of your husbands......?



Forget doing the smallest little chore over and over?  When my husband has a day off work he stays up a little later than I do and before I go to bed, I ask him to clean a bottle for our son to have during the night.  Does he do it when I get up?  Of course not.  It's always, I forgot.  How does someone forget every week?  Sometimes he may do laundry (on a rare occasion) but when it's done he throws my stuff on the bed for it to be wrinkled while his stuff is put away.  I find myself always putting his shits, pants, socks and underwear away everytime I do laundry.  Why can't he help out?  Why can't he decide to get the vacuum out and say, I think I'll vacuum?  What do I do or what can I say, so I don't just blow up?  It's driving me crazy.



</question>



<additional details>



I don't get a thank you if I mow the yard or take him and the kids out to dinner.  Sometimes us wives have a thankless life.

I have the same problem every day of my life and it drives me nuts. I understand i am the stay at home mom with a energetic 4 year old.. but it has always been me doing the bottles, diaper changes when he was little ofcourse, now cleaning, bathing, feeding our child. Ya think when i am overwhelmed with my 24 hour 7 day a week job he would say hey... I got these dinner dished.. Or i'll take the dogs for a walk.. Not a chance..Even on his days off i am the slave,nanny,caretaker,ect..I just take it one day at a time.. I left recently for about 2 weeks because I had enough of my slave job. I didn't know if i was coming back at first but he chased me saying I understand now what you do.. With cleaning, dogs, child.. My child was with me ofcourse...So now I just say hey can you help out and i think it triggers in his head well remember when I didn't have her help how hard things we....(which they weren't )  he says sure put the garbage by the door.. Then he takes it.. If it takes leaving for a couple days to prove a point.. I never thought it would work...but it did.. If not that ...I would say go on strike... Let him take care of things.. and tell him to im done..Your turn now...your house might get a little messy but atleast your point will get across...Good luck....

If you've always done most of the housework and now you'd like help that may be the problem.  When you overcompensate for someone for a long time it's very difficult to get that to stop.  A new baby often magnifies it.  I don't recommend a tit for tat approach.  I recommend sitting down and explaining that things have changed and you need more help than you used to.  Everyone works and everyone is tired.  That is an excuse - this is a partnership.  If you need help say it.  Not just with a bottle at night - he needs to be more aware in general.  If he doesn't realize it is a big deal - it isn't.

If you ex (wife or husband) would want to get a firearm licence...?



Would you willingly sign the forms?



Here, my ex-husband would need my signature to get an acquisition licence... and no, he's not trying to get one, this is all just hypothetical... but, I've been thinking lately... and with his past drug and alcohol abuse, with his anger problems, and threats he's made against me and my family in the past... I don't think I'd give my signature!!!Kind of afraid that if we fall out again, he'd go after me, my family, or even himself.



Would you sign for a firearm possession or acquisition licence for your ex-husband or ex-wife?

I mean she spend time with me too. Is just that. This girl wouldn't drop or cancle no plans for me. So why im I so in love with her. When I had plenty of girls before who would do what ever for me? I want to marry this girl. ANd I feel like its the only way that I well see her more. She won't leave nothing at my apartment and she won't move in with me. An everytime I bring up marriage she change the subject. Or she tells me she hasn't really thought about that subject much. She doesn't call me much. Especially when I;m  with the guys.

The reason why you are so in love with her. Is because your girl has a life. And her happiness don't depend on you. She got goals (med school).And she don't pressure you or make you feel tie down in any way even after one year. Sounds like you got yourself a winner.

FMIL is really annoying me-what do I do?



Me and my fiance don't want children, but his mother asks us when we are going to have them on an almost constant basis. We have explained to her that we are not going to change our minds, but she won't listen. She thinks that it is perfectly reasonable for me to give up my job (which I spent a lot of time, effort and money qualifying for) to stay home all day. I would be happy to lie to her and tell her that we are trying to have a baby but failing, but my FH says he isn't comfortable lying about that to his mother and getting her hopes up. What can I say to convince her that no amount of whining will change our minds?

Just because a man has only been with one woman does not destine him to boredom. What the husband & wife make of their intimate life will dictate boredom or lack therof. I think it's insulting to assume that being with only one woman is enough cause to drive a man to boredom- unless that woman only offers boredom.

Nope not if they are both taking the effort to spice it up.  I have been married over 9yrs and still can not get enough of my wife.  I think this occurs more often with guys that are promiscuous when younger then guys that wait for the one they marry.  Because they know that every woman has a different feeling or could be better in the sac.  Personally I waited for the woman I married and proud that I did screwing around just has a load of probable consequences like pregnancy or STD's that really just screws up your life.

I was with other women before I met my ex wife. My sex life with my ex never got boring. I was totally faithful to that woman for 14 years. That didn't matter to her. Nothing could make her happy.



But as far as our sex life went, it didn't get boring. Over the years, the sex seem to get better and better. I could keep her satified as far as that went. As far as I was concerned, we could have done it more but I wasn't going to complain. she just didn't have it in her to do any more. that's ok. Our marriage bed was sacred. up to the day she didn't want to be married anymore.



So no. it doesn't have to get boring.

Can it set a better example for mom to leave dad when the children are girls?



Anyone with a link or site that can help me justify this? My husband and I married for the wrong reasons and some of our times are very difficult and stressful for both us and out girls. We care about each other only because we have the children in common. I have tried to leave before, but he is convinced that we have to force ourselves through this for the good of the girls and because he does not want to lose time with them. He will not leave on his own and fights me every time I try. I am willing to share custody, he is a good father. We just are not truly in love. Is there any way to show him (or myself) proof that I wold set a better example for my girls by showing them that it is OK to move on and let them maintain contact with both of us equally, then to continue having them see the problems we subject the to. As girls, I want them to learn from my example that it is OK to admit a mistake and move on. can anyone direct me to data that confirms what I believe. Our relationship is never going to be what we want it to be or what we would want for them. We are just making it tolerable and the stress is hurting all of us. The oldest will be 8 next year and will soon be forming her ideas on what is appropriate in a relationship. Any help for all of us, Mom, Dad and Kids, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all very much...

I'd be questioning the morals of a man who would expect to be paid to babysit his step-kids.  That's sorry, if you ask me.  It's wrong of your wife to ask you to pay for it considering it was for her benefit, especially after 7 months.  Tell her to go jump and if she takes you to court over it, the judge will probably laugh at her.

That's ridiculous!  Some women will try to get away with anything, I swear!  If this has to do with a child support case, I believe that it would never hold up.  At least in Ohio, the child care/day care place has to be accredited and approved by the court in order for it to be listed on the calculation worksheet.  My hubby's ex-wife has their 13 year old watch their 7 year old often and is not able to list her as "day care".  I don't see how this would be any different.  She would need receipts or some other type of proof as well, by the way.  Good luck!

Are you kidding me?  She is just trying to get money from you!  Saying that she paid her current husband to watch her kids is ridiculous!  Like you said, the money isn't leaving the household!  Of course, a person can say they do it, but you are not obligated to 'pay' her for it!  There was no agreement between you and where is the proof, anyway?



Why pay for something that you don't even know happened and that you don't have to pay!

Well logically your correct.



But this is America the land where all logic has been lost.  I actually know a woman who has 3 children and runs a daycare and the state is paying for her kids to be in her daycare while she is working at the daycare that she runs.



And her kids are the only ones in this daycare.



And this payment is above and beyond what she recieves in wellfare checks.  She very readily admits that she makes $3500 a month sitting at home watching her own children.

MY MIND IS BLOWN and you did it with this question.  Actually, legally she is paying him probably to set a precedence that this dude has been paid and now she wants you to continue paying for the child care. Uff da  Seek--legal advice from a family lawyer asap.  PS do you approve of the quality of this child care? Have you asked your children if they are ok with it? and lastly I just can't believe this question.

Take out the step, they are your children. No way!!!  Flat out no way. It is not acceptable. If she wants to pay someone to watch your kids, there are plenty of daycares, and friends that would be glad to take the kids. My opinion is that if she pays you to watch the kids, she knows she going out to do something she shouldn't be, or is just being selfish and doesn't want to take the kids. I mean, she wants you to pay her to watch the kids? Does she pay you? Tell her you'll take it out in sex, that she can pay that way!!!!!! What a B**ch!!!!

<question>



Can you explain my wife's behaviour?



Last month at the shoe store, I was surprised by the way a salesman flirted with my wife and the way she reacted to it. She actually seemed comfortable with his flirting and allowed him to hold her foot in his hand for long moments as he helped her try different shoes. At other times he kept his hand on her knees or putting his hand on her waist when she would try the shoes in front of the mirror. My reaction to that is I got immensely aroused and I have not stopped fantasizing about this guy actually making it with my wife. I was really taken aback by my reaction and these images keep playing in my mind. I would like other people to help me understand my reaction. Why would I want this guy to have his way with my wife and successful bed her? It is also worth mentioning that the salesman was really good looking. I am also interested in knowing what goes in a woman's mind in moments like this. Would anything more have happened if I was not around on that day? Would my wife try to go to the store again on her own to try more shoes, and try to meet with the guy in my absence?

Don't be alarmed. It's a common fantasy to be there while someone else makes it with your mate. There is nothing wrong with you at all. If you were uncomfortable with the amount of touching, I would let your wife know, only because she might be used to it and doesn't know that it makes you feel that way. Also I'd share the fantasy with her. No reason to be shy. She might not feel the same way as you, but then again she might be interested.



As for if anything more would have happened I doubt it. Most women start getting come on to around 13 and for most of us it's like water off a duck's back. It isn't a crime to bask in another male's attention every once in a while. We don't focus on it any more than when it's happening and when we laugh about it with our girlfriends. She's with you, she loves you, let it go.

Some men are aroused by the thought of other men engaging in sex with their wife.



I would say the salesperson was being flirtatious with your wife to get the sale.
Most shoe stores give their sales people a commission.
So if he can make your wife feel like Ms. Sex-appeal 2008 for her to buy more shoes, it generates a larger paycheck for him.

well your reaction? idk. maybe thats a deep fantasy of yours to see some other guy do your wife, why? idk.



her? well sometimes its nice as a woman, to know that despite being married she is still seen as desirable to other men. when you are with only one man for a long time (and the reverse works too) you sometimes forget that other men find you attractive too. its a nice complement like saying she has still got it. especially if she doesn't get told she is beautiful by her husband very often (cough) because though he loves her he assumes she knows that or just doesnt think to say it to her, and she doesnt know it, when men stop saying it women stop thinking its true. and maybe she just wanted to know that shes still got it, and that she is still desirable to others, its an ego boost. maybe she will go back and see him, maybe not. hopefully she is a good faithful wife, who also knows that shoe salesman are sleezes. maybe shes not and maybe she cheats, we dont know your wife and we cant tell you either way.



maybe you'd like that. and maybe you should sign up for one of those wife banging porno sites. idk.



just maybe thats whats going on.

Um. If he isn't into you enough to do it himself, if he isn't even going to bother to ask your mother if he can marry you himself, then he probably is not ready to be a husband yet. If he really wanted to marry you he would have done something about it by now. Time to move on and forget about him.

Any 'man' who considers sexual liasons with females a 'conquest' and something to brag about hasn't had much experience in life. He also hasn't any friends who have any brains either as most men that I know would curl their lip and sneer at a man who can't keep an intimate act between two people to himself.

<question>



How do I find out if my estranged sister is still alive?



She abandoned the family about 10 years ago after getting involved with a less than moral man.  We found her once before through the phone book, and left her alone at her request. She said (for reasons we don't understand) she wanted nothing to do with our family.  My mother is getting older and we would like to try to reunite with her while mom's still around.



My sister has always been grossly overweight, and the last time I saw her she was at least 350 lbs. or more, so I don't even know that she's still alive. She was a prime candidate for diabetes or heart disease.



How do I find her without hiring a private detective? What public record searches can I do, knowing her birth-date and social security number to find information on her?

You need to find out what the messages say that they are sending each other. If he refuses to show you it's cause he is cheating. So you either need to leave him or beat or ***!!! What the hell I would do both!

He's not cheating your just being delusional.  And even if he is cheating it's probably your fault, so let him cheat.  He's obviously not getting what he wants from you, so he gets it elsewhere.

He's either attracted to the girl or she just does really good massages!  Go to the girl and talk to her.  Don't confront him because that could ruin the relationship between you and him.  Go out with him and show him what a great girl you are!( if you discover stronger signals them maybe consider confronting him)

If you are sending someone hearts who is not family, then it is for a love interest.  Plain and simple - he is testing the waters, he's crossed the line. Wish him well and let him loose.  If he is not physically cheating on you yet, he will be.  He's already having an emotional affair.

No...I'd have to say no. Why? Bceause you said 'he used to like her'. See...that's past tense. So despite all this stuff that would lead any reasonable and prudent person to believe that something is going on...how can it be when he 'used' to like her.

I think there are several types of cheating...



1.  of course anything sexual



2. Emotional cheating...meaning that you are having emotional feelings toward someone else and sharing those thoughts or feelings with someone other than your spouse...



3. and anything that you feel you should hide from your spouse...

I was married for two and a half years and then got divorced.  There were many reasons but the main ones were that I wanted children and he didn't.  We couldn't come to a compromise so we decided to go our separate ways.  I wish I had never married him in the first place but now I consider it one of those life lessons.  Do what you feel is best for you.  Life is too short to stay in a relationship that doesn't work.

Try marriage counseling.

It hurts for kids to see their parents fighting.  So make sure no kids are involved in it.

Listen to me please.  The first year / two are the hardest in a marriage.  Don't throw in the towel.  Know this from a person who has gone thru it.  It gets better I promise.  You and he will go through times when you are in your puppy love again and then you will each have moments of literally not liking the other.  It's all normal.  Do you have children?  If you do, that can change things for a while for a bajillion reasons, but in the end all good.  I was married for 5 years then divorced my husband....I really thought I was not happy.  Well, here I am three years after us divorcing and we are remarried.  Older / Wiser and realizing that out there it's all the same (TRUST ME).  If you have 7 out of 10 things you love about eachother, you are on the right road, keep on and don't worry if you sometimes feel like throwing in the towel, we all do....you will be okay...hang in there and be your own success story.  The fact that you posted shows you care, go with that....your on the right track!

I was married for one year when I was very young.  I was 17 and he was 18.  We thought we were going to have so much fun playing house and it really didn't turn out that way.  He wasn't finished being a young man and he wanted to still have fun.  I was young and stupid and put up with a lot thinking I had to prove to everyone that we hadn't made a mistake (Since everyone we know thought we were too young).  Finally I realized that this wasn't what I really wanted my marriage to be and I left him and got a divorce.  Not blaming anyone really, we were just too young.  He had a whole lot more playing around he needed to do.  I'm 56 now and have been married to my loving husband for 30 years.

This is my exbf story..... She got pregnant on purpose (went off her bc without him knowing it).  Ihe married her so his child would not be a bastard.  She cheated on him with her mother's boyfriend then filed for a divorce 11 months later.  He gave her the house, which she sold and moved  90 miles away.  He has been driving the 180 miles every other week for the past 5 years to visit with his son.  I guess she just wanted a baby, but not a husband.  Pretty much a normal story I think.

Yes, I was married to my first wife for a very short time.  Honestly, we were young, and I was heavy into the throws of alcoholism at the time. We were crazy about each other, and had crazy awesome sex 2-3 times a day...everyday.  I will never forget our time together.  It wasn't all bad, however, she had been sexually abused by her alcoholic father I found out later.  She had some anger issues and was a little abusive at times. I don't blame her for not seeing much of a future in me, so she ran off with an ex-boyfriend in another state.  He had a better job than me at the time and he made more money.  They remain married and have 3 kids together.



I since have gone back to school and gotten sober and have a great job, don't know what my life would be like today if she would have stayed

If he is still in the military you can simply contact his commanding officer.  That is how my sis got divorced from her hubby who was in the navy.  He had moved across country she used a locator to find him called the base.  Within a week he was back here signing the papers.

file the paperwork.put down her last known address.if they cannot find her,just show up for the court date and they will probably extend the divorce for another few months.if she still cant be found then then at the next date they will probably give you what you want.

If you are opposed then don't go.  If you want to avoid discussing your philosophical beliefs about abortion than make up a reason you can't go.  If you are good friends then she may already know how you feel (on some level).  You can just tell her that due to your beliefs you just can't support her decision at this time.  Leave it at that.

It is important for you to stress to your friend that you completely support whatever deciasion she makes for herself but that because her decision goes strongly against your beliefs, you will not be able to go with her. Be sure to make yourself available before & after, if you feel you are able. It's a tough place to be for both you and your friend: I don't envy either of you. Best wishes.

2. tell her you have to go to church

Thats really tough, but I think you need to stand your ground and not go. Unfortunately because she is in an emotional state, maybe you should'nt exasperate her situation by telling her the truth on why you dont want to go. This may only make her feel rejected and neglected by you. She has obviously made up her mind and its no use in you getting on your soap box and making it worse.Maybe you can tell her that you will be out of town or that you have to work or go to school. Tell her you have to help a family member in an emergency.



Once its over though, you definitely need to have a talk with her and let her know how you feel and that you dont want to see her make that mistake again.

If she is a "really good friend" as you stated, you should be there for her through whatever obstacles she goes through.  I'm sure she needs your support now more than ever (I'm sure its not easy for her either).  You don't have to be there in the room while she's getting it done, just be there to drive her safely home.



She trusts you enough to ask you for this favor, so going with her is not being an "accomplice" its being a friend.

Tell her exactly how you feel about the issue. Tell her that you love her and always will, but you are morally opposed to her decision.

By going with your friend, you are supporting HER not the issue at hand. I understand your position, as I believe the same thing. But as her friend what is more important? Your belief or supporting your friend? If you really can't go, then tell her the truth, don't lie to her. Be there for her every moment you can. Don't belittle her for choosing this though. I believe that being a friend means sometimes I will sacrifice and be uncomfortable to be a friend. Good Luck hun, I don't envy you!!!

Wow, that is a tough one.  I stand the same place you do when it comes to abortions.  My good friend was put in this same situation, and she ended up taking her friend because she wanted to support her even though she is against it.  When I found out about it, I though about it, and I don't think that I could ever do it.  Even though I would not be the one getting an abortion, I don't think that I could be a part of it at all.  I'd just explain to her how you feel and offer to support her and be there for her when she comes back.

You said it - she is a good friend of mine - so tell her that although you wish her well, your personal beliefs will not allow you to go to the clinic with her.  If I may say, it would be best that you also tell her that you will help her in any other way after.  This is a hard decision for anyone to make and without their friend's help, it is even harder.  Good Luck

She is asking for you to be there to help her through this, not to decide to abort or not. It's her choice and body. You can either be there for you or you can let your beliefs get in the way of supporting a living friend in doing what she feels she needs to do. Your choice, but I would hope that your loyalty to your friendship meant more than your political views.

I know some one who makes her stepson call her mom. When thing don't go well for him at his moms she tell him things like,"God has a way of showing you evil" and things like that..I mean it makes me sick she's totallymanipulating the poor child..

I've been thinking about calling CPS or the childs mother. Even though the stepmom is supposed to be my friend I don't like seeing this take place.

Of course it's not fair.  He needs to seek out some other adult company so he doesn't get as warped as she is.  Perhaps a counselor or priest or uncle who can help him grow up normal.

She sounds like a sick,evil woman that needs help. "God has a way of showing you evil", yeah he's looking at it. The poor little thing, he's going to get messed up in the head and years down the road his wife is going to be the one who has to deal with his mental hang ups.

That's messed up.



I'm raising my step son, and I would never make him call me "Mom."  He already has a mother, and I'm not it.  Sure, I'm his parent, but not his mother.



When things don't go right when he goes to visit his mother, I always defend her.  I try my best to make her out to be a good person to him, because you should always respect your parents.



Things are so unstable at her house he only visits her for 3 hours on Saturday and Sunday, and never even sleeps there.  However, I would NEVER talk down to my stepson about his mother, ever.  That's just not okay.



I feel badly for the poor kid.  Things are confusing enough when you have blended families.  That poor child is going to end up with some serious emotional scars, and his father will be just as much to blame as the stepmom is, if he knows about it and chooses not to do anything.



Poor kid. ;(  Hope everything works out for him.

That is never ever under any circumstances good for any one, Biological or step parent to do. Some one needs to address this issue and fast. Because children are very easy mislead you could say. They believe the things you tell them and take all that information into their future lives as adults. They can have trust issue and things like that.  Maybe you could say something to the childs father in a very adult manner and say your just concerned. Because if any one were to find out about things like this you could loose your child.  Before calling CPS or the childs mother Please try and talk to the childs father. Because your this womans friend she may do things in front of you that she would never do in front of any one else. IF that father doesnt know then he cant fix it and if he lost his children because he married a mixed up lunatic then that isnt fair. He could always leave her and still keep contact with his child.. If he does know and doesnt care then I would call the childs mother and have a small chat with her about some things and then tell her that your concerned. But if the childs father does know and doesnt know what to do then you might possibly be able to help him out. BUT YOU SHOULD also talk with your friend. Maybe she doesnt realize she is being that vendictive with the child. She might think that she isnt doing anything wrong...

And where is the child's father in all of this? He needs to step up.



CPS won't care - they have real abuse to worry about, not some stepmom telling the child things you don't want to hear.



Dad needs to step up and say something.

How to deal with a difficult in-law situation?



I've never gotten on well with my in-laws. When I met my husband in college I was under the impression he came from a lower-middle class nice family.  When he brought me to meet them I was suprised to see they lived in a 2.5 million dollar mansion, as did all their relatives- and were very well off. On our first meeting they made me feel small, and not good enough for their son.

Why do most Americans frown upon/ judge harshly girls who decide to stay virgins until after marriage?



shouldn't it be the opposite, since most Americans are Christians and it specifically states in the bible that sex before marriage is not favored.........also considering the consequences and bad side effects of sex before marriage (STDs, unplanned pregnancies etc.)



a girl could be moderately or not religious (rarely goes to church) but still chooses NOT to have sex before marriage......



also i personally know gorgeous girls who don't mind foreplay but would never have actual intercourse before marriage.........they frequently tell me they are judged cuz of their choice..!

Why do i feel this way..............?



It’s been 3 years since my ex broke up with me for another girl. I was heartbroken but I eventually got over it and move on. I haven't talked to him since.
I realized that everything happens for a reason and there is someone out there for me. I am not bitter anymore and I have no hard feelings towards him.
I have been thinking about the old good days including our first date, the first time we kissed and how he used to look me in the eyes and tell me



How beautiful I am.



Ii addition has been having an urge to run into him just it talk to him and see how he is doing. I don't want him back but it would be nice to see him.
I think I would be very happy to see him.I know he is an ex for a reason but i am happy that he was part of my life for a while and we had fun



So why do I feel this way towards him even though he broke my heart?

Because you're doing that whole nostalgic dreamy bit & not remembering the bad stuff.  It would be one thing if you were just saying that you miss his friendship, but you're not.  You're talking about the way he looked at you, your first kiss, etc.  I'm back in contact with an ex who did me wrong, but I accepted my part in that & we really did just miss the friendship, nothing more.  I don't think it helps to be in contact with someone when there are still unresolved feelings.

because you are truly not over him and will not be able to find  Mr. right until you are over him. I realize this was a good part of your life but that was yesterday. Yesterday is gone and it is not coming back. If you live today to it's fullest you will be happy. When you are happy you are much more attractive.

Because you haven't made enough of an effort to move on?



3 years is a long time, hun. You REALLY need to try to get over this relationship. Yes, it hurts when your significant other abandons you, but after some time it should recede into the distance. Get busy with other things - find a new hobby, make new friends, start dating. Sounds to me like your mind is idling, and it's grabbing onto things that should be left in the past.

My wife left me Saturday after 12 years. Please advise as it's so painful?



We have a daughter age 11 but I took her for granted far too long. I dissapointed her too many times as a provider and she has been more of the bread winner. She was the perfect wife and I blew it. I didn't execute on my dreams and she needed more stability and no longer views me the same way( understandably) I want her back more than anything. I handled it more maturely than she expected. I thought my great communication was enough and she still craves and doesn't want to lose that. She was afraid she would lose me as a best frind but i told her you deserve that and so do I. She does deserve better and I am determined to be the man she needs me to be. It sounds too late ( she said their is no chance) but their is a 30% chance she is doing this extreme measure to finally change me and she has seen it already as we talk every other day and she even invited me to dinner tonight as friends. I acknoledged the significant wrong doing and told her I understand that she needed to do it. How can I get her back and is giving her space the first step.

He still wants to work things out, go to counseling, whatever, but I feel I got married too young (20), and never really got to experience more of what was out there...I also got married out of stupidity...we were druggies and homeless...we're clean now, have a home and two kids, but my life is progressing more (I'm a step away from being a deputy sheriff, and he's against the police)...I'm just wanting to play the field now...guess I'm a little selfish..then again, he's proved himself to be that as well. :)

my ex spends more time with his girlfriend and it is affecting my children. I want him to be happy but not at the expense of my kids. She appears very insecure and controlling(not my opinion only, others have noticed it) I fear my children are coming second now.

<question>



Are all men like this or is just him,?Do i really complain..?



We always argue with my husband becouse i tell him he is not like other men,he used to be better while we were couting but he changed when he married me,.



I always tell him my ex B.f was nice en romantic but he always say i compare him,so what should i do,.



I see other couple happy en nice but him he is just there.



THINGS HE DOES



He never remember my Birthday.
Never kiss me good night
Never kiss me in the morning at least saying goomorning,he just jumps out of bed,
When we meet after work in the evening he just say HI?
Never hugs me maybe by saying goodbye not at the streets not even at home.
No sms during the day to know how one is doing,not even a call even if he is away for work 4a a week,.
Never has time for me ,like we seat en talk,No going out for dinner and when i ask he says everything is in the house so why waste money,
Not even a picnic or Movie.
No suprises flowers or presents.
Pulling a chair u know
He want to walk together en he can say lets meet there.
Never hold hands
Not even recalling when we meet,i always remind him everything,last Velentine i was in tears as i see gals at work with presents en flowers en he did nothing .



There is so so much if i start listing ,but i try to buy  him things en he just say thanks ,i am tired  of doing this alone ..and when i talk he say I like to COMPLAIN.



Conclusion is he is not romantic,he wants me only when on Bed ,en sex thats it,i need to feel more like a woman a lady ,feel loved .



My Ex used to do all en he never forgets anything , he was Very nice i mean very romantic only he went away for studie en we could not have kept distance now he is happly married .



Is this normal or hi is sick en am i asking alot



Do i really complain or men SHOULD be doing all he doesent do??

Im doing a paper about PRO gay marriage...?



These are the facts/ reasons for pro i got...



NOOOOO. The actual oldest known definition of "marriage" is bonding two as one" even before the bible. Its not going to be taught in schools cause normal marriage isn't. the teachers who did are just idiots its not in the curriculum. all those commercials are bullshit. blacks couldn't marry whites for a while. and they can now, gays deserve to as well. if its such a religious thing then it should be only done in a church and atheists shouldn't be able to either. but everyone deserves to get married to whomever they want. the god i believe in loves us no matter what and wants us to be happy, healthy and loved.



Are their any more you can help me with????



I DONT WANT PEOPLE SAYING ITS WRONG NO BLAH BLAH BLAH.. BECAUSE THATS NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. IT JUST MAKES YOU AND YOUR VIEW LOOK IGNORANT IF YOU DO. I WANT REAL HELPFUL ANSWERS.



(and none that say god doesn't exist this is for a church thats basis is about god loving you and his word being a guideline to become a good person, and that he does not condemn anybody and loves us all the same. he is happy for our choices.)



</question>



<additional details>



Ive also got they cannot procreate...but neither can sterile women but they can marry.....and people who just plain marry and dont have kids...so you marry for love not kids

What you marry a guy who lived with his ex for 7 years and live in the same house?



I have someone I am seeing. He was seeing someone else before for 7 years or so and she lived with him and her 3 kids. Tomorrow I am going to redesign his house inside throw out all the old stuff and revamp his house buy new furniture, new linen, change the whole style, buy all new photos and lamps and plants and just change it from how it looks to a new age look. But what I am askin is that he might be ready to sell and move away to a new house. But if I lived there with him post marriage if I accepted ofcourse, would the previous memories haunt him and screw up our future? I am very sentimental and thats why I ask these questions. Thanks



</question>



<additional details>



It was a previous life in relationship. He doesnt have any of his own kids. He threw her out and told her to move on with her life. Now I am on the scene 3 years later. But she was living there with him coz she didnt have money and he was supporting her. Now they left but I am sentimental and very worried it could upset us.... our future if we decided to get married and live a life together

You need to reevaluate your current relationship. Why are you guys seperated for work reasons? Is he in the military? If not, there is no excuse! I would follow my man anywhere. This shows an obvious disconnect in your relationship.
Do you still want to be with your husband? This is the question you need to answer before you question being with another man. If you decide not to be with your husband you need to tell him that BEFORE you cheat on him.

take great caution with people online. you may not want to see it but you are easy picking being vulnerable and having an emotional void in your life. cut ties with the guy online unless there has been a background check done to verify he is safe to be around. focus on yourself and get yourself right before you get into another relationship.

Why is my wife so upset about my ex-girlfriend?



Since I got married, I told my ex-girlfriend (first love) that I didn't want to continue communicating with her. She is also married with a child, and we had been talking once in a while as friends. Since then, she has texted/called/emailed once in a while to say congrats on our marriage, child, etc. I have ignored all of her attempts to make contact, until last week when she called and I answered. We had a 60 second conversation, but my wife got mad because I answered her phone call. I have no intentions of cheating on my wife, and I don't even want to continue talking with me ex, she just keeps contacting me! Am I the bad guy?

It is time to add some roll playing and dress up.  And of course this is the perfect season to buy some very erotic costumes that will add a lot of spice to the bedroom.  So go out and buy that school girl outfit and when he comes home this evening, you can tell him all the naughty things you did at school today.  Have fun sweetie.

Hi Wailea...



Romance is hard to achieve unless your a romantic honey.



It's a feeling, comes from with-in you..



Love is much more than sex, although it does feel awesome but it isn't what keeps couples together..



Companionship is the other key, spend time doing what you enjoy honey..



Bowling, skating, sledding, a evening walk together..
I love star-gazing, sound crazy?



it isn't, it's very romantic..  Go out for brunch together and just stare at one another and think of what first brought your hearts/eyes together..



Ask him on a date, that's a good spicer..



Even if he does that for you.
Let me know how you fair, Good Luck..  Great Question!!!

My husband wants to tell his children that his ex wife had an affair when they were married?



I think this is a stupid idea. I have tried to explain that he will only upset the kids and they may not believe it anyway (They are 15 and 21 and this was probably about 13 years ago). I think he should move on. He feels the kids have been brainwashed by their mother and that this will 'set things right' so they can make an informed decision. I said, about what? He won't listen to me. He also has his own past that I wouldn't be too proud about and I think it could just backfire on him. Or is he right?

Yes this is true.
God talked to people and read out of the bible.  He came up with the whole "you may now kiss the bride" thing.
This was right after the father of the girl beat her and forced her to marry the son of his family friend.  He then threatened to kill her if she didn't go through with it.

God created Eve to be with Adam and there was no marriage. There was no ceremony. Find it in the bible and tell when you find because you will not find it.



Man was not that intelligent yet. Laws were not being enforced they were broken up.



The rise of the Federal Government is where marriage became law. Until then it was only a cultural ritual and nothing more despite what the Bible said.



America was not built upon marriage it was built from sacrafice and guess who sacraficed?

Wife is gorgeous, what's going on? *continuted*?



Hi all, this question is continuted from this previous one:



http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...



I spoke to my Wife and she said she loves it when i call her beautiful but asks that i don't get mad when she says she isn't. It does anger me, because i said it three times, 2 times no i shrugged off, a third made me annoyed! She said that is from her childhood as during high school she was bullied for being ugly and shy. Now that she's grown up it's a natural reaction when i call her beautiful for her to shy away from it. She has done this in the past but i think today was just a bad morning. I love her to bits, and said i understood. It still hurts though. Makes me feel like she thinks i'm just saying it because I'm her Husband, and if some randomner said it it'd make her day.. but she told me i'm the only one she's ever believed who's called her beautiful, she says she can see it in my eyes.



How do i conquer this? Just save it for special moments, or keep complimenting her and don't get mad when she disagrees?



Thanks!

Alyssa, a picture is not necessary. She is beautiful, but that's not the point. The problem is a mental thing, not physical.

stop complimenting her. she needs to feel beautiful on her own. she's just looking for someone to reinforce her self esteem, but she's the only one who can do that. she's being childish by putting down your comments. she's needs to grow up and love herself.

Just tell her it's a communication issue, and that you will not see her as egotistical if she believes you, or even thanks you for the compliment.  Ask her to see herself through YOUR eyes for just a few minutes each day and to accept your sincere compliment graciously.  She probably realizes she's beautiful, but afraid that others will prey on her because of her shyness.

Try making your compliments more specific. Tell her you love how her eyes sparkle when she smiles or how her face lights up when she's happy or how she has the sexiest lips you've ever seen, how soft and shiny her hair is or how silky her skin feels. Compliments like that are hard to resist and because you are telling her exactly what it is you find beautiful about her she can hardly deny it,

Just keep telling her she's beautiful but don't go over board with it cause you can make her nervous by saying it too much. Or you can call her "sexy" "beautiful" or "gorgeous" instead of "babe" or "honey" or whatever it is you call her as a pet name. If she says she believes you think that way then that's great, eventually she may even come to see from your perspective. Remember, when she says she isn't, she's not calling you a liar, she's simply stating that she doesn't agree with you. You wouldn't get mad at her if you said you liked blue and she said she preferred red would you? She has the right to her own opinion don't get peeved

I think you shouldn't say it too much. She obviously has some self-esteem issues, which she must deal with on her own. What i've noticed even personally is that the only person that can fix you is you. Maybe you should point out things about her that you find attractive or unique. Making fun of yourself lightens the mood too. If you tell her she's beautiful and she believes you, but doesn't believe she is beautiful, then you gotta let it go for a little bit. Her battle is with herself, not you. I know high school can be a crappy place, and probably the worst place to be for someone like her, but she's gotta discuss it with someone. Keeping it all inside makes the situation worse. Maybe little talks here and there will help. Also, try something fun like a shopping date. Have her try on clothes she may like, and compliment her on her figure, her shape, whatever. Showing constant interest in your partner always helps when one has self-esteem issues. Never give up on her though, she'll come around. Good luck!

I am the same way (I don't think I'm beautiful or gorgeous) and when my boyfriend tells me that I get all red in the face and disagree. It is nice to hear and I wouldn't like it if he stopped saying it. Don't go overboard with it but don't stop saying it either.

Some women just need the reassurance. I m like that as well. If my man doesn't tell me some sweet compliment for a time, im getting worried. Don't be harsh on her, its normal. Tell her again, that you really think she is gorgeous and wouldn't be with her first place if u didnt fancy her. Maybe take her out sometimes , women love when their men are proud to show them off...

Is he cheating&gt; Or am I insecure?



Night after night he's never home. I have been with him for 5 yrs going on 6. I m only 20 yrs of age, and know nobody else but him. I am very attractive exotic young female that takes care of home oh so very well. Wither it be in the kitchen or the bedroom. He comes home sometimes at 4 in the morning or sometimes not at all. Brings me home beautiful gifts. Just yesterday he took me as well as my grandmother out for dinner. Of course bought everything, from dinner to her b-day gifts.....then presented me w/ a $2200 tennis bracelet. Is this just to cover his cheating ways? But how could he cheat on me ? Love is blind...... or is it just dumb?

Perhaps when he's not at home, he's working. That's a lot of change to drop on a tennis bracelet.If he's not working, then he's cheating cos I don't know many men who stray far from a good meal, a beautiful woman and bedroom fireworks unless there's something else holding them down.

He's probably just spending time with friends or family.  You should ask him.  If he's buying you all those nice gifts then he's most likely stuck on you and not cheating on you.  Just tell him to call you whenever he's going to come home late because you get worried about him.

Sounds like you are a kept woman.  Kind of a live-in prostitute/maid thing going on here - at least it sounds like it pays well.  He probably is spending time with someone else but doesn't really consider it cheating.  In his mind, you are bought and paid for like property - he can do whatever he wants.

i say both. if youre taking care of the bedroom so well then why isnt he coming home to sleep with you. he knows that you are materialistic so he buys you expensive gifts to keep you quiet. im assuming he wants to have his cake and eat it too but is it worth as much as he is spending? i wouldnt be flattered that he bought you  tennis bracelet...what is that proving? that he has the money to waste on a random gift for no particular special event? anyways, for you to say how attractive you are and "exotic" shows me you need to prove yourself to someone. perhaps he is turned off by your insecurity and thats why he seeks sex elsewhere.



anyways, i know you werent pleased with that answer. but i still want to give you helpful advice. ask him why he isnt coming home at night. and from now on...he needs to come home at night. if he fights you or gets defensive with you---then he is cheating.



rich or poor, pretty or ugly....being cheated on sucks. so i wish you the best of luck and i truly hope he isnt cheating on you. i hate cheaters. and conceited people..

You have the right to ask him where he is all night, especially when he doesn't come home at all! No healthy relationship works in this manner.



He buys you gifts knowing that he can silence your worries which is pretty lame. Money can influence and deceive, but it can't buy happiness.



He is cheating.

Why aren't you asking him this question? He knows you can be bought with things. I would find out once and for all if he is cheating. If you are perfect in home and otherwise, why would he cheat? You were 14 when you moved in with him? He must be going somewheres if he isn't coming home.I would do some investigating. Sounds fishy.

If he doesn't come home at all, where does he sleep? At home with his wife or possibly other lady. A sugar daddy will buy you the most expensive gifts to keep you from leaving him, i suppose. Why take you take his money, go to college, learn to fend for yourself so you don't have to put up with this kind of stuff?

Sweetness, Love is blind and it can make you dumb! I believe he is cheating, what excuse is he giving for coming home at 4 in the morning or not coming home at all.  Sounds like you are materialistic if all he has to do is buy you expensive gifts. Men (and women alike) are going to do what they want to do.  No matter how well you are taking care of home whether in the kitchen or  the bedroom.

My source is my experience.  My husband cheated on me and I was taking care of home just the same and he tried to blame me for his actions.  Again, people are going to do what they want to do, no matter what!

Should I allow my husband to bring in a problem child from a previous marriage.?



I have been married six months to a wonderful man.  He was previously married and has two children from that marriage and I have none.  Lately his 12 year old son has become a handful to his mother with typical misbehavior issues, such as misbehaving in school and not doing things around the house as he is told and just being mischievous.  His mother (the ex wife) feels that the child is calling out for attention and needs his father and so she now wants his father to raise him (in our home obviously).  I feel that with this come so many responsibilities I don't feel prepared to handle and I just shouldn't have to.  This was discussed before our marriage, I said that I will not allow his children to move in with us.  When I met him he would have his kids every other weekend and that is what I agreed to. Please help out tell me what you think.

Im actually going through a situation very similar to yours. My dad got a girlfriend and is leaving my mom, but my mom still cares and loves him. Its a very very rough situation, and i am sorry you and your son is going through this.



My best suggestion is, go to church and talk with a pastor. If your husband truly does not love you anymore there is not much you can do besides getting help for yourself and praying to god to put your on the right path to happiness for son and yourself.



I hope this helps.

I don't believe there is any such thing as falling in or out of love with someone.



I believe that there is realization that love has always existed between you (even before you meet) and also a realization that real love has never really existed between you.

How can I compromise with my husband about saving electric?



My husband is hard to get along with. I am the one who takes care of all the bills in the house. He is already wanting to use heat in the house and makes it stay in the 70s. I want it to stay at 62. It is so hard to pay the bills. We are VERY behind but he doesn't care. He refuses to put on a sweater to keep warm. How can I get him to listen to me?

I'm right there with you sister!  My husband resembles this comment.  Mine is like he doesn't want to see the bills, tells me to just pay them, and he says its too depressing.  We'll it's life (my thoughts) so deal with it (I don't say this).  I have a spreadsheet that I keep in excel that has listed every bill that I use for the entire year.  I mark it when its paid, how its paid and when its paid.  There is one column for what it due, in bold, and totaled column.



When money comes in, I show him what is due and the due dates.  I want him to help me decide what to pay with the money.  It helps.  If you want this spreadsheet and you have excel, email me.  It really does help me and maybe you'll find some use of it or edit it and make it your own.

Well if he is going to behave like a child then treat him like one. Do what we do - we shut off the whole thermostate at the fuse box so our kids can't even turn on A/C or heat - at night when U need hot water U can flip it back on.  He's just being childish and stubborn - U pay the bills so just tell him if he can't or won't be mature minded about it U will do so on your own.  Tell him this is IMPORTANT to you and to your finances and he needs to GROW THE HECK UP!

Explain that you can't meet the bills with your current income.  Give him the option of helping you find ways to cut your budget or finding a second job to help you better afford everything.  Personally, I'm sort of with your husband on this one.  It's important to me to be comfortable in my own home.  I'd rather find other places to sacrifice and have a home that I can be comfortable in.  Perhaps the two of you could come to a compromise and find some other ways to save.

explain to him that if he doesn't start to be more conservative the house will be a lot colder then 62 because you wont be able to pay the bill and it will get cut off. It that doesn't work just find other areas in the bills where you can make up the difference like food, don't buy name brand stuff get store brand or buy in bulk and freeze things.

start doing the "college diet".



Only have ramen noodles, hot dogs, grilled cheese, macaroni and cheese etc for dinner.  when he asks why the dinners suck, tell him it is because you couldn't afford steaks and hamburger and had to cut expenses somewhere since he wouldn't be willing to compromise and turn the thermostat to 68.  (62 is way too cold!!!!)  Remember...you have to compromise too.  Meet him in the middle.



When I first moved in with my hubby, I preferred the thermostat to be set to 70, he liked 66....so we started with 69.  Once i got used to it then we moved it to 68...now we are at 67.



If you slowly turn down the thermostat he won't notice hardly.

Should I join the Army or get Married?



I went to MEPS a couple weeks ago totally set on joining the Army and even willing to break up with my boyfriend. I was 1/2" too big to take the Arms test and 17 pounds over to just join. So I was told I had to wait 10 weeks before I could try again. During this wait I have completely fallen head over heals for my boyfriend and couldn't imagine life without him. He is even hinting at wanting to get married as well. So now with my new MEPS date creeping up and an absolutely amazing guy here, I am confused on which direction to go? HELP PLEASE!

Have you considered nursing school?  nurses are need just as much as soldiers, and you wouldn't have to pass any physical fitness requirements to become a nurse (although it can be a physically demanding job).  don't join the army unless you are completely into it and will not regret leaving everything in your life behind. in my opinion, you should stay with the guy you love and pursue an education in a field where you will make a difference, but not the army.

The army will be there, should you decide to join at a later time. I would stick with the amazing guy; but don't let yourself become dependant on him as the only thing in your life that brings you joy! Be independant, that way you can take him or leave him either way and not end up feeling trapped and unhappy!  Always keep your guard up and let him believe otherwise; in other words, watch your back. Guys these days are not high on my list, I was with my ex hubby for 10 years and that was a waste; then, I thought I found true love and was is Heaven for 2 years solid- but he dumped me for a new truck!! So yah- be prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. TAKE YOUR TIME before marriage, and see how it all goes for a WHILE. If it dosen't work out, GO ARMY!! Good Luck to you sweety! God bless!

The key is patience and communication. Sometimes when my boyfriend and i fight, it sucks because he just clams up and won't talk which makes me even madder and things get worse! I just have to be patient with him, and try to calmly talk about it. Otherwise just cherish your time together and make sure not to talk anything for granted...

What should I do with a liar?



this liar is my boyfriend.  he is a business man.  we don't live in one country.  At our first date, he told me he's single. so i accepted his love. but after 5 monts, he told me he lied. he's married, & with 2 kids already & also he's expecting a new baby. he begged me & told me he's not happy with his life & he would leave his family for me. he said if i leave him, he would die cos i'm his only love in life. i forgave him cos i love him so much. after that, he acted so well & i never feel he's cheating me.  after 5 months, he lied to me again. he went to vocation with his wife in italy. i found the truth. but he explained he planned this one year ago before he knew me. he was going to talk the divoice issue with her. i wasa so stupid & believed him again though i was much hurt. but after that, we couldn't contact often.  he doesn't call me & don't like me to call him. we only contact by mails or sometimes skype when he's in office.  During their public holidays, i couldn't find him. Last week I found a web about him by chance. i got to know he has a girlfriend in philiphine too. (he travels to there often.) the girl is only 19 years. (he's 41).  I was reallly very hurt.  I couldn't believe that.  I never thought he's such person.  I cried alll days.  but I didn't tell him what I know.  He's till cheating me. told me he's consulting with lawyers & he had no love from family & i 'm his only love in the world,  he's still telling  me he didn't touch any woman after he knew me.  Even his wife, he didn't touch her at all.
ALL is lies.



I really hate him.  I want to kill him.



He is so so bad and has to be punished.



I want to tell all to his wife cos he's a lier to family too.  Also I want to tell our top management (we work together. I come this company for him) .  he will come to my country in next 2 weeks. how can do with him?  should I talk to him? or punish him as I want?  Anyway I don't want him a good life in his rest life.  how should I do with such big liar?  Pls tell me.  I was so stupid.  I get crazy & so hurt now.

Leave him alone.  He's making you look dumb for beliveing him over and over.  If he can walk away from his family, whats going to keep him from walking away from you?  It sounds like you a wrecking his home.  If you love him, let him go.  There's really no such thing as walking away from his family. You guys will both be paying child support in the long run.  Be careful.

What are things YOU do for your husband to enhance your sex appeal?



My husband expects me to have "sex appeal" because he's lost interest in me sexually (read my other question for more details on what's that all about http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?... and then come back here). He said that if I tried to dress hot he'd come on to me more ( check this different question to get more details on that http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;... ).



I don't know the slightest thing about sex appeal. He said sex appeal is an all day thing and it's not necessarily how you dress, do your makeup, or how high your heels are (although he says all that can play into effect) but how you carry yourself...



I guess I just need help understanding this one, what do you ladies do? I guess give me examples of what you do to go out of your way to have "sex appeal" for your husband.

It is an attitude.  You feel sexy, so you look sexy.  It is not a 24/7 deal, however.  You can not be sexy while cleaning house,etc... You can while cooking in only an apron.  You can always make sure that your clothes fit fairly snug, that your pants look good from the front and the back, the same for your blouses, and dresses.  You could wear sexy sandals or flats, and sexy heels or boots for special occasions.  Put on light makeup when just around the house, and make it a bit more dramatic for when you leave the house.  Walk with confidence and knowledge that other people think you look good too, and you will radiate an aura of sexiness.  Be sure to keep up with the style.  Not all, but some clothes should be add to your wardrobe every season.  Sexy earrings, and jewelry help too.  Act sexy to your hubby, as if you were picking up a handsome stranger when you approach him.  Wear sex lingerie, or surprise him occasionally with the naked under the robe strip-tee!!  Consider yourself his love goddess, and encourage him to do the same by buying him nice things to wear.  I love sexy boxers at night, and clothes that fit my man's physique when we go out.



Tell him that he wasnts the effort from you, you expect him to show you appreciation by taking you out to eat once a week, just as he did when you dated, or at least give you a break in the kitchen by cooking for you and eating by candlelight. (A goddess must be treated like one!)

You may want to sit down, this may take awhile (i.e. "WARNING: Long Answer")... -^_^-



Okay, first of all, I will answer this from my personal experience.  My husband and I are the same way... we rarely have "date nights", and there were quite a few times where we would go 2 or 3 years in-between.  I can count on two hands, with fingers left over, the amount of times we've had actual *alone time* that lasted more than a couple of hours in our 10+ years of marriage (and I can count on one hand, again with fingers left over, the times we have been able to in the last 4 years... do you know how many people are okay with watching *four* children?!  *None*  ::sad sigh::  Anyhoo, moving on...).



Secondly (and please do not die of a heart attack, I would feel so bad!! o_O), although I think sex is an essential part of life, I disagree that you should spend your date night having oral sex.  ::lmao::  I see no reason why either of you cannot do this on any other night, but that is just my own opinion.  I noticed that almost half of the people here feel that a sex-based date-night would work, but for my husband and I, that sorta missed the point of having that time for just each other.  I mean, OF COURSE sex was often (but not always) a *part* of it (like the response by "Jean" mentions), but it wasn't what made it wonderful.  There was a huge difference for us between our friend down the street watching the kids so we could.. um... put the open-marriage thing into practice (which we'd actually stopped just prior to moving to WA, and only made an exception a few times while living there for a few extraordinary people), and having an actual set, extended amount of time to be together.



My husband and I never aimed to make our date nights, which are few and far in-between, about sex.  The way we saw it, we could do that anytime... a date night was about spending time together, having fun, once again getting to know the person you married.



I think the answer by "Bosco A" is closest to what my husband and I would do... just go out and *have fun*.  We haven't had a date night since we moved out of Seattle, however one of our favourite things to do would always be to walk down to the waterfront (we didn't live right in Seattle, but in a small city called Mukilteo, next to the Puget Sound) and head to Ivar's, a little waterside seafood place (with a walk-up window) that also had soft-serve, get a couple cones of ice cream, and head to the Ferry or the beach.



We would either skip dinner and get little snacks while we were out, or we'd pick up food somewhere like Ivar's or one of the downtown hot-dog stands, and walk over to the water and eat there, watching the Ferries come in and out of the docks.



We'd usually buy round-trip tickets for the Ferry, (we did this both in Mukilteo, which was a short ride across, and in Seattle, which would be almost an hour long each way), walk onto the Ferry and spend the time at the rail.  We'd watch the water pass by, and the lights of the city recede, and we'd either just talk, or hold each other close to keep warm and enjoy the silence.  It was a soothing (and cheap - under $15 usually) way to spend an hour or two, just the two of us.  ^_^



Afterward we would spend time just walking, talking, laughing... just holding hands and being two young people in love, laughing in the face of the world and all of it's stresses; not two adults with children and jobs and a difficult marriage.



Later, we would walk home (and we almost always preferred to walk, because even though we could have taken the car, it gave us a chance to hold hands and talk... tho we did drive down into Seattle, that would have been an insane walk, down the express lanes and such.. ::lol::), and we would stop by 92nd Street Park (an awesome children's park that was a block away from our home), and we'd actually *play* there (and no, that isn't a euphemism... we would seriously just run around and play on everything.. ^_^).  We would climb on the climbing thing (whatever that structure is called with the fire-pole and net ladder and monkey-bars, etc..), sit side-by-side on the swings and see who could swing higher, sit on the tire swing together and see how fast we could spin by turning around and around and twisting the chain up, and then lifting our feet... you get the idea.  -^_^-  The point is, we just went out and had *fun*.  No pressure, no stress, no talking about work or the kids... it was like we were still in college and at that silly-and-in-love stage.  ♥



One of the most fun things to do was going crabbing together... neither of us had *any* idea what we were doing, but we loved spending the time out on the docks, and we loved crab, and we could read the "throw back any *this* size" measuring device, so all that was left was bringing a cooler for our food (like a picnic on the docks.. ^_^), a bucket for the crab, renting the crabbing gear and then spend the day laughing at how silly we were

I searched out 92nd St. Park on Google Maps... this is the area we lived, that I was just talking about (click "satellite".. this is a block away from old place before we moved to TX.. ^_^):

Well depending on where you live it varies..Long walks on the beach are niice:)... if you dont live near a sea borther than you can go somewhere, where the sun would set between the mountains or something and have a picnic there, also amusement parks are fun :P.. if any of does arent good you could just set up a romantic spot rite in the conforte of you own home, floorsm candlesm supper, movies and if you wanna try something new in your sexual life after a beautiful date is a good time :).

If you have children and not use to being alone without them, then sit and watch things not move together. Seriously. That amazed me the first time my mother took the kids for two weeks.



:-)



All I know is that there's only one off limit topic - the children.



You can play truth or dare. Go bowling. Ride a mechanical bull. Park and make out. Go to a local event - cook-off, fair, festival. Go fishing. Share a bottle of champagne. Eat dinner in bed! Take a long walk together. Find a free concert. Go to the zoo. Pack a picnic lunch and drive to a nice park.



I guess it depends on what's available in your area. Check online to see if there are any events.

Well, it depends, you have to rate the job, full blown out tire skid marks should be worth at least $100.00, now sweat stains, maybe $10.00. My thoughts only and approve this message.

I figure its based on hooker pay. The more personal I have to get with the skids..the higher my rate!

But if you need help turning on your husband- talk to your husband he knows what gets his jolly's off. He'd be the best source for this question not some strange people- yeah I said strange not strangers.

LMAO. That is funny maybe it is time to hit the gym or something maybe you just don't have the goods you used to have.  Or simply he is at a phase in his life that he is going through ED and needs some help ie Viagra, Cialis etc.  If you strip in front of him or intiating something sexy with him doesn't get him going make sure he is still alive?.  Try turning off the Football game or other sports crap and see if that wakes him up.  I would say a good clapper give him a BJJJJJ.

Try taking away the remote or standing in front of the TV and asking him to do what you want...that usually works. Even though my husband has a 42 inch screen he claims I block out the whole thing when I stand in front of is (and I'm only 115lbs) go figure..it works.

And then ask him if he wants to try something "new".  But be ready for his answer.  It will probably surprise you.  If it does, don't say h### no, tell him you will think about it.

Some Child Support help PLEASE?!?!?



My ex just will not pay!! I've tried everything I know but he will not help. I don't keep the boys away from him or anything. They suspended his DL and then started garnishing his wages,then he QUIT HIS JOB!!!! I've wen't through the court,county dhs,child support services and everything I know!! I can't afford a lawyer right now. Is there ANYTHING I'm missing? I have to do ALL the work and he's a lazy A**hole and it makes me SO MAD he's getting away with this!!! Is there anything anyone could suggest to help? THANK YOU!!!



</question>



<additional details>



thanks guys! i really didn't wanna be ugly about it.  i don't want the boys to miss out on their dad but he just don't care. he's selfish. it don't cost anything to pick up a phone and call them from time to time but he wont even do that!!!



thats what my dad says too. i don't talk bad about him in front of him. i see the wisdom in this. HE'S the one missing out and I've told him that! I love them and one day he's going to regret not being there for him. he may need them one day and (selfishly) I hope they return the favor!

By law you cannot stop him from seeing his kids, but if you are in Canada you can qualify for Illegal Aid Lawyer. I would take his A__ to court and but him in jail. He needs to realized what is responsibilities are.

Child support and visitation are separate issues all together. Keeping them away because he doesn't pay  is like holding your children for ransom. What can you do? You can acknowledge and realize that he is a "Dead Beat Dad" and one day they will get the money from him one way or another.



You must do what ever it takes to support yourself and your children. I know it sucks! My ex owes me $19,000.00 in back CS. Our children are in thier 20's.



I did what I had to do and survived. My children are great and pretty much have no relationship with their deadbeat dad. I never kept him from seeing his children. It was his own choice.
Keep your chin up, you will survive.

Unfortunatly this is an ongoing problem with a lot of child support.  The spouse's wages are garnished, then they quit, so you wind up with more paperwork trying to get the support from them.



You cannot make a person see their kids (happened to us).  You cannot make them pay all the time.  Sad but true.  Just do the best to keep track of his jobs and file the papers.



Be the better parent to your kids and NEVER talk bad about their father to them - after all he's part of them and #1 rule is not to put down the other parent no matter how bad of a parent they are.

It sounds like he is showing his anger toward you by not paying and the kids are feeling the blunt of it. You can always move where it will be difficult for him to see the children. If he can't be a part of their life in helping provide those things the kids need, then take the kids away completely. Of course the kids need him but they also need his support.

If you have any type of court orders for visitation or child support, he WILL pay it. You just need to go to the Attorney Generals office, tell them whats up, and they WILL find him. He will owe you all backed child support and if he doesnt report a job change they WILL put him in jail. The government does not take lightly child support offenders. Just wait. HE will get hats coming to him.

In CO and I think in most states...if he gets behind when and if he files taxes they will take them and give them to you....my ex was so far behind it was crazy...my youngest son (his kids) turned 21 years old last summer and finally the dead beat filled taxes...they took my back child support out and sent it to me....he did not pay and every time they started garnishing he would quit also,,,sucks but sometimes we just have to suck it up and do the grown up thing...talk to someone at social services or what ever they call it in your state and they can help you....well as much as they can....good luck

Keep him away from the kids until he starts paying. Also keep receipts for everything you buy/do for them, everything! When the state finally makes him pay you can prove what you've actually spent.Call legal aid in your county and get some advice, maybe they can come up with a few suggestions on getting him to pay. Good luck

Both are pretty in their own way. The short-haired girl seems sexier, but the long haired girl looks friendlier and more fun to be around.



However, as I am a heterosexual female, I don't want to marry either. Sorry.

Uh, being that I am female and straight, I realize I may not be the appropriate person to answer this particular question.



And we all know that the only thing one can tell about another person in a photograph is what they look like. You can't tell what a person's personality or values, etc., are just from a picture.



But, having said all that, I find the girl with the short hair to be the most appealing. She is beautiful and wholesome looking.
The type of girl a respectable man would be proud to show off, take home to meet the family, and yes, marry.

You got married because you love(d) the person you married. And because you thought it would make you happy, but maybe its not. If you marraige really is a "misery" though, don't look back and try to figure out why you got married. Things change. If you aren't happy, it might not get any better, so maybe you should divorce.

Because it was something that you wanted to do at one point. Marriages are not all rainbows and happy endings. They take work and daily work at that. It's not an easy thing but it can be well worth the hard work. You have to make sure that this man is one you can't live without and even when he makes you mad and miserable you still love him even if you have no clue why. Hard times get better and counseling really does work. People get married for one reason but most find many reasons to divorce. Remember that reason.

The real question is...why are you in misery? There are plenty of people who get married and aren't miserable. So just because you said "I do", does not put you directly in misery. And anyone can change the way they live, so don't give up. Maybe you and your spouse should sit down and communicate your problems. Try and regain the passion you once shared.

Hi Ikra



When we are dating its the best feeling and time that we cud possibly hav with our parther but, when we get married sometimes things change as does one or the other in the relationship.  Some men/women think when they get the ring on the finger thats it and it gives them the right to do wot ever and behave how ever they want.  They think that cos that rings on your finger u belong to them and thats it forever.  What a mentality to have, sad.  I went thr it and its an awful sinking feeling, I woke up everyday wondering wot did I do to deserve this.  So I know wot ur going thr.  Try sitting yr husband down and explain to him how yr feeling, tell him things need to change.  Maybe marriage councelling wud help, he needs to be put straight on how to behave and treat his wife.  If none of this helps only u can make the decision on what to do luv



I really wish u all the best with this and hope the situation changes for you



Luv Magsxx

Well, I dont know about u, but 4 me I got married at 18 to my high school sweetheart cuz I thought I was in LOOOOVE.  Well, we had one child and I went to nursing school and went to work and was like; damn theres a whole big world out here I never knew existed.  We stayed married for about 10 years, he cheated on me once, (in high shcool no one would have ever believed he would do that to me) and like I said once I got out of nursing school I realized I married him 4 all the wrong reasons (to detailed to tell u) and I wanted out.  Well it was a rough divorce, but I believe the saying "everything happens for a reason" cuz now I have 2 precious little boys.  Oh, and get this they are with a black guy (another one that threw my faimly and friends for a loop) but the main thing Im tryin to tell u is, if theres any doubt now, get out, cuz ur just wastin time u could b finding someone who u really do love and care about.  Dont live in a fantasy cuz it looks good to everyone else (like I did) cuz ur happiness is what really matters, no matter what anyone tells u. Oh, and if u have kids, trust me they r better off not seeing u guys fight, than seeing mommy and daddy happy.  Hope I helped?!

<question>



Is my husband cheating?



5 years ago, he called an ex regarding sex, but swears nothing happened.  Shortly after I find an email to "a couple" trying to set up a meeting to "see what might happen." We separated for a while, then got back together and he constantly looks at porn.  Some of it is regular, some transsexual and some gay. A couple of months ago I see him e-mailing someone from craigslist.  He says it was just to ask for pictures.  He set up an email account, I knew nothing about.  Then tonight I go in his email and see an email he sent to a guy asking if he was available, because he needed to "unload" one.



Each time he tells me he is only looking for excitement on the internet.  He says he would never actually meet the people.  He says our sex life isn't so great so he's just looking for excitement but would never really do it.  So do I believe him or is he cheating?  Every bone in my body says he is.

It sounds like he is cheating AND gay. I don't know for sure if hes acted on any of his emails, or surfing, but it sure does sound like he has some type of infidelity going on here. I would not be with a man who is hiding things like that from me, or going behind my back. I'd tell him if hes just doing it for excitement then to include you in it, so you don't feel like hes cheating on you. good luck, I hope everything works out.

You need to RUN...not walk away from this relationship. He is not being honest with you.

I'd go with your instincts. It sounds as if he could be bisexual, and he definitely doesn't respect your marriage.



It isn't as extreme as physically cheating but it is something very insensitive and something to watch out for.
I'd suggest leaving, but it depends if that's possible for you..
Good luck

Get rid of him and do it quickly. He's not worth the headaches. If he wants to play then he needs to tell you so you can decide what steps to take to move on without him. Please don't stay in this marriage a minute longer. There good men out there that will love you the way you were meant to be loved.

The porn part alone, would not bother me, all guys watch porn pretty much,a nd all different types of porn too. The part that would bother me is that he seems to be trying to set up these meetings to have sex with people. I can't believe he seems to think that is ok, even if he does say he will not go through with it.



You need to make it clear to him what you are ok with, and what you are not, and let him know to either get it together or you will leave.

Trust your female Intuition as it is always right, but by what you are telling us here, I am saying he is up to no good and I think you really need to have a think to yourself and ask yourself if you are truly happy in this relationship. If not, then I am sure you can do better and find someone who will treat you well. Good luck.

I've had several friends tell me they've caught their significant others in a lie and/or secretive behavior and they constantly snoop and play detective because they can't trust that person or yet tell themselves to leave the relationship.  I guess I'll tell you what I tell them.



ALL HONEST RELATIONSHIPS MUST WITHSTAND EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF FAITHFULNESS!



Secrets, weird behavior and lies undermine a critical element to a successful relationship - TRUST.  You deserve to have a trustworthy relationship because you have been trustworthy.
Evaluate what this man means to you going forward with the rest of your life and what role you'll have to play to keep him.  Make the right choice NOW rather than later.  Be it counseling, or a fast exit.  Good luck.

Differences between good and bad counselors?



My hubby and I have started seeing a counselor, but I have heard alot of people warn me that not many are good, and can do more harm than help.



Has anyone had bad experiences with a counselor regarding advice?  could you please tell me your experiences with them?  The good, the bad, the ugly hehe



Any advice that a counselor may give that should be a warning flag for me?

My husbands fantasy makes me feel shy?



So he confessed to me that his biggest fantasy is to catch a woman (me) playing with herself...I have played along to a certain extent but never just straight up surprised him when he gets home from work or anything like that. I feel so awkward about it. There's plenty I'm willing to do but I don't feel very confident putting on a show like that.
Is there anything I can do to make this work better for us?
I feel like my insecurity runs the risk of ruining his perfectly good imagination.



</question>



<additional details>



I do, do it for myself. That's what he wants to participate in but I can't seem to share it well...

I like the last thing you wrote.  You are open to him having an imagination.  So it sounds like you are more worried about him not liking what you do.



Let me put your mind to rest on this.  Women worry so much about 'what if I'm not good enough'...you hear that with BJs all the time.  Don't worry...he loves you..he thinks you are sexy...you could lay there and be like a wet towl and he would think it is the hottest thing in the world.



So close your eyes and think here is someone you want to be happy...who you have the power to make happy...and how anything you do will make him happy.  It should be easy to decide.



Next step it has to be when you are ready and it is easy for you...after all thinking the above might  make it a bit fun for you.  Plus, once he catches you he might need some more of your time.



I wouldn't suggest the coming home from work thing.  You could be trying and he could have a lousy commute and not be receptive.  Instead pick a time you are up for it..he is in a good mood and not distracted.  Then do the things to pamper yourself that you deserve....maybe a hot bath...a glass of wine...a candle..music.  After all you will be making love...to you ..and to him.  So get yourself in the mood.



Here is a thought.  Pick a good evening when you might even make love.  Tell him that you are going to take a bath and ask him to bring up some towels...like maye they are in the dryer getting warm.  Go fill your tub...let him see you get the wine and even ask for a match for a candel.



Lay back...relax...don't think about bad...think about how sexy you are...how you make his dreams come true...and then lay back and see if it comes to you.



If it does you will make his dream come true.



If not you will know you tried and it just wouldn't work.  Either way you will go away feeling good for making an effort.



</answer>

Well, you could have a few drinks before he gets home to loosen up that way you would feel more confident doing it.  I used to be shy about things that my husband likes too, but once I realized how much he likes it, and how he doesn't even pay attention to the things that I was insecure about- it's fine!

you can start with video taping yourself playing with yourself this way you will not be shy about  being directly infront of him; then progress into being on the phone and having phone sex, then after he has seeing and heard all of it trust me you will feel better about doing it infront of him.

My wife called me at work one morning and suggested that I come for "lunch" The kids were at school and we would be alone.



When I got home and walked into our bedroom, she was naked on the bed and had started (and was continuing) without me. It was one of the most erotic things she had ever done, and some of the best sex ever. You won't disappoint him.



And besides, the next time it will be his turn.

That is tough, Sex should be open, honest, and fun for the both of you. My only advise is to try and see yourself through your husbands eyes. To him you are a sex goddess, he loses his train of thought at work because he dreams of you... When I was first married my wife was beyond shy. She was a "good" Catholic girl, and while she wanted to please me, she did not have any clue about sex. She was so shy and timid that I invented the concept of nude weekends. Once we were both home from work on Friday we were not allowed to wear clothes until we left for work on Monday... This led to a lot of sex for sure, but it also relaxed my wife to the point where we would just be together, naked and it was not always about sex. My wife relaxed, learned to trust and to feel comfortable with me... I don't know if that helps you other than that my wife and I have seen each other from every imaginable angle... and we still find each other hot. Your man is not staring at you to find faults.... he is gazing at you because of what you do to him in his head, his heart, and his shorts! Good Luck, just have some fun you body is a gift.

Instead of checking up on him why don't you just tell him "honey, I didn't know you like porn" - you could find a place that does sexy photos and take some nice intimate shots for him.  I did this for my bf for his b-day and he just loved it.  Some guys who have the hottest wives or gf still look at porn - it's like a habit.  As long as its not child porn and he still give you time, don't make it a big issue because then he will get more secretive --- communicate with him

Don't bother- if you know he looks at porn does it matter which porn?  All *legal* porn is basically the same.  Talk to him about it.  Most men like porn.



If you really want to check on him though, it depends how good he is at clearing the history.  Look in your temporary internet files and web cache for suspicious names and files.  Most porn websites aren't free- check his credit card statements.

you can get transfer things that you put on keyboard and it records key strokes....however, this is not the answer.



The answer is 1) why is he doing it behind your back 2) why does he feel the need to do it without you



I personally think that if somebody is purposely hiding something  THAT (the lie etc) is the destructive part...it shows mistrust and break down relationships. If you just talk to him, ask him what he likes about it, what kind of thing does he watch, does he want to try it, lets watch some together etc....much healthier than trying to counter-act his lies y 'stalking' what he does.

but what difference does it make?  Unless he is aware he has a problem u aren't going to make him stop by catching him.  U'll just make ureself feel worse...let it go...unless and until it affects your sexual relationship, him viewing/and masturbating probably isn't an addiction...

yes there are ways of still looking at the history but why do that?? if it's bothering you that much then y dont you talk to him about it, tell him how it kakes you feel.



but it is normal for a man to watch porn, it's just that women view porn differently than women. there is nothing wrong at looking/watching porn as long as it's legal!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you know he is, then why do you need to check?  Who cares what sites he's on.  The point is, he's doing it.



Approach the source, your husband.  Don't research to see what porn sites he's on.  It doesn't matter.

I would not want to stay with this person, especially if you dont have any children together to tie you down. Your are to marry a person because he is the right one for you and who you do not have to worry about and try to change or fix. He obviously needs counseling or some sort of treatment. I would temporarily seperate with him until he changes his behavior or you are in for a lot of stress and heartache later on. Dont put yourself through that. Invest your time into someone who has a good head on his shoulders and who is not going to cause you worry or stress. Good luck!

I'm really okay with it cause we can be in engaged for about another 6 to 9 months and then get married. I've met his whole family and he has met mine. I've met his Pastor and everything.

personally, don't do it. marriage is complicated and you don't NEED to get married just to show someone you're committed and in love. if you're both truly in love and if it's actually going to work out.. then wait a few years. six months is way too early considering that feelings can change. a few years of dating and then a break up will be a lot easier than getting married and having a divorce. don't do it! wait!!

I guess it depends very much on the foundation and understanding of the relatioinship and you yourself if both are emotionally and mentally settled down to be ready for a marriage rather than rushing into one because of the honeymoon stage. Marriage is sacred and will also be different from a relationship. A lot of responsibilities, commitment, effort, love, understanding, trust, finance etc to keep it going for the long haul. If both of you can see the future together, i guess how long both of you have known each other/in the relationship shouldn't matter much. The depth of each relationship is only known between the 2 person.

Not happy in my marriage:(?



i told my husband that his video game playing is ruining our marriage on several several several occasions. he just makes jokes about it and tells me how his xbox magazine had an article about the statistics of divorce due to video games and video game addiction. and then goes right back to playing the game. obviously he doesnt care how i feel or about our marriage. he's not willing to see the problem or get help for it. where do i go from here? i have a 4 year old and a 9 month old (which he ignores for the game) and they are the only human interaction i get most days. i just dont know what to do...



</question>



<additional details>



we have talked and he has refused to see the problem... its just his "hobby". he says its my fault for not having hobbies of my own, but i have 2 kids, theres no time for me to have hobbies. so basically i just need some reassurance that it is time to move on.

Tell him you both need to go to counseling and you need to work this out or you are leaving. Since he hardly spends time with you or the kids you doubt he will notice the difference. Trust me I love playing video games but there are other things in life that I have to do and when I'm with my kids and husband then I spend my time with them. You need to be happy and if he's unwilling to work with you then there's nothing else you can do. If he refuses counseling and you leave then it might hit him how serious this matter is if it doesn't then I still think you will be better off without him.

hey, I know how she feels. You need to give her attention too. Help with dinner and dishes and all that sort of stuff, set up your bedroom with candles and things and give her a nice massage. She won't be able to resist you! Make it a weekly thing where you pamper each other and things should start to steam up. The more attention you give, the more you will get.

How do I go about marriage, moving in, in a short period of time?



I'm 25, working, still living at home, tried looking for my own place, but its hard to find a decent place in NY with what I make at work..  With the way the ecconomy is now, its very difficult to find a job that will pay even more than what I make now..  I help out around the house a lot..  I do my own laundry, I watch my younger brother when both my parents go to work..  I even had to adjust my work schedule to be home for him on the days that both my parents work..  Anyways, I decided that I want to marry my boyfriend before I move into his place..  I considered just moving in for a while because things at home are getting pretty bad.  Me and my father aren't very close, and I've come to the conclusion that we won't ever have that kind of relationship..  I've tried many times, and he is practically made of stone.  Basically, the only time my father talks to me is to ask for a favor or to yell at me over petty things. He will actually go out of his way to find something to complain about, it is beyond ridiculous.  My boyfriend's parents really like me, and they don't agree with two people living together before marriage (I didn't for a while either)..  My bf and I have been talking about marriage for a while, and a few months ago, we were saying sometime in 2010..  Recently things between my father and I have gotten worse..  He has become very controlling, and even ruined a trip that I took two weeks ago..  Me and my bf drove down to N. Carolina to visit some friends, and I called my parents to let them know that I was staying an extra day (so they would not worry), and my father flipped out, to the point where he ruined the trip for me.  I then had to go home immediately after we arrived in NY, and my father made a comment that my bf took too long to get back (which he didn't, he made good time considering the stops and the traffic)..  Now its like I don't know what my father is going to do next, and I can feel tension between us growing and growing..  My bf told his mother about the problems I've been having at home, and she suggested that we get married sooner (she's already told me that she loves me like a daughter)..  I honestly don't think I can wait another two years to get married..  I also feel conflicted because I always thought it was the "right thing" for a guy to ask the girls father for her hand in marriage, and now I'm not so sure..  It doesn't make any sense since my father and I aren't close..  Besides, its more of a blessing, and not nessesarily permission.. How quick can a wedding be planned?  Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?  I know that I probably won't be able to get married in a church if the wedding is in such short notice..

<question>



We're drowning in debt. My husband makes too much for financial assistance. Do I have to leave him?



So I doubt you want to know every detail about my financial issues but I need help. I'm completely lost. My husband and I can't afford to buy groceries after paying our bills. I have a 2 year old son who needs to eat, My husband and I only eat dinner to conserve food and still, we don't have much in the cabinets. My friends tell me since he makes to much money to qualify for any assistance, I should leave him.



Here's a run-through of our situation:
My husband makes
$2,628 Monthly
MONTHLY, we pay
$933- Rent
$80- Electricity
$80- Child support for daughter not living with us
$400- Car
$112- Car Insurance
$200- Cable/Internet
(Which my husband refuses to stop paying because he doesn't want the account to get sent to collections)
$188- Cigarettes & Coffee every morning before work (My husband refuses to quit... I have quit smoking altogether months ago because I realize it is no longer affordable)
About $160- Gas to put in our explorer. (For husband's 30 minute commute to work every morning and 30 minutes back... and also other transportation needs)
My son drinks about $50 in milk per month



That leaves us with roughly $105 for the week which comes to nothing after trying to buy enough food for my growing son and my husband who will eat a whole box of little Debbie snacks in one day (surprisingly, he's not overweight)



As a married couple, I'll admit we absolutely suck at managing our money together. My husband will use the debit card everyday without even checking the balance which causes us to often overdraft our account. We also often end up with way less money weekly because of this.
We have HORRIBLE credit... both in the 500 range.
We owe credit card companies, a lawyer, old cell phone, cable companies, etc.
We cannot get a loan for a safe, reliable vehicle and are paying $100/week for a rundown 1994 explorer for 6 weeks, which could die on us whenever it feels the need.
I just don't know what to do anymore. I don't want an answer to my problem. I realize no one has one for me. I just need advice. I'm getting depressed and even having suicidal thoughts once in a while when I feel like I can't handle the stress anymore.
I work 12 hours a week as a cocktail waitress in a gentleman's club. Some nights I make good money, but others I've even lost money so we don't rely on that income.
The dancers at make $100 on a bad night so it's good money and I could do it and help with our financial issues but I'm too shy and respect my body. It's making me feel guilty that I won't do it and will only stick to waitressing.



I'm just so lost. My friends tell me I can't afford to stay with my husband and I need to leave him so I could at least be eligible for food stamps and feed myself and my son. Even though we already have a rocky marriage, that just seems so wrong.



In case you're wondering, I'm 22 and my husband is 24. We've been married for nearly 3 years and he just got out of the air force in June so the transition from military life to civilian life has been hard.
Any advice from veterans and wives is also appreciated.



</question>



<additional details>



Sorry... we are left with $70, not $105.



HUGE reasons why I have not left my husband...
I have no where to go with my son. No family or friends whatsoever who could help me out... trust me, I've asked. And I simply cannot afford a divorce. In massachusetts, you have to have a lawyer and I cannot afford a $3,000 retainer on top of the $1,500 I already owe my lawyer for custody reasons regarding my daughter.



My husband refuses to quit spending $53 a week in cigarettes and coffee. And also will not give up the internet, cable and phone which is costing us $200 per month.



Thats just the financial reason why I want to leave him... there are other reasons which do not pertain to the question.

Tough one, but I don't think you should leave you husband, you should stick through it and learn how to manage your money better.

There are plenty of things you can do.  Don't despair.



First, go to www.debtorsanonymous.org.  You can find a meeting and get help for your problems.



Next, call United Way and get a list of agencies that can help you.  There are lots of them, no matter where you live.  You can get free, healthy food, certainly enough to live on.  You can get counseling for free, too.



You should also check with local churches.  They have food pantries and give away food.  They may also get food from local farmers or people with gardens.  You HAVE to accept this help on behalf of your son.  He trusts you to feed him.



You don't have to leave your husband, and you don't have to strip for money.



Your husband does have to face facts.  He can't keep using a debit card.  You need to withdraw cash from the bank each week and just use that, and when it runs out, it's gone.



You can call old creditors and negotiate payments, and get the credit/interest rate reduced.  You may also be able to get the bill reduced, especially if it's gone to collections.



You need to cut off the cable tv, frankly.  If you can't afford more than one meal a day, you're better off taking the money and spending it on food.

I can help a bit here, I've helped alot of people with finances to pull out of a ditch.



That truck is costing far too much money.  Sell the truck and make your husband get a bus pass.  It is cheaper, you don't have to pay for gas or most importantly, repairs.



Your rent is a bit high, have you tried looking for another rental that is cheaper?  You need to make drastic moves, you are going to hurt your bodies by not feeding them properly.



$200 for cable and internet is very steep.  I suggest you cut back on some of the chanels to save some $$.



Does your husband make his coffee at home or buy it from a service?  If he's purchasing from places like timmies etc stop!  Buy a bag of pre grinded coffee and make your own at home, you'll save there too.



Your husbands smoking addiction is preventing you to eat, he needs to learn what is more important, you or his cigarettes.  He needs to ATLEAST cut back on cigarettes.

You are simply paying for things you cannot afford.
1.) You need to get rid of cable
2.) Sell your vehicle and get a less expensive one...maybe $200/month.



That will give you an extra $100/week.



Also, he should get a part time job for 2 reasons.



a.) You will have more income and b) he will work more and smoke less.

Ok wedding vows say for better or worse and trust me I was in your shoes for many years. There are programs that will help with food that don't go off your income. And honestly I have 2 kids and lots of animals and I could manage off of 75 a week for groceries. Don't let your kid eat a whole box of little debbie snacks it's not good for him and there are better things to spend your money on. Turn off the cable then when it's paid off you got more money there. Trust me I love my cable but went years without it. Food is more important. File for a chapter 13 bankruptcy that will condense everything you owe into a low monthly payment based off your income and with a chapter 13 you won't lose any cars or anything like that. It's easy to love someone and stay with them when the times are good but you will be an even stronger and better person to stay through the bad times too. Find churches that give food. Not sure where you live if they have the Share program. You have to pay for food but you get a good amount and it's low in cost. they also have program there for people who cannot afford food. Good luck and don't listen to your young and immature friends. Stand by your man!

Check the law.  In some places, you have to live apart in order to get a divorce.  Otherwise, the separation doesn't count.



Personally, I guess it depends on how well you get along, whose idea the divorce is, and whether you trust him.  If the divorce is your idea and he doesn't want it, then he might want you to stay so he can change your mind.  Or, if he's possessive, he might want to keep you from dating.



I wouldn't do it, but that's me.  Over is over as far as I'm concerned.

Why do I keep fantasizing about my ex (from a long time ago)...as I am going through a divorce....he was my ?



first true love (when we were very young and it was soooo long ago). I know he wouldn't even be the same person now as he was then, and that was a decade ago! We're both still in our 20(s)...he's not married....but in an exclusive relationship and states away...but we keep in touch...



Am I crazy? Is this just some pre/post divorce depression thing? I just want to learn to fall in love with me right now. I just got out of a verbally and sometimes physically abusive marriage...I know I'm not ready to be in a relationship, rationally, but I cannot stop thinking about him!!! Should I just cut off all contact with him and try to forget about him completely?



Ah, I swear...I feel like a crazy person. Does anyone out there understand or am I all alone?



I just feel like sitting in a dark room with that chris issak song playing 'i wonder'....and crying.....I don't even drink-ever....but for this i feel like I need a drink....help!

Yes it has allot to do with you getting divorced, you are use to having someone around and that is your internal thought process starting to think about you being alone and that is not what you are use to and it like walking on new ground. You shouldn't be keeping in contact with some one like that its a make for disaster, you are still living in the past when you was young and let me tell you I went through the same thing with my first love and it will be way different. Why you ask. Because you are not the same person as you was then and he is not either. Keep a good MEMORY and move on with your life. Before you start looking for someone new learn to be in depend for yourself.

How do you handle a problem with a crazy soon to be in law? Am I wrong for feeling this way?



My boyfriend joined the Navy.  His cousin pretended to be my friend and then she wrote him a letter stating I was cheating on him with 3 guys.  This of course was not true.  She told many lies.  She is crazy.  She is now mad at him because he did not break up with me.  We are planning to get married next month.  I fear she will flip again and try to weasel her way back into his life.  I want him to have no contact with her out of respect for me.  She can not be trusted.  I never want her in my home or around us.  Is that too much to ask?  I don't think I can handle this at all.

You can ask that she not be anywhere near you or in your home, but he can see her if she wants. What she did to you is not easily forgivable and she would have to be getting burns on her knees with the amount of *** kissing she would need to do before you even think of forgiving her.

Money trouble with husband?



U have been married for five years, we have three children, He trys to stop me from working saying that I dont need to work etc. yet at the end of every  month we argue because I have used his money to keep the house, food etc, I never buy anything for myself, its always living expenses. He has called me and the kids names like klingon bastard, he says "he could go and live in a bedsit, wouldnt have to pay for all of you lot then, etc. Over the years has made me feel really bad, He does work hard and i do appreciate it, butI feel like i am 17 again, living with my parents, its depressing me. I feel really guilty for buying food for the family, but everyweek he spends £80 on cannabis for himself, he has even took control of the bank cards and took them all to work with him so that I cannot use them whilst he is at work. help

Your husband is really pain in the neck. I'm sure a lot of people would suggest you to leave him. But we don't want a divorce happen here. Why don't you talk to him, remind him that you are his wife, you deserve to use the money for the family. But if you really can't stand him, leave him....

So you live with a user. Get rid of him. You are paying for everything now as it is. He is a control freak and a drug user. And users use everyone and everything. If he wants to take care of the food and the house let him. When you lose everything then maybe you can figure out a way to get rid of him forever.

Should i leave him or not?? whats ur opinion?



HI
I have been married for 5 years now. i m form indian originally but moved here as he is british, we got married in 2 dys of knowing each other as it was  an arrnage marriage, it was all ok at first, but then it all started, we havent been on a holiday as he thinks i m boring  and he doesnt like to go on holidys with me, we dont go to cienmas and stuff just an occasional visit to a restuarnt, ha verbally abuses me and insults me all the time, he thinks i m stupid and odnt know anything, so fr i have managed to get every jobs by myself he hasnt helped me or anything, he doesnt like to hold hands in public with me, says feel embarrassed  and the way he talks  to other girls from here in london is diff then the way he speaks to me, i have never felt the connection between us at all and i think i have never loved him,



he never texts me to say he misses me or how was i all day when i m at work, or doesnt care when i m working late how m i going to get home, he`ll ask for the sake of it and thats it.
i now feel he married for the sake of the indian culture and the society and his family and not for himself,



few weeks back i said everthing how i feel about him and stuff, told him i m going to leave him and get divorce as i dont feel anyhing for him, then he started to change a bit , but then everytime when he is upset and all he askes me if i want a divorce or not, coz he feels that i dont love him anymore, i said yeah i dont but i cant help it he has drawn me to it,  i feel used and neglected all the time when i m with him now and feel guilty of not having any feelings for him anymore,



and recently i had an affair wiht one of my work mates, he is so right for me, respects me and like me for wht i m, and has said once that he does love me, but nothing can happen betweem us as i m married and have so many probs in my marraige,  no we just kissed ntohing more than that ,and no i wont go to him if i do get divorced but if so will consider it if it works out,



Please give me ur opinion on this.
thanks

It seems to me like your husband only started being nice to keep in good books with the family - he will test exactly how far he can go with you and settle there if he doesn't want a divorce.  All I can say is that he will gradually errode your self confidence and life is too short -  get out of this and live YOUR life.

I think the fact that you are even thinking about getting divorced proves that you should get divorced!!



You only live once, he is obviously not worth wasting your whole life on! You will never get those 5 years back that you wasted with him so you should leave him now and make the most of your life!!!

You should definitely leave him. He doesn't love you, appreciate you or even respect you from what you've said, he just seems to make you really miserable and that's no way to go through life if you can do something about it. You're not right for each other and should be with people who are right for you, both of you, he doesn't sound happy in this situation either.
I appreciate it will be very difficult for you both as this was an arranged marriage and you are both going to feel like you're letting your families down or doing the wrong thing, but you each have to think of your own happiness, you can't go through life like this for other people. Your families must want what's best for both of you and if neither of you are happy, surely they wouldn't want you to go on like this? I wish you both the best of luck x

This is exactly why I disagree with arranged marriages. Some of them work, but like yours, some of them don't. You cannot force love.  Him being upset when you talk of divorce, is not, I'm sorry to say, because he actually loves you, it's because he's afraid of the repercussions for himself. It will look bad on him. He is trying to emotionally blackmail you by saying 'is it because you don't love me anymore'. No, it's because you never loved him in the first place, but that's hardly your fault, so you have nothing to feel guilty for!



If it were me, I would divorce him. Do you want to be happy, or do you want to stay married to him and be abused and unhappy?



Your choice.



Be brave, and good luck x

Go on leave this guy he is no good for you, go with your work colleague if he makes you feel a lot better around him, because if you stay with this guy you will end up being depressed and lonely.



He treats you like SxxT and he thinks you have got door mat written all over you head. You are letting this guy walk all over you and its not good, you will be a lot happier with out this guy and the way he is treating you he doesn't deserve to be classed as a bloke he's more like a control freak who thinks he can treat people like crap and doesn't think about other peoples feelings, only himself, and his own feelings.
Get a DIVORCE from him you will be a lot better off when you're away from him.

If he's Indian (a Hindu?) then he would have taken a big fat dowry to get married to you. He sounds as though he only did it to shut his family up, so went through with it, and it would not surprise me if he has another woman or man on the side. Unfortunately it's all to common in this country and the US for people of Asian origin to get married to people of their country of origin because the parents want them to. He sounds like a complete waste of space and certainly does not respect you. Do not waste any more time on this marriage, just divorce him, get a settlement out of him ( you are entitled to half his property, pension etc) and make a new start. Maybe even with the new guy from work. Good luck.

There's the kind of talking you do in the living room, and then there's the kind of talking you do in the bedroom, and they should be nothing alike.  The only talking you should be doing during sex should be about sex.  Period.  I don't think there's anything wrong with what happened, and I'd talk to your wife about the discussion matter during intimate occasions.

Separated but living together?



My husband and I are coming up on our 5th year anniversary and he told me today that he isnt "happy" anymore. I am 8 months pregnant and its against everything in him to just leave me high and dry with our 2 1/2 year old and a new baby. Even if he decides not to be with me anymore, he said he will still help me since he knows I have no job, no money, and didnt finish college (I was planning on returning this summer). If I get government aid, we decided that i would move out (but be close by since I am pregnant) and start "dating" again (no dating outside each other or physical contact with another person). We want to stay together, but I am still very scared of losing him. The crazy thing is, even if I move out, he wants to be with me everyday (like visiting) but come to our house to sleep. I think that is a sign that he really doesnt want to separate. I know that all will probably work out, but I want to be prepared if it doesnt. I feel like my world is crashing in on me. We both don't want to involve our families yet, so I have very few people I feel comfortable telling about this, but being pregnant and having this happening, i am afraid I will start crying infront of other people without notice. Any advice would be appreciated.

hye sorry to hear abotu thi, everythign seems harder while ur pregnant,



wantign to be with u daily kinda send u the signals he dosnt want to loose u maybe he just feels like he is stuck in a rut, being with one person a long time can cause this but it dosnt mean he dosnt love u and the children,



maybe try somethign new, start goign for meals,pictures, or if u do that now cuddle up on the sofa things like that try a fresh start not a new life apart it would seem shuch a shame,



just see hwo things go and let him visit/be with u everyday
just have soemthign exciting waiting for him, keep him goign like you would with a new man

Sounds to me like he feels guilty. It's not fair for him to try and keep your hopes up. I really think you should talk to your family because you truly need them.



If you leave, he's going to have to pay child support and, depending on where you live, alimony. Lots of women are able to go back to school.



Check with a lawyer. Don't wait til he walks out the door. If you stay, start giving your mother money every week to keep for you. Advice I wish I'd taken...........

I don't get it.  How are you separated if you're still going to be sleeping together?  Basically, this sounds to me like a plan to waste money.  He's going to rent you a separate residence, but you're still basically going to be living at home.



He said he is not happy.  I strongly recommend you ask him how he imagines the implementation of this plan will make him happy.  Because, I can't imagine what he's thinking this will accomplish.  Can you?

You will cry.  Your hormones are everywhere. You need to tell your family.  You need family and friends.  All this sounds fishy to me with you suffering.  I am not saying things will not work out but, dear, you are very vulnerable right now and it is OK to need others.  All these conditions put on you is all about him.  He needs to grow up and know the world does not revolve around him.  What kind of father is he?  You don't need to be dating.  You can't move on to a stage so dysfunctional.  Talk to your doctor and perhaps she can help you find counseling.  If you could move out with your family you should.  This guy is not all there.

I have not words enough to sympathies with you , what you are going through is hell inflicted upon you by circumstances u definitely dont deserve . I think you are clutching at straws by allowing him to come home to sleep over . Maybe he is just trying to make his exist easier on you and you are misreading his intentions . He sure wants it safe for himself while he is testing other waters that he wants to also keep the door to you open. Dont let him. Either he sticks it up with you or be gone . Stand firm. You have nothing to lose now and he knows that if you seek child support legally , he would be going to the cleaners therefore he is ready to "help" you out as if he is doing you some great favor. The kids are as much his responsibility as yours not only financially but otherwise too. Dont be so understanding he is trying to get his cake n eat it too. Wisen up girl.

Please don't isolate yourself from the people who love you best.  I understand how family can sometimes get in the way, but I'm sure there is this one person who you can think of who can lend you the support while staying out of your way?  Talk to that person about your current situation.
I admit I don't understand your arrangement.  Is your husband just tired of getting no sleep in the night? with the 2 1/2 year-old crying?  Or what is it?  Because I would think that it would be easier for him to move out and go to his appartment to sleep at night, leaving you and your children in the place you're most familiar in.  Living in the house would make you feel much more secure than living near by.
And, while you said that both of you made the decision, I think if your husband would have taken your opinion without making you feel bad, you would have wanted to stay.
So, please seek help from the people who know you best.  Isolation is usually a sign of something gone wrong.  Do it, if not for yourself, for your children.
God be with you!



Edit:  I didn't want to say it at first, but after reading the responses from Imok2005 and Rachael H, I have to say that that was my first impression too.  I was in denial and didn't want to upset you any more than you already are.  But, if you will stand strong and protect yourself and your children, know that your husband is very likely wanting to keep you while seeing someone else.  He's getting you out of the way so that he can live this other life at home.  Don't let him.  Either do what Drew suggested and get your man back or do what Chasings suggested.  Again, God be with you!!!



Edit 2: Wait.  On second thought.  If indeed your husband has already been seeing someone else and has committed adultery, then go the divorce route.  But, if he hasn't (yet), then do what Drew suggested.  Make an extra effort and get him back.  But, honestly, because your situation smells of control (him controlling you), you will both need to go to a counselor for your marriage to last.

First and foremost, any man that walks out on his pregnant wife and child is a piece of garbage.  Let's be clear on that.



However, what is going on in your marriage to make your husband feel that way?  Is he just freaked out of the responsibility of knowing he has to support a family of four?  Because as a working husband who supports a stay at home wife and twin daughters that are also two and a half, I can tell you that it's a pretty heavy load to carry sometimes.  Especially when I come home to a dirty house, a wife still in her pajamas, and the girls who don't look like they've had a bath since Wednesday!



Clearly some changes need to be made on BOTH ends from what it sounds like.  Your husband needs to quit talking about leaving you and how unhappy HE is, and you need to start stepping up too.  You two made a commitment to one another for BETTER or for WORSE.  And now that you have elected to become parents, those vows should mean even more.  DO THE RIGHT THING!

It sounds like your marriage is definately worth trying to save, try getting him to go to marriage counseling with you, and if he is hesitant, try finding a male marriage counselor, he'll probably feel more comfortable and less nervous that he's going to be manbashed for the entire session.  Good Luck, and love him to pieces in the meantime, the more you love and respect him, the harder it will be for him to leave.

All or nothing!** Do not let him move you out and then allow him to  visit when ever he wants, as this sounds like he wants to keep you, and make room for another. This type of relationship is hard and will only get worse as time goes on.You need to be reading this as a sign that he is going to put you on the side for safe keeping and if the other relationships do not work out he will have you. Now wake up and listen to all the other ladies, as you are  not different, and in similar circumstances. Do not isolate your self - tell those around you what is going on. One sign of emotional abuse is to isolate the victim and you being pregnant and the mother of 2yr. old you need all the support you can get. If there is no other woman then he has nothing to be ashamed of, or hide. Start talking today with your family and friends the longer you wait and keep this all bottled up the more stress you are putting yourself through. Your children deserve a happy mom that has family and friend support, not hidden away and put on hold for a man that wants his cake and cookies too.

What to do if your husband, keeps up old habbits?



Ok, my husband and i have been married for a little over a year, but we dated for 5 years before we got married, and now we have a 4 month old son. My husband has had some bad habits, but nothing that i couldn't over look before, but his big one is last night i confronted him on the fact that i know he sent and received a dirty picture on his phone... i didn't tell him how i knew but, at first he tried to tell me that it was forever ago and i told him that i had talked to the person that got the picture that he sent (she was the same person that sent him the picture). As far as she knew it was ok with me, but i informed her of the fact that i was quite upset about it, and she is a friend of mine too, but anyway, now he is sending email's with the same stuff to a different person, i just don't know what to do anymore. I love him dearly, our relationship started off with him still having feelings for his ex (he doesn't anymore) he has cheated on me before, and this is the thanks that i get for bending over backwards to always be there for him in every way no matter what i have to do. I have never once done anything to hurt him, and i'm too kind-hearted to ever do anything to make him feel the pain he has caused me and still is. Any Advice....

if he isn't cheating right now, he's trying to. Why else would you send pictures like that to a woman that isn't your wife? You already know the answer, but are trying to deny the truth because it hurts. It will continue to hurt unless you put a stop to it. If he wants other women he shouldn't have gotten married. So, dump him and get with a real man. Good luck in the decisions you make.

If you dont have kids, get out and find a husband who will give you the respect you deserve, if you do have kids, you knew he was like this when you got married, and you still decided to marry him, so you have to take some responsiblity for the decisions you made in life and stick it out for the kids, at least until they are 18.

Real thing?  A bj is a real thing.



There is a variety in sensation from oral sex that you just don't get with vaginal sex.  That said, I'm apparently odd for not liking bj's better, but vaginal sex gives me more of a whole body experience.



What about you?  How do you like receiving oral sex compared to penetration?  I've never met a woman who didn't love it.

I'm Agnostic.  I don't know if there is a god or some supreme being, but if there is, I highly doubt he's anything like the god they talk about in the bible.  There's just too much of the bible that doesn't make sense.



But I don't think it really matters what religion people are when they are giving advice.  I know several really religious people steal from their employers and cheat on their spouses and that kind of stuff, but go to church every sunday.  And I know many atheists that are the most moral people I've ever met.



I think it's actually easier for the religious people to do the "wrong thing" because they have this whole forgiveness thing going on with the church.  As long as you accept jesus or whatever, then you can pretty much do whatever you want and you'll still go to heaven....it's basically unlimited "get out of hell free" cards!



Many athesists and agnostics do the right thing because they want to, not because some sky critter supposedly told them to.



So I think it doesn't matter what religion they are.  There are good and bad people in every religion (or lack of religion).  Some of the advice you get here will be good and some will be bad.



My advice is to read everyone's opinion with an open mind, and then choose which sounds the most logical, regardless of who it came from.

I believe in defining our terms.  Religious means pertaining to a religion.



Religion (noun): a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, esp. when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.



Except for the "devotional and ritual observances" part, I would have to say that I am definitely religious.



All that said, I would caution you against rejecting advice from religious people out of hand.  For example, I believe that the large majority of atheists would agree that this is a very good guiding principle: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.



Take answers in context.  The Bible, for example, contains a great deal of obviously sensible guidelines from which even non-believers could benefit.

I was brought up as Christian Orthodox but I definitely cant say I'm that religious at all. I do not agree with some principles (especially those concerning marriage and wife's place in it) outlined in Bible. I totally respect christian perspective but I think if anyone was interested in getting a religious advice they could visit church or post in religious discussion forums or smth. Most people here are ineterested in how it really works in life not how it should work according to christian point of view.

I'm not religious, but I am spiritual, that is, I do believe in a higher power, but not the Christian God, not Allah, none of them. I believe that we are higher powers inside and will eventually break free from our physical bodies and be purely spiritual beings one day not looking for some purpose in life. I lean very much towards Buddhism and other religions in the indian area like Hinduism, if I were to classify myself as any religion. I do call myself Buddhist though, as I do study the religion and find myself at a best match and well suited for that religion. I can't fit into christianity. I've tried before while I was soul searching, and just can't bring myself to believe in something that I have never seen, never seen the actions or results of a Godly act, and find it too hard to believe that such a being can exist.

i'm not against religion at all.  i try to do whats right, specifically, take care of my family and dont hurt others (who dont deserve to be).  however, when it comes to criticizing people who dont live the biblical life, or have views different from mine, that is wrong.  there's too much of that on here.



people should live their religious or non-religious life as they choose.  if it works for them no one has any business judging.  there are things i dont agree with, understand or want to do myself but i'm wise enough to know that if they're happy and not doing blatant harm to themselves or others, in this earthly world, then its none of my damn business.

I'm generally agnostic. I was born a Protestant Christian, non-practising. I doubt the existence of a God in the traditional sense, though If I'm being honest, I'll play a safe card and not entirely rule out some creative entity either, since not even science has yet been able to explain certain things such as what caused the Big Bang.



I do find certain fundamentalist Christian and Muslim ideas a little disturbing. Particularly hard-line Muslim views regarding women, and equally so, hard-line Christians who deny hundreds of years of scientific research over what the bible tells us. I mean really, what sort of person claims the bible was right and Darwin was wrong these days ? If those people held absolute power, we'd still be burning witches. Each to their own I guess.



I do believe you should never put down anyones religion either. So long as we live and let live, we are all entitled to our belief. Unfortunately it's those differences of belief which has caused pretty much all the trouble in the world throughout human history. So for that reason, organised religion is not for me.

I grew up in the Catholic school system. It about ends there. I did not have a "church" wedding. My children are not baptized. I was never truly comfortable in a church- I could never understand why people walked around like zombies - listening to the preist - because that was what was expected of them.........groomed from a young young age.
I have family who are "religious" - by that I mean - they go do their "penance" for ONE hour - ONCE a week - make their donation - and that is it.
This is not something I'm interested introducing to any of my children......My children do ask a lot of questions about church (they have friends who are young and unfortunately continually try to lure them in - again - I realize this is something instilled at a young young age........) I continually tell them that there is nothing wrong with church  so long as you can find the right one! (which I've yet to) and when they are old enough to make INFORMED adult decisions - then we will go and explore all the different types of religions and see if there's anything that "clicks" for US.
By that I mean, one that doesn't make you FEAR God - I don't believe our Creator should be feared!! Why would God (Allah, our creator - how ever you want to word it) put us on the Earth to FEAR all the time?
My childhold was wraught with FEAR. Constant - listen to me or you will burn in hell - listen to your parents  or you will burn in hell - do as I say - but not as I do - or you will burn in hell.........
All that has taught me is - if it is all true - then I'm guessing neither I or the 2 ZILLION other people who didnt' follow the word of the Lord to the the T - will not be alone down there!! LOL
(and I don't really believe in Hell either)
I feel you need to live your life day by day - as a good person - doing what you can to ensure you children have good lives and are brought up with morals and values that you can be proud of......DAY BY DAY - not one hour a week - minus 10% of my income. I just don't agree with it........
As for holidays. We celebrate the fun part of them. Again we have friends who do not allow their kids to celebrate Halloween due to their religion........to us there's no religious aspect to it - or should I say - not anything we wish to teach our kids. We've given them a brief rundown on the ideoligy that some religions have - but for us - it's a great day to dress up like witches/vampires/BATMAN - whatever - go out - get some excercise and some candy! Woo Hoo!! Their public school actually won't allow them to dress up = so as not to "offend" anyone.
Please!



The same goes for Christmas. We give them a breif rundown of how the different religions see Christmas (and so many are so similer now a days)
and then carry on to celebrate it as a family - a time of giving - sharing and caring for eachother. It's not all about the toys - it's about spending quality time with eachother and our family and enjoying grama's SOUL food...........could there be anything better?!?!
Same for Thanksgiving, Easter etc. We tend to just do our own thing, take it as an opportunity (and day off) to spend time with our family.

I do not believe in "god" I feel that religion is just another way of controlling people, it gives some a needed feeling of belonging, and it seems to make others feel superior to others.
It still amazes me the reaction I get from people when I say I am Atheist, it is as if they are suddenly afraid of me. I need factual info before I believe anything, I question most everything, but it is only questioning the existance of God that really offends people, and to ask a person of religion to provide any type of proof to validate their belief they can get so selfrighteously enraged to even be asked, I mean of course I should blindly have faith in a unseen un heard unverifyable supreme creator of all, but if in fact there was a "god" with the power to create all, well shouldn't he just show up and prove him/her/it self so all the loyal sheep wouldn't be bothered with having to constantly be questioned about it's existance.



but it does not seem to be a problem for so many seemily intelligent individuals, who just believe, in a invisible, man in the sky who is considered loving while just sitting back and dealing with all the sinners bad behavior, and yet threatens to have you burn in hell for any number of ever changing no no's, but then again it is interesting that if a individual claims he is guided by unseen entitys, we call that, delusional behavior and they are deemed Insane. but if alot of people have the same delusion, we call it Religion.
there is a reason congregations are called flocks, they are like sheep, a group of many, who however share 1 brain.
I say THINK PEOPLE it's not illegal yet.

Wow, so you're a cheater and you're a home wrecker. Damn! Talk about a double whammy. Move away to go to school and get on with your life. Try sticking with single men from now on, preferably only one at a time. Having two relationships, one of them being with a married man no matter whether he's getting divorced or not, is only going to end in heart ache for you, and other people involved that you obviously don't care much about. Time to grow up sweetie. This is not the way one finds love.

End the relationship with both guys.



You are not in love with the bf if you are cheating on him, and
being with a guy who is still in the middle of a marriage is a
huge mistake.



He is not yet emotionally available, because he still has a boat load of crap to endure when the divorce is filed.



My guess is that once he is finally free, he wont want to be tied down by a relationship, and he will have trust issues if you are gone to college any way.



You can find someone else to date once you have established yourself at college, someone who is not married, and someone that you care enough not to cheat on.

Just get out of this.What ru doing with 36 years old married guy .Is he really divorcing because of you or because he has problems in his marriage.
Don't feel elated that some guy is leaving his wife for you.No, he is leaving for his own reasons.
You are important to him now because he need you to escape his own problems not because he loves you or something like that.
Anyway you will be the best judge as you will know this guy and also your priorities.

My advise would be for you to drop both relationships and focus on your own needs, as seeing two people can get very confusing, it's only a matter of time before you start becoming emotionally drained. Also I'm 36 and I have a 18 year old son, I couldn't imagine dating someone in this age category, it's insane, the 36 year old knows better and if he cared for you he would let you go, as caring for someone means that you have their best interest at heart, you do whats best for them and set aside your own wants and needs, but I'm guessing at the age of 18 you simply don't get it? But trust me on this one, you are being used, so I highly recommend that you rid yourself of relationships for a while, get yourself on track and do whats best for you, not whats best for others.

It appears that you need to stop and evaluate your life and make a decision, that is something as an adult that you will have to start making.  Do not worry, you will make many wrong decisions in your life, but hopefully you will learn from each mistake, and that will only make you a stronger person.  So you make your decision, do not allow others to do that for you, stick with what you decide and be happy.  Good luck.

So I am totally in love with my girlfriend of 1 year. The thing is. She is always busy. She goes to med school. And the gym and is always hanging out with her friends. When she is not studying. I mean she spend time with me too. Is just that. This girl wouldn't drop or cancle no plans for me. So why im I so in love with her. When I had plenty of girls before who would do what ever for me? I want to marry this girl. ANd I feel like its the only way that I well see her more. She won't leave nothing at my apartment and she won't move in with me. An everytime I bring up marriage she change the subject. Or she tells me she hasn't really thought about that subject much. She doesn't call me much. Especially when I;m with the guys. And she doesn;t talk on the phone more than 10min with me.

Well it appears that she likes you too.  But you appear to be needy and that is forcing her to keep you at a distance.  If you really want to marry this girl, then you have to be mature enough to wait until she is ready.  At this point in time she only has her focus set on becoming a doctor, so allow her the time and you may get your reward in the end.  Good luck.

So she'd have to be fawning all over you to make you think that she truly loves you? Come on. Obviously she's not yet ready for marriage, which is probably because she's still in school and getting her own life in order first. She obviously cares about you, but doesn't feel the need to hang all over you. You've fallen for an independent woman who has her own life outside of you. That's not a bad thing. Would you rather have a girlfriend and eventual wife that sits on the couch every night awaiting your arrival? If that's what you're looking for you've definitely found the wrong girl.

It sounds to me as if maybe you may take the relationship a bit more serious then she does, and you can't force her be more loving, this must come natural. Sometimes people who are in your shoes feel a little isolated and left out, this can make a person be more drawn to want to conquer the other person, she becomes more of a challenge so therefore you may start to want to become a bit more clingy to her, so don't confuse love with instant gratification. Let things go the way their gonna go, and stop stressing over it, as the more you stress the more you will think you want her.

You need to answer the phone by saying this family does not accept blocked calls and hang up immediately. Your husband does not sound like he has your best interest as heart. You need to talk to  the police by going to the station and asking to talk to an available officer about every thing. A background check on this lady would be helpful as if she has had any emotional problems and has been hospitalized then she may not be allowed to own firearms. Your husband is making up excuses to have several women in his life. Talk to a counselor who can help you take the proper steps to get him out of your life. It seems like you are being emotionally abused. Get out now as this most likely is not the first affair or his last. You may not be treated good by him but its time you respect yourself and not allow him to walk all over you.

Change the phone number to a new, private number. Do not give it to your husband.



Have an attorney send a letter to her telling her that she is to cease
all contact and charges will be pressed & you will go to court for a restraining order if she continues to phone harass you.



Tell your husband that you are filing for divorce and that he can leave now or when the court orders him to.



If you get these same phone calls after you change the number, call the phone company and advise them of the phone harassment. They will press charges once they trace the calls back to her.



BTW: You could end the drama now by leaving with the kids.
If you have somewhere to go, take the kids and leave and file for divorce. You do not have to tolerate his disrespect or hers.

(I came home a few minutes later) she is like the exersist!!!!! I have two children with my first wife and she never acted like this, I will admit that I didn;t give her her space when she needed it but never expected an outburst like this. Is this the preganacy or should I pack my bags? I don't want too but if I am the ause of this I do not want to hurt the baby.

Honestly.. I would just give her some space. It is the hormones. Every woman is different. So one might be totally fine, but another one will be out of control.



It is almost over, I am sure she isn't going to hurt the baby. She does have the babies best interest. I am sure at this point of her pregnancy all she wants is her body back. She will soon enough.



Trust me.. just go along with her.. but be behind her and if she needs you she will let you know!!!!! You are a good man!!! You will be a great father!!!

Mood swings are common in pregnancy, and you need to ask her what it is that she feels missing now that she is expecting a child. Let her now that you are there for her, and if there is anything that she needs you are willing to provide for her.

It's the pregnancy.  Just learn to duck and cover when you need to.  She can't help it right now but she can talk to her doctor (don't approach her about this unless she is in a good and I mean really good mood) there are not a lot of medications pregnant women can take but there are a few available to help with the mood swings.  If she is not a danger to herself or others, I would just try to roll with it.  Once that baby pops out, her hormones will level out very quickly and she will be fine.



That being said, since she has had such a hormonal reaction to pregnancy, she might be in for a bout of postpartum depression once the baby is born.  Read up on it and be aware of the signs. (Also look into postpartum psychosis just in case.)



Leaving her because of her mood swings would be incredibly cruel right now because she really isn't at fault here.  I'm sure there is a part of her that hates the mood swings as well.  She feels fat and ugly, she is afraid of this change in her life, and her hormones have turned against her.  She doesn't need to face becoming a single mom on top of all that.

Once she has the baby, her hormones should level out in due time and if they don't she could have post pregnancy depression which can be treated easily with medication and is temporary. She probably does need some alone time, but she does need you more now than anything even if she seems crazy. Both my parents have had a relationship full of turmoil and many fights and many many bumps but they have stayed together because of the times my dad told my mom he would not leave her, no matter what (even though she pushed him and hit him a few times... they got over it). She may be testing your loyalty..it's a thing women do. Her hormones are raging and she wants to know if you are willing to stick around to see her through this.... Trust me, if you can stick it through times like this, you guys can stay together. It's one day at a time... Just remind her even while she's crazy that you will never leave her but if she needs space... you will give it to her and go to a hotel... but that doesn't mean you don't want to be there for her :)

Could be the pregnancy, when she is calm and rational, I would gently say something about her behavior.  It also could be the financial issues, you both are bringing a child into this world where everything is horribly expensive.  She could be freaking out a bit on how are you both going to raise this child when we all can barely take care of ourselves.



I would tell her, honey, what am I doing to make you act this way? What do I need to do?  I want you to be healthy and happy and the baby too.



If she still rips your head off, I would go to the store or somewhere outside until she cools off.  I would call her doctor and let them know what is going on.  Its going behind her back, but if you truly fear that she is endangering your child you have every right to call a doc to get advice.  She may need help.



Hang in there, she still needs you despite her erratic behavior.



Hope this helps!

LOL...I'm sorry I know it's not funny but pregnancy affects each woman differently.  Her hormones are going crazy right now so don't hold it against her.  However don't pack your bags either....all you have to do is leave the house for a few minutes or just leave the room....let her cool off and calm down...that's all.  I know it might seem like she's the exorcist but it's okay...she just doesn't have any control of her emotions right now and the pregnancy itself can be overwhelming at times.  One more month and it'll get better.

Ofcourse that's the most obvious sign because they really don't want to. Those people who have "age" just what others said might get married even though they're like that. Or those people with "attitude" or whatever may because they might like to

There are no such signs !!



Even those who run around saying they never will, end up doing so.
When love strikes, or ppl think it does, those claims are forgotten real fast.



Besides, most ppl, women in particular are usually raised to believe that getting married is a "must" in life, mothers still pump this into their daughters from an incredibly young age, teaching that it is the only path in life and still teach them unrealistic views on love, marriage, children, etc.

for men it devotion to work as number 1
then self as number 2
then family as number 3



they will set up their life for a single existence and be comfortable with it
they have friends so they are not lonely
they have a Gf from time to time, but will never commit ( and the Gf will usually hang on thinking that they will )
they go out and do things ( hobbies, etc ) to pass time away
they are often very intelligent and thus do not see the reason nor need for marriage
they like children but do not want any to take care of
they are often good Uncles to their siblings children
and usually earn more than most since they can advance in career unimpeded and unfettered by marriage or child raising duties

What would you do? If your 27 yr. old fiance was hanging out with 18 years old little scanks?



Ill make this story short. But my fiances best friend whom is like 40 years old always hung around this little 18 year old two girls the girls are very pretty.  So for some reason i dont think my fiance would cheat on me, but he is also a compulsive liar.  So just the otherday he suposidly went "dirt-biking''  and the yesterday i found out he was over at his best friends house and hanging out with them two girls.  He said he didn't tell me because I wouldve flipped out. But in my defence i said if you no that i was goin to flip out then y are you doing it?  And then to sit there and lie about it makes me think something is up.  I am sooo unterly pisst about this! I slept on the couch last night but for some reason I dont think this will stop. I dont think he would cheat but honestly i dont think he should be hanging out with 18 year old girls.  But also the fact that everything out his mouth is a lie makes me not believe anything that he says.



If your all going to say move out..... well i moved out of state to live with him, so just up and moving out will not be as easy as said.  If i were back at home this would be easy but i do love him but im just sick to my stomache with this. I dont no what to do.

You may not think he is cheating, but if he's willing to lie about hanging out with them, why don't you think he'd lie about doing things with them? There's absolutely no reason for him and his buddy to be hanging out with two young women like that. For God's sake, it almost sounds like they're double dating. If you can't trust him now, trust me, it's only going to become harder in the years to come.

Honestly..I would make arrangements to move out when you can. This issue will more than likely evolve into something bigger. Even if he doesn't cheat on you, the fact that he is going over his best friends house and also hanging out with 18 year old girls is not only suspicious but highly disrespectful to you. If he cared about you and respected you then he would care and respect your feelings. Give him an altimatum (sp)...tell him that if he doesn't start respecting your feelings then your done. Simple as that. At 27 he doesn't need to be hanging around 18 year olds? And at 27 why does he have a female best friend that is 40? lol Shouldn't he be hanging out with his "guy" friends. Weird.

You most likely right and unless you have some hold on his behavior this will continue and his cover-up will get more pronounced with more lies forthcoming. A habitual liar doesn't like getting caught. Someone who has the best of both worlds doesn't like anyone telling them how to lead their lives. So what is your plan for recourse and redirect his bad boy behavior. Love means more than just awhile, and if he continues on this course the worst can happen. You have to decide how much all this pretense is worth. Is his love for you substituted for free sex and lust. A cheater will make your life miserable and not trusting him in everything he does and says. He has proved that you are definitely above him in class and integrity. He can't measure up. Move on before the pain comes in your next tearful question......

Older men who hang out with young women do this to feel attractive, sexual and younger. Young women love the attention and feel older and attractive when they are with older men.



This is a dangerous combination!! Also it is not appropriate, in my opinion. I believe that you are not exaggerating on how you feel about the situation because I would be incredibly uncomfortable with this situation.



Personally, I would dump the guy. I would not tolerate such behavior in my life and would not want to deal with this. It will only get worse if you get married.

Think about it this way.  The man you think your in love with has knowingly snuck and done something behind your back that he knew would tick you off.  What does that say about his character? What does it tell you about his mentality about honesty? Does it tell you that there is a point he thinks its ok to lie to you? ITs ok to lie if it keeps him out of trouble? And why would he spend time with those girls without you there if there was nothing to hide?  Do you think a marriage with someone who is willing to lie to you will work out in the end? Theres a great deal of heartache from being betrayed by someone you are engaged to but it multiplies by ten when its your marital partner.  Past predicts future.  I would demand a lie detector test (google it for your town, they are amazingly accurate) Have you heard the new song If I were a boy?  if not listen to it on youtube.

You know he is a compulsive liar.  He is doing things that he knows you won't approve of but chooses to do them anyway.  What are doing?  Don't be a fool.  He can't be trusted.  Call off the wedding and tell him to grow up or move on with your life.  You deserve more than the games he's playing with you.

It is disrespectful for him to be hanging out with any females that you are either not friends with or that you are unaware of them hanging out together.



He is cheating because he's a liar.  And if he isn't cheating, he will.



Not only that but he and his friend are disgusting.

I don't think I have to tell you that a 40 year old man, a 27 year old man and two 18 year old chickies when mixed together become a recipe for disaster.



Think maybe he actually told you because he's trying to prepare you for something that may be coming down the pike? I'd be pretty angry too and find it hard to believe that all they may have done was 'hang out' and talk. Think about it....what could a 40 year old guy possibly discuss or have in common with an 18 year old?



Nope....there could be trouble brewing here.

It amazes me how people come on here to ask for advice, yet they claim they do not want to leave. So what advice did you expect us to give to you. The way I see it you only have two options, you stay and take it or you leave. A guy that is a complusive liar is capable of cheating. I am not saying that he is, but two young pretty girls is tempting to any man. Just know, he lied to you because HE KNEW it would pist you off. So he already knew in advance that he did something that would upset you. I am not suggesting you leave him. But it would be to your advantage if you took more time to know him because from what you wrote you truly don't. Good luck to you!

It sounds like you already have your answer. If you do not think it is appropriate for you fiance's friend to hang with an 18 year older, then you must also think that it is also wrong for your fiance.



Question: What is it that you see in this guy? He has lied to you. You cannot trust him. So what is keeping you on the couch and not kicking him out? I hear that it is easier for me to say this than it is for you to do it. But in the long run, moving will be a lot easier than living with someone you cannot trust.

Hon, you're in a clearly unpleasant situation, but you've got the power to free yourself from it. The problem I'm seeing is that you're resisting using that power and are instead waiting for someone else to come along and shake your life up enough for you to see what's going on. I'll try to be that someone.



You don't think your fiance would cheat on you, but he is also a compulsive liar. Hmmm...you must see the contradiction there, right? He's demonstrated a profound lack of respect for you by lying about where he went and admitting that he lied because he didn't want you to flip out. This translates to:



I'm willing to do things that I know will hurt you but I won't tell you about it so your feelings will be safe and our marriage will stay a happy one.



And the HUGE problem with people (guys and girls) who behave like this is that the marriages they have are never happy ones. With hidden agendas and lies all over the place, no relationship can survive or be a healthy one for either person.



You may have moved out of state to be with this guy, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to leave a bad situation. The fact that you say you're "sick to my stomach" reveals that you know what to do but are deathly afraid of doing it.



There are organizations who provide help to people in your situation: women's shelters, hospice organizations, churches, and others. Do you have any family members you can go to for assistance? Even a couple of weeks in the spare bedroom at your sister's or parents' house, or uncle's place, or a close friend's place...these are options you shouldn't ignore outright.



And one last note: No man above the age of 20 should have anything to do with 18 year old girls except in professional (i.e., teacher/student, doctor/patient, etc.) capacity. If your fiance is spending social time with 18 year olds, he's very likely getting a serious ego-boost from their fawning attention, which they freely give in exchange for his attention, which almost every 18 year old girl likes to receive. Short answer: They've all got "issues" with mommy or daddy baggage and this is their way of managing them.



If your "man" won't go to a marriage/family counselor with you, that should be proof enough that he isn't worth the ring you're preparing to put on his finger.



Take care of yourself.

Moving out of state to live with him was obviously a mistake, but staying with a compulsive liar, and likely cheat would be mistake number 2.  Yes, moving away from him would be hard, but it's going to be even harder, once you're married and have kids.  If you're only staying with him because you're far from home, what does that say about the relationship?

Does my brother in law's wife really like me? Women your help please!?



So here's how it all started.. I've known this woman for over 6 yrs (she's my brother in law's wife) and last year at a party she got kind of drunk and grabbed my hand for a little bit. After that I asked her about it but she seemed to act like she didnt know it happened.we started txting, flirting back and forth after that. At another party I would hug her and touch her affectionately (discreetly) and she seemed to be ok with it. We even went as far as to have lunch together and I hugged her and kissed her in the cheek... she offered very little resistance except when i tried kissing her on the mouth. After that I talked to her and she said that she just sees me as "just a friend" all along and can't do that to her husband. What I'm wondering if she really means what she said about seeing me as "just a friend" or is she using that just so we don't do any further damage to ourselves and family? I insisted that she let me know if she saw me as more than a friend but she continues to tell me no she just sees me as a friend. It just doesnt make sense what she says and how she acts around me just doesnt seem to add up.... is she telling the truth?

Why are you so concerned on if she likes you? That shouldnt be what you should be trying to understand from her. She is married. Stop being selfiish and self centered. If she likes you, she is letting you know not enough to leave her husband. So quit with this fantasy and grow up and find your own love. Thats so triflin. take care

It sounds like you're trying to steal your brother in law's wife away from her husband.



There may have been a little something but she thought about the situation and decided that she wants to remain faithful to her husband.  She specifically told you she doesn't want anything to happen.  You should respect that and stop thinking it can develop into something more.



Women, even ones in relationships, like to flirt and feel good about themselves, but that doesn't always mean they want to ruin everything with their significant other.  I wouldn't read too much into it.

Ever heard of a Penis in a glass case??? that could be what she is preparing you for.  Since she is your brother -in -law's wife.  Ther eis really no relation between you 2,  this would be a perfect fling situation. but you have to play your cards right.  She said that she sees you as 'just a friend" ,  well when she needs a "friend" she will check for you first.



Look... i not saying that you should cheat or she should cheat.  but the Penis in the Glass case, is for those emergencies that women have when they find out that their husbands had some sort of orgy somewhere with some college chicks  and they want revenge.

My advice would be to "follow your heart"... as cliche as that sounds.  The fact that you are stating in public here that you absolutely don't love your BF... says that you should definitely break it off.  If you stay with him now for stability reasons, you will undoubtedly be MISERABLE for the rest of your life, and it can only end it disater because there are a million horrible situations that could lead to.  You are still young you should date and find someone that makes you happy no matter what, your life will be a lot richer :)

Love or stability? What kind of choice is that. Love IS stability.



If you think a marriage without love can honestly be "stable," then you have a lot to learn about marriage. Marry for love, that brings emotional stability, you might have to work for financial stability. But that's life!



By the way, I married for love. Things were tough financially in the beginning, but that's part of the process. We're happy, in love, financially stable. All the money in the world can't hold a marriage together. If it did, there wouldn't be anywhere near as much fodder for tabloids as there is nowadays!

Everyone is going to tell you so some version of, "don't be practical, follow your heart!"  In the end, that's the right answer, but I understand your dilemma.  Personally I got married at 25  and have been VERY happy for the last 8 years - but I was one thousand per cent head over heels in love.  I now believe that was sheer luck.  During these years I have seen a lot of couples marry for reasons other than true love and either they live unhappily or they end up divorcing.  It's not worth it.  Live your life with a free spirit and eventually you will fall totally in love.  By the way, most of my friends have gottem married in the last year, so don't think you are over the hill at 25.  You have plenty of time to do as you please!

The old cliche holds true..."money doesnt buy happiness".  You may be financially stable with this man, but every other aspect of your life will be misery because he is simply not the man you love. I dont recommend simply marrying just for love either since we cannot control who we fall in love with and the person who we do love can be a terrible person.



I got lucky and married for love and friendship. I couldnt have done better if I had created my husband myself! Give yourself a chance to find the right person for you as well.

For me, Love, with the assurance of stability (he had just graduated with his undergrad, and had not yet found a job, but was starting seminary in the fall). I knew he'd find work (and he did, a few weeks before our wedding), and now he and I do fine and live well within our means-so now we have the best of all things: love and the security of being financially stable.



Don't be in a marriage with someone who you know you don't love. Because stability can fade-it really can, and then what are you left with?



Don't let someone force you into making such a huge commitment. It's better to break his heart now, before you are married, then 'try to love him' and marry him only for financial comforts, and have to divorce him later because you are in a one-sided marriage-because that will get old really fast. You have to be crazy about him, as much as he is about you, because when times get really hard, you will lean on your friendship, and your deep love for one another to make it through.

Ex husband wont leave me alone, what to do?



I recently seperated from my husband of 5 years. He moved out and got his own place and Im living in mine. The problem is, he calls me everynight and tells me he misses me and that he is lonely. I feel terrible because he doesnt have any family or friends in the area because we just moved here a year ago. After getting his call of depression I end up going over to his place to keep him company and I end up staying the night. WE ARE NOT HAVING SEX. And he isnt asking for it, but we do end up falling asleep and curled up together. I dont know what to do?? I just want to go on with my life but he makes me feel guilty with the late night calls of loneliness. We didnt want to part as enemys and have made an oath to each other to remain friends. Maybe we shouldnt have done that?

Some guy on oprah was saying that most men who cheat did it to feel important and cared for.  They felt like "winners" with the other woman where as their wives were not paying enough attention to them and making them feel left out or less needed and appreciated.



Yeah I think trying to affair-proof your marriage is a waste of time.  You really can't control what they are going to do.  All you can do is love them to the best of your ability and try to make them happy.  After that it's up to the husband to be faithful.  And if they can't be then you don't need them anyway.



And yes woman do it too.  Lots of them these days.  Are men sitting around worrying about affair-proofing their marriage?  I doubt it.  Some men will cheat just like some women will.  These people really shouldn't be married.

It is up to the man how much integrity, honesty, commitment, and morals he chooses have, and if he takes his marriage vows seriously or not. I believe some men will cheat no matter how sweet, giving, and pretty their wives are. Some men simply don't care. They feel no sense of guilt and they think they are justified in doing it and fully entitled to doing it. What causes that? Not sure...Narcissistic Personality Disorder? There are just some people in this world who are backstabbing, selfish jerks, what can I say. Just the way it is. Why were head honchos of charity organizations like some big Cancer foundation, stealing DONATION money people generously gave to the foundation, to try to help people with cancer, and used the money for their own pleasures instead of putting the money towards where it was intended to go to, to help sick people? Why do some people find it perfectly acceptable to slaughter foxes, minks, baby seals, grown seals, the lynx, chincillas, and other animals, just to make fur coats? Because some people are greedy, stinking, you-know-whats! That is just the way it is.

Men and women in a marriage try to love each other the way they themselves want to be loved. However they should love each other according to their spouses needs.---- They asked men and women would they rather be Loved or Respected (but not the other at all)? Women chose loved 92% of the time. Men choose respected 97% of the time. Have you noticed men say she got bitchy(disrespectful) after marriage. Women say he doesn't care/asshole(unloving) after marriage. Women and Men find the traits they want their partner to have in others. This is what draws them to cheat. This in no way justifies cheating. If they cheat, they cheat and they are wrong period.

Not much of one, I guess. But I think most men still have that primal drive to spead their seed around to the most females in order to keep the species going.
Could also be due to the fact that humans seem to like getting something different from time to time, and it's not just men who feel the need to cheat at times, wives do it too, you know.

Because cheating like most things today, can be overlooked or justified so often, at least by the worlds standards.  Look, you can never guarantee anything, nor can anyone else.  What you can do is pray a lot and try to act as you should act, according to what God says.



Most people today can find a way to justify anything.  There was a time when we held people accountable.  Years ago, to do some things would get you ran out of town.  Today, no one bats an eye.  The moral standards have gone down, so naturally people are more comfortable in doing things they know are wrong.  Make sure you are not one who helps them go down or who helps them be seen as trivial.  If you do, you will have to accept that it is just as trivial when things are done to you.



Make sure you do not act in ways that can help others justify or feel okay with acting wrongly toward you or cheating on you.  Yes, you will make mistakes, you are human.  But goofing or making a mistake occasionally is different from only giving sex to your hubby once a month or lying to him or acting as if he is just their to please or satisfy your whims.  You must act in ways that do not aid others in making excuses for bad behavior toward you.



Hope that helps and makes you think a bit.

The same reasons it draws a woman to cheat. There is no definitive answer for this action. It appears that as long as you have a reason, then it's OK. It doesn't matter how lame the reason is as long as it's justified in your mind. All you have to do is check on this site and you'll read tons of reason for cheating. Just when you think you've seen every reason for cheating..not a chance...along comes a new one !!

I know men that have cheated with girls uglier then there wives. It's just because the new female is appreciating him a lot more. She's new and is needy. Men need to feel needed/loved and not forgotten. When you get married you must always be on your toes because newer models always come out and you need to keep reminding him why he's still with the classic

marriage is no different then any other wrong doing.  So why do people steal?  why do people kill?  prisons are full and not for cheating for a ton of other things people just do wrong or bad things.  So yes you need to affair-proof your marriage just like you would secure or rob-proof your home you lock your doors at night don't you?

Is it all right to catch up with an ex-boyfriend who is married?



My ex-boyfriend (we have been split up for about 3 years) who is now married rang me recently and asked if we could catch up. However I feel he has an ulterior motive.  I realized recently that I still have strong feeling for him and he told me things weren't' going well in his marriage. So I thought perhaps either he wants to see me because he wants a back up plan as his marriage isn't going to well, or he just wants to patch things up and be friends. I am single at the moment.

Married guys who are looking around all say things aren't going well in their marriage.  And it is guaranteed that if you are willing to get involved with him, even on a "friend" basis, his marriage will not go well.  Then what, you win the prize?  A man like that is no prize.  No matter what he says or how much you think he cares about you, know this:  if he is doing this to his wife, he will do it to you.



We have moral obligations to stay away from married men.  So is it all right to catch up?  Since you have strong feelings for him, no way!!

So you suspect he wants to cheat on his wife with you? Do you really want a cheater? He doesn't just want to be friends and you know it. Tell him you'll catch him when he's no longer married or his wife tells you it's okay to mess with her husband. Don't set yourself up to be the other woman.

I need to understand psyche of men. i am married for 14 mnths but fear my husband is chatting withsome women?



i had a good job, doing well in my career and nice lifestyle. my husband had shifted from another town for better prospects and wanted to start something new. we got married inbetween as he and his family was in a hurry. my husband was doing no work and said he wanted to start a new business and needed sometimeto start a nw life. i decided suportting him.



After marraige i started seeing my husband at home and always being on the net, either adding new friends, chatting  with  strangers especially girls. he also would recieve text of girls, one such stating 'he was her world'. after questioning my husband he said it was just girl after him and he had no such relationship with her. after which i would check him but found he had no such contacts with the girl. it was only before marraige he was in touch with her, but this was also the period when we were courting each other.



After marriage i started being irregular to office due to house commitments and my husband wanted me to leave my job and move to a new country.  We shifted to uk after 9 months of marraige.
we planned to move to canada and start a new life but formalities took time and we moved to london where i joined business school. i thought life would be better and my husband would settle down and mend his ways.
Outhere i recently saw him on messeanger with a new id and he had girls 15 years younger on it. to be honest i have not seen him chatting but yes he has added them to his contact list. further he has many phone numbers stating it is cheaper to call his hime country and user email ids. i have also seen in the net history some sites like adult friend finders, married and looking, and other sites.i have seen him exchanging mails with a girl who had advertised for company.



my husband who has not worked till now is suddenly looking for jobs outside london. he says he can earn as a care worker and getting free stay and would visit me in weekly holidays.



should i trust my husband ? wat shud i do? am i being too suspicious.
i am student in this country, how do i check whether my husband is being true. can somebody give me a better view.

Sorry honey, but it really does sound like your man, if he hasn't actually done the deed yet, is certainly thinking about it. Why would he have girls on his msn especially ones so much younger than him. As a new husband yo 2 should be enjoying your time together, not him online for the majority of it.



Why would he be on a site called married and looking if he wasn't prepared to cheat, as I believe from the sounds of it that that is what the site is, married people looking for other married people so they can have sex together wthout their partnrs knowing. I would take care when having sex with him as he may not alwys be using contraception if he is cheating, and you do not want to catch any STD's he has or could have picked up, never mind fall pregnant when he is acting so irresponsibly around other women and the internet.



As for him suddenly finding jobs outside of london, that sound suspicious. He can get a job as a care worker in London adn it would be better paid so I would question that.



I think you have to sit him down, explain your fears, worries and thoughts to him. Tell him that you expectcommitment fromm the man you married and moved country with.That youu haven't let your dreams go but it seems that he has.



That you wont stand for him working away from home so early into the marriage.



Be firm, tell him you are his wife, and as such his equal partner, either he change his ways or change his wife as you wont be anybodies doormat.



Good luck.

I'm alone this Christmas for the first time....?



I've been divorced for a year now, but last Christmas the X and I spent it with my son and her family. Her family still stays in contact with me to this day. I'm invited often to a get together regardless of the divorce. I was always a gentleman and helped with anything I could. But this Christmas she is heading to south Texas with my son and all the family members to a Grandparents house. This will be the first Christmas I have spent alone for as far back as I can remember. My Dad will be in Phoenix...My brother with his family in Georgia. Sooooo...any other divorcee had to spend a major holiday alone? I'm thinking a trip to Mexico.....or New York City......Any ideas??

I remember the first christmas I had to spend alone after my divorce, from a huge family gathering (we already had five kids plus his two) to no one. I was lost and depressed. What I did was to start volunteering whenever I had a holiday to spend alone, I figured that since I got depressed even the kids would be home soon, how much more depressing for those who were just alone in life. This has made the holidays better for me over all, and for my kids. The spirit of true giving is now very alive for us.



Did you know that there are actually children out there that have no one to share the holidays with? More than you might think. How much better to help one of them not be alone, than to go on a trip. Think about it. You make a huge difference in the world.

Alone isn't a bad thing, trust me.  I got a tree and dumped a lot into XMAS last year for my wife and her kids.  She even told me what to buy her for a present.  She took the tree, all the gifts, and left to be with someone else and I got left the bill.

Actually it's not always that bad, unless you are alone every year. I've been away from my family for more than 4 yrs now, and it's hard especially during the major holidays & festivals. I m from India, but staying in US now.......and my ENTIRE family's in India.



But I have made some great friends here and try to celebrate whatever little I could. I also love to travel, and have taken trips all alone by myself. People raise their brows, (with a young girl travelling alone), but let me tell u that travelling alone is a hell lotta fun, and it also gives a very different perspective on ur own self. So don't even THINK about brooding, pack a few clothes, and start with a little road-trip to a nearby place. If nothing else, just get cozy home alone or invite a couple friends who r on the same boat as u. It'll be fun!

What do women do with male strippers at private batchelorette parties?



I caught wind of what my wife and her friends did with a black male stripper at her friends batchelorette party. Do most women carry on like this in the situation? I heard that women got in line on their knees.



Should I just let it be water under the bridge since I know what us men do at batchelor parties. Should I just chalk it up as a one time deal at a batchelor party and let it slide?

You may be giving this whole event way too much credit.  The stripper I had at a birthday party - took his clothes off and grinded on everyone -we giggled a lot and got drunk - he got a few smacks on the behind but that was about it.  He was very sweet and hung out with us afterward.  I don't know what you're doing but it supposed to be funny - not prostitution.

even having sex im so angry that he wont have a vasectomy and i have to worry about birth control



i just feel so mad with him all the time, i dont feel  happy in love [i do love him ofcourse].. but i feel there is no romance at all,, i dont have those happy loving moments anymore,, everythings gone stale, and the more my mind thinks and hears stories and reads questions i just feel further apart from him,, seems like everyone has a partner that helps cook, clean, is romantic, changes nappies, feeds the babies, has patience
mine seems to b lacking in everything and theres no way of changing him now,, hes stubborn and old fashioned



even though he knows i feel this way lately [i have brought it up] it dosent help,, im taken for granted and ive had enough

Hi there,



Sorry to hear you are feeling te way you are and not unsurprisingly either.



you may not be able to change your man, certainly not overnight, but you can sit down with him and talk. Explain without raging at him, or without putting him down just how you feel. That you feel that you have both allowed the marriage to become stale and that if you want another 14+ years together then you are BOTH gonna have to work at it. Tell him these things, also that you want more help around the place, say, I don't suddenly expect you to do everything around the home, but I would like to see you contribute, especially at weekends, pick up a duster, vacuum the floors, change the baby occasionally, just do thing that show me how much you do CARE about me and respect me. If you can't say these things to him, put them in a letter. Give him the letter and then leave the room whilst he reads it. Give him 30 Min's ot think then go back in, if he hasn't come to find you first.



Sometimes men, just forget, an once they have got away with this sort of behaviour for such a long time they don't realise that their woman feels any animosity towards them or thinks there is anything wrong.



your only way forward is by letting him know othrwise it is, one day soon all going to come out in a huge row and you wil end up hatingyour husband for something he isn't even aware of.



At first he may think you are not serious, then it is up to you to make him realise that you are. If he is still in love with you he will try to change, if he is a sexist pig who doesn't want to change then ultimately you have to choose to stay with this man or to move on so that you can both find what you need.



Good luck

Come on - remember these answers follow people around and spouses often read them - that makes them 100% BULLSHIT.



If they are true, every guy here has a 13 inch pecker, screws 20 or 30 new women a night, makes $750,000 a week, has a private jet, and is being blown AS WE SPEAK by one of the Yahoo Nymphos, who are  also completely full of bullshit.



But yeah, your guy sounds like a loser. Why do you keep having more kids with him? He keeps treating you shitty and you keep taking it right up the old tailpipe.  Hmmmm. Ponder *that* gem over the weekend.



By the way - that whole "give him a letter and let him read it" crap isn't going to work, either. That's how a CHICK thinks, not a man. Haven't you already talked until you are blue in the face? And what changes happened? Exactly. Zero.



He's the type of guy who doesn't give two donkey shits what you think, but he will be motivated by a complete lack of p*ssy. Guaranteed.

Hit the old 'speed bump' of life I see. Yeah...we all get that way at one time or another in our marriage. I've been married 25 years and there have been days that I'm really angry with my wife to the point I'm on the verge of walking out. She caters to her 92 year old father who lives with us. yet she despises him at times because he can be such a pain in the azz. So rather than raise hell with him I can come walking through the door from work and immediately catch backlash from her. She especially slams me for something petty ante and inconsequential.
I do all the cooking, I do laundry and clean the house. She spends the majority of her time either at home with her father or with the grandkids and her kids while I watch the old man. So yeah....I understand your resentment lady. Oh boy do I.



I don't know just what advise to offer because quite frankly I'm trying to work out a solution on my end to reach a satisfactory conclusion with the dilema I have. Talking to her is a waste of time. She will stop for a very short period of time and then start right up again. in addition she's the one who wanted the old man here...not me. I just agreed to it because how can you say "no' when she's crying about the guy saying she'll never see him again. now she can't wait for the guy to kick the bucket. And I can tell you this....he isn't going anywhere anytime soon by the looks of things.



So you'll adjust and this will pass. but it'll be back. It never goes away. When i come up with a solution I'll look you up and pass it on. maybe it'll help.



Good luck...chin up. Things can always become worse.



Although just how I can't say.

You have only just realised you are being taken for granted. So he may well be in the same boat. POSITIVE is your key. the more enlightened you get, the more you look into your needs(not wants) the sooner you will resolve this. This is brand new training and may be trial and error, at 1st. Don't cast a negitive light on your hubby. You will only feel TOXIC and so will he.



(As you helped train him, to treat you like this, unwittingly) Retrain him...and yourself, into what you and he need together now. you are NOT the same as you were. RESPECT for one another will get you through this. Even if later,you need to leave- leave in respect. It will aid you. Who needs resentment. Baby steps X

Would he contemplate going to therapy??? Does he know EXACTLY how you feel or just that you hate that he doesnt help? Does he know that the fact that he takes you for granted turns you off him? that you arent as inlove with him as you should be? that you have had enough? have you brought up the "d" word?



I will tell you what i would do.....organise with a friend  to spend the weekend at their house and when he walking the door on a friday night have your suitcase packed and tell him you need a break and walk out....its scary i know (and maybe a little unfair on your kids but not in the long run) because you will either find out he is really a heartless so and so that cares only about his well being or it could save your relationship BUT if you want this fixed you have to take drastic steps.....i dont have 4 kids but i did have an as#hole for a hubby and i walked out we were apart for 3 months and he realised he couldnt live without me and we have been happy ever since (this was 5 years ago) so i always recommend drastic step. You only live once and your dont deserve to live unhappily........good luck xxxxxxxx

Ok sweetie, you are in your l4th year! congrats.  Marriage goes through ups and downs and lulls and twists and turns. Hang on! It will be worth it.  Take a nice warm bubble bath.  Then tell him you want to challenge him to a date night twice a month.  THe first one is yours to plan and the second one is his to plan.  You have to enthusiasticly do whatever the spouse plans and seriously enjoy it.  If he takes you shooting or to a football game enjoy it.  Try to make it better each time, you are competing to see who can come up with the best date night.  And dont compare to other people.  I had a friend that did that. SHe said her husband never brought her roses.  And she stewed over it and got to the point she was fuming mad ready to leave!  Then she realized something.  He didnt check the miles on her car or tell her how to raise the kids or argue with her about talking to her mom long distance etc.  These were the ways he gave her roses.  The other side of the pasture sometimes looks greener but isnt always.  You have created this marriage by your expectations and goals etc.  ITs not to late to change though.

My advice is to be specific when telling him what you need.  Saying you feel unappreciated and need help is going to go over his head.  You tell him flat out - the baby is messy, go change his diaper.  I cooked dinner, you need to clear the table.  The trash can is full, take it out.



Just saying you "need help" doesn't tell him what he's supposed to do.  I know you think he's an adult with eyes who can see when the laundry is piled up or the floor needs to be swept, but men don't always notice those things.  And I know we women often think something "doesn't count" if we have to tell him what we want.  You have to let go of that thinking though.  If he's willing to do what you ask then be grateful that he is willing to do the work.  Don't knock the fact that it wasn't his idea.



Also be sure not to criticize.  A lot of men claim they don't help because their wife just complains that they do it wrong.  So what if he doesn't fold the towels the same way you do.  Or if he loads the dishwasher differently.  Even childcare can be different provided he's not actually endangering the children.



Also - I have 5 children and my husband never once cried while I was in labor.  And he rarely cooks or cleans unless I tell him specifically what I want done.  But he's very willing to do just about anything I ask of him and I appreciate that about him.



Oh, and about birth control - don't do it if you don't want to.  I told my husband that I had to give birth to all those babies, the LEAST he could do is be the one to get "fixed."  I told him after our last baby (I would have had more but he said he was done) that I was absolutely not going on hormonal birth control any more.  I hated what it did to me.  Since he was the one more adamant about not having any more kids, he took care of things.  It took a couple of years for him to finally get around to doing anything permanent, but that was his area of responsibility.

Okay I have been married to my husband for 8 yrs we have 3 boys. I carry on a fulltime M-F job, get the boys to school, cook, clean, laundry, get them to usually 5 sports between the 3 of them, get up at 5:45a and my head hits the pillow at night after evreyone else usually about 11p!



What I am trying to say is DO NOT COMPARE YOUR MARRIAGE from what you read on here!!!! I don't know about everyone else but I am pretty straight forward about what goes on in my house and believe me what people see in the real world is what happens behind my closed doors BUT most people show what they want to the world to see and when the door closes it is a whole new story!!!



I love my husband but he is a product of what I have made him. I have taught him that I can do everything without drowning!!!! Maybe this is what you have taught your husband. Right before I go under I exploded on the poor man and he just looks at me like why didn't you say something.  Complaing gets no where with a man they will just tune you out, you need to go to him when you are not about to drown and say Hey I really need help with ... today.



If you are the type of person that would rather do it yourself b/c you could have already done it by the time you explained or you would just rather do it yourself to kow it gone right (these both me) then you have probably taught him in the past 14yrs not to ask just stay out of your way.  When I get upset about these things I have to step back and think how I have been approaching the situation prior to me getting mad at my husband. And most of the time I have lead him to believe I do not need help.



sometimes I believe that people on here want that perfect marriage so bad that this is the way they get it through words! You can't believe them always and sureley you can not compare yourself to them.  Marriage is hard and I can gaurntee you that happiness is not 24/7 in there home. Also find those that you think are so perfect and you have been comparing yourself to and look what kind of questions they ask or how they answer other peoples answers most of them live with double edged swords and if they lived the way they give other people answers to live their marriage is going to hell in a hand bag!

Ammm. i donot know from where i should begin but...yes lets put it this way so that it is practical. because if i write the usual emotional bullshit like 'love is like a boat' and 'your the horse shoe that lost its charma', it just...not defined. you hate ur husband(at times) but let us not treat him like a cloud lets treat him like a human (one that has intelligence)



the marriage has gone stale because there is no flux, flux changes as circumstances around u change and since you are changing  the dippers for the last century and a T-REX didn't attack you for your husband to come save you, everything is starting to loose its meaning and perspective...the children are busy in studies and suddenly they dont need you that much...and they start complaining about the food that its not as 'hip' as it once was...u noe, that kind of senario...



i am sorry that i am the one that has to break it for u but i think you need a long holiday. somewhere away from the family. not a vacation just to get everything into perspective. lifes tough and tight and the children need attention but sometimes you need to plan for yourself. the summer holidays is a good time for this when schools are out. let them miss you and let yourself miss them. first it will be fine then you'll feel lonely and then in one week it will become difficult. then youll be yearning to go back to changing the dippers but donot go, let your husband come to you. it is no place for a woman to follow men, the men are there for that. do not make this as a separation make it a 'perspective vacation'.



you husband will not change, it is tough for him but its just that men cant find out whats wrong in the relationship in the first place, and even if they do they would not communicate. he thinks that lifes coming to a stand still as it is for all middle aged men and that the rock star and hero he once was has now gone. Remember, no matter how old or new fashioned you are, the revolution of you life's purpose is around you babies, when the first one's achieving the set target feeling of appreciation can become a feelings of alienation.

Single women sleep with a married man..?



I just want to know how single women justify sleeping with another woman's husband. Do they think if the marriage is already bad it's basically like a divorce? Just give reasons & any personal experience (especially if you're the single woman, the married woman or the man).



I'm not in this situation--And don't give answers like "for the same reason men do it"--- I specifically want to know what goes on in the woman's mind. ---Even if you have to camouflage the people in
experience stories tell it.



Do they think if it's just oral it's okay?

Ex husband wont leave me alone, what to do?



I recently seperated from my husband of 5 years. He moved out and got his own place and Im living in mine. The problem is, he calls me everynight and tells me he misses me and that he is lonely. I feel terrible because he doesnt have any family or friends in the area because we just moved here a year ago. After getting his call of depression I end up going over to his place to keep him company and I end up staying the night. WE ARE NOT HAVING SEX. And he isnt asking for it, but we do end up falling asleep and curled up together. I dont know what to do?? I just want to go on with my life but he makes me feel guilty with the late night calls of loneliness. We didnt want to part as enemys and have made an oath to each other to remain friends. Maybe we shouldnt have done that?

don't pick up his calls. if you have children together, ask that he emails you, ONLY in regards to children. and text messages, insteado f phone calls. that way you have a choice of whether or not you want to respond, based on what he's writing.



you don't have to answer the phone. in fact, stop feeling bad for him adn start living your life.



ps. you're not his counselor. and you shouldnt feel responsible for HIS behaviors. he is in charge of his life, not you.

If you care about him enough to feel guilty when he's lonely, maybe you belong together.  I must also take exception to you calling him your "ex" husband.  He is your husband.  Furthermore, you made a vow "until death do you part".  It's time to stop playing this breakup game and get down to some serious hard work on your marriage.

We risk our pride, our self respet and fall crumbling to our knees for our ex.  We are sorry sacks.  But we have all done it. Why?  They were very important to us.  We spent alot of intimate time with them, invested in our relationship with them more than any other, then it broke apart.  You crave each other because of security, habit, predictablilty, you know each other.  Our hopes and dreams were wrapped up in each other.  Those are hard to let go of.



You never said what brought about your seperation.  But you did say you want to move on.  Its nice not to part as enemies.  But you are not sending hiim that message at all by enabling him to hold on to you and hold on to the security of holding you.  Its hard to sleep alone after 5 years.



Only you know if you are sure of not being married to him.  If you are sure that there is nothign left then running to him is unfair...it is such a mixed message.  If there is hope or doubts then please get counseling. IF there is any way you can make it work Its worth fighting for.



Good luck hon, you have some hard decisions to make. Listen to your innner voice and it helps to keep a journal.

I am having the very exact problem with my ex husband. Even though I have now remarried to a wonderful man, my ex husband keeps calling me (mostly at work) and tells me how sad and lonely he is. We are cordial to one another because of the kids, but I too get so depressed after hearing his sob stories, can't help it, it gets me down to the point I even feel so guilty over my own happiness with my new husband. I encourage him to go out and meet others, I try to be supportive and understanding, but nothing has worked. Finally, my husband had to talk to him and asked him to stop calling me. He has stopped calling me at home but continues to call me at work. I find it very hard to be rude to him and yet I feel that I may have to be. So I can understand how you feel. I am in the same predicament as you so I will read what advice others have to give to you. Good luck to you.

Hi Sandy,



You sorta have created the problem by 1) taking his call just because he's lonely, 2) going to his house and 3) staying there the nght.



Honestly, how are you (either of you) going to be able to get on with your lives (if that's what you both truly want) if you keep this up?  Believe me, soon you will be having sex.  It's gonna happen.



If it's OK with both of you, then fine.  Maybe you should examine the reasons for your breakup and determine where to go from here.



Agreeing to remain friends is a nice idea, but if you're really splitting up, it's not very practical.  One of you is going to get mad when the other finds someone else, and how are you going to explain the nightly phone calls?



Good luck either way.  Hope things work out for you.

You shouldn't have made that friendly agreement. Now he's taking advantage of you. You need to restrict his contact by getting a "no contact" order put in place if you already have separation papers in the works.

I'm divorced but this will be his first marrage.  The minister that performed my last ceremony had a rule that you had to do counceling with him first.  But we won't use him.  And I want real counceling.  I know he doesn't want to do this how do I show him that I love him and can't wait to be his wife but I just want to work through some things so our marrage can be better?

Tell him what you just said, why are you trying to beat around the bush.  If you can't even talk to him about something like this, you shouldn't be getting married.  There has to be open communication between both parties.  You have got to be honest and put it on the table.

My husband is very inconsiderate, what would you do?



Ok so for about the 100th time my husband has left the house with MY CAR and not returned from where he was going within a reasonable amount of time. He left at 7:45 to drop our older son off at school, which is literally a 1/2 mile away. Then he was going to drop off a prescription. The pharmacy is probably 1/2 mile away in the other direction. It is now 10:35 and he is not home yet. I am so angry because he has done this time and time again and no matter what i say to him he keeps on doing it. I guarantee you he was browsing in Walmart or some other unimportant thing. I have an appt for which I have to leave soon and he is not here. What would you do?



</question>



<additional details>



I doubt he's cheating. He has my 14 month old with him, whom gets into everything. Besides, according to his mom he has always done this sort of thing.



That's right people, blame me when he's the one who is doing something wrong. If the shoe were on the other foot I bet you'd be singing another tune...He has a car but it is not on the road because he takes a company vehicle to work. Yes, it is my car. It is registered to me and my father gave it to ME.



Conveniently, he always leaves his cell at home when he does this.

I would start to wonder if he really was browsing in walmart.



Seems to me, that no guy is gonna risk the wrath of his wife just to potter about, that there must be more to it. I would think he has a mistress or visits hookers. Sorry but in reality do you really think your husband would be being so inconsiderate just to browse in the shops, especially when it isn't a 1 off, that this keeps happening? Unless he is incredibly selfish and dense that is and if that is the case then again, why do you stick with him.



Maybe he even gets fed up of you nagging, (so does it to pi*s you off)as after all we only have your side of the story here. You come across as a nagging wife who thinks her role in life is more important than his and that everything belongs to you.

Does he have a cell phone?  Call him and tell him to get his butt home.  You say he took "your" car.  Does he have his own car?  Take it to your appt.  If you only have the one car then I would think it belongs to both of you and you should have been very specific when he left and told him you have to be somewhere.  The only other things you can do is to run your own errands and not give him access to the keys

I doubt that his inconsideration (and whatever else he is doing) began recently.  Why did you marry such a dud?  And then you had a child with him - Judge Judy would have some words for you.



Wear the car keys on a chain around your neck or waist,  insist he get a job and use his car to get there.

He does not respect you and he is probably disrespectful
of many people..He is a "user"..
He only respects people he fears..
You need to lay down the law..
Tell him how much this bothers you, that it shows



disrespect and that you are not going to tolerate it any more.
If he does it again you are not going to let him use your car
and that eventually his lack of respect will destroy the marriage.

it sounds like it's an early toilet training problem; doing what he wanted; when; where and how; without having to explain his actions to anyone.
if this is the case, you will need to tell him that you are not going to put up with his inconsiderate behavior, that his parents tolerated.

<question>



Is this a healthy marriage relationship?



My wife doesn’t give me s e x(2 months) and my friends suggest that they should try to persuade her into running a 3 some between my friends and her. My friends also said they will only do this for 500 bucks and if she is good they will give me back 300 dollars for my troubles. They said I have the option to come in after the whole ordeal so I have that trump card to divorce my wife after the incident. I have three outcomes out of this matter.



1. This 3 some will increase her s.e.x drive.
2. I can divorce her for cheating on me.
3. I can still recoup $300 for this experiment.



My friends also want to try to give her the BIG DP “do  uble penet



ration” or gag factor her. I am not sure if I want my friends to do that to my wife but if it is for the greater good of the cause I guess I can let them try to persuade her on that. I could also ask them to reduce the price to $400 instead of the intended $500. Should I charge my friends $400 or $500???  I trust my friend’s judgement and they're two of my best friends and they even offer to have me hide in the closet if I choose to go through this.

Have you tried to have a romantic dinner with candles for your wife, make her feel special??  Do you have any kids??

Are you crazy? Really, are you?  Why would you even let your friends mention doing anything sexual with your wife?  That's sick and I would have beat the hell out of one of my friends and then stopped being their friend.  Why would you even consider your wife sucking your friends off? That's sick.  Behind your back they are looking at you like you're dumb.  Think about it, you're condoning your wife having sex with your friends.  That's sick.

You'd pimp out your wife for $300?  She should never have sex with you again.



And what in the world makes you think a 3-some would increase her sex drive?  Maybe there is something hormonal going on.  Maybe you need to help more around the house and give her a break sometimes so she can rest.  Or maybe you're just a pig and she's totally turned off by you.

No wonder why your wife hates you. Look at the little boy that you are. Conspiring against her like this, so she will have sex with you. You are pathetic. And you are going to pay them to have sex with your wife? Sounds like you are going to end up murdering this woman. Someday.



Even if I wasn't living the nice, good life, it would be a cold day in hell before I ever went through with something like this. There are very good reasons as to why she is not sleeping with you. If you were my husband I wouldn't be sleeping with you either.



Didn't think men like you really existed. And thank god I am living the nice good life. In fact my marriage is fabulous.

Your other question was a lot better than this.



Seriously dude by your mates trying to persuade your wife into having a threeome with them wont make her want sex with you. If anything and she goes along with it, it will tell you that she thinks that sex with you is very boring so needs the added excitement of a 3some to have sex. Also will make her feel like youdo not respect hr and that wont make her want to let you touch her.



on te same note, they are not true friends else why would they be charging you for something they want to do, I.E sleep with your wife. The want to fu*k her senseless and put their cu* in her and you expect to have respect for your wife after she had allowed this to happen? NO.



What you need to do is work out why your wife doesn't want sex, maybe she has a low sex drive, maybe it is because you don't pleasure her and are a selfish lover who only wants to fulfill his needs, maybe she faked orgasm with you in the past. So you need to get a tantric sex dvd sit down with your wife and watch it together, slowly build up passion, respect and love again and when you next take her to bed to make love ask her how she likes to be touched.



From reading the other question it sounds like she has depression and low self esteem, so rather than you pout her down some more why don't you try building up her confidence.



Are you sure you are not just staying with her for her fathers money when the times comes?

Can the thief be able to obtain, withdraw, view my money on a bank savings account. I'm afraid to put my money on a savings account. I already put a fraud alert on my credit through Experian, Equifax and, TransUnion. Im planning to put security freeze for each; but next year I'm going to move from Detroit to Alaska and I'm going to look for a job there in Alaska and make car loan? What can you advise me to do?

WOW!!! You're at the wrong forum but will give you my suggestion or opinion anyway... :)



Since you have reported the incident to these 3 credit bureau (that's how I call them) then I don't see that it would be a problem if you move to Alaska and make a car loan BUT just bear the fact that everytime you make anykind of loan or apply for a credit...YOU ALWAYS have to call either Experian, Equifax or TransUnion to verify your identity before the financial company where you're obtaining a loan can access your personal information and run your credit. You have to bear this procedure for at least 10 years.
Regarding your social security number...my suggestion is go to the nearest Social Security building and ask them what's the best way to do to avoid identity theft by using your social security number.

The worst for me... an affair or physical abuse. Most everything else, you just have to put on your boots and get through the mud. The problem is, most people don't want to get dirty. So, when they see a storm coming, instead of getting their boots on, they just pack up and leave.



If everyone did stick around and tried everything in their power to make it work, there would be a lot less divorces in this world. Of course, it wouldn't take care of them all, but a lot. Most of the divorces today are from people who rushed into marriage, didn't really think about their vows and stuck to "for better".... not "worse"...



I get it, marriage is tough, but the things we work hardest for in life have the greatest rewards. I say, fully get to know someone to decide if you can put up with them for life... Don't rush into it. Because marriage is hard enough by itself, without having to learn what the other person is like at the same time.

If he constantly cheats on you, physical, emotional abuse, falling out of love, no longer happy.



Many people divorce for these reasons. I think a major one is constant cheating, there's really no repairing that.
Same with abuse.
I think couples should try marriage counseling before doing the big D. But everyone has their own opinions on this.

abuse. i would leave about abuse.



if someone is mentally ill and can not longer be trusted (delusions, halluincations, violence). i would get out.



worse to me is someone loses their job. not cheating or abuse or substance/alcohol abuse.



i think people take worse too literally. worse doesnt mean rock bottom and death or STDs or bruises or holes in walls



when your rights are violated in any way,  i would leave and never look back.



everyone deserves to be happy, so if you're miserable in your marraige after several months or years of trying, get out.  life's too short. you made a mistake..we're all human..now move forward.

The determining line is drawn right at the moment when someone takes your self respect for granted for the first time.



Coz, once that happens, all the worst one can think of starts to get real and is not worth staying back to experience.



Simple.

<question>



This may sound crazy, but hear me out on it about marriage?



I think that when two people get married they will be one flesh according to the Bible right?



Isn't possible that also the character of the Husband is laid upon the Wife?



In other words the wife is more likely to pick up on his habits & sayings rather than he picking up on hers?



The wife is a direct reflection of the husband.



Think about this question before you answer it because I have studied this behavior in most married couples and my conclusion is that the wife is more apt to pick up in the husband.



She may even repeat his Witty sayings. Her character becomes entangled with his and he may be looking at himself when his wife speaks and this a serious quote, but I'm sure there is some type of rub off. She may even want to wear his underwear too. She will cling to her husband. She will wear his clothes and his shirts. She will look upon him as her protector and in some cases some times a woman will choose heart over character and that leads to misfortune in the marriage.

I really did think about it as you requested and there is a lot of truth in what you say is the husband does not have a strong character then I don't think this would happen as much if anything the wife might become more "Loud" to make up for her husband who she might feels is lacking. Truthfully I tried the underwear for a while but realized he had hell of a lot of responsibilities and gave them back!

How do military spouses deal?



I love my boyfriend and I knew what to expect when I got together with him, or so I thought with him being in the military. Tonight he was called off to go babysit one of his soldiers because they decided to beat their wife so we had to cancel our plans and might even have to cancel Halloween. It sucks so freakin bad, how do you deal with feeling like your spouses affair? It really feels like he is married to the army and I am the other woman he has to sneak around with... grrr.



</question>



<additional details>



I know he feels really bad about it, he tells me a million times again, and he also tells me that his job comes first, but I wouldn't expect any different.



I try really hard to not harp on him but I know I get a little pissy with him and really fustrated, but I always tell him sorry as soon as I realize how bitchy I am being.



Oh he treats me like a queen no problem with that, it just gets really lonely after my daughter goes to sleep. He deploys in the end of december and depending on who makes it into office he will have at least one more deployment after this one most likely 2 more since he doesn't get out till 2012... and I don't believe in finding "comfort" in someone else just cause I am lonely, I'd rather go wake up my daughter and piss her off to pass some time...lol.



Ladies you have helped alot, I am working on the whole taking it in and digesting it all, I love him to death and I will be damned if the Army gets rid of me...lol.



I will just keep telling myself only 3 more years...lol

for some reason people seem to be really mean when you ask these question. I am an army wife and its hard. You want him all to your self, but his job is a 24/7 job. And there really isn't anything you can do. It does get easier i think when your married than dating, but i have had lots of lonely night. Being an army wife is also a 24/7 job. Our men need us so much. Sometimes we are the only  thing that keeps them going. They have a job that can't just leave they are there to the end, so we have do the same for them. Its hard not to get pissy i know, my husband has been gone for 13months, and my little one is 16months and i get mad that hes not here, but they really have no choice.You need to make lots of good friends that have husbands/boyfriend in the army to, army wife's are the only thing that can get you through it sometimes be careful of the army **** that sleep around while their man is gone.

I understand exactly how you feel, I dated someone in the army for 4 years and had been friends with him since childhood before that.  I hate to say it, because I don't know your boyfriend, but from what I have seen of the soldier family, it will likely not change unless and until he leaves the military, and even then he may be set in that behavior pattern.



My best advice to you is to be true to yourself.  You'll know deep down if you're not being treated well and I hope if it comes to that, you'll find the courage not to make excuses for him to everyone, least of all, yourself.

Really.. you are his mistress.



There's a reason that they say the role of wife is the hardest job in the military. It's going to be hard, a lot - but you need to try to be as understanding as you can. The military is probably all he knows at this point and he was taught to put his job before his personal life.



Support him as much as you can, and remember that he really does love you - even if things don't always go as planned. He may feel as bad about this as you do, so try not to harp on him.



Good luck.

Hi I know exactly what you’re talking about but that’s just the way it is in the military. I’m a Marine Wife going on 6 years. When I went to my first Deployment meeting 5 years ago the meeting started with “Ladies you are now married to the Marine Corp” at first I didn’t understand what he was talking about but it didn’t take long for me to know what he meant.  As time passes by you learn to deal with it. Its not so bad just have patience it’s not worth fighting over something he has no control of. He is Army first and that is the way it will be for as long as he remains in the military.

Is it wrong to feel betrayed by friend who befriends a guy that broke your heart and played you?



After our extremely parting of ways my friend decided to take it upon herself to become my ex's boyfriends friend and emotion advisor.Which in turn changed our relationship as friends because I can no longer trust her not to repeat what I say to her to him and their closeness makes me really hurt. I have tried to talk to her all she say is "he's my friend now and I can't change that" She really doesn't care how this makes me feel and that our friendship is no longer the same.I know this wouldn't bother me if I didn't still love my ex and he loves me. We just need sometime to grow individually. My friend is a factor between the him and I. Our relationship is none of her business and having her be his advise giver pisses me off and she could care less! It's to the point now she knows I'm upset and she's taunting me with little remarks and personal stabs. So I've lost my chance with hime and a friend. She was the one who told me he was no good but she still managed to remain friends with him. We hardly talk anymore because of her.I was there for her when guys played her and when people called her a **** and she stabs me in the back I am Sad!!

That girl is no friend of yours.
It's pretty obvious she wanted him herself or else she wouldn't have been in your business with him as much as she was.



And now that you two broke up, but she's "friends" with him should be the ultimate red flag of her true agenda.



Maybe you need to distance yourself from both of them.
You don't need people like them in your life.

Sounds like she set you up from the beginning, when she told you he was " no good". She wanted him for herself and sounds like she got him. Sorry kid sometimes that is how it happens. Good rule of thumb DO NOT tell your girlfriends what is going on in your romantic relationships, unless it is a dangerous situation. If you start telling them how good he is to you or bad they will think they would be better for him and probably do what she did, and break you up.

Um, I'm a wife, but I'd be upset if my husband wanted to work out with another woman.



No reason for it.  He can work out alone, or he can work out with me.  Not necessary for him to be working out with another woman, period.

Yes.  There is no reason for your wife to want to get into skimpy workout clothes and get all hot and sweaty with another guy unless there is some attraction there.  I'd be very suspicious of this.  It is completely inappropriate for a married woman to behave this way.



If she insists on doing this, you should make it a point to "drop in" on their workout sessions a couple of times a week without notice. Come prepared to join in on the workout.



If there is nothing going on, she shouldn't mind.  If she gets mad (or worse, if she is not there as she claims), it may be time to find a lawyer and set up a seperate bank account...

Donnie, I certainly would not be cool with my old lady working out with another male.  Certainly I trust her and majority of my male buddies.  But fact of matter is that natural attraction is there with familiarity and there would be far too much togetherness for my liking.  Besides we are all aware that when working out most folks sexual intensity increases.  Be honest with your wife and let her know how it makes you feel, and if you also have to let the fellow know then do so there also.  Best of luck.

Eh, I mean, I wouldn't want it to be with another guy... and if it were my boyfriend doing that with another girl I would be hurt.



But I know from my personal self that I need motivation to keep exercising. If I don't have a friend to go with me, then I don't feel like going.



I'd ask her to find a GIRL friend to go with her in stead of a guy.



So I'm sure she isn't trying to hurt you by any means, but I can also see very clearly how  that would hurt you.

How do I deal with my cheating wife?



My wife of 9 years has repeatedly cheated on me for the last 7.  I caught her having a phone/cyber/mail sexual relationship about 6 years ago.  When confronted, she was remorseful, but then I found letters from this guy and others again.  Two years ago, she snuck off to abort what would have been our third child.  Recently, I found she was in love with some Andre Latour from Montreal.  I discovered she was having a long distance relationship with him, as well as a visit three years ago.  She says it was three years ago, yet she was writing love letters and posting explicit pictures to him last week.  I don't know what to do.

Should i trust that she will leave him and stay faithful to me in marriage?



I broke up with the mother of my child because I thought we needed a break. She accepted me back even though she has a very young boyfriend. We love each other very much and want things to work between us. Now the problem is that this boyfriend doesn't want to go even though he knows I'm back and want to get married to my sweetheart. She tells me he is stubborn and doesn't want to go away. i think I need professional help cos I can't sleep at night when I think of the time they spent together in my absence. This is really eating me emotionally and physically. What should i do about this? if there si anyone out there who knows how i can deal with this please help me out, I'm dying here. We are currently staying 500km (360miles) apart because of work

that's something only you can find the answer to,if she really wants him to go then theres no problem he just has to accept it and move on although you have to understand that it will probably be hard for him cause he probably loves her,but she has to stand her ground and get rid so that you can put your mind to rest that shes with you,if shes going to marry you then it must show she loves you so have faith in your realtionship :)

I've been getting the same answer from a lot of people around us, but I doubted since they were her friends as well and might have been "working with her" to gain whatever my untrusting heart might have been thinking of. Now it comes from someone independent of either of us so i believe it now. tx

First off, I would kick his little *** just out of GP. Thats my woman with my child. We have a right to break up and make up as often as we choose. I would have to question her commitment at this point however. You can't blame her for not wanting some assurance after you kicked her to the curb. And thirdly, I agree with the other answer that you should move back in if you really want this to work. You don't want to hear the back door slam every time the front door opens.

The best medicine  for your problem is TRUST.. This is what you must build first because although you love her but you don't trust her because of her exboyfriend then,your relationship will not work. Sometimes love isn't just enough in a relationship it must be with trust. Trust and love are the most important things inorder the relationship continue to grow and strong.

l would say that when you broke up with her...you sent a message of not wanting to be tied down.
She obviously needed some one to fill that void when you walked out.
The best you can do is speak to her or see her when she is alone.
With the new boyfriend around when you are wanting a conversation...will only rile him up all the more.

It does not sound to me that you have a stable relationship. For one, you don't fully trust her. If you don't have trust, then you are only kidding yourself. Your best bet, is to cut the strings and find a new girl friend, but be sure to provide Child Support, or you'll end up loosing your child in the long run too!

Please don't blame her for meeting someone else because it doesn't mean she didn't ove and care for you it was just because it was her way of dealing with it. But I'm sorry it does seem like she is not being 100% straight with this other guy because if someone told you or me or anyone they didn't want to be with you anymore because they're getting back with their ex I wouldn't be waiting around either would anyone. The sad part and most difficult is that your not there to make sure he's not. Your just going to have to tell her she has a week to get him out or you might as well leave it and not get back together, but then when your not there you have no way of knowing that she doesn't still have him around. Maybe it's time to move on, I know it's hard, I've been there, the not eating, sleeping, loosing weight, headaches because your thinking way too much about what she is or isn't doing or has and hasn't done but as much as you might think you will never get over her, you will. I'ts important for you and her to have a good relationship though as friends because of the child, so maybe you two are better apart because together it could end badly and it could take years to build up a stable frienship for your child, or you might never again build one. She's not being very fair, I know your the one that left her but when she accepted you back she was suppose to be leaving the past behind. Goodluck and take care xxxxxxx

Anniversary card, why no 'love' in it?



my husband sent me [he's in the mideast] an anni card and din't write 'love' just his first name, he said the card already had the word love in it. I think he doesn't love me, he always avoids the word sex in our conversations, just talks about $, etc.

A few things are in question here....



First...is he in the mideast temporarily ?  Is he on business or taking care of a family emergency ?  Or is this something like he's with you for six months and there for six months ?



Did he sign his cards to you with "love" in the past and just recently started leaving it out ?  Do you usually use the word "sex" in your conversations or have you had sexually explicit conversations in the past and not recently ?



Although he did send a card to commemorate the event, it does seem strange that he didn't actually write the word "love".



In my experience, if someone has said things or told you things in the past and just stops saying them, then they probably don't feel them.  It sounds like you need better communication, and possibly marriage counseling, and at the very least to be in the same place together so you could address the issue face to face.



If you really love him and have doubts, don't wait to deal with it.  Do your best to find out how things really are and decide how to proceed.



I wish you the best
:-)



PS:  One thing I didn't previously consider:  Is he in the military and stationed there ?  That brings about a whole other order of concerns.  Sometimes soldiers become very depressed, and feel hopeless, and just become numb.  This might explain the void of affection and intimacy.  In any case, you really need to be direct with him.  If he IS in the military, get in touch with anyone you can that's with him there to see if they can give you any insight.

Most men don't like or feel they need to be overly amorous.  I think my husband doesn't sign love, but I know he feels it.
Remember, he's away from you right now, and talking about sex and how he feels might just make him feel more lonely, or remind him of how much he misses you.  Money on the other hand is something he can still help out with from a distance.
Talk to him.  Let him know that your feeling lonely and neglected and you need a little more from him right now.  Tell him you know how hard this is because your going through it too, but you need just a little more from him right now.
Good Luck!

Trying to be supportive of boyfriend and exwife problems...?



My boyfriend and I have been together for a year.  His exwife, however, is the most unkind and uncaring person imaginable.  He never gets to speak to his son and she never allows visitation outside of the custody agreement no matter how convienient he can make it for her.  Now she is being completely impossible for Christmas to be well-rounded and now I might have to spend some of my Christmas adhering to her list of demands.  As supportive as I want to be (and normally I am), it's hard to keep my mouth shut this time about how she's still managing to ruin our lives.  How can I learn to be more supportive during this particularly difficult upcoming Christmas arrangement when I feel as though I, too, am getting the short end of the stick?  Am I being too selfish wanting a smooth holiday season?

If you really care about him, you should do whatever you can to avoid conflict with him seeing his son, but that does not mean "you" have to abide by her rules. As long as you are acting non-interested in the drama I think you can have an awesome Christmas together.

Nothing is ever smooth when you are sharing children.  There isn't much you can do to change her mind.  Your boyfriend just needs to be more assertive when it comes to his rights.  If his custody orders are to strict then he needs to go back and get them changed giving him more time with his son.  My nephew got 50/50 custody of his children and it really works out great for them.  His ex would be very unbending when it came to letting him have the kids for something that wasn't his scheduled days.  He started treating her the same way and then she learned to be a little more lenient.  Get the custody order changed to favor your boyfriend a little more first.
Good Luck

Welcome to the world of dating someone who has a child with a crazy ex! I've been living it for 5 years and let me tell you that it never gets easy. My husband & I dated for 5 years before recently getting married. He has a 10 year old son with his ex-wife and I bite my tongue on a daily basis when it comes to her and her antics. They have shared custody and holidays are always a pain when it comes to working out the schedule for their son. Unfortunately you need to seriously consider if the situation with the ex is something you can live with if you plan to marry this guy someday. I have chosen to be "friends" with my husbands ex since we see each other often for sports events, birthdays, holidays etc. I do it mostly for my husbands sake because she gives him enough sh** as it is, I don't want to add to that by hating her and not being able to be in the same room. Also it's important that the child involved sees all the adults getting along, even if it's all a big front.



You mentioned that she's managed to ruin your lives. I hope your exaggerating because if you feel that way about the situation now, it's not going to get better and you should just get out while you can. I'm sure it's hard on your BF dealing with her and trying to fight for time with his son and it's great that you're supportive, but you & your BF can't allow her to "ruin" your lives. I tell my husband on a daily basis when I think that his ex is calling too much, how I feel about how she acts or things she's said and he listens. He's taken my advice on certain things and not on others. But I stay out of there dealings as much as possible because I would probably go balistic on her if I had a say so. It's worked out well so far and I can honestly say that no matter how difficult she can be when it comes to their son, she will NEVER be in a position to ruin our lives.



It's tough sometimes but your BF's son won't be young forever and as the child gets older hopefully he'll see how his mother treats his dad and how difficult she is about the time they spend together. A father/son bond is special, your BF needs to take full advantage of their time together to build on that and time will take care of the rest. If she's as evil as she sounds, the kid will eventually get it, trust me. As for you, just keep being supportive and stay out of it as much as possible. Yes it sucks that she's making the holidays difficult, but if you're with this man you need to be able to accept the situation he's in or get out if you can't. I hope it all works out for you.

And he works from 10am - 8pm that day ... so there is no option of sending it to our home

Men typically do not like stuff sent to work - especially relationship ooey gooey.  They usually get embarrassed over it and they will get razzed all day long by their colleagues over it.  While women like the attention of a work gift delivery, men most of the time do not.



If you must send something, send cookies - at least he can eat and enjoy them and they are low key - nothing worse then a huge basket of balloons with a big message saying I Love You coming his way in front of his respected co-workers.



Keep it simple -- better yet, have the gift delivered to your house!

I would be thrilled, excited, aroused, ecstatic and much more. Anything that can spice a couple's sex life is good. Many guys would kill for their wives to install a strip pole in the bedroom. At least it's not in the living room. It's in the confinement of your personal space that only you and your wife should go anyway. I give props to your wife. This can only turn out good for the both of you. I don't see any negatives to this situation. Think of it as a fantasy fulfilled!

Are you kidding?



When we were building our house last year I told my wife I could have one installed and rig the install so it slipped in and out of the ceiling with a switch so on one else would know it was there when not in use.



Her response was "Don't you dare, that's disgusting!"



So, I would be thrilled if my woman wanted one installed in the bedroom.  Maybe I need to trade my wife in for a less conservative model - THEN install the pole LOL.

If she is going to keep adding to your zoo, then she needs to have a plan for someone to take them if something happens to her.  Responsiblity is the first order of business.

I know I'm not much help, but how about an alpaca instead? They are much smaller but quite like a llama. They aren't much trouble aside from the usual things you would have with any livestock. There's grazing areas and feed, vet bills. Why does everything have to be so big and extreme? Ask her if she wants a kitten. Maybe you two can come to some happy medium.

Llamas are nasty.  Don't get me wrong I'm a sucker for anything but my friend's neighbor had those growing up & they were just gross.  Maybe they weren't caring for them properly but their hair is so thick & it would get really dusty from being outside.  Plus I remember one of them spitting on me before.  I don't know if it actually spit at me or sneezed but whatever.



I would at least try to steer her towards something else that's easier to take care of.  A chihuahua maybe?

I must admit that I'm a sucker for animals that are domesticated (dogs and cats), and since we live in an in town location in suburbia this would not include exotic animals. Whenever I happen upon a rescue animal that I want to bring home I always ask my husband first and he'll usually tell me it's okay if I take care of it - fair enough. I don't think it's unreasonable to tell your wife the same thing. Good Luck.

If you mean "lost" in a broader sense, like through negligence or not paying attention - well, I've had some traffic tickets, the most serious one being for about $300; it happens to everyone, and it wasn't a big issue between my husband and I, we just paid it and no one lost sleep over it.

Around the house?  No I have not lost money that way.  I am very careful with it.  Same with my husband.



But I do have a story.  When my husband and I were dating, I bought a favorite painting of mine for a good price.  I proceeded to take it to a framery and spend $200 on the frame.  My now husband was absolutely horrified - saying I got ripped off and so forth.  We've been married 3 years now and to this day if I bring it up, it still irks him.  Yet he has gone out and bought a $1,000 digital camera, portable DVD player, video camera...you name it.  I think he is the worse offender.

Can it set a better example for mom to leave dad when the children are girls?



Anyone with a link or site that can help me justify this? My husband and I married for the wrong reasons and some of our times are very difficult and stressful for both us and out girls. We care about each other only because we have the children in common. I have tried to leave before, but he is convinced that we have to force ourselves through this for the good of the girls and because he does not want to lose time with them. He will not leave on his own and fights me every time I try. I am willing to share custody, he is a good father. We just are not truly in love. Is there any way to show him (or myself) proof that I wold set a better example for my girls by showing them that it is OK to move on and let them maintain contact with both of us equally, then to continue having them see the problems we subject the to. As girls, I want them to learn from my example that it is OK to admit a mistake and move on. can anyone direct me to data that confirms what I believe. Our relationship is never going to be what we want it to be or what we would want for them. We are just making it tolerable and the stress is hurting all of us. The oldest will be 8 next year and will soon be forming her ideas on what is appropriate in a relationship. Any help for all of us, Mom, Dad and Kids, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all very much...

Kudos to you for wanting to do the right thing. I spent 10yrs. in a horrible relationship just so my daughter had a father. When I did finally leave I learned that she knew a lot more about the horrible relationship than either of us gave us credit for and I think both she and I are better because of it.



Staying in a loveless relationship can only lead to your daughters accepting the same for themselves when they get older and it's just not worth it.



Your husband doesn't have to agree but you need to do what is best for you and your family. If nothing else you can even get the girls into counseling to help them cope with the initial shock of the break up, but most importantly don't blame each other or your children will only end up blaming themselves.

There is no way in this world that your daughters aren't going to affected by the breakup.  I divorced my adult daughters' father when they were 27 and 29.  The 27 year old still hasn't spoken to me and it's been 3 years.  The eldest daughter was o.k. with the divorce and now tells me that when she was 7 years old she used to wish I would divorce her father 'cause she knew how sad I was.  If the two of you decide to split the blanket then go into divorce counseling and find healthy ways to break the news to your daughters and learn how to make the divorce as amicable as possible for all.  Good luck!

It's not fair that you should stay in an unhappy marriage. It isn't healthy for you or your kids and I am sure they will feel the after effects of that.

Is this for you or for your girls?  Statistically, if you leave your husband, your daughters are more likely to live in poverty; to drop out of school, to engage in sex at an earlier age; to become pregnant while still in their teens; to have problems with drugs and/or alcohol; and to have their own problems with relationships with men. If you date or remarry, your girls will be at increased risk of physical and sexual abuse.



You say the problem is that you are "not in love".  Okay, but can you live in peace with your husband? Does he beat or abuse you or your daughters?  Is he an alcoholic or have other addictions?  Is he unfaithful?



It is popular today to say that your happiness is most important, and that the girls will be better off if you leave him and find someone that will make you happy, but the statistics do not bear that out.  The girls will be better off with a stable 2-parent home.  Get some counseling, and if you can't "fall in love" with him again, at least work out an amicable relationship that allows your girls to have the safety and security of a home with 2 loving and committed parents.  You have time to find the "love of your life" later, after they have grown.  Right ow, your first commitment should be to them, not to yourself.

Little girls learn from watching  their dads about the way a man should treat a woman. And little girls learn whats acceptable from a man by watching mom. So what have you, as a mother taught your daughter? This isn't about him anymore. So from here on out you need to leave him out of this. This is about you doing what is right for you and your children. It takes no genius, or degreed psychologist to figure out this is not healthy for you or your children. I suggest you start making plans to move out. Find a place to live, it it's an apartment, go fill out the application, put down the deposit, and keep your mouth shut about it to everyone. If you can't do that, find a friend, or your parents to stay with, someone who won't run their mouth. You will have to pack up and move while he is gone. Take the children to your mothers or friend, and get out. You can file for divorce without him having to know where you live. He can see his children all he wants. You can drop them off at his house, or have a friend or relative drop them off. You can meet in public places. You will have to sit down with your girls and in an age appropriate way and explain what is going on. You have to get out for your emotion well being and sanity, and for your children. Trust me, staying together for the kids is the worst thing you can do to your children.... Good Luck hun!!!!

I don't know about a site or link to justify what your going through. I went through a bad relationship with my girls dad. We had 3 together. I tried to stay with him just for the sake of them having their father in their life. But I realized that it was just hurting all of us. No one was happy in the house and it was causing everyone to be unhappy. The kids suffered the worst though. My oldest which was 5 at the time, started failing school. My other 2 cried all of the time. When me and their father split up and everything calmed down the kids became alot happier. Just follow your heart and do what you think is best. Your children will suffer because you are.

I don't have any statistical information to direct you to, only my own life experiences.  I have 4 girls and divorced my ex 2.5 years ago.  At the time, I didn't realize how much the girls knew about how bad our relationship was.  I just knew it was bad for me and figured it couldn't be good for the girls to see a relationship like that any longer than they already had.



Now, I think the girls are much stronger for knowing that as a woman you have all the same choices as a man.  You do not have to stay in a relationship that isn't working.  They also have gotten to see first hand that a woman can make everything happen that needs to for a household and a family work (I don't get anything from my ex; I have to pay him alimony).



Best of luck to you!  Peace!!

My husband and I can't decide on these costumes - suggestions? I CAN'T DECIDE. **Easy Points**?



My husband and I were going to go as gansters to my sister's Halloween party - until we found out that four other couples are doing the same. We've narrowed it down to two costumes, but can't decide. We already have them both - for um... play ;0) - so rushing out to buy one isn't an issue, it's just choosing one.



This one is the cop (I think the top is my husband and the bottom is mine)



http://www.spicylingerie.com/cqm6531.htm...

This is the sailor one (top is his and bottom is mine):



http://www.spicylingerie.com/cqm36.html



http://www.spicylingerie.com/53064.html



I can't decide, and my husbands response is "what you want" (very helpful lol). I'm kind of leaning a little towards the police one, since the costume is a little more fit and he looks damn good in it ;0) but let me know what you think!



THANKS



*Also, in case it matters (not sure if it does) my husband is 5'4" and about 110 and I'm 5'7" and 140*



~I realize this isn't your typical husband/wife issue, but I've put the question in other places and haven't gotten any answers~

<additional details>



@ SEEKINGPEACE - my husband originally wanted to go as a "ball and chain" but we he looked like a meatball with legs (he's just to short lol) when he put the costume on and I was laughing to hard - so we decided against it. Here's that costume: http://image.orientaltrading.com/otcimg/...



The costumes are skimpy - well mine will be - because this is an adult party. There aren't kids there and my husband and I with both be fully dressed for trick or treating with the kids (somehow we got talked into being Snow White and A Prince) we choice these costumes because we already own them from ....other things.

I'm sorry, but I'm going to be really 'negative' and suggest that you avoid what looks so bloody 'tacky' and, if you are going to dress up, then do so in 'real clothing' and not some cartoon like parody of the characters that you want to portray.



I can't honestly imagine anyone actually wanting to dress in that cheap tat ....But then, that's me and maybe my lack of imagination (as it looks 'tat' I can't see anyone would want to !)

Husband is being suspicious and mean lately...?



I am 23, he is 28 & a doctor, and we have been together for 6 years, married for 2. Lately, he has been having radical mood swings that are unusual for his character b/c he used to be very stable - one moment he'll want to have sex and says he loves me passionately, then an hour later he'll suddenly treat me like I'm at fault, and I'm just a random stranger [blame me, accuse, etc.]. He snaps at me for no reason. Also, a month ago he refused to let me go on his work trip to Lake Tahoe until I forced him to take me. His reason was that he "didn't want to take care of me." What is going on?



Also, he suddenly wants to work out and go on a diet on his own...which he hasn't done before. He has been distancing himself with my family & relatives and often criticize them, also something he never did (always praised them).



I feel like I'm losing my husband. What am I doing wrong? I am smart, independent, loving, and cater to his needs.. I am a pre-law student so jobless at the moment. Is he cheating on me?

I don't think he's cheating. Does he have anything going on at work or is he stressed? I don't know what kinda doctor he is, but maybe seeing some of the stuff in the hospital freaked him out a bit. Call me an optimist, but I know when I get stressed sometimes I lose my cool with a quickness and it always seems I take it out on the ones I love most. Sometime I would go to the Gym just to get away and blow off some steam.

If you think He is cheating on you, most likely he is. And I know this is a stereo type, but most doctors to cheat on their wives, I have a lot of those in my town. I hope he isn't for your sake, but dont just ignore it, you should ask him questions and see how important ya'lls relationship is to him. Getting angry for no reason, or a change in mood is a definite sign of a man cheating.

I've been married for 17 years and my husband has cheated on me twice in the last two years.  He too started sliming down, traveling alot, and being angry saying very horrible things to me.  This is a sure sign that he is cheating on you....listen to what your gut tells you!  Get some evidence...texting...emails...phone records and then get some help with a counselor if you think he might want to stay in the marriage.  One of the biggest mistakes was not making sure we got counseling after the first affair.



I hope he is just stressed and that he isn't cheating, but you are smart and you KNOW him better than anyone.  Protect yourself against possible STD's as well...



So sorry for you sweetie!

I work with doctors in theatre and I know that most of them are under a tremendous amount of pressure on a daily basis. They also start to develop unrealistic god like personas within there own egotistcal mind sets .They become child like and expect to be given exactly what they ask for. Most doctors unfortunately become real assholes and head cases and it is quite likely that he may have developed a relationship with a colleague or nurse. As the saying goes if the person your with often suspects you of having an affair then the chances are; they are! Or he loves you and needs his space.Ask him.

I am not going to jump the gun and say that he is cheating because well...no one knows that answer except for him.
There are other possibilities such as mental illness. The drastic mood swings, changing his mind constantly, being loving one minute and cruel the next, taking up new and strange ventures, etc. can all point to something mentally not right either.

My wife left me Saturday after 12 years. Please advise as it's so painful?



We have a daughter age 11 but I took her for granted far too long. I dissapointed her too many times as a provider and she has been more of the bread winner. She was the perfect wife and I blew it. I didn't execute on my dreams and she needed more stability and no longer views me the same way( understandably) I want her back more than anything. I handled it more maturely than she expected. I thought my great communication was enough and she still craves and doesn't want to lose that. She was afraid she would lose me as a best frind but i told her you deserve that and so do I. She does deserve better and I am determined to be the man she needs me to be. It sounds too late ( she said their is no chance) but their is a 30% chance she is doing this extreme measure to finally change me and she has seen it already as we talk every other day and she even invited me to dinner tonight as friends. I acknoledged the significant wrong doing and told her I understand that she needed to do it. How can I get her back and is giving her space the first step.

30% chance, huh? How sure can you be of that statistic? Really.



Give her the space she has asked for.  If you smother it, you'll ruin it.  Why are you complaining about this on yahoo answers when it is you yourself who know more about your wife and yourself?  You CAN come up with an answer on you own.  You need time as well to figure out the man YOU want to be.  If you change for her, it's not worth it.  If you change for the 3 of you because you want to, then it becomes worthwhile.

you only want her back because you don't have her.  if you got her back you'd turn right back into the man you've always been.  If you couldn't wake up and change after 12 years, you won't now.  Let her go so she can find someone who will treat her and your daughter as they deserve to be treated.  You had your chance and threw it away, now you need to let her find the man you should have been but weren't!

giving her space is the first step. but you should tell her how you feel at this dinner. let her know that you love her and always will and address all the problems, regrets, etc. and say all you can do is let her decide. bblahblah. sometimes, girls need to lose something in order to realize what they had was the best thing they ever had. its like "you dont know what you have until it's gone." just, let her know all your feelings and hope for the best.

I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years.. We have had our ups and downs... What works for me is to show her the change. Trust me dude, i know what your going through. But you need to be committed and not just committed for the first month. Getting her back is going to be the easy part. Making her think that this was the correct decision to come back is the hard part.



Continue to talk to her, but don't pressure her... You have been with her for too long so she must still love you... The Love part is not the problem. You just have to change.

Man it sounds like you definitely on the right track.  The important thing to remember is to not push her to much.  The fact that you are still communicating with her every day is awesome!  Always listen intently.  Don't keep beating yourself up though, try to focus on the future and focus on being a better person,and not who you were.

Do all men look at porn??!?



halo everyone, im new here and the reason i joined is cos i am looking for some advice (and hopefully will be able to give some back!)  i am very happily married to a lovely man and we have one little boy aged 3 whom we both adore.  at the moment we are also trying for another baby.  everything was hunky dorey in my marriage up until yesterday!!



basically i had been out doing a bit of xmas shopping, so i was gone with my son for most of the day.  when i came home we went throught the evening as normal, eating dinner, watching tv etc, the usual stuff until i decided to check my emails.  now my husband doesnt know an awful lot about computers and so he doesnt know that you can google something you've checked already by clicking on the google history button which brings up a list of previous things you have checked besides going through the whole process again, which i did after checking my emails.



when i did this i saw that while i was out my husband had been googling porn websites, i could hardly believe it!!  i dont really know what to think or how to feel, should i be angry and say it to him or should i just let it go?  this has never happened before in the 7 years that we are together and hasnt happened since, this is why it is so shocking to me.  do you think it was just curiosity getting the better of him and he did it just for a bit of a laugh or do you think i should be worried that it could turn into something seedy?  please help i'm not sure what to think and i certainly dont want to lose my husband because of this.

Most men do look at porn sites, its just a habit. Even though it is not a nice thing for girls to know about, its just what they do. If you bring it up it could stirr up an arguement because he might say you've been checking up on him. but maybe just drop it into conversation and say its in the interest of your child?

If hes never done it before + not done it since, I wouldnt worry. Like you say just curiosity getting the better of him.



I would personally go out again all day + see if the same things happen. Basically give him chance to do it again and see if he does.



I doubt its anything though. If its bothering you that much try talking to him about it. I know though that most men do use porn - it doesn't mean hes going to go out and cheat on you or anything.

Yes.  All men, from the age of about 12, look at porn.  If they tell you they don't they are lying.



There are many websites that explain why this phenomenon is perfectly natural.  I'll let you google it and find out on your own.



BTW, just because your guy does this, doesn't mean he doesn't love you or want to be with you.  He does.  Trust me on that one.

Well, wait a little while and after he goes on the computer keep checking what he's been doing on it. Dont make it obvious, as this could spark off an argument. If he keeps looking at it, confront him in a nice way. Maybe he feels like he doesnt get enough private moments with you, or if he really has a problem with it maybe make some videos together? Good luck! x

I would be angry, and you need to make him aware of how you feel.  I have to tell you though, that this most likely is not the first time he's looked at porn.  Maybe the first time he's done it online at your home, but theres no man in this world whos into porn that simply looks at it suddenly one day and thats it.  I understand where your coming from, because it it were me id be furious that my husband were looking at other people.  As his wife, your the only woman he should be looking at.  I dont believe that this is something that would tear apart your marriage, unless you allow it to.  Sometimes, you have to cave into things that you dont agree with.  Personally, with this, there wouldnt be any negotiations.  And it sounds like your alot like me... so i would tell him straight up that this makes you feel bad and degraded and you want him to stop or at least not do it where you will obviously be subjected to finding out.  All guys look at other women, theres nothing we can do to stop them... but you need to lay down your laws with him too.

as you say, you know more about computers than he does, so could you barr any porn by going to security on your internet connection, or tell him you know about it and that you dont like it. otherwise you may have to accept that over 90% of men watch it in one way or another.

All men look at porn, honey.  It's o.k.  Doesn't mean he's cheating on you.  Men get turned on by visual stimuli.  Women get turned on by emotional stimuli.



Men are genetically pre-programmed to desire sex with more than one partner (to sow their seeds far and wide to better increase the odds for survival of his offspring).



Women are genetically pre-programmed to want one mate so as to better provide for and protect herself and her offspring.  Females expend a lot of energy on carrying a baby and childrearing.



You have to look at humans as animals.  We may have iPods and A-bombs, but biologically, we are still just animals with animalistic needs.



You husband is not cheating on you.  Just give him as much sex as he needs, try to keepyour sex life interesting by doing sexy things for him (lingerie, bj's, try new positions, try sex in public places - don't get caught, etc.).  Women have just as much responsibility as a man does to keep the magic alive in the sex department.

i would say that hell no. not all men look at porn it is a sick addiction that needs to be dealt with. as a young man i was curious just like everyone thank god i never had access to pornography. people that get into pornography are addicts plain and simple. it is a powerful and sick addiction that leads to mental and sexual desires that are very unhealthy. i would ask him about it and then ask him to stop. if the problem persists ask him to attend counseling.

When I'm low on budget, which is often, I usually just make the person's favorite meal, and favorite cake myself. There is a lot of work that goes into that, can be affordable, and it can be considered a present. :) It's shown to have always been appreciated, every time I've done it. Good luck.

If you don't want to spend much, you'd better celebrate your husband's birthday at home with your family. You should cook the food he like. You should buy a birthday cake which is cheap and enough for your family members to enjoy. You should blow some balloons and hang them up on the ceiling or on the wall of your living room. I think that doesn't cost you much. I am sure your husband will love that kind of birthday party. For a birthday present, you should give him your home-made suit or hat which is made by yourself. The important thing is you shouldn't let your and your husband's friends know that you are celebrating your husband's birthday party at home. If they know about it, I am sure they would love to come to.

No...there is no exact number.Just depends on the person.For example if the person is easly swept off his or her feet and falls in love quick then probally more then once for that person. It doesnt matter in what country and stuff.I know true love is hard to find though.People fall in and out of puppy love all the time though.Im in love right now and have been for the past 3 years and i cant see myself loving anyone else.Ive only loved once.

That is different from person to person. Some fall in love once or twice in their life time while others fall in love many, many times. Some unfortunate others may never fall in love which I think is the worse scenario since they will never know the beauty and joy of being in love with somebody and the pleasures it brings. But on the other side, they never have to deal with a broken heart either.

There is no answer to that...it differs for everyone...and, there can be different feelings with the different loves you have. I know when I've been in love, by the certain fact, that I still love those people today...if I've ever said I loved someone, and think now, what the hell was I thinking, I know it was just lust....so, I guess, so far, I've been in love....hmmm.....three times, and I'm 26.

That  just depends on the person.... I have always been a one woman kind of a man and if I dated a girl one time, boom! she was my girl. The thing is that I thought I was in love a couple of times... and then when I met the woman that would become my wife I realized that what I had felt for other women I had relationships with was a a combination of lust and like... not love. I saw my wife and that was it... love at first sight.... it took me a year to convince her too... but I knew right away that this one.... she was the one.  Nine great years of marriage later and I am still the luckiest guy on the face of the earth.



There are a lot of people out there that are in serious "like" relationships... and some people even settle for "like"... but love, love is rare... especially when the one you love love's you back.

I think it doesn't differ from country to country. It's a gift to the whole human race. But u can love only once. I mean the real one. U might be attracted to someone in any ways. but that is not love. and love has a limit. here is how. I don't hate any stranger walking beside me but I don't think I'll will to be beaten for him/her. I love my brothers but I don't think I will die for them. I love my mother but I can't wake from death for her, coz my love is not as deep as Jesus's. To come to the point the ultimate love u can give and take will come once and only once.

I am not sure. Some people fall in love several times in their lives. But, that's because they are not being able to find true love. Some people who fall in love once and never fall in love with any others can be considered that they had found their true love. No matter a person fall in love many times, the important factor is to find true love.

My husband got home late from work the other night ( which happens sometimes)................ so lastnight while watching Deal or No Deal i started to tell him about the game he missed the previous night that he got home late......... while i was explaining to him how the game went he said "yes i know , willie told me" ... (willie is the guy he shares a ride to work with).............. so i said, how would he have seen it if you were working late ?????
He just said " erm, erm, (paused for a bit while i stared at him and then said.. " i don't know"..
Then he got angry with me and said i was looking at him as if i had just caught him out at something.



What would you think ?????  Would your first thought be one of suspicion ????

some time guys don't want to talk so they just say anything to stop the conversation, i don't think willie told him anything about the movie, but i doubt he's actually cheating either. yeah i would initially think he was out for a drink or whatever but not having sex, not everything is about sex.

you probably have joint custody and you can do watever you want with your child. Living together or apart means nothing, that is your child even if you live on the moon. you need to assert your right of visitation!!
Child support is different. Next time you have the child, have him tested.

All the songs have been written and all the questions have been asked.  I think most people are just too lazy to search for their question in Yahoo Answers (or anywhere else on the internet).  The magic of this place is that you can save time, ask the same question for the 10000th time, and there's going to be people who answer you.  Heck, I'll bet your frustration has been expressed before on Yahoo Answers and someone else has written an answer just like mine.  Did you search for it? *grin*

Just like we are tired of hearing your broken record about how bad marriage is and how people who are happily married are just fooling themselves... Just because you can't stand to be married. Or I should say your ex wife couldn't stand to be married to you, doesn't mean others don't have success where you failed.

I'm not sure about the laws in your state, but usually when its turned over to child support enforcement they will put a hold on any refund she receives via IRS and you will receive it as payment. I can't understand if she has a high paying job how she could get by with only having to pay 378 for 2 children per month anyway! Best of luck to you and your children.

<answer>



Private attorneys bring much faster results than public child support enforcement agencies, but who has the financial means to afford one. Many years ago, I was in a very similar situation. I did not have the money to hire a private attorney, but I was determined to bug the child support agency VERY frequently by either calling them inquiring about the case or even dropping by. They actually got their butts in gear and a few months later they enforced an incoming withholding order and my sons father's wages were garnished.



By the way, the amount your ex pays (or should pay) is a joke, right? I hope the 378 $ is just for one child and that's even low especially since life in CA is very expensive. I don't know if the judge ordered your ex to pay such a low amount of child support or if you guys agreed on this. You can always take your ex back to court as soon as you find out she has a better paying job or her income has increased due to a promotion etc. Since she has a job with great benefits perhaps your children can get medical insurance with their mother. In case you didn't know this in some states the parent even has to continue to pay child support when their child/ren go to college.



Also, when you call the child support agency to inquire about the case ask them what their next step will be and how much time this will take. If they tell you the next step will take approx. three weeks call them back ASAP if you don't hear from them after that time. Your ex will accumulate a lot of arrerages which she will have to pay back one day I know this fact doesn't help you now though.



Be persistent and never give up. I truly wish you and your daughters the best of luck. With your girls being Teenagers, I am sure they know what an awsome dad they have. It's a shame that so many children have to grow up knowing one of their parent's was/is irresponsible and apparently doesn't make their financial well being a priority.  In my eyes every single parent that is loving and nurturing is a hero. The best of luck to you!

Why is it you don't miss your wife till she's gone?



Last night my wife pulled a good one on me. We had a little spat and she packed her things and left and said she was going to her Mothers, but when I called this morning her mother said she is not there, but she is at a friends house and doesn't want to see me or talk to me.



So all day I paced the floors and finally her Mother came true when I called for the hundreth time and told me my wife has been there the entire time all night and day, they just wanted to get me back for locking her out of the house last night.



It worked pretty darn good, it had me worried.



When my wife came home she gave me a big hug and I told her I love you and I won't ever lock you out of the house again.



It felt so good to hold her that I didn't realize how much I would miss her until she was gone.



So my question is why is it that some married men like myself maybe not all don't miss their wife until she is gone and then they realize they goofed?

All that anger pushes true emotions aside. All that while you're fighting, you're brain is coming up with something to top whatever she just said while your heart is screaming stop. As soon as your anger fades and she's nowhere to be found, you realize whatever just happened doesn't amount to how much you love her and you just want her to come back. Plus, how can you say sorry when you can't find someone?

Regardless of what your fantasy may have been.  The grass is truely NOT greener on the other side.  Maybe this was a good wake up call for you to realize how much SHE really does mean to you and how lucky you are to have HER.  Everyone, and I mean everyone has arguments with their spouse and that is how our relationship w/ our spouse can become stronger.  Next time tell her she can have the bedroom and YOU'LL sleep on the couch.  Be grateful you have someone that LOVES YOU and show HER how much you cherish her.  It's very rare nowadays.

It depends on your religion. Like catholics are not allowed to use any type of birth control because they believe you are rejected God's gift to women.



But I'm just a lot of christians have recreational sex and not just procreational.

Depends on how ridiculously religious they are. Most normal people, though, have sex for pleasure when they're married even if they are religious. Its the sex out of wedlock that's the sin, not sex unless you're making babies.

You should ask this in the "religion" section of YA.



I expect that most religious couples also have a low sex drive or are secretly gay, so having a "reason" not to have sex is quite convenient for them.

<question>



Are all men like this or is just him,?Do i really complain..?



We always argue with my husband becouse i tell him he is not like other men,he used to be better while we were couting but he changed when he married me,.



I always tell him my ex B.f was nice en romantic but he always say i compare him,so what should i do,.



I see other couple happy en nice but him he is just there.



THINGS HE DOES



He never remember my Birthday.
Never kiss me good night
Never kiss me in the morning at least saying goomorning,he just jumps out of bed,
When we meet after work in the evening he just say HI?
Never hugs me maybe by saying goodbye not at the streets not even at home.
No sms during the day to know how one is doing,not even a call even if he is away for work 4a a week,.
Never has time for me ,like we seat en talk,No going out for dinner and when i ask he says everything is in the house so why waste money,
Not even a picnic or Movie.
No suprises flowers or presents.

He want to walk together en he can say lets meet there.
Never hold hands
Not even recalling when we meet,i always remind him everything,last Velentine i was in tears as i see gals at work with presents en flowers en he did nothing .



There is so so much if i start listing ,but i try to buy  him things en he just say thanks ,i am tired  of doing this alone ..and when i talk he say I like to COMPLAIN.

My ex was like this and yes its telling you plain and simple that he doesn't love you anymore and no its not normal. You need to sit down with him and ask him where he is at in the relationship (thats if he will tell you the truth, they usually don't) and go from there. The true answer for me was to move on and start anew and I am so glad I did. Good luck.

You're not complaining. If he doesn't even do anything for Valentines day and worse (your birthday!!!) then anything you say about it CAN'T be complaining because that's screwed up and he screwed you big time and anything you say about it is COMPLETELY fair game. You should leave sometime... sooner than later... unless you can live with being a piece of garbage. Or unless there is something that can open him up.

Is it time for me to leave?



I don't know if I should end my 6 year relationship or not. We argue/bicker/b1tch at each other 95% of the time. (From screaming arguments to little annoyances & nasty comments.) The other 5% isn't like it's really good either - more like neutral. Yes I love him but recently I feel more hatred, annoyance & resentment towards him than any positive emotions.  I feel miserable most of the time & it's usually caused by him:



what he has said, done etc.



Is there any salvaging this? Or should we accept it's never going to get better & go our seperate ways?



We have lived together for 6 years.
Any advice welcomed.

Yes if you are fighting and arguing 95% of the time then let it go and move on. It doesn't sound like a very healthy relationship and if you continue to stay together then you'll just continue to hurt each other more. Everybody deserves happiness and it's out there somewhere, but your not going to find it being together.

Seems that you are both unhappy,May be you could separate and see if that makes you both happy. It does neither of you any good to live in misery, have you heard "Absence makes the heart grow fonder" Give it a try, can't get any worse. You can be apart and not end the relationship , just like a little breather. If you seem to be happier with out each other in your lives then you will know it is for the better. Hopefully the whole six years wasn't all bad , so just remember the good times.

This is a classic case.
Any counsellor will lap it up.
Relationships go through a small crisis at about 3 years, then a major crisis at 6 years and again several small crisis situations between year 15 and 20.
Just stick it out some and see a councillor.

I'm wondering why you are even considering staying in a relationship that your extremely unhappy in, and not getting any of your needs met. I would explain to you boyfriend that you have needs, what they are and if he isn't able to meet those needs, move on. Find someone who will. Just because you have lived together for a long time, doesn't mean that it is right. Remember it takes two to make a relationship or break a relationship. You feel miserable most of the time because you choose to stay in a relationship where your needs are getting met. Take responsibility for yourself and your happiness, make the necessary changes, it is worth it. Good Luck.

Realistically...if you haven't gotten married after 6 years...what is going on? You are in essence...still dating. So what happens if you are still together in 4 years? Are you arguing at each other 98% of the time? How much more of this are you going to take before that limit is reached where it's over. Just reading this it already sounds like it's over, just going through the motions of living together.



And lived together for 6 years...what positives have resulted in your relationship? Probably all negatives, right?



You may love him...now you have to ask yourself...is that love enough to negate the arguments and fighting? You are writing this stuff here for us to read and give advice to help you. Read what you wrote...if someone else wrote this what advice would you give? Look at all the key words...
argue
bicker
screaming
annoyances
nasty
hatred
resentment
miserable



I don't think I need to tell you now what to do. You already gave yourself the advice you wanted to hear. You accept it's never going to get better & go your separate ways. 6 years investment into a relationship that ends in 95% in unhealthy living is a loss you need to cut loose and move on.



Now go on and get your life and your self-esteem back!!

yes, after 2 months that we broke up, we resolved the issues before and told each other never to brought it up again and said sorry as well as got back the trust



Yes it is lasting, because since you did have many issues before. Both of you will understand more each other.

I did once, and I don't think I ever would again. We were separated for about a week, and it didn't work out. You have to ask yourself - this didn't work first time round.. what makes me think it will this time? Maybe I'm wrong, second chances and all that, but in my experience getting back with an ex isn't a good move.
Hope that helped(:

about 15yrs after our divorce my 1st ex and i met up again. i thought about getting back together with her despite my reservations of "they are an ex for a reason"...and she proved my point all too well. she had become, shall we say more than a casual drinker in that time. we shared a pizza that day, a few phone calls a few days later, and she went her way and i stayed on the straight and narrow path.



ya can't go back...and a persons mind never lets them forget what really happened and why they are ex's and not still companions.



good luck and GOD bless.

Because I was in a 20 year marriage, I received flowers many times throughout the years. I thought I appreciated them. Once I got divorced and met my current boyfriend, I guess I never thought about what flowers I really wanted.  I will tell you though, the best flowers I EVER received were hundreds and hundreds of rose petals! I came home one day and the bed was completely covered in beautiful rose petals, candles were lit and soft music was playing.  Sounds like a fairy tale I know but guess what, women want the fairy tale once in their lifetime!

I like any kind of flowers.  It is the thought that counts.  For me, you could stop in the local food store and get a bouquet for $8.99 and I would be happy.  I would actually rather not get expensive roses, because I think they are a waste of money!  If you want to be really thoughtful, get her flowers (any kind) in her favorite color.



If her favorite color is yellow, get daisies, yellow roses and carnations.  Any combination of her favorite color.  It shows that you though about it.

There are two parts to your question. First I dont think you could say that one of the above was worse than the other. Its not a comparison that you can logically work out one way or the other. Neither has to be "worse" in order for them to be abominable and also life changing.
The two things do have something in common, the fact that they involve having sex with someone who isnt your spouse and this is being done secretively.



Neither of these things are acceptable in a marriage. If there was a lover then you could suspect that not only are they having sex but there may well be an emotional attraction there or some type of friendship, and you could also feel assured that he was attracted to the womans looks. Not so with the paid sex, paid sex is annonymous, its just getting off. Theres no involvement or intimacy at all and its hardly about an attraction to the prostitute based on either her looks or personality.
Just ask yourself how this behaviour has made you feel? Can you dewsribe it as making you feel cherished and respected.



I think your husband has irrevocably damaged your relationship, and I also dont think he is the man you may have thought him to be.
He has betrayed you.
He abuses his own sexuality aswell. Being married and having paid sex is like having your cake at home and eating it out aswell. I
To answer your second question I think you should file for divorce and surround yourself with people who will support you through the tough time ahead.
I truly wish you all the best.

You need to get tested immediately for HIV, HPV, Chlamydia, HEP A, B, and C, Herpes, Gonnoreah, and all the others. He needs to go get tested too, and show you the results from the lab, on paper. Don't just take his word for it, you need to actually see the results. You should leave him and not give him any second chances. If you get out of this relationship without having any diseases from it, consider yourself VERY LUCKY and be thankful. Many people aren't so lucky. If you have your health, then you have everything. He is scum, and you need to get him out of your life.



Try to document and keep records of everything he says and does to you. Tape record him. Try to get on tape, him talking about the whores. Take pictures of any upcoming property damage, if it comes to that. You will have the burden of proof later, in divorce court, so you need all the evidence you can possibly get. Can you go live with your parents, immediately?

Talk frankly with him and find out if he is addicted to x or if there's something that you are not doing or he does not like. But he needs to be open to you and tell you the truth so that you can make the best decision about your relationship with your husband.

I don't think it matters, either way he is cheating and you should pack your bags and leave. If he is paying for sex then he is having sex with different women that have who knows what and then he comes home and gets in bed with you. My advise is to leave him and get yourself tested. Good Luck!

How can a married woman lay down with someone to pay their power bill?



My good friend just called me and told me that his friends wife had to do the unthinkable and lay down with someone she knew and he paid off her Georgia power bill to get their service connected.



Her husband is out of work and he should feel real bad, but he doesn't care what she does as long as the power got turned back on.



How would you ladies feel if this was your husband not working and you had to lay down to get your service connected again? + There are no children involved here either.

If my husband wasn't working by choice, he wouldn't be my husband. If he wasn't working because of something unfortunate that has happened to him and he was doing everything he could to make money again, I would do everything necessary to keep us going. Sometimes we face unfortunate choices, but it's not necessarily the end of the world.

alrozz,



I will tell you this much!  If I had to lay down with someone to get my bills paid, then I would have to get that man out of my house.  He is no man to me.  He is a worthless peace of crap that wouldn't even get the opportunitiy to even use the electric if I was her.  No job or not, if he expects his wife to stoop to that level, then he needs to get out of the house.  She would be better off without him.  Actually she wouldn't have to suffer as much because that would elimnate probley most of her bills getting him out.  One less to feed, one less to clean up after, one less to use electric on her, one less to use gas, one less to upset her and force her to do humiliating things to get the bills paid.  If she has to do it she my as well have that man as her sugar daddy!  and just be having sex with that person then.  She shouldn't be taking care of a man then have to do other men because he don't work.



I understand what it is like to have a man who can't seem to find a job.  My husband went 1 year without a job.  He wouldn't ever stoop to the level of letting or wanting me to sleep with another man to pay our bills.  He would not allow that to happen.  He would sale everything he owned to keep that from happening!  Of coures my man is a real man though.  Her's isn't!!!!!!!



I am sorry to hear about this.  I really feel sorry for her!  Talk to her and tell her to get rid of her man!  It isn't worth having him there since she has to go that route!

Certain hormones in women are higher during menstruation (periods) and this can lead to being more turned on. Some women are opposite because they get a lot of crappy symptoms like bloating, headache, fatigue, cramps, stiff joints, anxiety, etc. You can't get any other infection that you couldn't get not using a condom. There's nothing new there. A condom always protects.

Firstly, there is no greater risk of infection during the menstrual cycle as out of it.



Secondly orgasms during this time can relieve cramping, bloating and other PMS symptoms. Some women say that they are more intense, because of the period.
Thirdly the chances of getting pregnant are minimal as there's nothing for a fertilized egg (if there could even be one) to implant into, that's what's being shed at this time.
Next time ask HER why she finds it so good.

How many advice givers?



Just wondering how many on her truly follow the old adage  " Practice what you preach." I enjoy sitting here in the evening reading and giving my worldly advice to others. And then at times i recollect the advice i gave someone else. It's sure truly easier to give someone else advice on how to handle there affairs but it's twice as hard to follow them out in your own relationship at times. With this said id like to give my top three difficult topics in a marriage..



Starting with number three.. Difficulty in raising a child. It is so hard at times to get on the same page with your spouse  on the proper way to discipline your child. And even harder when it's a step child.



Moving on to number two... Dealing with family members.



Number one: communication... This has to top all lists. Being able to express something that really is bothering you has to be the hardest thing to do. Showering your spouse with compliments that makes them feel good is easy. But when the tide is turned and something you say is going to cause a confrontation that has to be the hardest thing to get out.

The hardest thing to give out ? HUMMMMMMMMMM



I would say the hardest thing to give out is when you give your love it is condemmened to be taken as wrong or bad or misunderstood then you are left with a bitter narcisstic person who hates you . Thats when its time to go.  Sometimes, often than not this happens because the narsistic person has another who is waiting in the wings{b/c of n affair} and doesn't have the maturity to tell the person they are suppose to trust w/  thier life , {the spouse} THEY WANT OUT!!  Its sad but true . It takes real maturity to raise a child alone and it takes real maturity to love another like you love yourself .  It takes work and communication and desire so when that is gone its time to move on . Its like someone hanging up on you when you are talking ... Its no respect is it ? As far as family members go , FAMILY sticks together , They don't pretend you don't count . That is a family!

seriously.  That happens to all kinds of men. I feel your pain brother.  IF your wife is on birth control have her stop. Maybe she is depressed or something.  Did it just happen out of no were or has it come on slowly.  My wife and I have been married 6 years from day one she was on birth control we have now had 2 kids and she stopped taking birth control.  We dated for 4 years before we got married and it was like this.  First 4 years sex on average of 2-3 times per week some times 2 times in one day used condoms.  married and on birth control sex 1 time every 1-2 months on average we just thought it was moving in together and stress and going back to college and stuff.  Even changed birth contol to no avail.  Then after 2nd kid my wife did not go back on birth control and we went back to condoms now back to sex 2 times per week give or take.  See what has changed if she still loves you and does not want to leave you and wants to have sex mentally but is not in the mood physically then it can probably be helped with therapy and change in or addition of or removal of medication.

This question comes up so frequently here. Yes it is normal for the frequency and passion level to drop after so many years. The question is do both of you have the interest to do what it takes to keep the sexual aspect of your marriage alive. In so many cases other areas of life will take priority. What you need to do is sit down with your wife and let her know how you feel. There are many ways to approach this problem. Being in the life style we have discussed this same issue with many couples who hit the same barrier. If you would like a few words from couples who have been there just drop me some mail..

Truthfully it does fizzle but then my friend you just have to put more in to get the spark back try different things, phone her more often at work, touch her differently, give her a little touch when she doesn't expect it, etc. All guys ask this question but another one to ask yourself would be honestly sit and think about what you use to do in the relationship in terms of the things I have mentioned above and no longer do bring the romance back!

Sometimes that can happen. Women need passion and romance. Are you romancing your wife? Think about your sex life, is it just at night before you fall asleep? Spice it up. Maybe a weekend getaway, hugs and kisses throughout the day, a quick call to say I'm thinking about you and I miss you, flowers, erotic massage. Let her know that you value her and appreciate her. Making love to a woman involves more than just the act of sex. She needs to feel loved all the time. I'm sure she still has the need, it is just buried right now. So use your imagination and dig it up. Change up your routine. Good Luck.

But we do make an effort to keep things a little interesting. sometimes he asks me out on a date, sometimes I run him a bath then wash his back, etc etc. We go out for a meal once a month. The main thing to remember is that foreplay is an all day thing for a woman, a hand on her back, brushing the hair out of her face, a special look. good luck, I'm just off to give my man a back rub

This is what happens when you don't listen or want or try to be together . This is what happens when you ignore a woman's relationship . This is why there is so much cheating and divorce .  This is what happens in ANY relationship where 2 people love each other . One needs to NURTURE a relationship that you love ....always! One needs to truly love the other like they love them self or the feelings go away.

Why is my wife so upset about my ex-girlfriend?



Since I got married, I told my ex-girlfriend (first love) that I didn't want to continue communicating with her. She is also married with a child, and we had been talking once in a while as friends. Since then, she has texted/called/emailed once in a while to say congrats on our marriage, child, etc. I have ignored all of her attempts to make contact, until last week when she called and I answered. We had a 60 second conversation, but my wife got mad because I answered her phone call. I have no intentions of cheating on my wife, and I don't even want to continue talking with me ex, she just keeps contacting me! Am I the bad guy?

How did you get involved with someone so insecure?  It's not your fault, you've cut ties..  Look into better communication or you might find that you need professional help in the form of counseling..

your wife is obviously self conscious and paranoid about this woman.  Does she do it will all women are just this women.  There has probably been pattern of emails, texts, calls letters and meetings but since you have no interest in her they mean nothing to you but to your wife who sees them as lots of contact with a past love the little things all add up to more in her mind.  The first thing I would guess is one of you cheated in the past and/or she has been cheated on several times.  If she is just like this with your ex and no all women then just dont talk to your ex. who matters more to you the ex or the wife. If the ex calls hang up on her, if she texts delete it, if she emails tell your wife and delete it without responding in a month or 2 she will never bother you again.

You're wrong for talking to her..



Do you want your wife talking to her old BF when you're at work?



If you keep on doing what you're doing, you are going to have a cheating wife in a few years....

Your wife is being unreasonable here. Just the fact that you were upfront and didn't do this behind her back should show her that this was nothing more then a phone call. She needs to put her insecurities behind her. And in the mean time reinforce to your ex girl that you have no interest in keeping in touch.

Your wife seems very insecure. No, your not the bad guy. Just continue to ignore your ex, hopefully she will get the message and leave you alone. Talk to your wife about her insecurities, I would suggest counseling if not for both of you, at least for her to became a more secure person. Otherwise, this will continue to be a problem in your marriage. Good Luck.

your ex sounds like a stalker. y is she so desperate to contact u? have u been firm with her? perhaps ignoring isn't enough, u have to say explicitly that u do not wan to have anything to do with her. if she calls again, tell her 'I have made myself clear that i DO NOT want to speak with u again', then hang up. continue contacting u? call the police. this is harassment.
an other way is to hurt her ego. tell her she's fat/ugly/smelly. she'll never contact u again. this is the most extreme one. use it only if u have no other choice.
ok, back to your wife. maybe she finds that u're not decisive enough. on one hand u told your ex not to contact u, on the other hand, u still talked to her. maybe she has security issues. anyway, explain to her your intentions n actions. it'll be better if she can hear u tell your ex off.

I don't think it is a case of your wife being insecure it is the fact that it was your first love and I too am a women with a man who really loves me dearly it does not sometimes make me feel insecure it is only because your wife loves you so much that she does not want to take the chance of loosing you.  Your intentions really do sound honorable but your exe's do not so avoidance as you have been doing I think would be a great idea. Well done for the effort so far.

There are some situations where you really have to put yourself in the other's shoes.



a. If your wife continued a relationship / conversation of the same kind with her ex would you feel secure..
b. Is your ex's spouse aware of her continuing conversation with you..
c. Having been close to each other once before there is a possibility that you could reconnect - is there a need to give in to such situations..



d. Meet as families so that there is an openness about the situation. let your wife feel secure about her husband in the presence of your girl friend if necessary.

To make your wife feel more secure next time have her talk to the ex-girlfriend because the ex-girlfriend is just not getting the picture when you tell her. If your wife speak to her with you sitting right there she won't have no more need to feel insecure. It sounds to me like the ex-girlfriend is trying to start trouble in a nice kind of way.

I think YOU ought to try and appreciate how your wife is feeling. I know I don't think I would be too chuffed either if an ex of my hubby phoned him up. The only way this is going to work is if you were to invite this women round to meet your wife so as to put alay her fears.



If your not prepared to do this then do not answer her calls or ask her not to call again.



Nothing to do with your wife's insecurity as has been suggested here.But more to do with the fact that I suspect your a flirt.

well your grandfather could have given his advice in a more civil manner. His concern is your age of course. And if you look at the divorce rates in couples marrying in your age group the number are  scary. I also married at 21 and guess what. I wish you all the best of luck but make sure before you jump into something you may later regret. My suggestion live together for a few years first.

your grandfather is used to the old way of doing things. It's going to take a bit of time for him to get used to the idea. the best things you can do is sit down with him and tell him how much this means to you.



Personally i wouldn't get married at this age - coz i'd want to see the world a bit and wait a bit - BUT it still is your life, don't let other people rule it for you, but sometimes taking peoples advice won't hurt either (that's for the rest of your life not just this situation)



Congratulations on your engagement! But remember to  be patient with your grandfather. Just be sure about your marriage though - if you are sure then go for it!

No you was not wrong for this. Your grandfather could be like mine..VERY OLD SCHOOL. and sometimes he think that everybody have to do what he say because he's always right. I hate to say this but sometimes you have to put your foot down in a nice kind of way, even to your grandfather to make him understand. Then you could say...Granddaddy I still love you but I would like for you to be excepting of my decision and then if things don't work out I want to be able to come run in your arms like when I was a little girl.

I don't think that your grandfather meant anything wrong by telling you that you were not ready go get married. I think he’s wise enough to see if you are ready or not. But to call you stupid because you want to get married that was not ok. But no matter what he said or how he said is not important because the only thing that is important is that your grandfather is telling you that you are ready to be a wife. And maybe you should listen to what he said. Twenty and twenty-one is young to be married. Why do you feel you have to rush? You are still so young and you didn't even give yourself a chance to enjoy life yet. I understand that you will make mistakes and that you want to find out on your own. But marriage is a big step and you don't need to find out now if you made a mistake or not. Give yourself more time with this young man because 20 years old for a man to get married is too young.

Loveless marriage~ dunno what to do..?



Married for 14 years, but in this 2 years, hubby take me for granted.He just think about work ,money and friends. Im just an option. Now im totally out of love,dont hv any feeling for him anymore.



I keep pretending to everybody that im having a happy marriage. But sometime i just want to leave and walk away.



I discussed about this to my husband and he said he will never divorce me no matter what. The reason :



1. He can't live without me



2. He dont want me to be with another guy after divorce.
So i asked him to change and make family as a priority.He changed for a bit (in about 2 month) but now he becomes like before..friends and money is his priority.



He said he dont care if Im alone or dont have any love for him anymore, but dont ask for divorce..bcoz that is the one thing he will never give to me.



Im stuck ! dunno what to do.

And if it's any consolation he has finally turned the other cheek and were all civil now.

Generally people don't change their behavior if they see nothing wrong in it. And he is totally comfortable with himself. So your not going to change him. You could try marriage counseling, but I'm not sure if that will work, because he doesn't believe there is a problem, or if he does think there is one, it is your problem. I would at least suggest it, if he's willing give it a try. Otherwise, it is time for you to move on and find some happiness for yourself. He can make a divorce miserable for you, but he really doesn't have much of a choice if you decide to do that. You are not stuck with him. Ask him why he can't live without you, my guess is that he needs you to complete him as a person. And he will find someone else to do that. Stay strong and Good Luck.

Do you really think of going away from your husband.
Before thinking about yourself, do think about your 4 kids.



Being married is not a path strewn with roses, but a road filled with stones, thorns and somewhere around there is some petals too.
You have to strengthen yourself to undergo this path.



Your husband is not violent, or a bully.
He is telling only what others are telling him.
If you really love your husband then you will surely find a solution to this eternal problem.
There is no miracle solution for this.
One has to adapt according to situation.
Try to analyse where the problem lies, put yourself in your husbands place and try to think like him, then you will surely find out the cause of the problem.



May god give you the strength and guide you to find the right solution.
take care my friend

Leaving your husband would be the biggest mistake you ever made in your whole life. If you just walk out the door, you will lose everything. And you have four kids to think about. You need to talk to your husband. If he's telling you that everyone is telling him to leave you then that means he's telling everyone that you are having problems. I don't know what your problems are but you need to see a lawyer so he or she can guide you in what you need to do. And if your husband wants to leave you then let him but he's going to have to provide for you and your kids. And you need to tell your husband that. But before you do anything you need to find if your husband is willing to work on your marriage. And are you willing to save your marriage and work on it too. And if you are not then see a lawyer. And always remember that the kids come first and now you have to do what is best for them.

It is hard, and it sounds like he is really stressing out, you both have to talk this out, you are really confused and you really do not know what to do, and since you are in a tight spot, your gut instinct is to leave, because people are talking about you.



You have to get to the bottom of this, and find out what is going on, there are children involved, so before you do anything "rash", I would talk to my husband if I were you.



Go to the source, I always say, do not believe what others are saying.



Since there are children involved, you must do everything and anything to get this resolved.

You don't really want to leave him...you want him to leave.  There is no reason to upset your children's lives any more than necessary.  Make an appointment with three different divorce attorneys.  The first hour is usually free and will be sufficient time for you to understand what all your options are.  Keep to the facts, attorneys do not care about your feelings and you will have more time for picking their brains.  When you are done seeing them you will have a full understanding of your potential divorce, how you want to proceed and with which attorney.

It happens so often that people lose interest in sax after being a long time in the relationship. Talk to your wife, tell her how you feel and try to meet half ways - do it not as often as you want but not as little as she wants.



Good Luck,

Talk to her about this, explain how you feel. She may just be bored with it. Spice it up. Women need to feel passion and romance. Are you romancing your wife? Think about your sex life, is it routine? Change things up, a romantic weekend get away, little hugs and kisses through out the day, erotic massage, flowers, helping out with the household chores, quick phone calls to let her know that your thinking about her. Use your imagination. Good Luck.

Have you thought maybe the problem lies in you.



Are you a man who fires in 2 minutes or a marathon runner man in bed?



there are so many things available nowadays.
It depends on the place where you live.  If you are living in a restricted country like in Middle East or Orient etc.,
If you are able to voyage to other countries, try to buy something sensual.
Sex doesn't start and end in bedroom.  It is the culmination, termination of a game played between the two people.
look at sex movies not too much,



Try to talk to her, you must have already done that.
Don't yell or scream at her.  Just be passionate, patient, try to understand her feelings.
Take her out, treat her like an equal partner.  Buy her gifts.



good luck and god bless

Why do women who cheat think they are so special when the man pays extra attention to them?



I have seen this over and over and it is so easy to get a married woman in bed. They feel so special, want to divorce their husbands, and never want to leave you. In fact, all I want to really do is have sex a few times, move on and stay single. If I want a relationship for a long duration, I would never pick a woman in a relationship. Is it because they are starving for attention at home, or they really want a new relationship?

Looks like their husband do not pay too much attention anymore. There is always time in marriage when people are bored and maybe that's the reason? Simply, their husband do not sleep with them as often as they would like.

You should talk to your father in law and maybe to your husband so he can talk to his father. Maybe your father in law feels shy when you are alone together? Try talking to him first and see what he has to say.

Tell him to go away and leave you alone.  It sounds like he is trying to make you feel bad for something, perhaps marrying his son.  Tell this jerk you are not married to him and you don't appreciate his eyeballing you and treating you one way when your husband isn't home, and another way when he is.  If you don't have your own place, go get it.  Your father-in-law is out of line.  Put him in his place.

Your father-in-law could be a very shy person. Ask your husband if he's usually shy with women in general. Then explain to your husband how your father-in-law acts when he's alone with you. Or you can ask your father-in-law if there is something wrong? Ask him if there is something that you are doing that makes him act the way he acts when he's alone with you. But if you are too shy to ask him then let your husband deal with this.

sometimes women just want to other fun things than have sex.. but on the other hand.. being tired.. if she's tired alot.. could she be prego? not to make you worry though.. most of the time women wanting other activities is normal. in fact.. doing something she likes will make her happy making it easier to tell her what you want and she may fulfill your fantasies. just tell her how you feel about the situation. she'll understand.

<question>



Should i be worried about the things my husband is doing?



ok my husband and i have been married a few months and been together for almost 6 years.



that being said he has never cheated on me, that i know of, and i really don't have any proof that he has even been close.



but i just have some gut feelings and he's always denied any kind of cheating. he is not the typical type of guy in the fact that he doesn't go to clubs and pick up on girls, he's not cocky, he's actually very sensitive and loving.



(he does not live near me and didn't at the time of these issues, because he's in the military)



but he has done these things that make me worry...
1. went horse back riding for a couple of hours with his good friend's girlfriend.
2. danced with another girl on one of the few occasions that he did go out clubbing (and was drunk)
3. always has an excuse for where he's been. he's supposed to get off work at 3:00 but doesn't get home until 6 or 7 and says that his boss made him stay late.
4. he had a "friend" who became obsessed with him, he would take her home and give her his jacket when it was cold, and they'd go out and things of that nature. she definitely knew about me because he would be on the phone with me and say "i love you sara".
5. said this about his good friends girlfriend "what if she cheated on you with me", talking to his good friend about her.



should i be worried or am i just being rediculous?



</question>



<additional details>



we were only dating when these things happened with the exception of the working late thing. but as far as that goes i know he's not having sex with anyone at work because he's in the military.



and as far as cheating on me goes, it would be a big risk for him because being married in the miliary, infidelity can cause a dishonorable discharge.



Yes! An extender!- you must know him because you are completely right!



THANK YOU!

If I were you, I know I'd be worried.



Personally, it seems as though you're very passive about this, or you just don't want to make a "big deal" about seemingly nothing.



I suggest you start establishing the fact that you HAVE noticed these things, show that you aren't ignorant, and let him know how acceptable you find his actions.  Tell him your stance on cheating, and make sure he knows that his actions are unsettling to you.

All these activities are stealing time from your relationship.  You should be his number one priority.  His hanging out with other women will more than likely eventually lead to him cheating.



4. is especially troubling.  He allowed and fed her obsession...very very wrong.

How many more red flags or warnings do you need?, to me he is up to no good for sure. Check his mobile phone when he is in the shower or asleep to see what number he phones the most and check for text messages as well, as you will need some proof before you come out accusing him of being up to no good. Hope you sort it out, good luck.

I would disagree.  I think my husband sounds like your husband and I know my husband very well.  You need trust in a relationship and you need to ask why you don't trust him.  Why would it be strange if he had to work late?  Many men do.  The fact that he is saying I love you in front of other people, women, is a really good sign and shows he has nothing to hide.  To me, it doesn't really sound like anything to worry about.  When you should start worrying is when he acts differently with you, doesn't want sex etc, hides his phone a lot (so you can't see who is calling or texting), is evasive about where he has been (if he's telling you he is out with a girl then he's not hiding it!), you get strange calls at home, he is suddenly dressing up a lot more / wearing cologne etc / sprucing himself up more than usual.  Things like dancing with another girl aren't red flags.  Some people are too sensitive about that sort of thing...sometimes people need to feel a bit attractive and 'wanted' by the opposite sex even if they have absolutely no desire to cheat.  Its human nature and anyone who tries to stop this in their partner is only going to make them be secretive.  When you've been with someone so long you do forget what its like to be looked at so it does feel nice to know you can still attract someone.  Completely innocent even if some people are unrealistic and think it is not acceptable!  I think you're ok and he isn't cheating.

What would you do or would you want your wife to do?



In 2006 i was stab by my boyfriend of three years. I had to have 10 surgeries to fix what he did to me. It was only one stab. I did nothing to deserve the stab i was putting the sheets on our bed when he attacked me. Now I am married to a different man and i have a hard time showing him affection. The guy that stab me i was a freak n sheets with and would get drunk if the time called for it but i cant seem to do the things that i did back then with my husband. He doesnt know i was once a freak and i would love to show him that side of me but for some reason i cant. Should i go through therapy so i can let loose with my husband. I thought about getting drunk to get me yo do it but everytime i pick the bottle up i cant drink it. I cant have fun with my husband n i think its cause of my past..what would you do or what would you want your wife to do if she had been threw what i went threw..



</question>



<additional details>



I tell my husband everything and he knows its hard for me to be affectionate. He wants me to let loose with him and to be the freak but i just have problems doing that. Like he wanted me to get drunk one night because he had never seen me drunk and I have always been the one to take care of him when he drinks..and once again i just couldnt do it.  I really want to be able to let loose and live a little.  My husband loves me very much and I want to be able to do these things with him.. Im only 21 i cant seem to just let go.

You're a different person with your husband now, and when you are fully able to relax with him, you will be able to have crazy fun with him too. You had a very traumatic experience with your former, and it will take lots of time to heal. Obviously your husband is happy with how you are now, so don't push it. It will happen in time. Good Luck!

I'd want to know.



Marriage is about honesty and feeling that you can confide anything in that one person.  You shouldn't have to hide anything from the person you love.



Have you considered that your husband may be confused about your actions?  He mightn't understand why you're distant with him, and he may even blame himself!



This man married you, so he obviously loves you very much.  He deserves your honesty, and if he married you for who you are now, I doubt he'll change his mind because of someone you were!



Also, remember that marriage isn't all about being close in the bedroom; it's a loving and caring partnership between two people.

Does love die ? is love enough for successful marraige? did i do the right thing? i am in real pain?



well ..may i ask you not to be judgmental .. here is the only place i can relate to my thoughts. i am an educated good looking girl , u can say kind hearted lady who has been feeling lonely for long time then i met this guy .. well you have to know me first , i am against getting involved with married or separated men , as i want to know a guy fall in love which can be end in marriage ..well i am muslim ..in our religion it allows men to marry more than one lady ..but i am different ..in my environment and my family and my social status refuse this CONCEPT



i met this guy i didn't plan to love him or marry him ..we spent hours and hours talkingand laughing ..there were very strong chemistry and great understanding ,, i was drifted away .. i tried to pull back because it is not what i want ,, but i couldn't at the beginning ..
i left him two times he wanted me back ..he and his wife are separated i told him settle your relation with your wife even get a divorce or stay with her but dont involve me
..he wanted me as a second wife which is against everything i believed in and against the person who u r ..we break up .. i deeply love him ..i loved him to the extent i start considering being no. 2 .. but he refused to take me back ,,, as i am very hesitant , and he is not sure i am the right person anymore ..i feel relieved because he refused but i am new to this feeling of love .. i am very worried that this feeling will stay long ..or i wont love again ...or maybe i was too much logical ,,,i feel so guilty now because i know his circumstance from the begining and i have hurted him ..i loved him though i know there was no hope ..i couldnt stop my self from love and caring ...but every part of me was knowing he wont do anything for me and i wont give up myself for him

Real love will never die. You are in a very difficult situation but if you really love him try to be with you. If you do not want to be with him it means you do not love him as much as you think - sounds complicated a bit :)



Give yourself some time and see how the feeling goes (it is staying strong or going away).

If you are against your religion in regards to a man having two wives, than I really think you should stick with that belief.  By your writings, I don't think you would be successful in a marriage and being number 2 wife.

You did the right thing.  I know it may sound harsh now, but trust me, the pain WILL end.  Everything just takes time.



You must have loved this man very dearly, but he had a chance to divorce his wife when they were separated, and if he loved you nearly as much as you love him, then he'd have divorced her.



To me, it seems the phrase "you can't always get what you want" never graced his ears.  You can't have everything in life.



You say you've hurted him, but take a look at what he's done to you.



Try distracting yourself - trust me, I know it's hard - but distract yourself with a hobby, play some games or become engrossed with work.  Do anything to keep your mind off it and eventually it'll just come naturally.

yes i does eventually nothing last however people live only 100 years and its really to little time.  But it can happen even in our race  I know people who simply got bored of themselfs. In reality love is just chemistry You're fre to do what you want but consider this for human love marriage is just an imprisonent and it kills love its better for everyone to have as much boyfriend they want to or to have as much Girlfriends theywant to living with hem having sex etc but not binding themselfs only to one person but create a network so all of the Girlfriends and boyfriends will become friends and not rivals ironically the Mariage is one of these things that divides the society as you yourself said his wife was a rival for you not a friend and if it were like I said we really could had  become one Big Familly lol

Your right to not go against your beliefs. You will love again, but give yourself time to grieve this loss. You have no reason to feel guilty, sometimes we can't help how we feel and our feelings just get away from us. It is a good thing that you recognize that this isn't the right thing for you. It will take time for you to get over him, but you will. Good Luck.

Dear silent tear,
I read what you had written and felt moved by it.
You have asked a question and at the same time you have answered your question.
Don't you have an objective in life, you have also stated in your narration.
But inspite of that, you have gone against your resolution and made yourself vulnerable to another man who is tied down with another woman.
Being a second wife is not what you want.



That guy is not worthy of you.



Don't spend another minute thinking of him.
What had occured in the past is finished.
You have turned the page and you cannot and will not go back.
You cannot do that.
So just carry on with your life and allow time to do its magic.
Don't dwelve in your past and thinking of him will only make you waste time about that person.
Meditation and prayer will surely help you.

hi first of all u seem like a person with a very good conscience and i am convinced u are cos lets even push everything aside, but reason simply, having to share ur man with a first wife or any other woman is a cruel life trust me, now think about it happening to u, we dont even want to go there , so in essence you did the right thing from not getting married to this man cos ,we would have evntually married another woman to add up to you guys,the feeling is not love really, u just realise that ,u are lonely and since there is no one you are willing to give such tym to now, ur mind veers towards him, it will pass, i am sur very sure, i am a girl and trust me,i have been there but finding ur own man, a man that is for u, that wil love and care for u, is the altimate and u dont achieve that by sitting down, u get out there get a job if u dont have one, or start a course u love,or a small scale business, then marry all that energy into prayers every morning and night,u will see the result, u will meet so many nice young and single guys, that you will have to pray to pick the right one.love and take care.....trust me it will pass, just get out there and focus on something u love doing so it will take ur mind of. bye pop

Do I have Seperation anxiety from my boyfriend?



I love my boyfriend more that anything in the world but.... I have had relationships before that were really hard on me. I found out numerous times that my ex had cheated on me and that always made me feel unwanted or not good enough. I go to work during the day and all I think about is, wondering what he is doing or were he is. He has never cheated on me but I am really afraid of it happening just because it hurt me sooo bad. What is this feeling? and how do I overcome it?

In my opinion, you need some counseling.  You have very low self-esteem, and sometimes after being very hurt by someone, it's very difficult for us to feel better..... I really suggest some counseling to help you overcome this.

It is hard let's admit to get over having been hurt whatever anybody says, but the truth of the matter is you have to move on if you haven't then you are not ready for a new relationship yet with this current boyfriend because it would not be fair for him to judge you on past relationships he had that failed the same as it is not fair for you to judge him on past relationships you had.  Trust my girl that is all it comes down to you have to trust him you have no reason not to.

what you feeling is usually normal for people who have been cheated on in the past. You should try and trust him, especially if he hasnt given you a reason not to trust him.



if all fails and you are becoming really anxious about him, maybe you should consider therapy....

Since you have been hurt so many times, I recommend therapy, they will give you the tools and the confidence to make your relationship with this man much, much better.



Separation anxiety can be cured, you just need the help of a counselor to develop the tools to make it easier on you when he is gone.



I had it when I was a child, and I had the counseling, and my mom had to work with me and let me know that if she went away, she would call me to know that she would be coming back.



We worked together, and together with a counselor, that helped.



I recommend you work together with your boyfriend and a counselor so that you can all work together to help you out.



You will be fine!!!

Other than that, if you have enough money saved up, try to treat him to a french dinner especially with oysters (reason you know) and then royally treat him once you both retire (this too you know).

Should I allow my husband to bring in a problem child from a previous marriage.?



I have been married six months to a wonderful man.  He was previously married and has two children from that marriage and I have none.  Lately his 12 year old son has become a handful to his mother with typical misbehavior issues, such as misbehaving in school and not doing things around the house as he is told and just being mischievous.  His mother (the ex wife) feels that the child is calling out for attention and needs his father and so she now wants his father to raise him (in our home obviously).  I feel that with this come so many responsibilities I don't feel prepared to handle and I just shouldn't have to.  This was discussed before our marriage, I said that I will not allow his children to move in with us.  When I met him he would have his kids every other weekend and that is what I agreed to. Please help out tell me what you think.



</question>



<additional details>



Sorry this is my first time on this and maybe I did not express myself properly.  I am very good to these children, but judging from the weekends we spend together with the kids I know that this will be solely my responsibility and that is what I don't feel is right.  Two weeks ago the children were over and made a hole in the wall and they were not reprimanded or corrected in any way and I don't feel it is my place to correct these children.  Also his ex wife has a child from her own previous relationship that she is also not raising herself, I feel she makes up excuses to not keep her children.  Another thing is that my husband offered to take this child in before we met and she did not want to, I feel she is taking advantage of me and my good nature.  She is confident that her children will be fine with me because I treat them well and then she is free from her parenting responsibilities.

So from reading this I gather did you KNEW he had kids before you married? No hu, you're not allowing him to do anything, if HIS child is in need of helpa dn attention, the child SHOULD leave with his father. You knew the risk of being a step parent. The thing is mothers and father get divorced from each other, not parents from children. Remember that.

Kids should ALWAYS come first.  You married him and therefore you married his kids, as well.  The son probably does need his father right now and you're jealous of that relationship.  You should have thought of all of the possibilities before you married him.  Stay out of it and let him be a father, and maybe you can help provide a loving, stable, motherly influence, instead of appearing to be the wicked stepmother.

When you marry a dude who has kids you have to be prepared to take the kids as they are your own just in case things like this happen. You may have agreed to every other weekend, but he had no choice in the matter.

I can see how you might feel apprehensive but that is very very selfish. How dare you make him choose between you and his son?! That's ridiculous. His family is now your family and you need to get used to that. The poor kid needs his father now more than ever. Who are you to try and make a rift between them? If you aren't ready for kids you shouldn't have married someone who has kids.

Selfish.  He should leave you.  These are his children and you have no right to expect him to not help them.  Yes the ex is probably right the child needs and should have the fathers attention.  You should not of gotten involved with him if you didn't want the responsibilities that comes along.. NO matter what was discussed before you should of known that anything could happen and the children would have to move in with you.  Guess what children come first no matter if they are from a previous marriage.  You said you would not allow his children to move in.  I hope he wakes up and boots you out.

I'm not going to be as harsh on you as everyone else.



I'm a step mother, and my step son lives with me.



It is hard work, definitely.  You NEED to allow your step son to live with you, though.  That is your husband's son, and when you married your husband, you married his children, too since they are minors.  You need to understand that this man had a life before you met him, and his children were a big part of that.



I understand your spouse should always be your priority -- I am my husband's priority even over his son, and my husband is my priority even over my stepson and my own daughter (that we share.)  I think people need to realize that when you marry, your spouse becomes your #1, period.  Of course, one thing DOES trump that, and that is the absolute NEEDS of your children.



His child needs a safe, happy, loving home to live in.  You and your husband need to provide that for him.  No one is saying you need to be an instant super-mom, that's up to you.  Prior to your stepson moving in, you need to outline what your role will be.  Personally, my role is huge.  I work from home, and I am my stepson's primary caregiver.  He is 8 years old,m and I get him ready before school, help with homework after school, make sure his chores are done, drive him to and from all his extracurricular activities, and do EVERYTHING else a mother would do.  He calls me "Heather," not "Mom," and I respect that -- I know I'm not his mother, but I AM his stepmother, and he does refer to me as his "parent."



You need to realize that this man needs to raise his child if thats what his child needs.  Sit down with your husband and decide what your role will be.  Will you discipline your stepson?  Will you attend conferences, dr's appointments, school functions, and sports games?  Talk to your husband and decide all of this together, prior to your stepson moving in.



It's a difficult road to travel and it takes a strong person.  You need to respect your husband's needs and desires to have his son live with him -- you need to do whats best for the children.  Everything will work out in the long run..



Good luck.

I think that you have a big problem on your hands. If the kid stays with you guys, you lose, and if he stays with the mother, you lose. This issue could become a marriage buster if some compromise isn't made.



If the son lives in the same town, perhaps, instead of living with you guys full time, you arrange for a 2 week on/off schedule or something that works for both parties.

How does the child behave when he is with you every other weekend?  His son is 12 and old enough to communicate, sit down with him and hear his side of things and maybe you can provide some help.  I think it was wise to have discussed this prior to marriage, clearly you have open lines of communication--which sounds like this might be what the 12 year old needs rather than a permanent placement in your home.  Additionally, I would make sure when/if you make a decision to have him in your home--GO THROUGH THE COURTS.  Make sure you receive compensation or no longer have to pay support to the ex.  I feel sorry for the kids of divorced parents.

If you weren't ready for the responsibility, you shouldn't have married him.  His kids come with him whether you like it or not, they are part of the deal.  And if he's a good man, his kids will come before you anyway.  And even though you don't want to hear this, the bio mom is probably right...  he's just crying out for attention.  It's hard on children with divorced parents and you have to try and put yourself in that child's situation.  I doubt he's a "problem child" as you call it, he just doesn't know any other way to express himself.  When you have your own kids, you'll understand.  But I think that when you married this guy, you accepted the terms of responsibility whether or not that's what you guys talked about before you got married.  I know it's hard because I have a stepson myself and I know how frustrating it can be but you have to think about the child and not yourself.



Give him a break, he's just a kid and he didn't ask to be drug into the middle of all this.  He probably already feels like nobody wants him.  At least give it a try, it might not be as bad as you think it will be.  Good luck!!!



The child needs his father and just think, if he moves in with you guys and you can give him some comfort and security, he won't be a "problem child" anymore.  My stepson's mom is all the time complaining about how he throws tantrums and hits his little brother (by her) but with us he's always smiling and playing and loving on his little sister (by us).

as long as his son isnt a danger to you or your home, you need to take him in. poor kid may just need some love and guidance.  there are responsibilities that come with children, but his natural mother and father should take that on more than you.  keep the lines of communication open with your husbands ex wife so that all 3 of you can help this kid.



the ex sounds like trash, you are better off taking these kids in - for their sake.  start disciplining.  go buy something to fix the hole in the wall and let that be their 'welcome to my house' present :)  im not kidding.

I don't believe there is any such thing as falling in or out of love with someone.



I believe that there is realization that love has always existed between you (even before you meet) and also a realization that real love has never really existed between you.

Of course, we have kids now too, so the whole dating things has been thrown out. We would go out just about every evening, and now its every other weekend. I look forward to when the kids can stay home by themselves and we can enjoy a late movie or something, maybe once a week. :-)

Sweetheart,



When a girl thinks she is starting up sex, she'll put on a sexy shirt, unbutton it, but on some red lipstick and come up to her husband and be like "come here big boy", but they guy will think that he started it by actually making the first move.



It's weird, but he may think he is initiating things.



Talk to him about it. Sometimes you have to do more than just look pretty and say a couple of words to completely initiate it.

He just feels more comfortable with you taking the reins. There's a great podcast called Sex is Fun. You should check it out because they did a whole podcast on how to approach this very subject. I suggest telling him out and out that sometimes you want him to grab you and have his wicked way with you. Make sure to give him a Scooby snack when he does do this and then according to Pavlov's theory it'll kick in for him.

You are his ideal partner and he's taking you for granted. You behave like a porn star and he loves it. His mates envy him and he thinks he's the d.b's.



Cut off the supply for a while, see how he likes it, or accept that you have a healthy sex life and go on enjoying it.



Just because he will not initiate sex does not mean he does not want it, he just loves being made to feel 'sexy' because you want him and always go for him.



It's a compliment maybe, he loves the way you start it off and he gets turned on by it.

He's probably intimidated by your sexuality.  You can either wait for him to initiate sex, which for some guys is close to never, or you can just take matters into your own hands.  Sometime when he's lying next to you, get out a toy and start going to town.  When he says something about it, tell him he didn't initiate sex, so you figured he was too tired or not interested.  More than likely, he will join you.

Don't start it next time. Wait for him to start it. If he doesn't, then something may be wrong with your marriage. It sounds like he's just not that into you. Maybe he is a homosexual and he is just now realizing it. You never know what's really going on up there since your not a mind reader. If he doesn't initiate sex after a week of no sex, you may want to suggest going to a marriage counselor. Good luck, I hope he starts something soon for your sake.

In most relationships, the woman is cherishable and is patient and sexy and waits for her respectable husband to make all the moves.  However, it is possible that in your relationship your hubby is the cherishable one and you are the one that is the respectable one.



Ask youself this:  choose one dominant side.



1.  you want to be cherished
2.  you want to be respected
There is nothing wrong if you are the respectable one...it is about understanding the dynamics of your relationship and making it work for you.

Here are some reasons he may noit be intiating sex.



He may have someone else ont eh side and no more energy for you.



You may want it so much that he is just tired of it and feels it is more like a chore then pleasure.



He may just be too tired from work.



You have rejected him so many times in the past when he has tried too and he has just given up.



Marriage is more then just sex remember this it is important, and really I would not go promoting yourself as a porn star it sounds slutty and degrading.
