You could search it on google maps or ratp (parision transportation company).
You didn't give any details - what transportation u wanna use?
By car it's 6.5km = 16mins. If u take a taxi that would be between 10-15 euros (depending of the time of day and if it's a weekend or not).
By metro : take the line 1 at Place Maillot - direction Chateau de Vincennes to Concorde, when there take line 12 direction - south and exit on vaugirard station. When there it's a 2mins walk.
I suppose you are taking a bus from the CDG airport. If so, i'd suggest u take the bus that takes you to the Charles de Gaulle -Etoile square (where the Arc de Triophe is). When there, take the metro, line 6, direction Nation, when at Pasteur station change to line 12 and go to Vaugirard. All in all, by metro it's a 40 mins ride.

Probably the most exciting day of your holiday!! Where you are guaranteed to have a day full of "Dirty Fun"!!. Explore the Cretan mountains, visit the caves, experience local life with Land Rover Jeeps. Professional Drivers.
We follow the trails of historical Crete, where no ordinary vehicle can reach. We experience the true life of Crete, witnessing its traditions, seeing the true natural beauty, historical monuments, archeological finds, national parks, the local people and their rugged way of life.



We travel well off the beaten track using our Land Rover "Defenders" which is a safe and hassle free way of witnessing the places and wildlife that most people only see in the brochures or from an armchair.

I worked in Albania in '99 along the Kosovo border.
Some areas are OK - well as OK as Albania can get, I was the 1st ex pat to enter Tropoje district in 6 months due to an aid agency vehicle being ambushed and the driver killed. Tirana the capital has a major smog problem, not helped by burning rubbish in skips in the street, I developed a cough within minutes of arriving in Tirana.
The road network is below the standard of an African country( - 7 hours for a 200km drive from Tirana to Kukes) corruption is rife. The chief of police was crossing into greece for a conference on stolen vehicle trafficing in the balkans, the Greeks checked his car at the border and found it had been stolen from Germany!
be prepared to pay an entry and exit charge, when I went it was $50 to get in and $10 to get out. In short, unless you really need to go, don't

Snow...not so much. Maybe if you're lucky. Our summers are humid and hot for about 2 weeks, our winters are rainy...and rainy.
The rest of the year...it's rainy too!

New Years eve is usually freezing cold, but mostly without snow. But hey, as we say in The Netherlands: you never know, you might have your miracle.

As for the fireworks; yes, the Erasmus bridge is an excellent place to see fireworks. There is usually a huge event surrounding it, with DJ's and lots of partying into the night.

Amsterdam is also a great place to be on the 31st. The Dam Square and Nieuwmarkt are usually packed with people, outdoor bars and music.

I have been to Madeira about 14 times. We are also going again this October. If the weather stays true to form it should be quite warm by U.K.standards although the Atlantic will not be as warm for swimming as say in August.
My wife and I have been in Funchal at Christmas in shirt sleeves and eating outside.
Only up in the mountains does it get really cold  in January/Feb and sometimes there is snow on the mountain tops a rare sight for Madeirans.

I have never known Madeira to be "cold" and I have been a fair few times!

It's fairly expensive everywhere in Europe so watch your budget.

You don't say your age, so I don't know if you're old enough for adult things like a drink or a bit of the ganja (which is perfectly acceptable in Amsterdam).

Here are a few things I would do if I were to return to Amsterdam for a couple of days:

1)  Visit the Rijksmuseum.  You won't find a more complete collection of Dutch art.  This museum is an Amsterdam landmark.

2) Eat Indonesian food.  Not too pricey is a favourite spot called "Kantijl and the Tiger".  Spuistraat 291-293 in the Nieuwe Zijde.  Order the Reisstaffel.  http://www.kantjil.nl/

3)  Walk through the Red Light District.  It's fascinating.

4)  Find "The Bulldog" and go there for a puff and a coffee.  Then walk into the Oude Zidje and situate yourself at any bar with an outdoor terrace beside the old church (Oude Kerk).  Order an Amstel and simply enjoy your surroundings.

5)  Walk around Leidseplein and choose among the cafes, restaurants, and nightclubs that you see.  Watch out for pickpockets.

6)  During the afternoon, walk on Rembrandtplein and do some people watching anywhere you like.

7)  Don't be shy.  Go see a live sex show at Club Casa Rosso.  Remember, you're in Amsterdam.  It's not dirty old men that go, it's mainly couples and small groups of friends that go to these shows.

I could go on, but you get the idea.  Enjoy yourself.

Amsterdam is not expensive if you're comparing it to London or Paris.



Eating and drinking is much cheaper if you are willing to pop down side streets away from tourist-trap restaurants. Eat in a department store shopper's restaurant for good value. 99% of them speak English so you won't have any trouble.

I don't like disagreeing with fellow Answerers but "Love" is completely wrong about the VanGough museum. It is a waste of time and money. They don't have any of his good works there at all (they're all in private collections or other art galleries). What original works there are on display are pretty dire.
The place is also crowded with Yanks who are rabbiting on about the "Vangoes"..... Yugh!  Keep well away.

If you like art then you must visit the Rijksmuseum. This is absolutely one of the finest art galleries in the world.

Near the Van Gough museum is an area of jewellers. Most of these small factories do public tours. They're free but you may be tempted to buy something at the end.

Visit the Heineken Brewery for the tour (the Heineken Experience - see link below). It's about two hours long, absolutely superb value and you get to drink a litre of the "best" along with a presentation tin with an excellent glass in it.

Take a stroll through the Red Light District and admire the ladies in the windows. Watch your boyfriend's reaction - you may be on a winner later!

There are excellent canal tours. These last from 1 to 2 hours and take you on an interesting tour of the city.

Avoid anything like McDonald's of KFC etc like the plague. If you want a very light lunch then go into a local Dutch cafe and have an Uitsmijter (pronouced "ouchsmeiter"). This is typically Fried Eggs on white or wholemeal bread with Cheese, Ham & Salad and is cheap and delicious.

Don't worry about the weather. Amsterdam is a great place even if it's raining.

one day only ..well I'm also going to be in Amsterdam on Monday..
the weather will probably be about 15 degrees C...it might be sunny but it might also rain....
you can visit some bars and restaurants obviously to taste the local specialities..and visit the Van Gogh museum.
Amsterdam is definitely cheaper than London.

Depending on your likes and dislikes-



I'd recommend a canal boat trip, its a great way of seeing so much,

in a little time, and at a leisurely pace.

Anne Frank's Museum is well worth a visit if you have the time

Price-wise, Amsterdam is on a par with here,

You can look up Yahoo weather, for an accurate forecast

Hope you have a great time !

In Holland rains at least once a day, its windy too. A beautiful city there´s a lot to see just look around . A little bit expensive ´cause it´s Euro and its more than Dollar. The Van Gogh Museum  it´s a must see it. Prepare to walk everywhere ...good luck!

A walk past the main attractions around the area of Dam Square, in the heart of Amsterdam, is all it takes to get a sense of the historical nature of the city. The perfect starting point is Dam Square itself. On its western side you can see the Royal Palace and the Nieuwe Kerk (New Church). To the east is the National Monument, established to remember the victims of World War II.

Walk along the main shopping street, Kalverstraat. Halfway along, turn right on the Spui. Immediately to the right here is the Begijnhof. This ancient court is traditionally inhabited by unmarried women with a religious background (but not nuns). Further along begins the canals. These can be difficult to orient yourself at first, but the church towers can be used as beacons.

In the distance you may see the blue crown atop the tower of the Westerkerk. This church is located near the Anne Frank House and the Homo Monument. Walking a little further on the Prinsengracht, you pass the many side streets, which are home to boutique shops, trendy restaurants and many very cosy terraces. At the end of the Prinsengracht, turn right onto Haarlemmerdijk. Moving towards Central Station, you will pass the bike parking garage, a multi-floor construction where thousands of bikes are parked each day.



Attractions for young and old:
Throughout the city, there are attractions which cater to the whole family. During a visit to Madame Tussauds, you may find yourself encountering one of your celebrity or historical heroes. Or enjoy a pleasantly creepy experience in The Amsterdam Dungeon. A fun combination of entertainment and education can be found at science centre NEMO, where the VOC ship of the Maritime Museum is also docked. And, of course, Amsterdam's zoo, Artis, is popular with young and old all year round.

Other things you could do:
A tour in a round-trip boat. Discovering the city on a bike. Walking excursions. Hidden Treasures Tours. Or go visit a museum:

In Amsterdam there are 37 museums, which offer up very diverse permanent collections and temporary exhibitions. The largest and most renowned institutions include: Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum, Stedelijk Museum, Hermitage, Anne Frank House and Rembrandthuis.  There are also a surprising amount of smaller museums, each bringing very different types of art and collections to Amsterdam. In recent years, photography and multimedia exhibitions have also been booming.

There are several parks to go to. For example the Amstelpark, Flevopark and dozens more...

I guess Sander has been very complete.

I can only add that Amsterdam is a nice starting place to visit other sights as well, such as Volendam, Enkhuizen, Zaandam.
And other larger cities are also within 1 hours travel (by train), such as Haarlem, Alkmaar, Den Haag, Rotterdam, Utrecht.

It all depends on how long you are planning to stay.

Where can I get a Buzzcut in Budapest?



Hi, I'm currently traveling Europe, and am in Budapest for 9 days. I keep my hair short and comfortable in a buzz-cut, but I haven't had it cut in almost 6 weeks now, and it looks sloppy and overgrown. I've tried going into a barber shop in Berlin and in Paris, and neither of the two barbers understood what a buzzcut was, even after I explained it to them, complete with buzzing sounds and all.



Where can I go here in Budapest to get this haircut, and is there something other than buzzcut that I can use to explain it?



Also, I usually use a 1 1/4 inch clip to buzz my hair... how would I ask for that here, given the fact that the barber probably won't understand?

Hi,
No worries, you are not on the Moon :))
You can get this haircut anywhere in Budapest as it's a quite popular hairstyle among men. All hairdressers have this electric clipper. It's called "hajvago gep" but u can say u need a clipper cut or buzz cut.

Instead of 1 1/4 inch better to say 3 - 3.2 cm.
Good luck & have a nice time

hi i am gurunadh, citizen of india.
I am travelling from mexico to india, through amsterdam. I have only mexican visa. On my way to india, i have a break of one day in amsterdam.
So can I go outside of airport, without visa. If visa is required then how do i get that?.....Is there any oneday transit visa into the city?

Hello gurunadh,
Yes, you will need a Schengen visa being holder of an Indian Passport if you want to leave the transit area of the airport. If you should have a Mexican Passport you would be waived from the visa requirement. Holding a Mexican visa does not waive the Schengen visa requirement.
There is no one-day visa and I am not sure, whether the Schengen transit visa Type B is applicable in your case. It is usually issued if an applicant needs to travel through a Schengen country to reach a non-Schengen country as travel destination, and is valid for 5 days.
http://www.minbuza.nl/en/welcome/comingt...
http://www.immihelp.com/visas/schengenvi...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_ar...

You can apply for that visa at the Dutch embassy in Mexico or one of its consulates in Cancún; Guadalajara; Mérida, YUC.; Monterrey, N.L.; Tampico, Tamps.; Veracrug, Ver.. They will be able to tell you, whether you may use a transit visit (type B) or you have to apply for a regular visa (type C).

Prices on the strip are more expensive than off but there lots of places off.  Last year it was great weather until the end of November but take, maybe, a jacket for the night time, you may not need it but just in case.  There is nothing I would especially recomment, you will find out yourself very quickly.  I will say that Albufeira old town is well worth a visit, you are about ten minutes away from it in Oura (where the strip is)
I live in Olhos t'Agua, it means nothing to you now but it will.

the best time to be in Portugal (along with June):
- Good weather - not cold, not very hot
- ideal light to take photos (true!)
- tourist places aren't so crowded
- good for shopping (you can always find some last sales)
- People are strangely happy... good for fall in love, or love, or something like that. (it's like that song "September morning")

1--Ireland, hands down (the South, not the North). The people like Yanks, and Dublin is exploding with energy--far and away the newest/hippest place. Cost of living isn't like the UK, either.
#2--Copenhagen or Stockholm--like Ireland, not part of the European Union. English is required in school, and both are very generous welfare states. Oslo's fine, too, but the landscape and manners are more burly
#3 Rekjavik, Iceland--another Scandinavian jolly, but you have to accept living with a volcano underfoot. The natural baths give the women the finest complexions in the world.
#4 Portugal-English not required in school, but the locals are very forgiving. Much better acceptance of Yanks than France or Spain.
#5-Berlin, Germany--A beautifully rebuilt capital, but it's underpopulated until the secret gets out. The architecture is gorgeous, and m daughter tells me it's hip to be Jewish there. Go figure.
#6==Prague, Czech Republic. Very intellectual and artistic, though the city seems like a large, gray monument during the winter. A very hip nightlife, and home to some great bands.

Five years ago I would have recommended Croatia, but it's so popular now that prices are out of hand.  It's tough to go wrong with Italy too--prices are reasonable, the language is easy, and the people are great.

First to comment on the first answer - both Copenhagen and Stockholm are in the European Union. Norway on the other hand is not.

All countries are starting to have the same immigration rules now, which is you need to have an education or skills needed in the country to get a visa there. So if you mean easiest to move to in that sense then they are all pretty much the same.

Norway, Sweden and Denmark are fairly similar countries and the people are rather alike as well. We are friendly to people who are friendly to us. =))

However, if you are looking for a better economy than I'd pick Norway. They chose to remain outside the EU and it seems to have done them well. I cannot find the article but it was reported that Norwegians manage to save the most money at the end of the months.

None, unless you've got a EU passport or are very wealthy.  Americans are only allowed to stay in the Schengen Zone (most of Europe) for a total of 90 days out of every 180 days, and other countries allow 3 months only.  Moving there is just about impossible unless you have employment skills that are not available in Europe.

First of all you can't make things better by running away; if the American economy collapses; you should hang in there and take advantage of the new opportunities that usually arise when chaos occurs. Its like a rat leaving a sinking ship. It ain't cool. Americans can handle anything weather any storm and come out ahead. You pull yourself up by your bootstraps and soldier on! It would be unpatriotic to leave for that reason. (mind you that there are other cool reasons to go live abroad)

Remember this; if the American economy collapses; it will be felt world wide and no matter how strong the Euro is; things will be worse anywhere outside the USA; my best advise if that if you must leave for that reason, you should go to a poor country somewhere in South America or southeast Asia in the Pacific Rim; They won't feel it as much cause they are poor to start with.

Having said that, when I retired from the service I went to live in Denmark for a while. (my wife is from Denmark) The Scandinavian countries ROCK but there is a basic language barrier that keeps you from suceeding and moving forward. Learning the languages is difficult; as they are not easy languages to learn. Germany is a cool place to live too. But Great Britain is the best to overcome the language barrier; but it is expensive. The last thing and probably the most important thing to consider is the immigration situation. You can't stay for more than 90 days there and you can't work. Some people do it there; just like illegal immigrants do it here.

In anycase this is your country (that is if you are from here) Stay here and help fix the problem; the reason I came back is because the grass is not always greener somewhere else.

Well there's no definite answer - the post office will only ever give a guideline as there are too many factors (e.g. if customs stop and inspect the letter, etc) which can affect the actual receipt date.

It also depends on whether your friend sent it as standard post or priority post as well and also what the weight of it was

Assuming it was less than 2kg and looking at the guidelines for other countries (Phillipines not specifically mentioned) the guideline (in working days) is 5-8 days - so you should receive it between the 22nd and 25th of Sept. http://www.tntpost.nl/voorthuis/brieven-...

However, again, this is a guideline and not a definate. Sending by courier is quicker and you can track & trace the shipment online - but you pay dearly for that service as well (very expensive!)

There are two buses per day for that 320 kilometers (199 miles) trip:
depart at 15:45 (3:45pm) monday to saturday to arrive at 20:25 (8.25pm)
depart at 18:45 (6:45pm) daily to arrive at 23:35 (11:35pm)

Edit:
select Lisboa for Partidas (Departure)
and Gouveia for Distinos (Destination)
by clicking on "Isa e Volta" you also get the times for the return trip (Horarios Volta)

Ticket price is 17 € for the bus, alternately you can use the trains departing from Lisboa Oriente:

daily at 10:09am to arrive at 13:44 (1.44pm) with 21 minutes overlay at Coimbra-b (28,00 €)
monday to friday and sunday at 14:09 (2:09pm) to arrive at 17:49 (5:49pm) with 21 minutes overlay at Coimbra-b (28,00 €)
daily at 16:14 (4:14pm) to arrive at 20:35 (8:35pm) with 36 minutes overlay at Mangualde (16,80 €)

Note: all timetables are valid until 12 October 2008!

Going to amsterdam this summer, and I have some questions :)?



This summer ill be going to Amsterdam for a few weeks, and I do plan on smoking marijuana.  Im going with 4-5 friends who will all be older than 18.  The problem is I'll still be 17 and i know minors can't linger in the "coffee shops".  But my question is, if im with a bunch of people who are above 18, will the shops check my ID?  And if they do, can my friend just buy me some weed and we can smoke it outside? I know the police aren't too strict on tourists smoking marijuana on the streets.

I hope I can shed some light on the situation:

People always seem tot think that you either have to smoke weed in a coffee shop, or on the streets. Like people always seem to think you need to have sex in a bed at night.

Many people buy some weed, take it outside and find a nice park to sit in, or (until recently due to new no-smoking laws) a nice bar to chill.

The big coffee shops are quite strict when it comes to age, since it can cost them their license. Smoking, as opposed to what people usually think, is NOT legal here, it's merely tolerated, so pushing the boundaries of the government's lenience would not be wise.

You can however, have your friend buy some weed, take it to a park somewhere, and smoke it there. Being paranoid that people might ask you for your age is not an unconscious feeling you want to be having while stoned. It can seriously screw up your high.

But, we do have some sort of etiquette when it comes to smoking. While in a public place (park, square etc.) do not smoke around children or large groups of people that might take offense.
Find a quiet spot where you can enjoy a quiet afternoon, and don't be loud and obnoxious.

It would also be wise to talk amongst your group about what kind of weed would suit all of your taste. There are many different kinds, and seeing that you won't be the person buying the weed, it might be a good idea to let him or her know what kid of buzz you are looking for, so that they can get some information from the person in the coffee shop.

I hope you have a nice trip and remember that if you're not sure about something: don't do it!

Do Portuguese think Portugal is really such a bad place to live and work?



The reason why I'm asking this is because my husband's family and friends who live and work in Portugal think we're crazy for wanting to relocate to Portugal from the UK. Ok, so we know the wages are a lot less to that of the UK in comparison, but the cost of living and the taxes we pay in the UK surely mean that we're not necessarily getting a better deal by staying put? Why do some Portuguese think Portugal is a nightmare of a place to live and work in? I'd be interested to see people's views on this because if I'm honest I'm failing to see why my in-laws are so against us relocating. Husband is Portuguese by the way. :-)



</question>



<additional details>



Wow, thanks for your answer José, you have given me a really interesting point of view which I like. I've never lived in Portugal but from what I can see the quality of life is much better than here, people seem to love living over there and appreciate life and family values one hundred times more than us over here. I love Portugal and Portuguese people and the language....it's a beautiful language and I love learning it and love hearing my husband speak it! I'm even a Portugal football supporter (watch me get lots of thumbs down from the England supporters now!!) It just frustrates me that so many people we speak to think Portugal is a terrible place to live.

Thanks for your answer!



Thank you MIG - thats an interesting point to make. I really love the answers so far and I'm definitely going to use them to challenge my in-laws and portuguese friends next time they tell us we are mad for wanting to move over to Portugal! ;-)

Thanks again to both of you. Muito obrigado!

Good question.
let me try to explain you:
We, portuguese, are never satisfied with nothing. Maybe it's because of our latin and southeuropean mentality, maybe because of our very peculiar history (ask your husband...)
The fact is we aren't arrogant like, for ex, the spanish and we tend to minimize our country in front of foreigners.
Maybe it's because we prefer to criticize our house before others do it. (it sounds funny, but it is probably right.)
The truth is, apart of our golden age (XV-XVI centuries), fado and football, we portuguese, IN FACT, are proud of many things about our country, like culture, monuments, traditions, food, wine, the peace, low violence and crimes, our language, etc.
We know the bad things about Portugal but we also know that there are more countries around the world worse than us. (i usually say to my friends when they criticize portugal's health national system something like: "it could be worse. it could be like Afganisthan" lol)
Of course is not a nightmare to live in Portugal. Just this morning my workmates were asking "how the hell the britisih can live in such a GREY country? always raining, fog, polution, etc." 
Of course when we travel abroad (in west Europe...) it's true that we feel inmpressed about the better stuff we find there... 
Natural, isn't it?
For last i'll say some things - in my humble opinion - are better in Portugal than UK (been there 6 times):
- Weather
- Wine
- Food
- Cooffe (i mean, the expresso)
- Polution
- the sky light
- security
- tolerance
- the "joie de vivre" (no translation needed)

last, but not least, my advise is: come to Portugal, live and work here, and i'm sure you'll be very happy like...me!

The big car rentals usually allow to go with their car wherever you want, if you take a special insurance police and explain your travel plans while booking. Also they give you only cars like Ford Focus, Opel Astra or Fiat Bravo or smaller. Many more exclusive brands like AUDI, BMW, Volvo or Mercedes they will not give you at all to go to Eastern Europe.

Well "it's" not legal in Amsterdam either (yes really).  It is 'tolerated' under given conditions but if e.g. you are caught for another misdemeanor and caught carrying, then you can be charged for possession as well.

Secondly moving to Amsterdam - well fortunately it's not as easy as that, or else A'dam would be even more densely populated than it already is.  Assuming you are from the US, you would have to get a visa to live and work over here.

Will it be legal in the US?  Doubtful and even more doubtful in the run-up to an election.  American politics play to the conservative middle ground and family values.



(a) The mindset in the US is very different than in the Netherlands.



This would need to change.
(b) The powers-that-be would need to reassign priorities from solving "the problems of the world" to actually admitting that things like marijuana consumption exist and then managing the issue rather than sweeping it under the carpet and pretending that making it illegal solves the problem

I dont see either of those things happening in the near future, especially if I read about the prospective president's policies and ideology.  So in conclusion - at least not for the next 5 years anyway!

<answer>



- New trade routes and new markets are "open" (mainly by the portuguese) for Europe and new commercial relations also (China, Japan, India, Arabia, Indonesia: the portuguese were the first western to start business and all kinds of treaties in those places. the spanish follow them, then the dutch, the english, the french, and so on...) 
- The introduction of cotton is very important, because this kind of fabric has to be washed more than wool and because of that, people tend to be more higienic and therefore, less diseases.



- More Precious metal - gold and silver - for the european market, economy, stock-markets, industry, etc
-Changes in eating habits: new kind of food: oranges, potatoes, corn, turkey, various types of spice.
- The introduction of new vegetables and fruits will produce a big change in european agriculture, mainly in the XVIII century, that will lead to an agriculture revolution
- Because of the discovery and colonization of new lands, many wars and disputes after lands are transferred from Europe to America, Asia, Africa, etc (it didn't ended with all wars in Europe)
- For the first time, people in Europe are aware of the size of the world and their place in the world : the others cultures, languages, religions, etc. After all, the sea has no "abyss end" and people can emigrate to other places, searching for a better life, prosperity, etc (America and Africa mainly) 
- It was the first Globalization in history, (but with a clear European advantage)

There are very big differences within Europe, it is impossible to give an answer covering the whole continent unless it is split out in very many details.

In the countries I am familiar with, the Netherlands and England, the libraries are often just open in office hours, but with an extra opening one or several nights per week, and often on the Saturday morning.
But in both countries cut backs in local financing often makes the libraries close down or at least be open less long.
Specially the local branches in the smaller towns suffer.

I am Irish. I live in Alentejo. I love Portugal. It is home for me. I live in a rural place and now really need to get my driving license. I do not wish to return to Ireland to do so as it's a long and arduous process, plus winter is rather miserable in Hibernia (hence the name!). I would sell my granny to get my driving license sorted in Portugal. Any input/advice very much appreciated.

Oslo, incredibly expensive - supposed to be the most expensive city in the world at the moment, according to an American travel programme we saw while we were there.
The west coast and the associated Fjords, from Bergen to Alesund is the only other part we know, and it is incredibly beautiful. We hope to go back there when we can save up for the trip.
There are train trips which reach places that are less accessible by other forms of transport, though the Norwegians have recently had a huge road and tunnel building programme.
We found a lot of people spoke very good English so we had no difficulty getting around.

Today foreign nationals are entitled to apply for Turkish citizenship on the basis of marriage, residence, birth and the intention to settle permanently. The acquisition of Turkish citizenship by means of naturalization requires five years of permanent residence in Turkey and the confirmed intention to settle in the country. Children born in Turkey to foreign nationals have the right to opt for Turkish citizenship within three years after reaching maturity. In principle, Turkish citizenship laws allow dual citizenship.



According to Turkish Nationality Act, No 403, a foreigner should meet the following requirements in order to apply for Turkish nationality.



Should be at the age of consent according to national law (if not a citizen of any country, Turkish law is taken into consideration which requires 18 years old as the age of consent). Should reside in Turkey for the last five years and should have the intention of settling in Turkey (This condition may not be applicable to those who are married to a Turkish national or those who have Turkish origins). Should be in good health. Should speak Turkish. Should have enough financial resources to live in Turkey.



If you meet the conditions above, you can apply to obtain Turkish nationality. Application can be made through the Turkish Consulate in the country where you reside or through the local Governor's office in Turkey. It is important to note that applicant's ability to speak Turkish is taken into consideration when an application is made. Usually, a certificate is issued by the Turkish Consulate upon successful interview of the applicant.

The best time to travel to see northern lights is the midwinter, and one of the best places to view them is Lapland. Do not try to find a big city to go to though, because the city lights will disturb the view very badly. Somewhere in Lapland in Finland is ideal to go to.

I'd like to go to Amsterdam from Ijmuiden. But I don't know how. Please give me some informations thank you?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



IJmuiden has good bus connections to Amsterdam, Haarlem and Beverwijk. There is also a ferry connection between the inland edge of IJmuiden and Amsterdam.

If you arrive by ferry from Newcastle in England you can use the coach service offered by the ferry company, which will bring you to Amsterdam, center of town. 
But even in that case you can walk to the nearest bus stop and use public transport from there. Unless you have bought a strippenkaart in a shop, the bus service from the ferry company has competing prices.

The buses and the ferry service between IJmuiden and Amsterdam all have an 'each 30 minute' service throughout the day, in the evening often cutting back to once an hour, travel time between the towns often is about 30 minutes, but if you also have to go through the whole of IJmuiden by bus, you have to count on closer to one hour.
If you decide to use the bus to Haarlem or Beverwijk and the train from there, the total travel time will likely be longer, cost higher and total comfort level not much better, but the trains will run twice an hour at least too.

And please note, the name of the town is written with an capital IJ, this is a letter that 'only' exist in Dutch, so we use the I and the J when writing on computers, but both have to be capital letters. I know it is often done wrong, but it is even worse than not using a capital letter.

Any hostel recommendations in the following European cities?



I'm from the United States, and my friend and I are planning to next year take a summer-long backpacking trip across Europe.  We're starting in London, heading to Stratford-upon-Avon, England; Salisbury, England; Paris, France; Warsaw, Poland; Vienna, Austria; Graz, Austria; Venice, Italy; and Rome, Italy (in no particular order).  In those cities, does anyone have any suggestions or recommendations for hostels? I would love to have an idea of what people think of different hostels.

Youth Hostels Associated is a fairly staid organization. Generator hostels are huge (over 800 beds in London). They have bars and encourage partying. The one in London is within walking distance of St. Pancras where you catch the train to Paris.
=========
Take a good look at your itinerary. You may want to stick to northern Europe instead of trying to do all those cities in one trip. You don't want all your memories to be of trains and buses.

First of all, I would highly recommend the Rick Steves' "Europe Through The Back Door" travel guides.  He is great at helping you find the hidden gems that show you more of what Europe has to offer while costing less than the more touristy places.  (His restaurant recommendations are also almost universally great).  I've generally stayed in the hotels he recommends, as opposed to hostels, but there are a lot of little family-run places in Europe that are sort of halfway in between a hostel and a bed and breakfast or budget hotel.  These are usually a lot more interesting and fun than the big chain hotels, and they cost about the same or a little less.  I'm not affiliated with these books or their author, but I've had nothing but good experiences using them.  As relates to your itinerary, I followed his recommendations in Paris, Venice, and Rome with resounding success.  But the biggest and most important thing I learned, both from these books and my personal experiences, is that there's a lot more enjoyment to be had in the smaller towns and rural areas than in the big cities.  Paris is stressful.  Vaison la Romaine is relaxing and the food is brilliant!  Same goes for Rome vs. Vernazza!  But Venice is a must-see.

You could try booking via www.hostelworld.com, and read the reviews people leave on the website.
