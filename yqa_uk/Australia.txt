Protect yourself from the sun and mosquitoes, Brits always get themselves burned - very uncool.

The Southern Cross will be prominent in the sky to the south east and well above the horizon. It's always visible somewhere in the sky regardless of the month.

If it's 8.12 pm PDT on Saturday in California, it's 1.12 pm EST on Sunday in Canberra.

If you need to check international times frequently, you can set up a Personal World Clock with all of the cities you need times for. Go to: http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/ , then select Personal World Clock and choose your cities. Every time you visit the site, your PWC will come up automatically showing your selected cities.

I just looked at the website and they still metion Jama on there. It may be that they have taken him and November out of 'circulation' for a while. Zoo's often do this to give animals a break from being gawked at by strange people. You could email the zoo and ask if you want to find out. Hope this helps.

I'm not sure of exact prices but things that are family friendly with pricing are:

Questacon
Cockington Green
Australian Museum
War memorial
Old parliament house
New parliament house
Australian Institute of Sport

They run some water sports on the lake also. What about a trip to Gungalin, a brand new shopping centre which I'm sure would have plenty for the whole family.

The National Museum has free entry, and will keep the kids amused all day.  It's hands on and noone worries about them running all over the place.

Questacon is another hands on place, but there is an entry fee and I'm not sure what it is.

Parliament House is free.

The Australian War Memorial is free.

If the weather's nice they can run around Commonwealth Park.

Someone else did mention Cockington Green, but that is quite expensive, although a nice place to visit.

Canberra Centre is a nice place to shop, especially now it's been extended.  Don't bother with suburban shopping centres, especially Gungahlin.

Do most people have lunch at 12 midday?



I'm just wondering, cause if I'm out with my mother-in-law , she always has to have lunch about 12 and sometimes I'm not even hungry, but just have something then, cause to her its lunchtime. Sometimes ,I don't feel like eating till about 1.30 or so, but I think she thinks she'll starve if she waited that long. If I'm at work(not every day) I usually don't finish till about 1pm if I start at 9, so I'm used to eating later.
Just wondered if others HAVE to eat at a certain time?

I believe most people do. Between 12 noon and 2 p.m., 
If I've had a big breakfast or a late breakfast, then my lunch will be quite late. Depends on each individual.
Your mother in law is used to having her lunch at that time, so have a snack or something, if you are with her. Don't say you are not hungry.

I don't smoke at all, but I have seen them in the little gift shop in the foyer of that big hotel near Martin Place.

Theres also a little newsagent in George Street in the suburb of The Rocks (which is just north of downtown).

Also, most tobacconists/newsagents/supermarkets have them.

You have a few options for coming to Australia. The easist way is if you're a skilled worker but without any qualifications or experience unfortunatly you miss out on that.



The other options are:

Come over as a student, you can obtain a student visa allowing you to study as well as restricted part time work.

Working holiday, pretty self explainitory though you need to be 18.



Working visa, come over and work in Australia for a year or so.



For you're situation I suggest coming over as a Student. You will gain qualifcations that are accepted internationally and can support yourself at the same time.



See http://www.immi.gov.au for the various visa's and rules and regulations.
