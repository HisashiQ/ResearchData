Just How Bad Can Ouija Boards Affect Your Life?



A few years ago I carried out a ouija board with several other people. We got communication from a seemingly good spirit and didn't use any protection like a cross. What I would like to know is if any of us could have been cursed?

Of the group of us, since the ouija board we did, 2 became addicted to drugs at some time, 1 became a mother at the age of 17, another became a father at the age of 19, 1 was thrown out of home, and that leaves 2 other people - 1 I am not in touch with, and ME (who has had alot of bad life changing events occur). So could you tell me if I could be cursed even though the spirit was good? Could it just be a coincedence or a bad run?



Thanks :)

First off curses don't exist and you don't know if the spirit was good. People make the decisions to do bad things, don't blame the ouija board for peoples dumb mistakes.

Depends on what sort of cosmic viewpoint you have.  I'm inclined to believe that we influence the events we experience, and some experiences are simply unavoidable.  (I believe our families experiences are repeated by us as we go through life.)  Using an Ouija board can have the potential for risk, so I'd suggest you consult with your local Wiccan retailer.  The good ones should offer Tarot readings that can help figure out what is going on with you.  Good luck.

Well think about it...

The type of kids who play with ouija boards aren't your typical goody goody, top button, bible bashing kids...

I don't think it's a curse. Bad things happen to people.

Take me for example. In one year I lost my father, grandfather, became depressed and self harmed, failed my college (high school) year and now am having to do an extra one. Before this I was a straight A student. This is all because of my fathers early death which has turned my life upside down.

I've never played with any paranormal stuff, never smoked drugs, never had sex, I was a Christian until 2 or 3 months ago yet my life seems to have been completely shattered by one event that triggered others.

Bad stuff happens to everyone. Don't blame it on a curse, because it isn't. It's coincidence.

Those things would have happened to all of you regardless.

We make choices for ourselves every day. 
And sometimes those choices aren't the smartest ones.
But you can't change the past, but you can change your future with making better decisions.

The two on drugs.....what is their family life like?
Do their parents drink, use drugs, been in trouble with the law because of alcohol or drugs? 
Is there abuse in the families? An overbearing matriarch or patriarch? Is either parent addicted to food or sex that you know of?

The ones having unprotected sex........young love. A pricey mistake for not taking better precautions.

The thing about being a teen is that you want your freedom, but yet too bullheaded to know there are consequences for your actions.
So if you want to be treated like an adult, then start acting like one.

Cultures from around the world, for example the Celts and Norse, believed that spirits of all sorts could go between our world and theirs. They believed that some spirits were benign (as in they didn't really care to affect humans) others were beneficial (this is especially true of ancestral spirits) and still some were malicious (meaning they "cursed" people can caused bad things to happen).

From the point of view of these ancient cultures, such spirits provided an explanation and even a scape goat to all the bad stuff in life - why people died when they were young (including infants and their mothers at child birth) why crops wouldn't grow well some years, why people got sick, why there were wars and so forth.

Today we realize that the vast majority of the "bad" stuff that happens is caused by events usually out of our own control - but events that are perfectly mundane and rationally explainable.



In all likelihood the bad things that have happened to you and your former friends are probably just things that happened do to poor choices and circumstance. Each action we make in life has its own reaction that dictate the path in life we take. We all have our vehicals that we use in the journey of life, neither are right or wrong. But they take us to different places, for better or worse. Some turn to drugs and a life of crime. Some are simply the victims of circumstance - on the wrong road at the wrong time, but the same time as a drunk driver.

Could you have been affected by spirits from when you younger? Its possible. But think of it this way - by putting the blame on that source not only are you scape goating yours and your friend's problems, you are empowering that by allowing it to dictate your life. Suddenly if it is a spirit, then you can say that anything bad that happens is a result of it and not poor judgement, or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

In my opinion saying any spirit is to blame for your troubles is not a good idea. Take control of your own life. Look at where you are now, the actions you've made and what actions you can take to find a better quality life. Then no words of wisdom will mend your soul if you do not follow through on those actions.



Often times the most affective banishment is not through prayer or occult rituals, but action. More over the action to take control of your life, own up to all that you do and do what it takes to life well.

It's a coincidence, and not that much of one either.  An ouija board is a piece of cardboard.  You might as well blame your mirror, the stove, or the Bible for your bad run.  You and your friends made some bad choices, but you made them yourselves, just like everyone else who made a bad choice.  The ouija board works through the ideomotor effect - you're moving it yourself, whether you realize it or not.  This is very easy to prove using a blindfold and a friend.

There is plenty of evidence to suggest that playing around with the Ouija board can have dire consequences. One must be prepared and know how to handle any spirit that may appear as even the bad ones come disguised in light. The word Lucifer means Light Bringer. Check it out: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer

We all have the will power to accept or deny whatever we wish.



I don't believe you and you friends were cursed, more to the point you have allowed an over active imagination to influence your life. Think about it, with so much media influence in today's world, sometime in your past you would have either read a book, seen a movie or been told bad stories about the dangers of the Ouija board. You can think and  think but right now when you need to know you can't remember when you would have done so.



Any so called run of bad luck could have happened any time any place regardless if you played with the board or not.



My advice is forget what happened, you cannot change the past. If you keep thinking of it and any bad luck, you are giving it power over your life.



Start thinking positive look to a brighter, happier future and you will be surprised how your life turns around for the better.
