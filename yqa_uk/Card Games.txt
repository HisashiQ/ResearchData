Where can I print my own Taboo game cards?



Hi, I would like to print my own taboo game cards. Can someone recommend a site that would allow me to print/make custom taboo cards at a moderate price? I would like the cards to look professional and to look as close to the real cards as possible. In case you don't know what taboo cards look like, here's a picture.

This is a strange view on religion it is derived from the idea of "summoning" monsters in this case Pokemon in Japanese known as pocket monsters so sometimes people think that it teaches their kids to summon demons and defy god. however this is just a delirious attack on things parents sometimes fail to understand. you will not burn in hell for playing Pokemon.

Hi,Please read this,coz i spent a long long time on it.
In Texas Holdem Poker, there will always be a white marked disc on the table called the dealer button. This button determines which player acts last in that hand. It moves from player to player in a clock-wise direction after each hand so that the player who acts last continually changes.



To get each hand started, the two players to the left of the dealer button are required to make forced bets. These are called the small blind and the big blind. For example, if you were sitting on a $4/$8 Fixed Limit game and you were directly to the left of the button, you would have to pay the small blind which would be $2 (half the minimum bet). The player to your left will then pay the big blind of $4 (the minimum bet).



The dealer will then deal each player two cards face down. The cards must remain on the table, so to view them simply lift up the edges without showing any of your competing players.



It is now the player after the big blind’s turn to act. Their option is to call the bet from the big blind, which would be $4, or to raise the bet which would be $8. Of course the other option is to fold and simply hand your cards to the dealer face down. This would indicate that you’re no longer part of the game.



After everyone has had a chance to call, raise or fold, the dealer will then deal the Flop. The Flop is the first three cards shown on the table. Remember, action in Texas Holdem moves in a clock-wise direction and always starts with the player to the left of the button.



After the Flop, another round of betting takes place. For this round, you may hear the phrase, “check”. Checking means that you want to stay in the game but don’t want to bet and you don’t want to fold. Don’t forget though that once someone makes a bet, you can no longer check. You must either call, raise or fold.



After this betting round, the fourth card will be dealt and is commonly known as the Turn. The first player to act will either check or bet. Based on the strength of your cards and the action before you, you may want to check, bet, raise or fold. Finally, the fifth card or the River card will be dealt. Just like in previous rounds, there will be action in the form of checking, betting, calling, raising and folding.



It’s important to note that in a Limit game, for example $4/$8 Limit, the minimum bet increases to $8 on the Turn and the River cards. However, in a No Limit game there is No Limit to the amount you can bet – at any point in time any player can go ‘all in’ and bet all their chips.



Now don’t forget that in Texas Holdem, you can use any combination of five cards. That means that you can use one, both or none of your own cards to make the best five-card Poker hand. It goes without saying that whatever you can do, the other players can as well. So remember that they too can use any combination of cards from the board and the cards in their hands.



At the showdown, the dealer will ask you to turn your cards over to see who the winner is. For example, if the community cards are two Aces, a King, a Three and a Seven and there are two remaining players in the hand - Player A with an Ace and a King and Player B with a King and a Three, then player A would win as they have a Full House.



If you don't get anything just ask your friends.If they aren't your friends they won't help you.

I think the most important thing is to know your hand rankings.
(from best to worst)
Royal flush = 10, j, q, k, a, of the same suit
Straight flush = 5 consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g. 6,7,8,9,10)
Four of a kind = 4 cards of the same value
Full House = 3 cards of one value, 2 of another value (e.g. a,a,a,k,k)
Flush = 5 cards of the same suit
Straight = 5 consecutive cards (different suits)
3 of a kind = 3 cards of the same value
2 pair = 2 cards with the same value, another two cards with the same value (e.g. a,a,k,k)
One pair = 2 cards with the same value
High card = highest card wins (if no-one has any of the above)



Usually, aces count as high, but you can count them as a one if you have a,2,3,4,5 to make a straight.



As for playing techniques, as it's no money involved, play as many hands as possible and try to get a feel for what sorts of hands are good in different situations.

it is impossible to learn how to play poker and get any idea of your opponents playing styles when no money is involved, example being if you have a pair of 5's and are playing for nothing why not go all in cause if you lose so what. try putting $2000 on it and then try make the same decision.. My point is you will never learn this game unless you play for money even if it is only a bit

Just go and signup for one of the no deposit bonuses - in example PokerStrategy is a good place to start, its not a poker room, but a poker school, they give you a 150$ no deposit bonus to the selected room, so you dont need to invest your own money, and they have lots of theory lessons and handy poker software on there website, that is especialy useful for starting players.
To receive the bonus you need to pass a theory quiz, it might be annoying but it will make you only better, especialy if your new to poker. So give it a try:
http://www.pokerstrategy.com/u8538Z
If you will play there - would be great if you use my refferal link, they have a nice "Friends" program there, that gives you a 10$ to 100$ bonus for each reffered player, depending on how much they play.



An advice - when playing with the bonus money, look at the money  received as if it was your own money, dont spare it easy mindly, cause otherwise you will loss.

I'm 14 And Want To Sell My Old Trading Cards But...?



But I don't know how to or where to sell them. I want to sell them on eBay but I need a credit card to sell them online. And I can't sell them to any card shop in the area (or should I say the whole state of CT) because they don't buy cards off of people. I have a bunch of Pokemon cards that I collected not to long ago that I would like to sell, and I have alot of rare ones. So..yeah. How would I sell these things?!?

Best thing to do is have your parents create an account for you on ebay, and have them use one of their cards for you, then once the money is transferred to their card, they can take it out and give it to you in the form of cash. Or, you could ask your parents to make a bank account for you, and you can get your own debit card.

Well, your best bet really is going to be e-bay.  Maybe ask your parents if they will set you up an accout (or make one for themselves and help you sell the cards).  I'm really surprised that no-one buys cards in your area.  You can also try Craigs List... it is a free listing and I dont think you need a credit card for it.  However, before choosing a selling price, go on a site like ebay and see what others are getting for the same ones so that you can be competitive.  Just remember, if someone buys something, you are responsible for shipping it out to them... it is illegal other wise (I know you already know this).  I would say to try craigs list, while you may not get as good of a sale as on e-bay you may not need your parents help to be able to sell there.  Good luck!

The best way to sell my baseball card collection?



I have well over 10,000 baseball cards that range from the late 70's to the early 2000's. I would really like to sell them as they are taking  up space and I could use a few extra dollars. How can I find out what they're worth and what my best bet would be for selling them? I live in Chicago if that might help.

Well, to be honest, that depends on a few things.



1) Are you fat?
2) Are you considered unpopular?
3) Do you love the @#$% out of anime and manga?
4) Do you have lots of acne?
5) Is your hair greasy?
6) Do you have virtually no friends?
7) Do you wear a lot of the same color? Black, in particular?



If you answered yes to any of these questions, then the answer is most likely "No," however, in most peoples' eyes, you are already weird and it will not matter to them if you do play/watch/enjoy Yu-Gi-Oh! in any way, shape, form, or manner.



Picture examples:



http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/42308...
http://www.blogodoom.com/images/debian_g...
http://www.devicepedia.com/wp-content/up...
http://www.geekculture.com/photogallery/...



Do any of these remind you of yourself? If so, then no, it's not going to be considered "weird," but you are.



However, if you're the kind of girl with long, blond hair, a pink sweater and a jean mini-skirt, then yes, that is very weird and you are a goddess in the eyes of all nerdy children who look upon you and gaze in awe as they are filled with slight hope in their hearts as they



think, "We're... we're not completely weird..."



Picture examples:



http://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6d...
http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Art...
http://www.nbc.com/Age_of_Love/images/ph...



Do any of these remind you of yourself? If so, then yes, it is considered "weird."



...but, like I said, if you're the "unpopular," "tom-boy," "fat," "filthy," "disgusting," and ... just sometimes plain creepy type of person, then it's not weird at all, however, you yourself are weird.



Now, I am speaking austerely through the mouth of the public human body. These reflect my opinions in NO sense or matter. If you were to ask this question in the form of requesting my opinion, I would've stated: "Most people may think it's weird, but I think it's pretty cool. DUEL?!?"



But, as you can see, that was not your question, and that is not your answer.



I know I am looking way too much into this, but it's 1:45 AM and I really don't feel like sleeping.



Hope I helped! :D

When I use to play in tournaments I was playing against 40 year olds. There is nothing wrong with this as Yu-Gi-Oh! is only considered a child's card game by all of the people who are too stupid to comprehend the rules. You usually see these people begging for money at your local schoolyard.



It's perfectly normal and you should just do what you like best. Although, if you don't like people much then you must have a tough time in tournaments (unless they are little kids that cheat all of the time).

So. Like really, who cares. It's your interest and what is werid about it. It's a hobby and bobbies range from all sorts of things that attract the attention of all ages and both genders.



I'm 17 years old and have basically played since the game was released. Most of my friend also play and they are my age to. No-one really cares. YuGiOh mey be considered a nerdy obsession, but ultimately what impact does your playing have on people that are not interested.

This is the main, side and extra to my Zombie deck after Crossroads of Chaos of course. So feel free to rate and fix, especially with the side deck. I need 1 more card. I am debating between Neo-Spacian Grand Mole or Snipe Hunter, so which should be the 15th card in my side deck? Don't tell me to add Il Blud or Imperial Iron Wall and don't tell me to take out EEV. lol So any suggestions?

It is a very rare card--I was amazed as hell when I bought about 20+ TDGS packs and managed to pull one out--but I don't think that that makes up for its virtual state of being a god among monsters.

It is still too early to call, after all, the next Forbidden/Limited List is not going to be out until March 2009.



I would say it would probably be Limited or Semi-Limited at best. More likely Limited to 1 since it is like a Monster form of Brain Control.

Please do not give me bull like 'That's way too many cards!'. I tried to stay around 40 but after building it, the lowest I came up with was 45. Then I realized I could not get my big monsters out without more support, so I added on to get a total of 48 cards.



</question>



<additional details>



wshao55: What do you mean by adding more 'powerful' monsters? Vandalgyon and Voltanis have 2800 ATK each. Stratos and Harvest Angel have 1800 ATK each. Breaker has 1900 or 1600 ATK. Plus, all of these monsters have sweet effects, especially Diamond Dude, he is the heart of this deck's functionality.



Joey L: Yes, I have realized that many people are jerks and post up s**t that is totally irreverant to what the person is asking. You did, however, waste some time typing your answer out since I already knew that fact. There are some people who do actually help a bit, one of those being me. Everytime I see a bad deck and a good rating on it, I give the person who gave the good rating on the bad deck a thumbs down. Do not worry, I test my decks extensively, and I know whether if it is good or not. I just post them on here for others' input.

...not to good with the monsters...but when i look at the spell and trap cards they are really good( they make me think that you could have a good chance of winning). i would rate a 2 out of 10 for the monsters and a 10 out of 10 for the spell and trap cards and for the total maybe about a  1/2 out of 10 and i would suggest a little more powerful monsters

Im sorry for posting this and gaining points but Im just gonna tell you something that may or may not be useful to you.



Look When you ask people to rate or help you with your deck they're gonna help by making you deck more of a deck they would play.  This, can help you and it can really hurt you.  Every player has a different style.  You built your deck the way you built it and you should be satisfied with it.  If your not satisfied with it, test it out first, if you win alot more than you lose, then most likely theres place for minor improvements.  If you lose more, then you must look at your cards and find what you're doing wrong.



Basically when your asking for rates and etc, you always gonna get bs in someway even if you can't see it.  My advice is to just play and fix your deck yourself and believe in yourself.  This is a game, and winning is not important in this game;  If you focused on making decks to win, then you'd be not having fun.  This game should be for fun.



Have fun dueling.  And again I apologize for putting bs thats completely unrelated to your question.
