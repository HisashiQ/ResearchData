Why do some people believe they have won lotteries when they haven't even bought tickets?



I've heard of people being scammed by con artists who send emails telling them they have won lotteries. Why do people fall for these scams? One would think that a little bit of common sense would tell them that they would have to actually buy a lottery ticket in order to win a lottery!

What is the best staking plan for horse racing?



I have come up with a pretty consistent method of picking favourites for the place. Only small returns, but very infrequent losses. I am now looking for a staking plan to go with the system. Can anyone suggest a plan that would be suitable for a system that has low returns, but very low losing streaks?

Increase by one unit after each winner

Probability in lottery-type game.?



Suppose a card game is based on the rules of a lottery. The draw picks 5 cards at random from the 52-card deck. A player draws 5 cards at random from a different deck.



How does one calculate the odds of:
1.) Matching one, some, or all of them with both rank and suit to the draw? (Think of this as a lottery with 52 numbers)
2.) Matching just the card ranks of the player hand to the draw? (4 suits, each with cards ranked 1-13)
3.) Matching just the card suits of the player hand to the draw? (13 cards to each suit)



I'd like to know how to calculate the chances of getting 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cards matched in each of these scenarios. Remember, the player gets any five cards from one deck, while the five cards drawn come from a separate deck.

If you're referring to an actual gambling site...that's illegal.



If you're referring to playing for valuless points, almost any games site I've ever heard of has some form or other of poker. In any case, if the kid has a hotmail/MSN account, (s)he can (possibly) play there, and the same here with Yahoo.



However, if the site has a minimum age restriction, he can't.



If (s)he absolutely has to play poker, buy him/her a CD with a poker game on it.



Good Luck



P.S.: Personally, I'd not do it, and discourage my kids from gambling before 18 in any case.

A question about hold'em starting hands...?



I know that the order of hands in each grouping is not that important, but I still can't help but to notice that all the lists put J10suited as a better starting hand than QJsuited.  Now clearly heads up you would want the lower ranked hand, but why do they consider J10 to play slightly better over all?

There is no Yahoo lottery, that is a 419 scam.
I have the same emails right now in my inbox. They will try to get you to send them money via Western Union, and you will never receive any of the supposed prize money. It is basically advance fee fraud. Do a Google search for "nigerian 419 emails" and you can read all about them.

Can you sue an indian casino for slip/fall injurys?



My mom slipped and fell in the bathroom because of a wet floor. The floor was wet because of the water from the bathroom and the person who was supposed to clean up started to after the injury occurred. She was sent to the hospital for back injurys (she has had a hstory of back problems, this only made it worse) we do have the name of a witness. This is an indian casino. So im wondering, is it at all possible to sue them and get a compensation or something?

I work security for an Indian casino. all our reports. (don't know if the other casino will be the same) say what/how they fell and got hurt. so there "should" be a record that the floor was wet.



but keep in mind we have lawyers that get paid over 100K a year. for anything that might come up. also, it will be hard to find a lawyer that will go Fight an Indian casino. if they are, as my casino is a sovereign nation then it will be 10x harder. . . I can't say to much because of the nature of my job, but I can tell you it does happen. often time the Casino is at fault. (like in your case) sometimes they do win, but It's very VERY rare.



the pre existing will make it that much harder.



to be honest, try to find a lawyer that will work on Contingency, this basically means that if you don't get paid, they don't get anything. this will mean you are not out anything



unfortunately you are in a bad place, best of luck to you. . . as much as I hate it, I see a lot of people that end up getting screwed. that in my opinion  should of got something.



best of luck to you.

it shouldn't matter if it's Indian or not. It's a place of business and if there wasn't a "wet floor" sign, you have a  legitimate case.

<question>



Are online lottery services scams?



Has anyone tried those online lottery services where they buy the lottery tickets for you (for example if you live in UK but want to play lottery in USA)? Do they really send you the prize if you win? What online lottery service would you recommend?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I'm sure there are some that actually work out there.  But just as many that are scams.



The ones I've seen that look legitimate still seem like a rip off.



If you live in the UK, you have access to one of the best lotteries in the world.  The odds are nice and low (about 14m-1) and the prizes are in pounds, and are tax free.



The US for example, has both Powerball and Mega Millions that you could feasibly play though a service.



However, both these lotteries are over 140m-1 odds of winning.



So even if the prize is say $150m, that's not the whole story.  First off, in America they lie about the prize for marketing purposes.  The real prize in this example would be $5,755,000 per year for 26 years.  And the government is going to take at least 35% off you in taxes before you even get your money.  So suddenly $150m becomes $1.92m a year (or Â£1.08m).  Still nice money, but keep in mind that the jackpot typically starts at one tenth of that amount and builds up over time.  If you won a non-rollover jackpot you'd be looking at a prize of Â£2.8m paid over 26 years.  Whereas the British jackpot would have been ten time easier to win, and you'd get all your money in one go.



Then of course you have the cost of buying tickets.  The exchange rate is kind to you in that you can almost buy two tickets for every pound, but by the time you have paid the agency to buy your tickets for you and then ship them to you, you would lose that advantage, almost certainly paying the equivalent of at least Â£1.50 per ticket.



Finally, there could be legal trouble ahead.  If you did win, you then have to claim your prize, and the lottery may determine that you broke the law by not being in the US to buy your ticket.  I don't know how well these agencies would support you.  With millions of dollars on the line, how honest would they be?  Would they want a cut of your prize?  Could you trust them with that kind of money?



As far as I am concerned, if you live in the UK, you are far better off playing the domestic lottery.  You are ten times more likely to win, your prize is payable in a lump sum with no tax.  And your ticket purchase helps good causes in the UK.



There would be no advantage to trying to do this.

I think because here in UK anyway, long before the title Bingo it was called Housey Housey. When I was young (by the way I am not an oap yet) you played Housey Housey or Bingo as you now call it at the fairground for prizes.  If you won a line you received a small gift and if you got a full house the man would yell "Pick of the stall" and you chose from an array of things like, mirrors, ornaments, kitchen ware, dolls cuddly toys etc.

TPGK on drawy board.. ?



Its 6 max, 5/10. Oppenent is utg+1, you are on the CO. Effective staks are 1070.



You have KcQs. Utg+1 is TAG and he raises to 30.  You havent seen him do anything stupid. The table has been kinda tight except for some shorstacker, so you have been raising a decent bit in late position. You have 3-bet villian a few times, and he has folded every time except once. This time, you dont 3-bet b/c you are almost sure he will never call with worse and will always call with better. You just call, and unsuprisingly every1 else folds.



Pot is 75. Flop is Ks Ts 9c. He bets 50. I am sooo tempted to raise for protection. However, the only worse hand calling is KJ and AsXs. KJ is calling, AsXs-raising or calling. All other hands have better equity than us and will never fold. So i resisted my urges and just called.



Turn is a 5d. Pot is 175. He bets 125. What do you do? He rarely 2 barrells btw.



If you say call, what is your plan on the river?



If you say fold, dont you think you are being too passive??

ok i'll go through this hand step for step as usual



pre-flop is pretty standard



as played, i think both a raise and a call on the flop have their merits, but in the end i think the call is probably the best play, since you could possibly be beat by A-K or a set, or otherwise your opponent has a pair probably with a dead straight draw, so there's no need to raise



since he rarely fires the second bullet, this turn decision becomes very very tough...there's a lot of reason to just give him credit for a big hand and fold, but since you did just call the flop he may not give you credit for a king and fire again with a hand like J-J...i think in the end the best play is to call, because you are in position and if he fires a third shell you can probably fold the hand safely...if a blank comes and he checks to you, then you can make the decision of whether to go for a possible value bet or to just show it down

The probability is 50% you'll win and 50% you won't.
There are a lot of factors that contribute to this that it's hard to make assumptions for equations.
See, some lottos are built to manipulate you.
They make you think that to have more chance of winning, you should bet more to have more advantages on others which is some how true, but not very accurate.
I don't know anyone personally who has won a million dollars, but I know some relatives who have won amounts from casinos in Vegas.
They say it's luck, a little mastery of the "sport", and some "talent".
I don't really know. The movie "21" is about how they controlled Vegas and casinos. Watch it, maybe.

When playing online poker is it useful to use pot odds?



I've been playing poker palace on myspace for a while now and some of the hands that come up and don't come up are outrageous. It seems to me that using pot odds on online poker is a waste of time.



At least when you're playing in reality you know there is only 52 cards in play.

Pot odds are essential in poker.  But if you are playing some kind of children's poker on MySpace, then don't expect a real game.



The poker I've seen on MySpace or Facebook is not real poker at all.  I've no idea why anyone would play it, when you can go on a real site and play for free.



But pot odds, when compared with your drawing outs, will tell you if it is mathematically correct to call a bet.  If you don't keep a track of your outs, relative to your bet size, then you are asking for trouble, and you are going to consistently be making the wrong play mathematically.  If you are going to be another player on the site, don't be another fish.

Absolutely. Play full odds on the pass line and full odds on your come bets. Some casinos give you 10 times odds. - if your table is hot you should rake in a big win.

I would say this is Betfair casino, This is a whole gambling site with casino sports and poker. And some exchange games. Now about the casino- Its 50/50 casino, the only one in the world with 50/50 chance for the player to win. The other casinos has house advantage.It's of course safe and secure- its english. Won 2 times the Queens Award for Innovations. You can read more about Betfair casino at http://www.bettingwise.com/betfaircasino...

It depends what you are looking for.  If you like a sportsbook, poker room, casino, and racebook in one, I'd like Bookmaker.  Intertops is also another great room.  Doyle's Room is good, as well.  It's software is poker-based, but they also have table games, slots, video poker, etc.  But they do not have a sportsbook.  Read the reviews of each at http://dagus-statistics.com/reviews.htm and decide which site suits you best.  You'll also find articles on secure deposit and withdrawal methods as well as free daily sports picks.  Hope this helps.

Funny story: my sister is going through a goth stage, and her boyfriend, who's also goth, actually hosts a midnight poker game on a regular basis!  They play by candlelight with moody, depressing music in the background and drink absynthe and try to convince each other that poker isn't conformist!  Which is strange, because almost all of them use little crystal skulls as their card protectors.  I was invited to one and showed up in a Hawaiian shirt with an 18 pack of Busch and whipped 'em all.  NOTHING is funnier than some 19 year old boy wearing two pounds of eyeliner trying to stare you down because you just raised him all in.  I spent half the night laughing, whether I was bluffing or not.  For some reason I haven't been invited back.  I'll play with you at midnight, just leave the Type O Negative at home.

Alright, I'm not a gambler :-p  But, I've been to the casino a few times when I was 21.

I don't know what the bets are (maybe $5 and above), but regarding the chips:  You sit at the table, put your money on the table.  During the next round, the dealer will take your money and give you your money's worth of chips, and you begin to play.

Usually in a poker room, there will be a cage near the table, you give them the money and get your starting stack there.  The dealers don't have a ton of chips at the table, since the players are playing against each other.

As far as how much at a table, then totally depends on the stakes you are playing.

The No Limit tables will have a maximum that you can bring to the table.  Might be 300 at a 1/2 table.  Ask before you buy in.

Hiya guys, quick gambling question. Can I get a shoe dealt game of blackjack in the U.K.?



I enjoy blackjack very much as it is simple and gives the house a relatively small edge compared to most games but the one thing I truly hate is the mechanical card shuffler sat at the table.  On a recent trip to Vegas it was great to see the casino use a shoe as it gave the table a nicer feel and I didn't have to look at a depressing grey box on my table, also it reduces the calls from disgruntled punters that the box has somehow rigged the cards (hard to believe but people still claim this is true).  And before you all rush to assume I just want to count cards you should all know that basic strategy and a sound betting pattern will work wonders with the auto shufflers, my reason for finding a shoe game is purely aesthetic.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

There are a lot of ways to make money online, however many of them are simply scams. They make money by selling you a product you pay for, then you sell the same thing to other people.



Beware of any site where you have to pay anything upfront with a promise of huge returns. It just does not happen that way.

Here is a legitimate site where you can make some money. You won't get rich, but you can pick up some spending cash.

i've never played before but i can understand that it is easier to blame someone else than accept that they are bad at playing or just lost some of their money.  no one goes to casinos to lose money.  i understand it isnt your fault, but who else will irresponsible people blame?  also, some dealers can be rather callous.  you isolate yourself, which is understandable, but that rubs the unlucky the wrong way.

People just need someone to blame for their own faults. I catch a lot of flak also from people who buy hundreds of dollars worth of scratch tickets and don't win a penny back. They seem to think that I'm keeping the winning tickets to myself.

I play regularly on Poker Stars and Full Tilt.  Either option is great for real money play.  Read the reviews of each at http://poker-lobby.com to decide which site suits you best.  There are also secure deposit/withdrawal tips as well as bonus codes for each site.  Stars and Tilt are the world's biggest poker sites, have the most game options at any stake you can think of.  Each site has their own little quirks that some people prefer over others.  Hope this helps.

http://www.pokerstars is a good site to play for money as well as full tilt.  However, the site that I like to use to get a lot of practice is http://www.spadeclub.com and that is because for a flat fee of $19.99 per month, you can play in unlimited poker tournaments and win real cash.  If you want to try out the site, use the promo code ACESFULL and you can play on there for two weeks for free.  I've won a few tournaments on there and have had no problems cashing out. The site is sponsored by Cardplayer magazine and is totally legal in the USA.

Poker Stars and Full Tilt are probably the most popular in America.

They both have plenty of games, lots of members, can be trusted, and have a number of celebrity players.

I've had accounts with both since 2004 (or perhaps 2003), and I've never had any issues with them.

he next time you are in the casino stop and listen when you approach the table games. From the craps pit you will probably hear whooping and hollering as you see high-fives and other animated gestures coming from the players. Craps is by far the most exciting game in the casino and the players are not afraid to let their emotions show. The game is fast moving and at times very loud. It is for this reason that craps is probably the most intimidating game to new players. If you feel this way you are not alone. Many players would like to learn how to play craps but the thought of approaching a craps table scares them.



It was a few years into my casino visits before I decided to find out what this game was all about and learn how to play craps. I knew that a pass line bet in craps with its low house edge of 1.41 percent made it one of the best bets in the casino. This gave me the incentive to take the plunge and learn how to play craps. It was a decision that I have never regretted. I love playing craps and over the years I have introduced many friends to this exciting game.



Craps is not as confusing as it looks. It actually is an easy game to learn. An understanding of the basics of the game and how to make a passline bet will get you started on your way. You donât have to be concerned with any other of the craps bets when you begin to play craps. There are about 40 different bets that can be made on a craps layout but most of them like the proposition and hardway bets have terrible odds that you should avoid. To get started playing craps, all you need to understand is the basic passline bet



Passline Bet
A simple passline bet works like this. You place your bet on the passline before a new shooter begins his roll. This is known as the come out roll. If the shooter rolls a 7 or 11 you win. If the shooter rolls a 2, 3 or 12, you lose. If the shooter rolls any other number, that number becomes the point number. The shooter must roll that number again before a seven is rolled. If that happens, you win even money for your passline bet. If a seven is rolled before the point number is rolled again, you lose.



Example
A new shooter rolls the dice for the first time and they land on a 4 and a 2. The total is six, which becomes the "Point." The dealers places a marker that looks like a hockey puck on the number 6 on the craps layout. The shooter must now roll a six before he rolls a 7. If he rolls the six, the passline bet wins and the shooter rolls again. This is a new comeout roll and the same procedure applies as the first time the shooter rolled the dice.



If the shooter rolls a seven before the six the pass line bet loses and the dice are passed to the next shooter.



Odds Bet
Once the point is established the bettor can make an additional bet behind the passline bet. This is known as the "Odds Bet." It is the only bet in the casino that does not have a house edge as it is paid off with true odds.



Most casinos offer double odds, which means you can make a bet twice the size of your pass line bet. If you passline bet is $5 you are allowed to make an odds bet of $10.



The odds bet is paid as following:
If the point is 4 or 10 it pays 2 to 1
If the point is 5 or 9 it pays 3 to 2
If the point is 6 or 8 it pays 6 to 5.



A passline bet is the simplest bet you can make on at the craps table and it will get you on your way to playing this exciting game.



An easy way to learn how to play craps is to take advantage of the free lessons offered by many of the casinos. The instruction will give you the basics and also show you some of the table etiquette that will make you feels more comfortable approaching the table.

This site seems to explain the details very well:



http://www.ildado.com/craps_rules.html



Yeah, I've always had a tough time knowing the nuances of craps, but whether playing online or in a real casino, craps is has one of the better odds, i.e. better chance to beat the house, so it's one of the better games to play (as opposed to roulette which is has lousy odds).



I certainly don't know the details of how the game but basically the major bets you place are the Pass Line Bet or Don't Pass Line (which refer to the sum of the dice roll).  These are the most simple bets and the beauty of craps is that you can potentially go through a number of rolls before you "crap out," so it's fun.



The more intricate "inside bets" don't have very favorable odds, so even though I'm hardly experienced in craps, I tend to avoid these bets.



Check out the site and I recommend starting out with low wages using simple pass/don't pass and get a sense of how you like the game.  It's very dynamic and fun, but to really take full advantage of the player's odds you really need to know the intricacies of the odds (I sure as hell don't).



So check out the site I linked and play conservatively at first, but as you get more sophisticated you'll be able to enjoy it and optimize your advantage.



Just remember one critical thing (and this applies to all casino games):  mathematics ensures that the longer you play, the more likely you will lose, no matter what the game (unless you know the tricks, e.g. card-counting and so forth).



Just playing using the rules for an extended period of time is guaranteed to be in the house's favor, unless you really know how to game the system, which is a skill that I don't have but professional gamblers have.  I'm not sure what sorts of "system gaming" tactics apply to craps, but I imagine there must be some.



I wish you great prosperity.

Too much to explain so sending you to school via this link... good luck.



As for rolling numbers you can roll till you crap out but will lose the numbers if you don't take your money before crapping out. The odds on each number depend on the frequency of how many combos of the number you are rolling for can be made on the dice. 7 and 11 have the most ways I believe , followed by 6 and 8. So those numbers come up more often when rolling the dice.
Hard ways mean only one way can be made.. those are the doubles.  Odds on those 30 to 1.

How do you bet in craps?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



he next time you are in the casino stop and listen when you approach the table games. From the craps pit you will probably hear whooping and hollering as you see high-fives and other animated gestures coming from the players. Craps is by far the most exciting game in the casino and the players are not afraid to let their emotions show. The game is fast moving and at times very loud. It is for this reason that craps is probably the most intimidating game to new players. If you feel this way you are not alone. Many players would like to learn how to play craps but the thought of approaching a craps table scares them.



It was a few years into my casino visits before I decided to find out what this game was all about and learn how to play craps. I knew that a pass line bet in craps with its low house edge of 1.41 percent made it one of the best bets in the casino. This gave me the incentive to take the plunge and learn how to play craps. It was a decision that I have never regretted. I love playing craps and over the years I have introduced many friends to this exciting game.



Craps is not as confusing as it looks. It actually is an easy game to learn. An understanding of the basics of the game and how to make a passline bet will get you started on your way. You donât have to be concerned with any other of the craps bets when you begin to play craps. There are about 40 different bets that can be made on a craps layout but most of them like the proposition and hardway bets have terrible odds that you should avoid. To get started playing craps, all you need to understand is the basic passline bet



Passline Bet
A simple passline bet works like this. You place your bet on the passline before a new shooter begins his roll. This is known as the come out roll. If the shooter rolls a 7 or 11 you win. If the shooter rolls a 2, 3 or 12, you lose. If the shooter rolls any other number, that number becomes the point number. The shooter must roll that number again before a seven is rolled. If that happens, you win even money for your passline bet. If a seven is rolled before the point number is rolled again, you lose.



Example
A new shooter rolls the dice for the first time and they land on a 4 and a 2. The total is six, which becomes the "Point." The dealers places a marker that looks like a hockey puck on the number 6 on the craps layout. The shooter must now roll a six before he rolls a 7. If he rolls the six, the passline bet wins and the shooter rolls again. This is a new comeout roll and the same procedure applies as the first time the shooter rolled the dice.



If the shooter rolls a seven before the six the pass line bet loses and the dice are passed to the next shooter.



Odds Bet
Once the point is established the bettor can make an additional bet behind the passline bet. This is known as the "Odds Bet." It is the only bet in the casino that does not have a house edge as it is paid off with true odds.



Most casinos offer double odds, which means you can make a bet twice the size of your pass line bet. If you passline bet is $5 you are allowed to make an odds bet of $10.



The odds bet is paid as following:
If the point is 4 or 10 it pays 2 to 1
If the point is 5 or 9 it pays 3 to 2
If the point is 6 or 8 it pays 6 to 5.



A passline bet is the simplest bet you can make on at the craps table and it will get you on your way to playing this exciting game.



An easy way to learn how to play craps is to take advantage of the free lessons offered by many of the casinos. The instruction will give you the basics and also show you some of the table etiquette that will make you feels more comfortable approaching the table.

How does a lottery syndicate work? Why does it "increase" the chance of winning?



I know a group of people come together and put forward their contributions thereby "increase their chances" of winning, but how does the maths work?



I mean, if 1000 people is a member of a syndicate how is this more of an "advantage" (as claimed by syndicates) compared to if each one of them goes and buy a ticket for themselves?



Thanks.

Expected value is the same.



But if you've got a piece of 1000 tickets, then you've got 1000 different chances to win.  If you win, you'll only win 1/1000 of the prize, instead of the whole thing, but if the prize is big enough, then even 1/1000 of the pool might be worth it to you.



</answer>



<asker's comment>



Thanks I think I got it now. It increases your chance of winning because you play everyone's numbers but any winning will be less because it'll be divided!

Hi hunn..
I'm not exactly sure what the two people who have already answered the question were watching..



But tonights lucky case number was 24.



I'm an avid that's life fan, so I'm stuck on deal or no deal! And the number definately wasn't 23-as said by someone else, as 23 was MY case number, and I was one off! :(
Anyway, it was definately 24,



Hope you had better luck than me!

You mentioned it only happens when you're online so here's another link..



http://support.microsoft.com/kb/909817/



In short, it may be your internet connection instead of the console that is making things lag or freeze up.. You connection may not be able to handle the max number of players.. at least at this time of night..



Hopefully, you'll find some useful information in one or both of the links provided as it's straight from XBox.com and they'd be the most qualified to know what to do..

When they are in the big blind (when the hand starts and no one raises preflop), and after the flop the player may check until one player bets - to see turn you must call, and same with the river it can be checked but if another player bets, you must call if you want to see which one of you has the better hand.
Basically you can check whenever there is not a bet made.

Help resolve this bet?



Last night I made a double or nothing bet to my girlfriend, tonight she bet me the Dodgers would win and I could do triple or nothing. I felt that there was no way I could lose 3 in a row. But now it looks like I did. The problem is I think triple or nothing means I have to do 3 of these, she says first I have to double the bet, then triple it. Who is right? Here is the original bet. I had to do one of the following three.



1. Wear panties for 30 days. She gets to pick them out. If you vote on this one, she will consider having me wear any suggestions on which styles to wear. Feel free to post pics.
2. Wear a girl costume to a halloween party we are going to. She will pick from the suggestions given. Feel free to post pics.
3. Get a pedicure with her everytime she goes until the Cowboys face the Redskins agian in Nov. Pick any color from this site. She says they will have most of these.

Okay for number one it would be now for 90 days you would have to wear panties.  For two I would have no idea how you could triple it unless you have to wear it for haloween and two days after.  And for number three it would be the third time the redskins and the cowboys play off so like in three years or so (I don't really know the scheduels.



Triple or nothing means that you triple the original bet if it is money you triple the amount, if it has something to do with time or length you triple it.  Or to make it less time for each you could ask her to make you do all three instead of doing lots of time.

well yes. there is one dealer but the dealer button goes around the table to each person playing cards.  the dealer button means that you place the last bet at the table or make the last decision during a round of betting. dealer button gives you the advantage in some cases just depends on how the hand is going.
