Thank you for putting up with this post.



I really do hope you get to keep your house. Many banks are willing to work with people in trouble now because it's a better deal for them to work something out with you than take your house and try to sell it.

As long as you reaffirm with the mortgage company you can keep the home. If you are behind on any payments ask if they can put them to the back of the loan so you can start making the payments on time.

IT depends on if it is your only asset and what equity there is in the deal.  Also they take into account if the property is jointly owned.  If the property is in negative equity or near it ( i.e. as regards the mortgage loan to value ) , then it is simply not a consideration. You need to work closely and compliantly with your insolvency administrator on this one to minimise that risk.

Yes, you can keep your home.  But you must continue to make the mortgage payments.



I actually had someone tell me that a bankruptcy excuses your mortgage and you can keep your home.  Sorry...doesn't work that way.

What it means is your home is protected from other creditors.  They can not force you to sell your home or other certain property to satisfy a debt.  Every state has a list of items excluded and the amounts.  Your attorney will explain this to you.

1. WHERE are you?  This question appears in multiple countries and laws vary even within some of them.
2. How much is the home worth?  Most laws allow you to keep SOME equity in the home, but there are often limits.
3.  Do you have a mortgage.  If you wish to keep the home, most laws require you to keep the mortgage.

If you'd lost your wallet, what would you want?

I would of handed it in. But call the person to tell them that you found their wallet and not to cancel their credit cards. Then either give it to the police or meet with the person to give them their wallet.

Either way, give it back.

Consolidating your credit card debt is actually one of the smartest decisions you could ever make. http://www.debtreduction123.net/  Credit card debt consolidation is ideal for anyone who is looking to have better credit now, and in the future. Consolidation is very common these days, and it is actually a sure way to combine your debt and make sure that you never get yourself too far in credit card debt.

Personal finance . motor vehicle finance claim?



hi everyone. has anyone had any experience with the new personal finance claims going about. The agents reckon most credit card agreements are illegal and unenforcable and for a fee of £495 they will fight your case and have the agreement cancelled - is this really possible? i've got a really expensive personal loan in april 2007 and car finance in august 2006. thank you



</question>



<additional details>



the company is called CARTEL CLIENT REVIEW . they do an initial assessment, if it is a winning claim they then ask for £495 fee which is refunded if your claim is unsuccessful. if you do succeed they keep 30% of the amount reclaimed. it would appear they only entertain cliams in excess of £5000. they seem to have a decent reputation on discussion forums and google. what do you guys think?



the agreement must be before 1st april 2007 for it to be (possibly) illegal

Your Grandmother lived through a different time...during the great depression many people lost everything when the banks went broke & inflation /deflation ripped the value of the currency.
Try existing today without one ! We live in the computerised age of electronic transfers etc etc  & the cashless society is almost upon us .Most people are now paid electronicly ...the days of receiving a weekly paypacket with cash are long gone as well.
So I guess for most of us we have no option but to deal with the mongrels ! lol

if you take care of your account, you don't have charges (if you pick the right bank). some banks charge a fee if you run your debit card as credit instead of debit, so logically, don't use your debit card! or always run it debit (or vice versa. it depends on the bank). they charge if you overdraft your account, so don't overdraw your account! always keep it positive!



if want to save money, then you're stupid for not putting it in a bank. it's FREE MONEY when it earns interest!



the only reason that people have problems with their accounts is because they don't know how to manage their money.

These days it is very hard to do without a Bank Account, though certainly not impossible. One major stumbling block is that the majority of employers now will only pay direct into a Bank Account.
You would find it impossible to get credit without a Bank account.

Do you really want to keep your savings in cash under the mattress?
In your Grandmothers day people were paid in cash and were mostly expected to pay cash for any purchase.

Get a bank account.  Your grandmother didn't live in a paperless, cashless society, which we are currently moving more and more towards (might not completely happen, but it's more likely than going back to a cash under the matress as a bank society).  Not sure how old you are, but when it comes time to accumulate assets like a house, car or any other substantial purchase or to start saving for the future, you'll need a bank acount and some sort of product that shows you have money coming in and money going out (showing the capacity to handle credit).

There are lots of financial institutions that don't charge for bank fees, depending on where you live.

Many utility companies charge you extra if you don't pay their bill by direct debit.
Are you always going to shop with cash?
Could you do without your overdraft or credit card?
Would your employer be willing to pay you in cash?

No fees, no debts, no charges, no hassle but also no loans and no mortgages.

If you don't like bank charges then don't incur them. Set yourself a weekly/monthly budget and stick to it. Check your account regularly - internet an phone banking give you 24/7 access to your accounts so there's no excuses.

I wash with cold water, I clean the house using cold water and minimal chemicals.  I don't flush the toilet every time I use it.  I make recycled paper logs for my woodburning fire.  I'd love a compost toilet but my husband won't agree.  I try to be frugal and it means we've paid our mortgage off in 12 yrs instead of 25.

I think my first principle is to measure my income by net and not by gross income.  It seems almost human nature to define income as the gross not the net income.  May have something to do with ego.  The danger in this "gross income" approach to personal finance is that you open yourself to more discretionary buying.  Examples:  buying a family motor vehicle without regard to real need for a replacement.  A home renovation that makes no financial sense.  A new kitchen for a 100K home could run 20 percent of the value of the property.  It just does not meet the "common sense" test.  My view is that these large purchases are more family budget critical than shopping price on a box of breakfast cereal.  But, a solid marriage in which there is general respect and agreement about money issues is the most important issue.  You cannot think savings before thinking about feelings of your entire family.  A selfish member in a family of four can be budget buster.  Even if it is the "baby" of the family who seems to know her special clout to smile for a toy or dress!

Do i need to make a minimum payment during an interest free period?



iv got a credit card with a balance of about £2000 to be paid off, but im on a 10 month interest free period. when i go to make a minimum payment online, it says my minimum payment i need to make is £0.

is this because you dont have to make any minimum payments during the interest free period? can i get a new card and transfer the balance to another interest free deal when it runs out?

Most likely you still need to make at least minimum payments.  If you just got your card or just did the balance transfer, it is possible that the first statement has not posted yet.  When I recently got a new card and did a 0% balance transfer, it took a couple of months before the first payment due showed up.

So keep an eye on it, because if you are late 1 or 2 payments, your 0% will go bye-bye.

OK - let's get this clear .... you are on an interest-free period - NOT a payment free period ..... your minimum payment is going to be deducted from the full amount (capital) that you owe - during the 10 months interest will not be calculated and added to your total on a daily, weekly or monthly basis - it won't be calculated and added at all ..... however you still owe the money used and so must at least service that financial amount by a small payment each month .... at the end of your 10 months if you haven't paid off all of the money then the card company is entitled to calculate and add interest to what you owe - which could be much more than £10 a month....:)

i would suggest contacting your credit card provider. in general even although its interest free the credit card company will still expect you to make monthly repayments. they may however as part of the terms & conditions allow you a repayment holiday. I would ckeck though to make sure. you can change your credit card provider at the end of your interest free period most people do. remember though that each time you do it leaves a footprint in your credit file. this is because any new provider will want to credit check you to make sure you are a reliable person and havent defaulted on any previous repayments. because of that its best not to change providers too quickly as this can lead to having an adverse credit score (the basis on which most financial institutions make their personal lending decisions) but 10 months is probably fine

I don't think companies can dictate like this .... at least I've never heard of it before .... in the UK, generally, people are not expected to take more than two weeks' holiday in one go without 'permission' but can take odd days off - so long as they don't clash with other employees (so that no-one can cover for you) or they don't conflict with a special time (like if you know major orders or something come in on a Friday) - even then there's usually discretion about allowing it ..... I would suggest you speak with a union rep or some other legal bod' who specialises in employment law .....

What country?  I guess it depends upon the type of work you do and whether they have to find someone to substitute for you when away.  That may be more difficult on a day by day basis.

We have 2 floating holidays that are normally intended to be taken at any time, but sometimes we are required to take them at a specific time when a regular holiday falls on Tuesday or Thursday (which does give us a 4 day weekend).

The annual vacation (or holidays) that you can take or the company you work with suggests you take should be based on the work contract you signed with them. I do know that some private companies can actually put a margin on the amount of time you can take off work as this can affect other staff members, your social insurance payments etc etc., as well as overtime for other members to cover your position. With small companies if you have a lot of days to take within a year it is harder to control workload if the employees take a lot of time off in dribs and drabs, so I can see the reason why this is imposed. My suggestion is to check your contract or with your HR/Personnel department.

Most companies have annual leave rosters for their staff drawn up so that works are not disrupted and cause inconveniences for them and their customers. That leave roster should be flexible so that staff can arranged among themselves to take certain holidays with their consent so that arrangements can be made. But asking staff to sign a contract is not a legal way to solve this problem.

In general a company guarantee's you a certain amount of holiday as one of the terms of employment in your contract. They rarely specify in the contract just how it is taken which gives them room to impose restrictions.  Some companies will shut up shop for 2 weeks in the Summer and and for a week at Xmas that is 3 weeks of your holiday allowance gone whether you like it or not.  Most companies are not over enthusiastic about holiday being taken in dribs and drabs, though they may not actually forbid it.

Personally, I'd suggest 7 years. Sounds excessive, but Mr Taxman can go back that far if you ever ever got into a dispute with him and he queried nature of receipts or of outgoings.  If you are in self -employment and need bank loans 3 years' audited a/cs are usually required and it's not uncommon for a certain amount of temporary transactions between personal and business activities to take place - in which which case bank statements can be a useful back-up.
For many day to day matters 2 years' should be sufficient.  Last I heard, banks charge a lot for issuing copy statements so the more you retain the better
I also find back statements a useful way of checking price increases ove a period of say 5 years - such a gas, electricity, water, council tax etc.  We are given a lot of bogus RPI figures by our leader - designed to deceive so it's useful to run over the last 5 years' statements and check on major items  - comparing our actual personal cost of living against Mr Brown's trickery.

ok this is a big one. I think what you should do is go to citizenens advice and ask them. They will be able to direct you. To a solisiter or back to the bank. I mean i can't see if you had absoloutly no knowledge of him doing this why you should have to pay it back. Surely they(the bank) should have seen you first before allowing a joint account and a loan to be given out. Whatever you do, fight agaist it,as you shouldnt have to be left with this. What about going to the police?

I believe possibility a forged signature or usually bank would like to see both person and identity for both person. If you prove you have knowledge for that account then you are not liable. On other side if you are lying then bank has every right to recover the money whatever means and you can go to jail. Usually banks are sympathtic but you have to prove you have no knowledge of that. Bank may ask you or can force you the details of your partner.

As long as you didn't sign any of the loan papers then you should not be liable.  It's good that you have opened a fraud investigation.  Ask the police about taking a sample of your handwriting to compare with the loan papers in order to prove the fraud.  I am not familiar with British Law but you may want to see a solicitor about the Bank messing with you.  Perhaps a letter from the solicitor will get them off of your back.

In Ireland, both people need to sign in person to open a joint account.  I'm sure it is the same in UK.  How did they get your signature fraudulently??  If perhaps they gave him the paperwork to bring home and he brought it back "signed", then they have not taken due care.  I'd be thinking of getting my own solicitor and see what grounds  I have to take action against them.  If nothing else, it is at least harassment.

The bank I work for requires both parties to be present and the signature cards must be witnessed by a bank employee.



We als have cameras everywhere and any transactions done at the bank are recorded.  The bank should have to prove the signature is not yours.

There is no such thing, legally, as a Joint Bank account without your knowledge as both parties have to sign opening documents and give specimen signatures. therefore if your partner has opened such an account by definition he has forged your signature and comitted a criminal offence.

If you did not sign any documents or give a specimen signature you have no liability. Write a formal letter to the Bank disclaiming all knowledge and tell them that an act of fraud has been commited and that you have reported the matter to the Police who require details from the bank to enable them to proceed with an investigation. Carry on to say while this is being done any further collection action by them is unwarranted harassment of an innocent party and that you will make a formal complaint to the banking Ombudsman if it continues. Send your letter by Recorded Delivery and keep a copy.

ABRACADA, Absolutely NO you do not back, It is not your hand writing, it is not your ID, so the Bank will have to prove that it is your bill and so far they cannot prove that so tell them to go to HELL.
Al so you can go after your Husband for fraud & forgeries so @ the moment you have nothing to fret about, and if they keep bothering you
then you let them know that they will be Herring from your solicitor, & you will have them off your back.

Clearly, this will depend on whether the signatures on the various account opening forms, loan applications etc are yours, or forgeries.  If the latter (and you can prove it) then I cannot see how you would be in any way liable.  If the former, and you were tricked into signing, you might well have a liability to the bank - because let's face it, they can't be expected to carry the can because you signed a piece of paper you shouldn't have done.  But then again, if you were tricked into signing you might have a case against your former partner.....

Good luck!

Well, your signature would have to be on the account papers in order for the account to be yours as well.



Since you are in the UK, your laws may be different from those here in the USA.  You use the term "partner" - is this person a business partner or a "domestic partner"?

Sounds like you are screwed.  Get an attorney.  But if your signature is not on the documents then you should not be liable in any country.

Good luck.

you're not doing anything wrong. however, the system you were born in is a system of rat race. think of it this way... we are all rats and unless you don't race, you don't get any cheese. now you can sleep all day and die of hunger, or you can compete w/ the other rats and get a big chunk of the cheese. no race, no cheese. be the best of who you are doing whatever you're good at and you will reap the rewards soon. BUT... you have to know first what you are good at. then focus all your energy on that. are you good on dancing? singing? bowling? fashion? there's got to be one thing you are good at. everyone has.

Try making out a written budget, once a month, before payday.
A budget where every dollar you'll make next month is spent on paper this month.
That way, you can see where the money might be going.

For more info, go to www.daveramsey.com , and type in "budget".

I'll help you get started:  Here's my budget for next month:

$3,300  INCOME
Next, expenses, in order from most important to least:
And most important is:
$260  FOOD
$549 RENT
$10 Renter's Insurance (it's a check for $100 once a year, so I'll save)
$50 Clothes
$140 Gasoline
$10 Oil Change ($30 for a once-every-three months)
$70 Maintenance (something's going to break.)
$50 Insurance
$50 Electric Bill
$25 Water Bill
$40 Gas Bill
$106 Cable Bill
$1640 Visa (it's a long story, and a lot of debt)
$300 Fun Money

Without money to invest, getting a job is definitely the easiest way.

Sorry to disappoint you!

Be very wary of sites offering you lots of money for little work, as it just isn't that easy. I joined one survey site and as often as not I'd spend 20 minutes answering questions and then be told that I wasn't suitable, but they got a lot of answers out of me for free and I soon gave up wasting my time.

By being a dropshipper. You have no need to hold any stock, just build a website and take orders from it. Pass your orders onto a third party, pay them, and keep the profits.
I have a website http://www.realisticwatches.com 
I take orders and payments for watches, I then send payment to my supplier (usually half of the asking price on my site) and keep the other half myself as profit, my supplier sends the watches direct to my customer.
I therefore do nothing more than collect payments and forward orders.
I make around £300 - £500 per week.

Good Luck

If you're invested in stocks, the last year has not been that good.  You will have to see how your portfolio did when compared against the rest of the market.

Whenever you have any type of investment account.  You need to be aware of what is happening.  This shouldn't be a surprise.

We are unsure how to do it though, if at all as we are with different banks.

I think all banks these days offer internet banking, its the easiest way to transfer money from one account to the other. I'm not sure about HSBC but with natwest you simply just have to make a payment to the other persons bank account. If you both use or sign upto internet banking, you'll find it pretty easy. Or you can do it the old fashioned way and go into the bank, your mum will just need to tell them the account number and sort code of your bank account and they will transfer the money over. It will take about 3 working days from leaving your mums account to clearing in yours.

Or just keep yourself busy in the day doing things like reading to pass the time and take your mind away from finances. Works for me

Do volunteer work.  It will accomplish four things:

1) It will give you something to do;
2) It won't cost anything;
3) You'll be helping people less fortunate than you, which will make you feel good; and 
4) It will show you that things could be worse, which will make you feel better about having less money than you'd like.

You could even revisit childhood days and run around your house with a cardboard helmet on and a stick in your hand pretending you're a valiant warrior saving the world from evil creatures.

Goldfish has been taken over by Barclaycard so you now get ripped off the same way that Barclays customers do.  You get a charge and a commercial exchange rate.  Previously, under Goldfish, you got a "tourist" rate which means a charge of about 5% was built into the exchange rate.

If you have a Nationwide Credit Card, there's no commission and balances are converted at a commercial rate.  If you have a Nationwide Debit Card, you can draw cash out of foreign ATMs on the same basis.

Yes, apart from the new Prepaid Currency card by Mastercard and FairFX.

It is a top up card preloaded in USD or Euro and therefore does not charge commission when you withdraw.



However, check the small print as fees are charged on other transactions.

Someone has cloned my bank card will the bank pay me back the money that has gone missing?



my daughter has had £400 took out of her bank account and been spent in England and India. She obviously doesnt know who it is or how it was done. However the bank have said that first of all they will investigate and it will take 6 wks. She is with the Abbey but I have been told that other banks dont take so long. Why does it take so long.



</question>



<additional details>



been on to the Abbey today and apparently it takes so long because firstly the form that has to be filled in is coming from Portugal. That may take up to 4 wks to get here. Then they deal with it once that is filled in and returned so in theory it could take a lot longer than 6wks. How ridiculous is that. If I hadnt been with Abbey for over 20yrs and have direct debits set up I would go to another bank but its the inconvenience of it all.

In England  and Wales, as you said its likely a first time bankruptcy will last less than one year.

As someone else said existing bank accounts will be closed.



But you will be able to open another one - just a basic one with the consent of your trustee.

You can then use direct debits as normal.

I don't see that legal aid would be affected  - compensatory awards might be though.

Best of luck, email me if you need more.

Its not a good way to go, much better to try and do a deal with your creditor's, if you go into liquidation you can't have a bank account for many years and you can't get any credit, its very hard to live like that, plus you will virtually never get a mortgage again. Good luck

I have left UK to live in Spain with £9000 debt. can I get away with not paying? really cant afford 2.?



I have been paying them for about 3 years and don't seem to take anything off the balance. I also do not have the option to get a loan out to consolidate them, as I have such bad credit rating.

I would like to know what power creditors have to chase me in Spain and what the likeliness is that they will find me.

I don't believe this is the right thing, but everyone else seems to get benefits and all sorts from UK, I have paid tax and NI for 6 years and have claimed nothing.



I do appreciate all factual advice.

Your credit rating knows no international borders.

There are always options out there. You might want to consider contacting the creditor directly and 9/10 they will work with you to either lower your total repayment obligation, or extend the amount of time you have to pay it back (which means lower monthly payments).

I'm not sure of bankruptcy laws abroad, but if your credit is already in the dumps, then this might be a viable option. Although, bankruptcy will follow you around for a very long time.

How can i get cash now for back support?



I am currently owed $11,750 in back child support.  there is a warrent out for his arrest, but his father works for the sherrif dept. in that county and they haven't served in for over a year now.  the court says waite for him to get picked up.  someone told me that there was a company that would pay off back support then go after the father like a bill collector.  has anyone ever heard of this or anything like it?

a Direct Debit is an agreement signed between yourself and a company / supplier.  They maintain control over the payment dates and amounts, although they must provide you with written notice of any changes.  with a  Standing order, you would normally be paying a savings account or friend (although some companies still use them) but you maintain control over any changes as they require your authority.

The advantages of Direct Debits are a) you won't forget to make a payment and changes occur automatically.  They also tend to be cheaper for companies so they may provide a discount to you for using it.

Hopes this helps

Direct Debits are variable amounts requested of your bank by the firm you have given authority to. Standing Orders are amounts nominated by you to your bank to pay as you dictate. Both can be cancelled by you, but Direct Debits need more thought as they are often linked to a debt you have incurred.

You can also amend a standing order when you want, whereas a direct debit needs a new mandate if you want to change the amount. A direct debit is more prone to being taken out twice or missed or paid on the wrong date as most firms dont always stick to the guarantee they make with you. But if they do mess up and you get charged, they should pay the charges back to you.
A DD is taken out on a specific date eg the 10th of each month, whereas a standing order can be set up for every fortnight, week etc.

i don't know if its legit but i know this is



Step 1:

Create an "AlertPay" account



Register for it here:

http://www.alertpay.com/RegisterUser.asp...

After you are finished registering validate your account.

Step 2:

Register to this site which gives you the links:

You will need to type your Alertpay account's username (should be the email you stated).



http://bux.to/?r=heater44

when prompted for your referrer, enter heater44

(after you made your own account you can do the same thing i am (referring this to everyone)

also this site (same thing but a little better) do this cause it means double the profit.

here is the link to regester:

http://primebux.com/index.php?r=heater44



Last Step:

Go to "Surf ADS" link up the top and start clicking.
Wait 30 seconds on each link (You can see how long you've waited in the timer)

Note:- To get your money to your alert pay you need to earn at least $10. (Not a big deal when you have a lot of referrals,
you can see your stats on your money by clicking in your account My stats and then account balance )

For every person you refer to (get to join) you receive his clicks also.
So if he clicks about 100 times you get $1 and so does he. So if you have 100 referrals you get about $100



This is a slow way to make money BUT its easy, free and if you have a lot of referrals then its quicker

If you need any help just email me back



Once you have done all the steps and finished clicking all the available links go back to the links page after a hour and check if their are any new links to click



this applies for both

If you are new to the world of loans, then all the jargon and terminology can seem very confusing. There are so many different terms to understand, and unless you know some of them you will not find the best loan deal to suit your needs. If you want to know more, then here is a guide to some of the basic loan terms you might need to know.When you borrow money in the form of a loan, the money you receive is called an advance. The more money you want to borrow, then the bigger your loan advance. It is called an advance because you are getting the money in advance of paying for it.The APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, is the amount of interest you are charged on your loan amount. This amount is written as a percentage, and refers to the total you are charged each year. APR is one of the primary features for comparison between loans, as it is a standard measurement for all loans.

http://best-loans.awardspace.com/

The lower the APR, then the cheaper the loan interest will be. Credit scoring is a method that lenders use to determine your eligibility for a loan. They ask a series of questions about your earnings and financial situation. Each answer you give is scored, and the better your score then the more likely you are to be accepted for a loan. If you score badly then you might be declined for the loan you want.The loan term is the agreed time over which you will repay the loan. You will repay the loan monthly over this period until the loan and interest is fully paid back. Loan terms on personal loans usually range from about 1 to 10 years, with mortgage loan terms being longer at around 15 to 25 years. The longer the loan term, the less your monthly payments will be, but the more you will have to pay back in interest over the years.

Sure, for utilities.  But there are tons of other everyday expenses to consider.  Not all may apply but some will.



Phone: home, cell or both
Car expenses including gas, insurance, payments repairs, etc
Food
Entertainment including cable tv, internet, movies, etc
Cleaning and hygeine (tiolet paper, shampoo, etc)

Housing should not be more than 28 percent of your budget, but a lot of americans dont fall into that.

No, they mean you have to have $100 to put into an account. They don't keep it, but they WILL deduct the monthly account fee from whatever your account balance is.
Once you get the account open, most of them have no minimum balance AFTERWARD.

Do yourself a favor and make sure your banking institution doesn't have a minimum balance requirement or monthly account fees. In this day and age, it's almost unheard of for standard checking accounts to have these provisions. If your institution doesn't offer these perks, go elsewhere.

You very well could make it with that much. But you need a budget. Need an idea as to how to budget for food. Household needs.. such as toilet paper, dishes, paper towels. If your able to do all that and have extra on hand ? Put it in the bank ! Save it for a rainy day.  Budget and planning will be the main things here though.

not very comfortably. it all depends on what bils you have (car payment, insurance,fuel, gas bill, electric bill, water bill) and what your basic expenses are for food and clothes and things. don't just jump into anything without putting pencil to paper first. my house payment (which is usualy cheaper than rent) and utilities are over $1400 a month. figure everything about 10% higher than you think it will be.

<question>



Will I have a comfortable retirement?



Would it be possible that you can give me a rough estimate of how much you think I'd be living on each week if I was to share some of my financial information with yourself? I've been saving about £450 per month into a savings account since the age of 18 and I'm now 28, if I were to continue doing this and maybe adding more as time goes on up until the day I retire just how much would I have to play with each week? how much of a state pension would I get? Am I wasting my time or am I doing a good thing by saving for my retirement so early in my life?

Thanks for your help.

Assuming that you keep doing this for the next 20 years and that you average a 10% return for all 30 years of my assumption.  You should have over a million pounds saved.  If you can afford to add more to your savings/retirement account, as you earn more, you should have a very comfortable retirement.

I'm in the US, so I can't tell you how much of a state pension that you will get.  If your state pension system is anything like Social Security in the US, I think you would get a statement in the mail every year explaining your benefits.

By saving early, you will be able to retire that much earlier if you so desire.  Using my example, you should be able to afford to retire before you are 50.



Keep saving.  It will be worth it.  I wish I started as early as you did.

You are extremely intelligent to start saving for your retirement so early.  The magic of compounding interest will make you wealthy.  I am hoping that you are putting your money into one of those 7% savings accounts that I read about in the British papers.  If so, your money will double every 10 years or so and you would have about 1.2 million pounds at age 58.



Please interview a financial planner or three and have them work up a plan for you.  Pick the plan and planner that you are most comfortable with and start watching your money grow to a big tidy sum.  I am not familiar with retirement vehicles in the UK (in the US we have Roth IRAs, 401(k)s, and other ways to save for retirement), but a financial planner will be able to point you in the right direction.  Good luck and keep up the good work.

Calculating accounting questions on investment appraisel, help needed?



How do i calculate the following - 
- Payback period to the nearest month
- Accounting rate of return
- Net present value



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Payback period is the time it takes for the total revenue from an Investment to add up to the original cost .. (after taking into account things such as Cost Of Capital and Rate of Inflation) ...



Take, for example, an investment of  £1000 that yields £10 a month. Plainly you will have to wait 100 months to get £1000. So the crude Payback period is 100 months ..

NPV is the value today of money you will receive in the future. It is 'discounted' by some rate (at least by the rate of inflation).

Again, a crude example. Say RPI is 10%. This means that money in a year will be worth 10% less than receiving it today. Thus, £110 in a year has an NPV of £100.



For Accounting rate of return see link ..

Sorry, I am not sure that is possible. There are a ton of scams out there so if you really need the money do not shell out any for promises or more.

There is Revolution Money Exchange which is similar to Paypal. Open an account and then refer friends and family. You will get $10 per referral for a maximum of $500. I made $200 in one week but this is just a temporary promotion they have going on and will end. It is free to join - they are legitimate.

Hello, I hope you are excited because I have found a way to earn money online that is easy to use and is something that you already do on the internet. It is called Homepage Friends and I am glad to tell you what it is. Homepage Friends is a search engine that is powered by yahoo that allows you to earn money for every search you make. It is the best paid search engine that I have ever found and I like t use it to make money while using the yahoo search engine. It is sponsored in England so you make 2.5 pence which is 5 cents in United Stated dollars. You are paid by PayPal when your account reaches 20 pounds which is $40 USD. You are paid in PayPal which means that you get paid the money of where you are from. I enjoy it because I do not need to do anything that I don’t do already on the internet. Once you are on make sure to make a new password and add it as a search bar on the side of your browser or make the home page be your home page. If you make 10 searches a day normally you can expect to make 50 cents (25 pence) a day without having to do anything you wouldn’t normally do. But don’t take my word for it, go to the FAQ page or look for reviews online and you will be satisfied. If you have a PayPal account and use search engines regularly then I hope you will make money for what you already use. Please use my referral code:  http://www.myhpf.co.uk/apply001.asp?Frie...  as a thank you for helping you find this site. Thanks for reading and good luck.

Try writing down everything you spend for a month (week if you can't make it). Then write it all down and allocate it into categories.  This way you can pinpoint what you are spending too much/too little on.

Also, my friend told me of this $20 challenge. Where you try and live off $20 for a week by any means necessary. Some results...personal gratification, increase in weekly savings, experiences that arise as you become poor, which increases your chances that you will sustain some of your newly acquired habits in the future.

Some quick money-saving tips:
1) Grocery store--look for items below eye level which are generally much cheaper (i.e. cereal in bags).  Also, clip coupons and buy when there are good sales.  Also, try not to make any impulse shopping buys at the end of the grocery store (i.e. magazine, candy, soda, newly released DVDs)
2) To save gas, do several trips at one time.

For $2000, you should be able to buy all the Sims game packs *and* a computer to play them on!

If you don't know how much it will all cost -- go to walmart.com and search for Sims and write down the prices and add them all up. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised to see they don't come to nearly $2000.

As far as earning the money goes, why don't you ask your parents what kind of chores you could do that they'd be willing to pay for? I always offered $10 for vacuuming out my car, or $20 for a wash and a vacuum. If you do something like that once a week, you could earn enough for one Sims game every week or two!

I think you should pay of your mortgage. This will then open up doors for you because once the mortgage is paid off you can treat yourself and not worry about the mortgage bills coming through the door.
I'd pay off my mortage but then again you might have reasons not to.
Good luck x

I do not understand why most people said don't rush to pay off your mortgage. If you borrow 100k, you would pay like 200-250k. That's a waste of money to me. I would pay off if I can afford. Keep in mind you should have some $ left for emergency use.



Some people invest in another property especially the house pricing is much lower. And you could make a good profit when the economy recover. It's quite a gamble doing this.

As a general principle you should pay off your mortage (and any other debts) as soon as possible. This avoids paying more interest on top of what you've already paid. In my opinion, paying interest is just like pouring money down the drain, but of course the banks don't see it that way -- they make their money from people in debt. ;-)

If your mortgage has an early redemption penalty, as some do, you need to see if it will cost more to pay it off or to let it run. Generally if your mortgage only has a year or two to run, it's best to leave it to mature naturally. But if it has a long time to run, pay it off as soon as you can.

It's always better to pay off your debts than to invest the money to service the debt. This is because the interest rate you pay on a debt is going to be higher than the interest you'll be paid on a savings account or other sorts of low-risk investment.

If you are a wage earner, it is better to pay off your mortgage. But if you are doing some sort of business, it is better to put aside some money either for additional working capital or  to set up a contingency fund in case you have some good investment to go into. Discuss with your banker and tell them to restructure your existing mortgage into part half term loan and half overdraft acount. This way have an overdraft acount to make use of in case you need it for business or for investment purposes. For overdraft accounts you need only to pay interest when you use the overdraft limit.

The answer to your question is the answer to this.
Will you be able to invest in another product or property that will make you more financially better off than what you would be if you did not have your mortgage?
So take into consideration how much interest you are going to pay if you continue with your mortgage.  Consider how much per month you will be better off by not having to make the mortgage payment.  But also consider how much money you could make taking a calculated risk in another property or investment vehicle.
I would suggest you speak to a financial adviser so that they can do a full assessment of your assets and your attitude to risk before you make any decisions.

In the UK the seller is obliged by law to give you a written quotation for the finance if requested. In practice this will be supplied by the finance company. It will show all elements of the agreement including the total payable at the end of the day. You can compare this with  the agreement document you will be asked to sign if you go ahead. This will ensure no mistakes are made.

That isn't right, 5.5% of 8500 is £467.50.  After the first year the interest should be less as you will have paid back some of the money.

The first answer is wrong because 5.5% is the annual percentage rate - the amount you pay per year.

If you right a check on an account which does not have enough funds to cover the amount, it will come back to you as an NSF (not sufficient funds) check.  Most likely, your bank will charge you a fee and the person who receives the check will have the money removed from their account.

You can write it and if its not electronic like at walmart
It won't go through untill next business day if its after 5.
Its not a good idea, this is called bouncing checks and if some one deposits it and your account can't cover it they loose the money and some banks charge a fee for that. Bogus chexks are a bad idea!

Physically you can write the cheque, however if you know there will not be sufficient funds in your account when it is presented, you are committing Fraud.

When the cheque is presented, it all depends on your Bank (and the size of the cheque) ..



IF you have some balance (i.e. are not already overdrawn) and the difference between the balance and the cheque is 'small', many UK Banks will allow it to go through = since they can then charge you MASSIVE 'penalties' (and Interest) for having an 'unauthorsied overdraft'

IF you are already overdrawn (or the difference is large) then MOST Banks will 'bounce' the cheque ..

NB&gt; needless to say, some UK Banks will 'bounce' the cheque even if the difference is only one penny .. and some even 'bounce' cheques against 'uncleared funds'** ... this can mean that if the cheque is presented for payment on the same day that you wages are paid in, they will still 'bounce' it !!

**it typically takes 2-3 days to 'clear' a payment although some UK Banks are now allowing 'fast pay' to clear the same day

RBS student account ?



I've been a member of the RBS bank for as long as I can remember but I never really used the account, always kept money in it to keep it open. But today I phoned up to see if I could upgrade (as I only had a cashline card which was pointless as I shop online alot) and the guy said I can upgrade to the "RBS Revolve Account 11-18 Yr Olds". I then asked if I would be able to set up direct debits and standing orders and then he double checked and mentioneed the name of a second account which I can't find any information off. Does anyone know of any other RBS current accounts for 16 year olds and what the benefits are, cause I'm not entirely sure and can't find any info anywhere of the account I've upgraded to. I won't have access to my mail for at least 2 weeks (long story) so I would rather know now so I can look elsewhere for a better bank. I checked the website to see if the Revolve account had direct debit, standing order factilities but seen nothing. Hope someone can help,

Thanks.

The Revolve account from RBS does not allow direct debits or standing orders.



RBS does have a Key account which is available from age 16. It comes with a Solo card and does allow direct debits and standing orders.

Other good accounts which are open to 16 year old and come with direct debit and standing order facilities are Alliance & Leicesters Premier 21 and The Abbey Account.

Yes- all deposits up to £35,000 are covered by deposit protection. Above this amount there is no formal protection, however it is generally believed that the UK government would protect all saving deposits for HBOS (and any other UK bank) if it were to fail- they did so for Northern Rock.

In any case, HBOS has just agreeed a merger with Lloyds-TSB Group, making it even more secure than it was.

No, students arn't entitled to benefits unless they have kids. Which i presume you don't. Your mum might be entitled to council/housing benefit  and probabaly working tax credit. But you personally not a thing!!

You would probably be able to get a student grant if you are in higher education and your household income is below a certain level.  Your best bet is to go to the Citizens Advice Bureau.
This website is for Croydon Council but helps you assess what benefits you may be entitled to:

Why does it take so long for money to be transferred from my Paypal account to my bank account? ?



A buyer of mine seems to be under the impression that even though his payment for the goods i,ve sold to him on ebay is taken instantly from his bank.It doesn't reach my bank account for several days.
've just had it confirmed to me by a Paypal employee.
I,d love to know why it takes them that long to transfer the money over,though i expect it has a lot to do with them gaining interest whilst in paypals account.
Is anyone else here fed up with this unneccessary delay,when they make out that its instant!

If a buyer pays you with paypal, then this goes straight in to your paypal account not your bank account, so you can send his item as soon as you have recieved funds.

The transfer only takes 4 days when you are withdrawing funds from your paypal account back into your bank account.

One of my friend has had a bad experience.The amount of £30,000 something has been taken from her current account but her debit card wasn't stolen.She uses her card on restaurants a lot & even gives it to the waiter behind the desk!

Tanx guys 4 yr Answers.My concern is about giving details on the phone & also is it safe to do so.

Your friend must have had a lot of money in the account. Banks would normally not allow a withdrawal much beyond an agreed overdraft. If she did have that much money, why didn't she put it into a high interest account?
In answer to your question, only use a credit card for on-line or telephone purchases, NEVER let your debit card out of sight.

On the phone, usually just the card number, name on the card and maybe the 3 digit number on the back. Its most likely that the card hs been cloned, she will need to contact the police with anywhere she has used her card recently. Resturants/supermarkets/shops anywhere. All someone needs is the card number, name and the security code on the back and they can just about do everything. However £30,000 from a debit card would have been declined by most banks these days as a fraud protection. Not many banks will simply let £30,000 go from an account like that especially if its not a usual occurance on the card! The bank will be able to tell her where the money was taken from after a few days so tell her to ring there fraud protection.

Bank- what happens if you have low money in the bank less than a pound say?



I really urgently want to download this song right now (i know what you're thinking, but music is my thing, and this song sounds so similar to my fav. song which is a very different, unique and rare genre) and my mind is telling me to refuse itself to wait until saturday.

SO .. the question really is:



Well..

What will happen if I have 0.10 - 0.40p in the bank?



cos i figure there to be that much left in the bank
and considering the size of the download it could actually be lower lol



but i won't do it if u tell me my account will be instantly cancelled and all that but i just need to know now if i'm risking big or not. i could put in some money tomorrow but not much, but enough to catch up to £1 something probably?
i'm only 16 anyway. does the bank take me seriously?! xD
nahh i love it really i just like am literally also IN LOVE with THIS SONG!

If you are in love with this song now, it's likely you still will be next week.  That will give you time to put some money in, so if you have some sort of half decent balance there, rather more than the cost of the download, you don't have to worry.

You bank account will stay open unless it is is a dormant account (unused) for a period  -  in Ireland it is 15 years  -  then the government grabs it.

You are only 16, why don't you beg your parents / siblings / neighbours for the download - tell them it's so very important to you, it's really good value, and be ready to wash the car / mow the lawn or do any odd job in exchange, in fact you should offer to do something you know they hate doing, so they are more likely to agree.
That way you don't risk anything on your account (they won't close it, but you could get hefty bank charges, and you can't claim anything back right now as the court case against the bank is not over - not a good start to your credit record).
Go on work for it - it's only 1 song so it won't be too onerous.

Of course, you can have as many cards from as many providers you want, (2 or more from one provider is also doable) 
Question is should you? remember the more accounts you have, the lower your credit score(each card is an a/c.)
Ideally you shld have one credit card from Visa, one from Mastercard.
obviously you have a checking a/c. and a debit card to begin with:-

Should we stop using banks?



My friend told me yesterday she is going to stop putting her paychecks in the bank and is instead going to rent a safe deposit box and keep all her cash in there. She's predicting something worse than the collapse in the 30s. I'm asking because it's not like she's just talking to talk. She's a well-educated and well-read person with an M.A. in American History who follows current events.

It's one of those things that we just have to trust. You could put some money elsewhere but it's ridiculous to think we can keep thousands in safety. I'm keeping my money in a building society (Nationwide) so that if it does go wrong my money is still secure. I was considering splitting money between banks but I've been told that it's not necessary. I think you have to worry more about unemployment and rising prices than much else.

You can have all of the education in the world and not have street smarts so to speak. Many do not achieve that balance and are not able to utilize that education.

I have a degrees in both history and finance. I have a MBA and a Phd as well. I have lived and worked all over the planet, I have bank accounts all over the planet as well. Add in that I am also a combat veteran. That does not make me any sort of genius by any means.

Your friend is misguided and needs to rethink things. If the economy truly went south all of the way that currency in a safe deposit box would be worth squat. History proves that. If the money is in an account there are certain protections under the law that would allow it to be regained. No such protections apply to cash.



If she knew what she was speaking of she would know that in such times people buy gold as it will always be worth something. When the economy goes bad the price of gold always goes up.

Yes it looks like the 30s but much has changed since then. The worlds economy is all interrelated. Banks, economies, imports and exports all over the world are being impacted. That is why the government has been forced to step in. The dollar is now worth squat and has been for a while.

You friends ideas are simplistic.

Not much, most of HBOS's brands will stay the same e.g Halifax. for now anyway but in the distant future it is likely it will be re-branded, but this won't put any money at risk. Even if it did there's a compensation scheme setup by the government ages ago that pays the first £35,000 of all lost money by any individual affected by a bank closure.

Can you go overdrawn on a Debit card?



I had an HSBC account with just a debit card and went overdrawn by something small like £6 and by the time they sent out the letter to tell me it was £20, and kept going up since I didnt have a job at the time. £170 by the time I payed it all off but it is going to be on my credit rating for 6 years which is stopping me from getting certain things.

Is it the banks fault for letting me go over on just a debit card?

How can you go overdrawn on a debit card when it should only let you draw out what you have in the bank.

Is it the banks fault?



</question>



<additional details>



Someone who responded to my question said : The only account that wont let you go overdrawn is a solo account"

Mine was a Solo card.

This is was all like 7 months ago, they passed it onto debt collectors which I paid. But on my credit rating it is going to be on there for like 6 years.

It is not the bank's fault.  However, it is always worth giving them a call and asking them to reduce the charges or knock some off especially if you have an otherwise good record.  If you don't ask you won't get.  Also in UK banks are now highly criticised for some of these practices and so do refund in some cases.  On more than one occasion I have been successful telephoning about a late credit card surcharge because I usually pay it all off in good time - I have been refunded the surcharge.  Of course I usually say I have been in hospital (true) but who is to know.  Give it a whirl - best of luck.

If this is a full time job, then it comes down to how many hours of vacation and other time off they get each year.

In the US, you can figure about 48 working weeks a year, after vacation and holidays.  I suspect in Europe, you get a lot more time off than that, so adjust accordingly.

Thus, you just do this:

16,515 / 40 / 48

This is about 8.6 pounds per hour.

If you get 2 months of paid time off annually, then that's only 44 weeks working:

16,515 / 40 / 44

About 9.4 pounds per hour.

35*52=1820 hours per year

It would be approx 9/hr provided they do not take any vacation leave without pay or other days without pay.  Then the number would be off.

Take your number and divide it by 52 then divide it by 35 then you have your final number.

I'm a discharged bankrupt too and I done exactly as alphamee suggested and built up my rating again.  Got extremely small loans from a couple of different companies like Provident and paid off the loans within a couple of weeks.  Once I'd done that my rating was apparently high and I was then able to get credit cards quite easily.

I wish I hadn't but that's another story!

Also agree that the current state of affairs regarding the credit crunch could also be affecting you.

I am in the same boat.  The best thing to do is get a credit card from Capital one.  They give anyone a card with a £200 limit, so if you use it a few times then you can gain credit scoring. Good luck, it is a nightmare eh.

Sorry, you probably wont get any. If the "guaranteed" dealers wont lend to you then no-one will.

Your credit history goes back 6 years so it will always register that you have a bankrupt flag from when it's discharged. I don't know of any lenders who'll make an exception just now.

You need to re-establish your credit credentials from scratch. Now is the worse time, due to the credit crunch business. Companies will most certainly strike you off any initial applications. Get a contract phone. Open a restricted savings account, and put a little away every month. You need to show a responsible attitude to finance to these companies. Don't be tempted by loan-sharks.

No credit score is worse than bad credit score!
As the above said, try Capital 1 credit card and use it for a few months to get a credit history, the other one to try is Vanquis bank, they are pretty good at helping people like yourself, but it may take up to a year before you get a chance.

My ex boss was in the same situation, he could open up another company but not get credit, I got him credit card with both the above and within a year, he had no problems.

Saying that, it may be more difficult because of the current climate.

If my mortgage lender goes bust, who do I owe money to?



Just with all this banks getting it wrong it got me thinking. Take any mortgage lender, what will happen if they get it wrong and go down, and in event of nobody offering to buy them? What happens with my mortgage? Who do I owe the money to?
In event of the bank being bought, do I keep the same terms with the new owner or is the contract void?

This has been asked 3 times today.

You will still owe money to the banks debtors, and you are generally advised to keep paying the mortgage as normal.

You will be advised, God forbid this happening, on how your mortgage will be affected by the debtors. It is impossible to guess how your mortgage would change because it would depend on how severe your lenders debts are, who takes over, etc.

Your contract is not void, but I won't pretend to know what happens to any fixed rates, etc - I would guess, under FSA regulations, any special rate you have would be viable until it expires (i.e. 5 year fixed, 3 year tracker rate) - what happens after that is another matter.

yes same agreement and everything ..usually when banks/lenders are about to go down ..they sell/transfer your loan ...no bank will leave without doing so ..because they profit by selling...aside from that ...everytime your loan gets sold u should recieve a letter stating that...telling u they are ur new lender and where u should be sending ur payment from that point on ...

It's £35K per bank for cover.



So your ISA isn't covered.
 If you are going to suffer penalties to move it don't.  If you can move itn penalty free then do so just to make you feel better!

The chances of  a main stream UK bank going down is nil.  The loss of confidence would result in a run on every bank.  The Government cannot allow it.  So like HBOS they would arrange for a takeover.

You have 35K so you're fine, your insurance with the bank will cover that - if you had more I would suggest you move it around. Your savings are best kept with an organisation that does not lend more than it recieves from depositers like the Co-Op bank or a local building society or the Post Office.

There is no such thing as a guarenteed 20,000 unsecure loan reardless of credit score. Have you not been watching the news or read the newspaper, were in financial troubles. Banks are being taken over left right and centre. Not many places would offer £20,00 unsecured anyway, most places will only go upto abou £10,000 maybe £15,000 and thats with an excellent credit score. Your out of luck unless you wanna try a loan shark with the average APR of about 1000%??

Good luck. Your credit will always be checked if your get a loan of any type, especially for a large amount in the current economic climate. Companies which aren't bothered about credit are generally for debt consolidation and other debt management purposes and not for business loans.

you can't.

no legitimate lender finances the purchase of a business if you have no cash to put into it and/or your credit is poor.

the other kind of lender is someone you want to be doing business with.  they either have some other agenda that you'll have to go along with [something illegal, of course], or their collection policies are themselves illegal [hold your family to ransom?]

much in my life as i am a struggling mum with three kids and i have been going
through really rough times in my life and my name is Helen
Peters and in all this hard times, a worse incident occured in my life as i

operation for his knee so he could walk again and at this point, life was
useless to me as i have no family and no one to run to and each night, i will
sit down and cry till the break of dun until one day, i read an advert on yahoo
answers of man that stated that he could help people in my shoes with loans and
in my desperate situation, i had no choice but i had to try and so shocking and
suprising, it was like an impossibility becoming a reality, i got a loan of
$75,000 USD even with my bad credit within 48 hours and my sons surgery was done
and thank GOD it was successful and now, i am okay and living in comfort with my
kids and i said to my self, i have never ever seen this kind of wonder in life
and i decided i will tell it to the whole wild world and i need every one to
thank GOD for Mr Patrick Harvey, the man GOD used to rescue me and my family
even when all hope had been lost and gone and i will say to every one, no matter
how dark and sinful the world is today, there are still GOD fearing and reliable
people on earth and if you are in my former situation or require a loan
legitimately, i will advice you contact this loan lender and you can reach him

me fund my education since i lost my parents in a gharsly auto accident while
they were away on vacation. the scamers parted with my $ 1,100, which i
managed to gather from friends and families to enable me takr care of my bills
for lart two months. I decided to tell Betsey.A.Braiaton who communicated the
story to Adrew Fulp who happens to be my Vic president for academic services
and has got link with various notable lending firm accross the globe. By this
means using it to bring a globarlizetion to the world, many student and business
men having finacial problems have been able to complete their education to bring
a globar happiness around the world



My happiness now is that i have not only gotten the loan($
85,000 USD) to pay my tuition them Harvey Loan Inc, piloted by Mr, Patrick
Harvey, i have  also been able to establish a chaned to allow me collect money
at very low competative interest rate. since they have assured me thet i can come for more funds as long i am a
genuine person for requesting it and that there is a possibility of repayment at
the stopulated time.i have never ever seen this kind of wonder in my life and i
decided i will tell it to the whole wild world and i need every one to thank GOD
for Mr Patrick Harvey, the man GOD used  to  rescue me even when all hope had
been lost and gone and i will say to every one, no matter how dark and sinful

if you are in need or require a loan legitimately and Government approve

NO! Taking money out will only create another Northern Rock scenario.There is no need to withdraw savings if you have less than £35,000, as even if the bank collapses, deposits less than this amount are protected in law.

HBOS will most likely be bought by Lloyds, so what is the problem?

Had Lloyds not stepped in, then I would have said yes. Despite the government guarantee, who knows how long that would take to get your money back off them.

No. HBOS has a strong structure and is NOT going bust!  Their shares have fluctuated wildly as a knockon from the Leman Bros collapse, but the group is in a good financial position. A merger with their main rivals Lloyds TSB makes a lot of sense to strengthen both.

RBS student account ?



I've been a member of the RBS bank for as long as I can remember but I never really used the account, always kept money in it to keep it open. But today I phoned up to see if I could upgrade (as I only had a cashline card which was pointless as I shop online alot) and the guy said I can upgrade to the "RBS Revolve Account 11-18 Yr Olds". I then asked if I would be able to set up direct debits and standing orders and then he double checked and mentioneed the name of a second account which I can't find any information off. Does anyone know of any other RBS current accounts for 16 year olds and what the benefits are, cause I'm not entirely sure and can't find any info anywhere of the account I've upgraded to. I won't have access to my mail for at least 2 weeks (long story) so I would rather know now so I can look elsewhere for a better bank. I checked the website to see if the Revolve account had direct debit, standing order factilities but seen nothing. Hope someone can help,

Thanks.

When was Credit spending introduced to modern society?



Once upon a time Cash was the way of life, I went back to "cash only" since I owe tuition (2004). It seems like credit is common currency now days when did this begin?



What would happen if we went back to saving up or only use credit to buy important things like Cars & Homes and spend cash on food clothing and other needs.

Credit has been available since the middle ages. Traditionally loans and usury was forbidden by the Christian church, so it was carried out by Jews as one of the few ways they were allowed to work. There is a summary here, stating that one of the pivotal acts was passed in 1545 by Henry VIII
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury

However Unlimited credit only became available with the growth of fiat money systems, where the currency is backed by confidence, not commodities. The dollar moved to a purely fiat system in the 1970's, since when credit in general has grown. There is a history available in economymodels (link in sources), although their conclusion that fiat systems inevitably lead to hyper inflation has not yet been proved.

As in a fiat system, more money can be printed as desired, the only thing supporting the value of cash is the belief in its worth. This means it is easy for banks to offer credit, as effectively banks can create more money to fulfill any shortfall. The problem is when the sums go wrong - e.g. Northern Rock.

This chart shows the growth of the M3 measure of money quite clearly since 1971, which would suggest that is when credit took off.

No. Why would that happen? This isn't like the recent trend of de-mutualising building societies (where the customers are in effect share holders)

The idea of the merger (a take-over in all but name) is to SAVE money, not give it away.

Well they are merging with Lloyds TSB by the looks of things so you should be fine. There are recommendations to all bankers not to have £35000 (pounds) in any one bank account. The reason is unsure but money might be lost because of the financial crisis caused by some big banks failing. Barclays did invest in Lehman Bank late last night though.

The rich kids who work in the city spreading rumours, the press causing panic and the customers clambering for their money caused this problem and now 40,000 people could loose their jobs.

A little thought can save you considerably
1. shopping: While going for shopping prepare a list of required things. Go only with a full stomach. these will prevent you from buying unnecessary things
2.Electricity: use CFLs. Switch off lights & electrical appliances when not in use.
3. Do not waste food.
4. Consider investing your saved money- in gold, real estate, mutual funds, share market, fixed deposits etc..
5. Use public transport. for short distances, walk..

Im only gonna say this one time!!!
The rich trilateralists have just skimmed the entire planet of cash.
The group of ultra elite bilderbang group that meets select individuals
around the worldhat are members  know this and it was in the trillions
they did it over the last ten years and none of the white shirts
in office stopped it for their pockets were lined to condone the skim.
The thing was to devalue the dollar while making the oil rich opec
feel the losses too. for their oil riches were based in american dollas and Bush a oil man with chaney allowed iran and all the terrorist countries feel the effects of the loss by devaluing the dollar and the stock markets all those foreign oil men tried to do to the usa markets
the oil man Bush let the trilateraists complete and every country
in the world felt the skim. thank you Mr B.
The bilderman foundation really exists and they are the super wealth
of this planet more wealthy as to be able to bankrupt even the largest
financial businesses in the usa. This group meets every year in the
swiss alps in a very posh secure hotel of the european
alps and they hide behind heavy security but they control
information and the exchange of monitary control for every
transaction affecting wealth accumulation in the world.
This has been a test to see how much power they weld.
just imagine if they wanted to get back all the oil money
from the opec nations might be rewarding to see this.
they are the only ones on earth that know true wealth.
For they know the control and they very seldom show their hand.
This is no joke they exist and there has been documentaries
done on them check frontline. for bilder... for the reports.
cheers

The super rich weld power over financial banking concerns.
thats way bigger than oil companies and the trumps of the world.
even bigger than opec combined all the open nations together.
they rival even the vatican wealth. Hard to fathom they would skim
their share of the worlds money so violetly. trillions of dollars have been
taken off the worlds markets in one fell swoop.
Cheers but they have thepower to do this granted by the watch man
Mr B.
He leaves office in three more months. Maybe Obama can tax us out of
the rising rip off of the usa's GDP. dollars.

What do you need to apply for a loan?



I am taking a year out from uni and i want to get a car but being a student i have no money so i'd have to get a loan out. i have just started working at my part time job a few more days so i do 30 a week now and i will easily earn enough to pay back the loan. But as i've only just started working more hours and i only got paid i won't get paid again for another month, but i need the car asap to get there. Can i go along to the bank now and say i will be earning enough or do i need a months wages to back it up. Also what else might i need to help me get a loan. I live in UK if that changes anything. Thanks in advance

You will need 3 months bank statements and proof with your wage slips that you can repay the loan. Also a utility bill, passport and most probably photo ID.

You need to bring proof that you can pay back the loan. Assets as collateral or bank statements or pay stubs will help do this.

Essentially, you have to demonstrate that you are financially well-off enough that you don't need a loan.

If you are new to the world of loans, then all the jargon and terminology can seem very confusing. There are so many different terms to understand, and unless you know some of them you will not find the best loan deal to suit your needs. If you want to know more, then here is a guide to some of the basic loan terms you might need to know.When you borrow money in the form of a loan, the money you receive is called an advance. The more money you want to borrow, then the bigger your loan advance. It is called an advance because you are getting the money in advance of paying for it.The APR, or Annual Percentage Rate, is the amount of interest you are charged on your loan amount. This amount is written as a percentage, and refers to the total you are charged each year. APR is one of the primary features for comparison between loans, as it is a standard measurement for all loans.

http://best-loans.awardspace.com/

The lower the APR, then the cheaper the loan interest will be. Credit scoring is a method that lenders use to determine your eligibility for a loan. They ask a series of questions about your earnings and financial situation. Each answer you give is scored, and the better your score then the more likely you are to be accepted for a loan. If you score badly then you might be declined for the loan you want.The loan term is the agreed time over which you will repay the loan. You will repay the loan monthly over this period until the loan and interest is fully paid back. Loan terms on personal loans usually range from about 1 to 10 years, with mortgage loan terms being longer at around 15 to 25 years. The longer the loan term, the less your monthly payments will be, but the more you will have to pay back in interest over the years.

Providing there is no financial penalty for cashing in now and all you would lose is an 18mth addition to the terminal bonus, it is probably in your interest to cash in now. The cost of living is rising and having the cash you would have spent each month for the next 18mths added to your disposable income will be a bonus in its-self.

I had this dilemma a year ago and ( having worked for many years in the financial services sector ) simply calculated the interest that I would have paid ( in your case over 18 months ) and that far outstripped any benefits in maintaining the mortgage. You would be ( on the surface of the info given ) better served cashing the policy, paying off the mortgage and making a regular savings plan over the next 18 months in substitution.  The bottom line is that is never pays to have an interest accruing debt and endowment assurances nowadays have no real value, especially as performance is poor and they abolished life assurance premium relief in the 80s. Go for it!

It is worth checking out with the insurer (not mortgage lender) as to what the surrender value is, and also what it might be worth in 6 months.
Also, there are places, well advertised here on the net if you do a search, and elsewhere which buy out endowments. I don't know if these are usually attractive or not, or if they make just moderate offers as they assume sellers are hard up and gasping to turn it into ready cash.
Be careful, do your sums accurately, and the best of luck.

I can see my bank balance online whenever I want to,  so WHY is my bank insisting I receive STATEMENTS?



Just curious.  I just cancelled my paper HARD copy of statements I receive in the mail.
Maybe I just don't like what I see on the statements, or maybe I just want to conserve paper and don't like getting mail for NO reason.
But why does my bank insist on me receiving statements, when I can go to see my statement online whenever I want to?
I cancelled my paper statements, but still I HAVE to receive statements online, now?
WHY?!
I don't understand what is so important about STATEMENTS? now that online is an option?
Just curious..

I'm not really complaining about hem, just tryign to understand the point of them.

Banks used to be heavily regulated.  There still are -some- regulations on the books.  One of them is that you have to receive a statement.  The bank is required by law to inform you periodically of activity in your account, not just to make the information available for you to retrieve it yourself.  Lots of people still aren't on the Internet.

I think they should be required to tell what they're doing with your money, not just about your account. Would you change banks if they released a statement showing they bought a billion dollars worth of lottery tickets?  8^)

Is it some big bank like Bank of America, Wachovia, Chase, etc? I doubt such banks will do that. If you have opted for online only statements, they'll also notify you via email when a statement copy is available online for you to view. I have accounts with the first 2 and I have opted for online only statements and if for some reason I need paper statements (like address proof, etc), I just request them for it. Although I must add that for some weird reason when you request a hardcopy of a statement like that, they'll send you a crappy printout and not that professional looking statement that you get otherwise. Also, Wachovia charges you $5 per statement copy you request out of turn. So, If I need a paper copy from them, I just change the option to paper statements and wait for my next copy to arrive in the mail :)

I know my answer is not a very helpful one, but it's a good way of asking how you're doing... lol. So, how are you? :)

No, because you have to sign up for that, and only when the provider offers it.

There will be different bills from different providers. For an ER visit, you may get bills from the hospital and then each specialist, depending on what you had done. Same with the hospital. Call the hospitals and explain that you didn't save your paperwork and you'll need new copies of everything.

Your money is safe. Your money is insured up to 100,000 dollars. Even if WAMU collapsed, the government steps in, and your funds are available to you the next business day as if nothing happened at all.

You are fine. Even if they go under you will still be able to use your debit card, use their atm machines and pay others with your checks. If you have over 100,000 dollars in any one account you need to move it into another account so as not to lose any money if the do go under.

All of the above answers are right. As long as the bank is insured by the FDIC, which I believe is a Federal requirement, you are insured up to 100K.

Online marketing is a good way to make money if you are smart about it.Which mean you realize takes time/hard work/etc. Most on-line business ops are not so much scams as they are not approached in the correct manner. If you know how to or are willing to learn how to market on-line then you could sell paperclips and make money on the internet. the problem is most people want fast, easy, no investment, no hard work money. And that my friend only occurs if you win the lotto. On the other hands there are a ton on on-line biz ops that just suck. They don't offer training or support and if you google them with the word scam after it then a million site with people complaints pop up! I have been doing the on-line thing for awhile and learned that the expensive biz ops rarely deliver on what they promise and the free ones NEVER deliver on there promises of riches. I am working with a good one know that i invite you to check out and even google and you wont find any complaints on. BUT it requires work, Yes you heard correctly, it is a real business that you have to work a few hours a day. On the plus side the money is great and you are your own boss. click the link to check it out and feel free to hit me up with any questions. Best of luck to you and remember no matter what biz opp you pick if you expect to get wealthy for free then don't waste your time on it.

There are a lot of scams out there and money doesn't come that easily. But yes it is possible to make money though the internet. You just have to find the right site that you can trust, which isn't easy. I don't know of any - I've only heard of 100s of scam sites.

Best way to get money is to get a job and work for it properly. Maybe you could try getting more hours in your current job or find a second job. If nothing else there are things like delivering catalogues or leaflets that pay money and you can do in your spare time.

You should definitely avoid rebate processing and surveys.

Look at what other people do to make money online. You could look into stores and drop shipping. I used to sell on ebay and had an apartment full of stuff but then I found out about drop shipping and switched to that.

I've been doing it for about a year and make pretty good money doing it ($3-4k/month, which is pretty good depending where you live I guess. I live in Canada) but you do have to put hard work into it. I work almost as much as anyone with a normal job, but I get to work at home :)



Look into selling on ebay or a good site is http://doiop.com/onlinestoresnow they have a lot of free info and their program shows you pretty much everything you need to know. It's one of the things that got me started. Anyway drop me a line if you want any help.

Hi Daisyflower
I have found one of the few ways to make money online that is straightforward and easy is to participate in online surveys. If you join lots of companies the money you get paid can really add up. I compiled a list of the best free to join survey sites which makes it easy to join them as you don't have to spend hours searching for the legit ones. Aimed at the uk so relevant to you.
Hope this helps

Right I know I may get some thumbs down for this answer but it is just something that I looked into, but am too frightened to do for myself as I have children living with me.
They do have sex line people you work from home, and you just talk sex down the line, they pay around 30p per minute.
Which adds up, over a 20 min dirty conversation.
I do not see any harm with this, I do not know of anything else which you could earn a good income from with hours of your choice, coz my other answer would have been ebay.
Good luck, I hope that you find something soon.

Does anyone else out there bank at Washington Mutual?



So, the rumors (online news, local news) go that WaMu is putting itself on the auction block, to be sold to who knows which bank. I called WaMu today and asked. I got the most insipid girl on the phone, who, in her best Baby Wets A Lot voice told me that 
Washington Mutual was fiscally secure and that I had nothing to worry about. I am sure she was just operating under order (all hail the call center nazis) so that they could avoid a rush on the bank. But really, WTF?! Do I take out my money and wait for the financial shite to hit the fan, or do I wait and hope my assets don't get frozen during the transition? They of course claim that that would never happen (the freezing part) but it happened to other people I know when when their bank was taken over a number of years ago, and their bank claimed it wouldn't happen.
So......if you have WaMu and have an opinion on this and I are willing to share what you plan to do with YOUR money, I would love to hear it.

Serious answers only please. Thanx!!



</question>



<additional details>



and yes, I know that WaMu is insured for $100,000 per account, and that theoretically you should have your money the next business day. But did you know that it can take up to 14 WEEKS to get your money?

Cheque Cashing - Simple Question But I Don't Know the Answer?



Hi,



I'm a foreign student who's living in the UK for the next few months.  I don't have a UK bank account.



I received a cheque from my UK university drawn from NatWest Bank (just over 100 pounds).  Can I just walk into any NatWest branch with the cheque and ID and they'll cash it?  And do you have any idea what service fee they'd charge?  Thanks!

Unfortunately, you cannot just walk into the bank with a cheque and come out with cash.

You have two options:

1) Set up a bank account (with any bank), pay the cheque in, and then 5 working days later the money will be in your account to take out.

2) Take it to a cheque cashing shop, there are quite a few of these around such as Cash Convertors. You need Photo Id such as a passport, and something that has your address on, like a driving licence or utility bill.



They will charge you usually around 10% of the value of the cheque for cashing it, so you could walk in with it and come out with around £90. You lose the £10 for having the convenience of not having to set up a bank account, or waiting for the cheque to clear.

Alternatively, you can keep the cheque and pay it into your account back home. You can do this any time in the 6 months after the date on the cheque. However, you will be charged a fee for doing this, and also a conversion charge. Taking it into a cheque cashing shop would probably be cheaper than this option.

If  you had money in British bank or building society and it collapsed?



Would all money in personal accounts be lost? I am thinking of the ordinary man in the street with a few thousand pounds say in a building society or bank?

100% of savings up to £35K are covered per person, per financial group under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

Some groups such as Halifax and Bank of Scotland are covered under one banking licence. As such any money with either these providers is covered once up to the £35K limit. However, the situation is different for RBS and NatWest who have separate licences. If you had £35K in each bank, if in the unlikely event both banks collapsed you would get back the full £70K.

The majority of people are likely to have less than £35K in a bank or building society, so their money is safe.

Savings upto  £35,000 are protected. 
So, should a bank or a building society collapse, an individual who has lost savings will be able to claim compensation up to 100% of the first £35,000. 
So if you have more than £35000 pounds open another account in a different bank - ensure you don't keep more than £35000 in any one bank.

Nothing your morgage will still be owed, the same amount and at the same rates but will be payed to LLoyds rather then Halifax. LLoyds will over the weeks months contact you to let you know of any change. you won't see much of a change, just a different letter head!

Nothing, you will carry on as usual. In due course you would probably get a letter saying that your mortgage is now with ---------- (whatever name they decided to call the merged group). The original terms of your mortgage will be unchanged.

If your mortgage has a specific deal on it (fixed / capped / tracker...) then nothing will happen until the end of your deal (except the new letterhead as others have said). 
However, if you are on a variable rate, then you may see a rate change as you will now be under either the Lloyds TSB or the new combined bank conditions, so you should go and check with your bank as soon as the merger deal is confirmed and details of the new entity are filtering out. The rates are likely to be very close anyway, so it will just be a minor change if any (it could be up or down, so not necessarily a bad thing).

Once your initial deal is over, then you will be in the same boat as the rest of us - less lenders, less deals available, likely to see higher rates, but you can cross that bridge when you reach it, so there's no need to worry yet.

You can find information about this on MoneyMadeClear.fsa.gov.uk; the consumer targeted website by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). More detailed information can be found on the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)'s website.

It is worth noting that only customers of financial firms regulated by the FSA are covered. Most (if not all) banks and building societies in the UK are but it is worth checking just in case they're not!

you are covered for 35k per insitution. So if you have a joint account it is protected up to 70k.
Only those with more than 35k need even think about spreading it around. besides who knows which bank is safe and which is not. Who thought HBOS would be in this position. I think we all need to relax a little about this.

NATWEST customers check your bank account major problem this morning?



Ive just checked my acccount and it was £40 light as 2 payments had gone through twice as a "hiccup" they call it.which could affect other payments that are supposed to be going through and in turn they (whoever is supposed to be getting a payment) will charge a late fee.
Have contacted natwest this morning and theyre expecting a complete system update at 8am and hoping it will be resolved but stand by to check your accounts just incase so we can call and bollock em and make sure they make provisions for payments and return the overpaid amounts.

P.S a little help-if you call take date,time and name of member of staff as ive found these things tend to go unlogged coinsidentally,at least that way if worse comes to worst you'll know who to blame for lying to ya.

Unfortunately this seems to happen a lot with Natwest. It reguarly happens to me! I`ll make a payment on my card, and the transaction will appear twice on the statements from the cash machines. After a couple of days, one of the transactions is reversed, and the money put back in, this all happens automatically. Its a real pain, especially when you are short on money and can't withdraw because you`ve had twice the amount taken out.

It seems to be a problem with the way the card system works. When you purchase something a pre auth is done which "reserves" the money on your card for the payment. Then its authorised which takes the money from the card. However, it seems that instead of the pre auth being turned into an auth, the pre auth stays reserving the amount, and then the auth takes the money out separately.

Its something that been going on for the last couple of years, and i`ve never been able to get anyone from Natwest to explain why its happening properly, and more importantly stop it from happening.

I am a mortgage banker and I will tell you that the mortgage is NOT written off.  When financial institutions go out of business, the debts and assets are sold to another institution.  Your mortgage will still have to be paid.

You will soon be receiving a letter in the mail that will tell you who has acquired your mortgage and the new payment address (if applicable.)

Hope this helps.

When the UK bank Northern Rock hit hard times, before its eventual nationalisation, the government promised to protect deposits, so at least in the UK, savings up to £35,000 are protected in law (but the Chancellor's promise was to protect all deposits.)

The bank sold its assets, including its mortgage book. So your mortgage would simply bought by another bank, and you still owe it.

Not a chance.  Your loan is an asset, in any bankruptcy proceedings the assets are either sold, in this case to another bank, or they are held by the newly restructured bank.  You don't automatically lose your money either, banks carry insurance to cover deposits.

Yes, there will be a charge.  In the Republic, Bank of Ireland does this through their Foreign Exchange desk. Up to 10 working days normally, but if it has to go back to Canada for the clearing, it might take longer.  Phone them first and ask.  There was a discussion on local radio about bank charges. I didn't get to hear the whole programme, but someone was complaining a bank in US had charged 100 dollars to clear each of 3 Irish cheques. It would have been cheaper to fly there and hand over the money.  I have cashed UK cheques here with a small fee, but none from across the Atlantic.  Ask first so there are no surprises.

I think if I had the time then I would change my bank account number at the very least, and inform the government of the change right away.

I would also harass the government for a new child benefit number and NI number too, just to make them suffer!  They may (should) do that now automatically anyway, they'd be pretty stupid not to.  Even if the discs are found, there's no way to tell if the data has been compromised.

Next time you get a new cheque book, credit card or statement, it will say Lloyds Bank of Scotland instead of Halifax.  That's it.

Leave it, you shouldnt loose a penny even if it goes bust.  Which it probably wont cos' Lloyds look too likely to be merging.  This could actually be a good thing, maybe a higher savings interst rate and lower mortgage one.  If anything you should be a winner : )

Personally I think Lloyds stepping in is a positive thing. I think there'd be more to worry about if they hadn't done so because consumer confidence has been hit. There was a risk of people withdrawing everything in a panic. Lloyds coming in should help restore confidence.

Halifax is not being sold, they are merging with their main rival which is a very different thing, and the resulting group would be as strong a one as you can get. There is nothing wrong with Halifax anyway, they have a strong business. Their shares are fluctuating badly as a knock on from the Lehman bros collapse as people loose confidence in financial institutions.  Your finances will be as safe with them as any where else.

I am not sure about ISA's but as for a normal bank transfer, if it is transferrred between the same bank, ie halifax to halifax then it is instantly. My cousin transferred some money from her halifax account into my halifax account the other day and it went in instantly. If you was to transfer from say, halifax to barclays it is 3 - 5 working days but usually it is the 3 days.

Hope this helps

Hi there,

It all depends what bank your ISA is with and what back your current account is with.

If your banks both support the new faster payment system, then the money will be in Your account within 2 hours, www.fastpayments.co.uk,

However, if only one of your 2 banks support the faster payment system then the transfer will go through as a BACS transfer which takes around 3 working days to be credited to your account.

ING Direct anything to do with HBOS?



I have a fairly substantial sum of money with Bank of Scotland, Halifax and ING Direct. I am aware with HBOS that the guaranteed £35,000 should a bank go under would only be paid out once, not for each account. Tonight whilst discussing news events with friends one insists that ING Direct is under the same umbrella as HBOS. Is this correct as I understood it was a Dutch Bank?

ING Direct is owned by ING Group which is no relation to HBOS.  ING Group is based in the Netherlands and is one of the largest financial institutions in the world and currently has a stock market valuation of EUR36bn.  Have a look at this

Don't believe everything you hear.

Do the maths - 10 x 12 months = £120 plus a bit of interest, say £132 in the first year. It's going to take a long time to add up to a million.

Dream on!  If you put £10 a month into a savings account for the next 25 years - until you are 40 - you would have including interest around  7 thousand pounds! That is all.



Dont believe me?  You can work it out for yourself in a few minutes with a calculator.  Take interest as being say 6% after tax.  Get a piece of paper and write down the numbers 1 to 25, these are the number of years till you are 40.  For the first year you take £120 x 1.06 which is £128  for the next year, take your 128 and add 120 = 248 multiply by 1.06 = £262.  For the next, 262+120 x1.06 and so on until you have a figure by your 25th year.  You will find that it is just about 7 thousand pounds.  A lot different from a million which is 1000 x a thousand pounds!

Who ever gave you your information is pretty stupid.

No, Halifax and Natwest are not the same.

Natwest is part of RBS (Royal Bank of Scotland Group). it includes Ulster too. It's a huge company, with other various banks around the world.

Halifax is part of HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland).

HBOS and RBS are not the same!

It's possible that Lloyds TSB may soon take over HBOS (Halifax and Bank of Scotland).

Barclays are not part of RBS, HBOS or Lloyds TSB, but they did buy Woolwich.

check out HSBC , they are mainly an on-line banking system that links to your local personal checking/savings accounts. so you can directly deposit and withdrawl they also send you a checkcard so you can use an ATM to withdrawl funds in emergency cases.



Savings intrest is good compared to other major banks but that depends on the market as well and as of right it's not that great.

Hi, good answers so far INGDirect, HSBC, CapitalOne all have high rates for online savings.  I like ING best, simple and high security.



Also checkout bankrate.com for more choices.
