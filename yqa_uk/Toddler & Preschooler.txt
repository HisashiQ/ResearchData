The first one looks much more practical for a trip aborad as it looks smaller and has a lot of a storage space which believe me is essential.

We got one from mothercare that folds up so small it fits in the over head compartment on the plane. very useful. They still have it - online only £74.99. Comes with a raincover and bag. check it out! Great for use immediately without having to wait for it to come with the suitcases!!  made by Safety First i think its called Kite. Its definitely online i saw it the other day!!

Personally I would go with the second one as it is umbrella folding and so is much easier to use  on a plane and bus and will fit in the boot of any hire car or taxi much more easily.

I would also look at Mothercare because they have new buggies for the same price as the Maclaren once you have paid for the postage.

It looks a bit cheap to be honest. Those wheels dont look to sturdy. If its only for two weeks that shoudl be ok, it depends what country you are going to though. I mean most of spain is cobbeld and that push chair would defiently not be up to the job in spain. You would need something with bigger wheels.

It looks a bit flimsy and it doesn't fold very small if you are taking it on a plane. If you are flying I'd highly reccommend the quinny zapp. It folds into its own small bag so you can take it on as hand luggage. Solves the problem of carrying a sleeping/heavy child to the baggage collection point!

High Temperature in a toddler?



My 20 month old son had a high temperature last night.  He was off his food all day and fell asleep on his dad's shoulder at 6.30pm (very early for him, he rarely goes to bed before 9pm usually, and not without a fight, lol!)

When I went up to bed and checked on him, he was really, really hot.  I undressed him down to his vest and opened a window, but he didn't seem to cool down.  He woke up shortly afterwards and couldn't seem to get back to sleep.  I put him in our bed and he just kicked and thrashed and rolled around for ages and was burning up.  He finally went to sleep after a dose of Calpol.

He seems absolutely fine this morning however!

Is it normal for toddlers to have a high temp like this for no reason and be just fine the next day - I'm a bit worried . . .

Well, a fever is a sign that your body is trying to fight off infection. Although fevers that last too long and are very high can be a bad sign. But a little fever tells you that their body is fighting off infection.So the fact that he woke up fine tells you that his body was able to fight off whatever it was trying to get. So it is actually a good thing that he is fine today, but do not be surprised if other symptoms show up later in the day. Good Luck!

he must have had a temperatuve for a reason

take him to a doctor as soon as you can - if nothing else, this will give you peace of mind - there is no point taking chances with your child

its often the case that virusses or infections give us temperatures at night but not during the day, so you should get him checked out as soon as you can (but no panic, as he seems relatively fine now)

He could be teething. Many kids have a fever when they are cutting new teeth. Just keep an eye on him and make sure he is drinking plenty of fluids. Sometimes kids just have an off day. He could also be fighting an infection and this would cause a fever, less likely though since he sounds fine today.

He could of had a 24 hr virus and disappeared, but i will keep a eye on it as it might be still a little in his system and flair up again and turn into infection and that will cause high temp.
If  a child or an adult gets high temp its cause thats the way the body way to fight infections, or virus that enter the body. Try to kill them by heat..........

Keep an eye on him, if his temp goes up again sponge him down with a TEPID not cold flannel, all over. Cold will make his blood vessels constrict and his temp will go up further and he could fit. Check for any rashes (pin prick that blanches is usually a virus). If it continues take him to your GP. Calpol is probably the best way to go. If you can't lower his temp, he is listless or showing any other symptoms that concern you take him to A&E. It wil probably pass in a day or too, but keep a close eye on him to be sure. Good Luck

Lullabye, by Billy Joel.  It's an awesome song, and you can buy a CD for the nights when you can't be there.

Goodnight, my angel
Time to close your eyes
And save these questions for another day
I think I know what you've been asking me
I think you know what I've been trying to say
I promised I would never leave you
And you should always know
Wherever you may go
No matter where you are
I never will be far away

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to sleep
And still so many things I want to say
Remember all the songs you sang for me
When we went sailing on an emerald bay
And like a boat out on the ocean
I'm rocking you to sleep
The water's dark
And deep inside this ancient heart
You'll always be a part of me

Goodnight, my angel
Now it's time to dream
And dream how wonderful your life will be
Someday your child may cry
And if you sing this lullabye
Then in your heart
There will always be a part of me

Someday we'll all be gone
But lullabyes go on and on...
They never die
That's how you
And I
Will be

How about something that has their name in it (although must admit this only works if their is a song of their name).  With my kids I changed the words of songs to include their names.  I sing brahms lullaby to my son with the words:

Go to sleep little Dan
Go to sleep my wee Daniel
Go to sleep little Dan
Go to sleep my wee man!!

with my daughter its:-

You are my Kirsty
My Darling Kirsty
You make me happy
When skies are grey
You'll never know dear
How much I love you
Please dont take my Kirsty away

Overly affectionate M.I.L.



My M.i.l. is overly affectionate with my 4 year old..my mil lives overseas and only comes once a year and stays for a month or two...we all get on fine...but she is constantly touching my 4 year old who isnt a toddler any more and doesn'[t like it...she rubs her back or leg or pats her on the behind...I AM NOT suggesting the touching is innapropriate in any way...but she cannot seem to read my daughters signals to get off....I know she misses her a ,ot and so probably feels a lot of emotion....but I dont now how to tackle this sensitive subject...she also talks to her in a bab voice which my daughter doesnt like...its as if my MIL hasnt realised my daughter has grown up a lot....help?



</question>



<additional details>



I should mention that it also makes me unbcomfortable to see this...I dont know why...

i don't think the cuddles are bad, but just explain to her not to do the baby voice!
i understand some people are less touchy feely with their families than others, which is fair enough, she just wants to feel close to her

Oh dear love chill out. Granny needs to show her love to her grand daughter in the only way she knows. I am always cuddling my grandchildren and always will., if they don't like it they will move away.  Its all very normal. Forget the baby talk, just put up with it, none of this will do your child any harm. Its hard for grandparents when they don't see their grandchildren for long periods of time. Sorry to say but I think its your problem not your daughters.

I can TOTALLY understand this. My ex boyfriends mother is overly affectionate with my 8 year old son. She seems to think she is his mother a lot of the time and hugs and kisses him all the time. And like you said, not in an inappropriate way but just in a "for gods sake, back off" kind of way. Perhaps tell your daughter it is okay to say if she doesn't like the way her grandmother hugs her and kisses her all the time-often these things are only accepted by grandparents if they come from their grandchildren. Explain to your daughter about personal space, etc-she is old enough to understand it. I found saying 'personal bubble' worked really well when I spoke to my son about things. I think children need to learn about it quite young or it will be them invading peoples 'personal bubbles' and hugging when it isnt wanted (for example, in school, to mates). Good luck!

I can imagine why you would find this uncomfortable - and it is probably twice as bad for your daughter because she sees her so rarely.

Firstly try to get your husband to talk to her - it will be better coming from him.  If he is not prepared to you will have to do it yourself.

Just sit her down and say that your daughter finds it uncomfortable all the cuddling and overt affection she shows and could she perhaps limit it to say when she arrives and when she goes.  And tell her that she isn't a baby anymore and you would appreciate if she doesn't talk to her like she is one.

Here are some ideas:
1) Encourage to get in the habit of saying when something makes her uncomfortable. It is a good practice for a child to have the right to say or shout if they dont like something. Maybe she can tell her grandma not to do that -or move away when she starts to do it.
2) Send regular newsletters, photos etc and maybe preschool reports or something to her so she can see how she is growing up. When there is a gap between visits then she may not realise where she is developmentally.
3) If you keep talking to your daughter as you normally would then hopefully grandma will pick up on this.
4) If the visit is only short and you know saying something would cause  fuss then just grit your teeth and remind yourself and your daughter she'll be gone again soon :) my nan still talks to me as a child and I'm in my twenties I think its a grandparent thing

althernatively you can get the father to talk to her as its his mum!

Birth!!! It's true, my two boys did. I have a 16 month old, and he gets this. He's my youngest. Nothing to worry about. It's natural, and they don't know what is going on with their bodies. It's more of the parents that get embarrased over things like that.

my son would wake up with one from about 12 months or so. but his first self brought on erection was a few weeks ago.
we are starting to potty train and he saw that I wiped after i potty so he wanted to.



so i let him  he started wiping as I was doing something else in the bathroom.  When i hear him start crying  "owey owey owey!" really loud. I turn around and he has wiped himself to erection and is still wiping over and over again although now it hurts!  i explained to him that you cant wipe it that hard.

It was really funny although I did feel bad for him, and he doesnt wipe when he pees anymore.  But I will never forget that story.

My 1 and a half girl did a poop in the bath and..?



My 1 and a half year old daughter named Aly (Not her name,her nickname&gt;;]) last week did a poop in her bath I took her out , emptied it then the next night she kept pointing in the water saying ''poopey,mummy poopey'' she would try and ''crawl away from the poop'' it's like she thinks it's chasing her. 2 days later I became aware of what was happening and I put her in a chair and made her watch me clean our bathtub trying to reassure her it was gone. That night she still continued it so I pretended to grab it with toilet paper, put it in our toilet, flushed it and told her it was all gone. Still she is still sure the ''poop'' is in  there. I dont know what to do, I'm upset that she is going through this, I want to help her! Please suggest some ideas it would mean so much!!!

Okay I just had my bath cause in 10 mins I'm going to a job interview ( :D) I called her into the bathroom , I put bubbles in there I said to her ''look honey mummy's having a bath'' I grabbed some of her toys , I  splashed around.. (actually acted a bit below my age ;])  then I called her she ran a couple of times along the bath's  (she tripped &gt;:( but she got back up, strong girl ;) ) I picked her up put her in with me , I sat her on my lap and we played with the water. NOT once did she think about her worst memory she was having so much fun she forgot (I bet she can't wait for her bath tonight!!) Thank - you so much!!! without your heartful answers I wouldn't of thought of that, I mean she normally love's her bath's, that's why I was so shocked to see her looking demented and scared.

This is probably pretty normal for a 3-year-old, but it can be stopped.  Explaining to him why it is wrong may be helpful.  Children often test the waters and may actually even appreciate knowing that there are boundaries.  Praising good behavior can be helpful, but I would probably take away a privilege (such as watching TV) for a short time or something to that effect if this happens again.  I have never personally been a big fan of "time out" as I think there are other ways to make it more clear that a behavior is not accepted.  The important thing is to follow through with discipline.

How do I tell my son being gay is wrong?



After our next door neighbors moved in a few weeks ago, whom were both middle aged men. looking out the window my 7 year old little boy see the both of them sodomizing each others lips viciously! Being a believer and follower of christ, how do I tell my son being gay is wrong with out discouraging him?



</question>



<additional details>



Christian parents only.



people, It is not my opinion that being gay is wrong, it is GOD'S!!!



I am sorry most of you aren't familiar with the word of the lord, but being gay is a sin to god, and denying his truths is a slap in his face.

If you feel offended by the truth and cannot explain how I can explain the truth to my baby boy, please leave, I have a right to share the truth with my son!

Serious answer:  anytime you tell anyone anything.. just use the scripture to back it up... you dont have to find a fancy way to tell your son. its written in the WORD.... go to the bible, sit your son down, and compare it to your neighbors... in my opininon, your son is a little young for that talk, but these days, you need to nip it before he become fascinated with it.... hope that helps

You do what my family will do with our son and teach him what the Bible says.  The Bible is VERY clear that "man shall not lay with a man as he would a woman" and vice versa for women. God calls it an abomination to Him. 
While you don't need to go into all the "details" of such things with him, you could maybe say something like:

God doesn't want men to marry men the way a mommy and a daddy are married.

Answer any questions he has honestly, but in age appropriate way if he has any.  There needs to be more Christian parents who don't roll over and play dead thinking "well, we all have to get along".  Keep your wits about you on this and don't let people tell you that you are racist or prejudice or anything else. We can love the sinner, but we do not have to condone their actions. I think I'd also keep any blinds pulled that face their house because it is inappropriate for them to be on display where you and possibly other neighbors can see it.

I honestly don't think you have the right to judge these two people for kissing. And telling your son that it is wrong (in your opinion) is going to bring up a lot of questions from your son. Also, addressing this issue at such a young age can leave him with feelings of inadequacy or dirty feelings about sex in general, whether as an adult he is straight or homosexual. I would wait until your son approaches you with the question then help him to better understand what he saw.

I think you shouldn't tell him being gay is wrong.. If your son doesn't come off as the fruity type don't worry about it.. Don't judge the neighbors.. That would be wrong and it sets a bad example for your son. Just say it's their way of life.. Or its very complicated to explain and understand.. In your opinion being gay is wrong.. The times have changed and your sons generation may not feel the same way.. Don't tell him it's wrong especially at such an impressionable age.. You never know by you telling him it's wrong and no it may make him experiment in the future.. Be careful Karma is a crazy thing.. Best of luck to you!

If you tell a child not to do something they want to know why and they like to challenge the norm and are curious about sex, and love and relationships.  By telling you child it is wrong to be gay you might just be pushing some internal buttons for him to want to find out more.  If these new neighbors seem happy and are living life and loving life and well he isn't seeing that all the time at home he might think maybe you have it wrong and not the other way around.

I also believe that homosexuality is not for me but whom am I to say it is wrong, I don't have any power over other people and when my kids have asked about certain acts in public that are really inappropriate I give them an honest answer, some people like to do things to make others uncomfortable and look at them they need some attention that's all.  Of course my kids are younger but that is good enough for them they know that they do things to get good attention and to get bad attention.



Be careful when you talk to your son, ask him how he feels what he has seen and prob into what other kids say and what they say to him, helping a child understand sexuality and guiding them in life is all you can do as a parent you can't choose how they will live the life you have given them you have to trust them to live it the best you have taught, you will never be abel to control them but to teach is magical.

im Christan and I think that being gay is not wrong and how dare you tell your son what is right and what is wrong in the world you call yourself a christian but, here you are judging people when no one has the right to condemn or judge anyone but god. shame on you. If your christain then why would tell your son to hold any prejuidice against anyone your son is better off being raised by your neighbors than you. Plus your born gay its scientifically proven therefore God created gays which means he loves them too along with all his children you should teach your son to love everyone for who they are than be a homophobic a hole.

Yes I would tell him it's wrong, but at the same time I would tell him he shouldn't discrimiate aginst someone for being gay. Telling a kid it's alright to be gay is giving him a choice to choose. Keep in mind if they don't ask don't bring it up.

Give me your thumbs down, but I refuse to tell my kids that if they want to be gay it's OK. Being Gay is still hard on many people and if giving the choice they most would be strait.

Read him from the Bible where it says it is wrong, since that is why you believe what you do. You shouldn't make a big deal out of it, you will only teach hate. Instead, teach him what you think is right and that not everyone feels the same way.

I am absolutely a Christian. I do not believe like you do though. I will never teach my children that being gay is bad, people are what they are. My husband on the other hand is just like you, he thinks the kids should be raised knowing that it is wrong. I choose not to raise my children to see people that are different than them as wrong or bad. If either of my children come to me someday and tell me they are gay I will love them and support them the way a mother should. I know what the bible says, but why is it any of your business what they do. Tell your kids the truth that you believe, it's wrong in Gods eyes and that you do not approve, just don't teach them to hate people that are not like them.

Four year old daughter suddenly wets the bed...Advice please.?



Hi everyone,



My daughter has just turned 4 and has now wet the bed for each of the last 8 nights. It isnt a huge amount and the mattress is always dry but her knickers and pjs are wet. She comes to us as normal in the night to go to the toilet and pees normally then, but it looks like she let go too early.

Some additional details...she is out of nappies since she was two and has not wet the bed for about a year. Her surroundings and treatment havent changed and she is not stressed about anything. This is really so much a bolt out of the blue and we dont have enough pyjama bottoms to carry on like this every night.

Thanks in advance for suggestions, ideas and other possible reasons.

First I would talk to her about the issue. Sit her down and ask if there is anything bothering her that she may need to talk to you about. If she continues I would take her to see the doctor. She may possibly have a urine tract infection or there may be something else bothering her. Children who are potty trained and have not wet the bed for over year and then all of the sudden start have something going on.

2 year old woke up screaming/crying and won't stop!?



My 2 year old woke up screaming and crying uncontrollably. He's never quite woken up this way. I tried to lay down with him and tell him everything was alright and just stroke his hair but he kept pushing me away and brushing me off. He didn't want to be touched. So i let him get up and walk around for a little while and he just threw himself on the floor and is still crying and screaming and is now fully awake. I turned on the tv to his cartoon dvd and he wants nothing to do with it. Doesn't want his sippy cup or a snack...i'm not sure what to do or what happened. I suspected a nightmare or something, but it's going on 45 minutes of this. I thought maybe he had a charlie horse in his leg (i get them)...so i flexed his leg and let him walk around and he has no signs of one anyway cuz he's not holding his legs and they're working fine. I'm not sure what else to do or what is happening. he wants no cuddling or anything, and he's not one to throw tantrums like this..



</question>



<additional details>



Someone said I might have turned into a big scary monster to him cuz I might have done something to him?? I've never done anything to him...never hit him or nothing...only raise my voice slightly when he goes to reach for something that he shouldn't...but i never do anything mean to him. And the same person suggested hallucinations? He was in his crib, started screaming like hell and crying. I picked him up and brought him to bed with me to try to calm him down and it didn't work. Even when he was completely awake and walking around (with direction), he would calm down and then start crying and screaming and throwing himself on the floor again. Yes, this is the first time. And he just went to the doctor earlier that day with a clean bill of health. I'm not sure what the hell happened. he's playing and wide awake now...i'm going to try again to put him back to bed

Its sounds like he is having a night terror.  When a child has one of these they have no idea what is going on because they are not completely awake.  The best thing to do is just lead him quietly back to bed.  The more you try to stimulate him by talking with him or touching him it can make it worse.  I would talk to his pediatrician about it and get some tips on how you can deal with this.

He probably had a nightmare you did something to him, e.g. you turned into a big scary monster (trust me, young children's dreams are very strange), and he can't tell the difference between his dream and reality. Turn all the lights on in your house, which will calm him down, and maybe turn on some music he likes, because silence is scary for two year olds. Don't worry, he'll probably get over it. If he doesn't soon (45 minutes really is a long time, I don't want to scare you, but it is), he's most likely having hallucinations, and you will need to take him to hospital for that. 
Hope it's the first one!!

From your description I would also tip on night terror (pavor nocturnus)...horrible thing to see but it will pass. Keep the room dark and quiet and stay there with your kid until they fall asleep or wake up.

Alternately, could be headache or earache...

LOL  Way to go!!!  It's amazing how something like that is such a big deal to us!  I remember when mine first went in the potty, although I don't always count the first time as her start towards potty training.  I had her in the bathtub when she was about 16 months old and she made this face and I was like omg...we're not going in the tub!  So I quickly lifted her onto the potty and she went poopy on the potty thanks to my timing LOL. But I called EVERYONE and told them LOL.  She started wanting to go pee on the potty around 18 months old, after dinner one night she looked at me and was like "Mommy I gotta go potty"  I was like ummm okay but didn't really believe her so I took her for fun anyway and sure enough she went...again called everyone!  LOL  Congrats on the next step and big Kudos to him!!!

if it happens when she is having fun tell her how much it is hurting her body and if she still soes it tell her that if she cant stop playing to go poop she will have to wear diapers again...some kids will do this so they can wear diapers again ask her if that is wat happen but it is probably the first of these u could also suggest her not playing if she wont poop or maybe try some sort of schedule to keep her in routine and go at a certain time so she doesnt hold it in hope this helps

I went through a similar phase with my daughter once, sort of. And does it happen when she is outside playing with friends or playing something so fun that she doesn't want to stop?



If I am right, explain that she is hurting her body when she should be taking care of it instead. And tell her that if she cannot come inside to go to the bathroom, then she won't be allowed outside to have fun. It should work.
(If this is the case.)

Maybe stress?  You say this has been a battle all summer.  Maybe she missed kindergarten or the structure of kindergarten?  She could also be afraid that it is going to hurt.  You can talk to her about making food choices that will help make soft poop.  Sometimes my daughter gets constipated, so we do a lot of talking in our house about making food choices that help make soft poop.

I had tried at 2 and a half but found my son hating it so I tried at 3 and it was easy. Before you start the actual process I found that introducing my son to the potty and letting him sit  on it great and will help you see if he's interested in it. (sometimes they get scared of the potty). The method that worked for me was the egg timer method. You either put him in knickers or nothing and turn the timer. Every hour when the buzzer goes off you take him to the potty (sometimes cause they're used to hearing the buzzer they go there themselves). Really dedicate a full day to it so that you get him to pee at least once in the potty. When he does go all out, praise him to high heaven and reward him with a sticker or lolly for his achievement. It's a bit of a process but we all go through it.

With my son I let him wear his nappy at night. I found that until you wake her up in the morning and she is dry (make sure that it is happening a couple of days in a row to be sure) it is futile. It's alot easier to control during the day. Remember to keep a potty in her room just in case she wakes through the night wanting to pee. The rest you just have to let it come naturally.

At this age, she may need to continue wearing the nappie while sleeping.  If she doesn't stay dry through the night when perhaps 4, 5, or 6 years old, then there are ways to help--primarily by making sure the child wakens to use the bathroom.

My 5 week old hasn't eaten ALL day. Its been over 9 hours... is she sick?



She usually eats every three hours. I fed her at 3 am just like normal. She want back to sleep and woke up at 7 am just like normal but didnt want any food. She has just been sitting contently all day. She's been asleep the past hour. I have been trying to feed her and she just doesn't seem hungry....whats going on???

Just to clarify, I breast feed her only. And I pump a little too.



</question>



<additional details>



She actually happens to have a doctor appointment tomorrow morning. And no, there's no fever. She seems very happy. I just pumped a little an am going to try to feed her again.

Also, the times I have tried to feed her today she has gotton some food. I think I made it sound worse cuz I'm worried. But she has had very small nibbles through out the day today.



I just took her temperature and its 97.1.  her neck feels a bit cool, but she has just been laying in her swing, so i think that might be normal.

If she's gained weight appropriately until now the its unlikely she would suddenly starve without crying.



You probably wouldn't wake a baby if she slept for 9 hours at that age (some guidelines say 4 weeks some say 6).  And small sips can add up.

http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#br...
Some mothers become concerned if baby begins to nurse in very short sessions. Most breastfeeding experts advise that if the baby continues to have plenty of wet diapers, regular bowel movements, is gaining weight well and meeting developmental milestones, then baby is getting enough breastmilk. Even sessions as short as five minutes can be normal, as long as baby continues to grow and do well.

http://www.llli.org//NB/NBNovDec92p173.h...
Possible Causes of a Nursing Strike

Sometimes the cause of a nursing strike is obvious, but other times the mother may never discover the reason. Some common causes for a baby to refuse to nurse include:



* mouth pain from teething, an injury, a cold sore, or a fungus infection, such as thrush,



* an ear infection, which may cause pressure or pain while nursing,



* pain while being held in the nursing position, perhaps due to an immunization or an injury,



* a cold or stuffy nose that makes breathing difficult while nursing,



* too many bottles, overuse of a pacifier, or frequent thumbsucking, which &gt;may lead to a reduced milk supply,



* regular distractions and interruptions while nursing,



* an unusually long separation from mother.



There may be situations or actions on the mother's part that contribute to a baby's refusal to nurse:



* a strong reaction to a baby's bite,



* a major change in routine, such as moving or traveling,



* limiting and/or rigidly scheduling feedings,



* talking in a loud voice or arguing with other family members while nursing,



* overstimulation, stress, or tension from an overly full schedule or an upset in the home,



* repeatedly putting off the baby when she wants to nurse or letting her cry.



http://www.llli.org//FAQ/strike.html
Nursing strikes happen for many reasons. They are almost always a temporary reaction to an external factor, although sometimes their cause is never determined. Here are some of the most common triggers of nursing strikes:



* You've changed your deodorant, soap, perfume, lotion, etc. and you smell "different" to your baby.



* You've been under stress (such as having extra company, traveling, moving, dealing with a family crisis).



* Your baby or toddler has an illness or injury that makes nursing uncomfortable (an ear infection, a stuffy nose, thrush, a cut in the mouth).



* Your baby has sore gums from teething.



* You've recently changed your nursing patterns (started a new job, left the baby with a sitter more than usual, put off nursing because of being busy, etc.).



* You reacted strongly when your baby bit you, and the baby was frightened.



http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/b...
Things that can cause a strike:



* A separation from mother that is longer than the child is typically accustomed to having between nursing sessions



* An illness that is causing a stuffy nose, making it difficult to breath while nursing



* An illness causing a sore mouth or throat



* Nipple confusion caused by artificial nipples and/or pacifiers



* Teething pain



* Pain while in the nursing position, due to an ear infection or injury



* Too many distractions in the nursing environment, such as other children, phone, etc. drawing the baby's attention away from nursing



* A dramatic reaction to baby having bitten you while nursing

Could be several things (some you should be concerned with, some not) but the bottom line is that an infant that goes without eating should be brought to the doctor or the hospital.  I will tell you my own horror story, not to scare you but to illustrate how serious it can be and how often doctors don't know what's going on.  I'll make it as short as possible.  When my two-year old son was born he wasn't eating well at all.  We kept bringing him to the doctor and they kept telling us they weren't too concerned.  They treated him for GERD as that's a common problem in infants.  One day, my son went 24 hours without eating and we brought him to the hospital where they did a barium swallow with a small bowel follow through (the follow through was key).  They found that my son had a malrotation and needed immediate emergency surgery (this was at 3 months).  The surgery was performed but complications arose, which is very common with intestinal surgery, and he needed two more surgeries within the next couple of months.  Today he still has problems and can only digest small amounts of liquids at a time so he is on a continuous feed using a feeding pump.  He is otherwise healthy and happy and will hopefully be off the feeding tube before he has to start school in a few years.

Again, I am not trying to scare you.  It could very well be nothing.  It could be GERD, it could be a cold, it could be a lot of simple things but you should always take an infant not eating seriously.  Good luck and keep us posted.

What most stretches your patience (people, pets or things)?
Mine is, we have a `slow` plughole in the bathroom sink and no matter how many times I clear it, it`s just as slow the following day.  Really annoying when you want to rinse your hair several times and things like that.
The cat comes a close second when he meows to come into the house, then, when I open the door for him, he just stands there looking gormless.

Im 13 weeks pregnant and they PUSH me around to get on the bus, I finally snapped and said LOOK your old enough to know better, JK and SK's should be getting on the bus first and to line up! and they just look at you with this stupid look like they don't know what your talking about!! UGH that really ticks me off, and the bus driver does NOTHING about it, I finally got a hold of the school and said what I had to say and hopefully the principal talking to them will help.

When you buy a doll for a little girl....?



My 3-1/2 year old daughter received a Cabbage Patch Doll for Christmas from a relative on my husband's side of the family. Whenever I've bought dolls like this for my daughter (or other little girls) I usually try to find something about the doll that resembles the recipient. You know, a doll that looks like the recipient, has the same name, same birthday (as with Cabbage Patch Dolls) etc.

But, this doll she received looks nothing like her. It's a different race, nothing similar at all.

Just curious. Not mad or irritated or anything, just puzzled. I thought most little girls liked dolls that looked like them. Am I the only one who looks at and thinks about little minute details like that? I just wonder what the thought process behind something like this is. Do most people just grab a doll and go? Do they scrutinize every detail (like I do)?

I am only curious. Personally, I think it's kinda cool that she's got something different, I am just curious about the thought process.

Sometimes people pick dolls just because they think they are cute. They like that particular doll. Other times, it is an attempt to blur the lines of prejudice in the upcoming generation. Also, if the doll looks like the giver, it is possible they want the child to remember them when they play with the doll.



I am a doll collector. I collect most of my dolls because they remind me of someone. I have all different races. Of course, I also have to like the way they look too. I think that different people have different reasons as to why they pick a doll.

Haha yeah I know what you mean. When I was a little girl I liked having my dolls look like me, so that I could pretend like they were me. I have brown hair, so it was nice when the doll had brown hair. I also was a fan of Beanie Babies and I always checked the birthdays in the tags to see if they had the same birthday as me. I think my mom finally found one with the same birthday. But yeah, I totally understand your thought process. =]

When I buy dolls for my daughters, I look for one that is different from any other doll that they have.  I want there to be something unique about this particular doll that will set it apart.

Different sizes, different hair colors, different skin tone...

If I buy multiple dolls from the same line (as I often do...one for each of my girls), I will look for different head sculpts and hair colors.  If I cannot find such variances, I will purchase from a different line or a different company.

My daughter doesn't seem to care about her dolls looking like her.  In fact, the one doll that she picked out herself is of a different race.  She says she likes the doll because it has beautiful brown skin and eyes (my daughter has very light skin and blue eyes).  I think choosing a doll that resembles the recipient is an adult notion.

It depends.

If I were buying a Barbie, I'd probably match race to the recipients' race.  Then again, I can't imagine buying a Barbie.  :)

Well my daughter has alot of dolls and I dont necessarily buy them all to resemble her, she has alot of the bald newborn looking dolls,and she has a red head cabbage patch kid and a boy one that used to be mine when they first came out ( i dont have red hair either). Alot of dolls you get the point....so anyways this Christmas I was looking at the "Baby so Real" dolls for her, and they are supposed to look like the recipient according to the commercial, so I thought that was kind of cool but I could not find one with brown hair and blue eyes like my daughter so I kind of forgot about it. But my grandma ended up buying her one and it has brownish red hair and like hazel eyes,so it doesn't look like my daughter but its cute. Actually on the website they consider the doll my daughter got to be Hispanic and I dont think it looks Hispanic at all. I have yet to find one with brown hair and blue eyes.

I think like you.  I'm hispanic and try to buy dolls that look like my daughter.  This Chistmas my daughter recieved a barbie with blue and blond hair.  My past experience with light blond haired barbies was that my daughter once told me she wished her hair was blond like the barbies.  It hurt me to hear her say that she didn't like her color hair (she was 4 at the time).



So I gave that barbie away and bought her 4 beautiful dark skinned and hair Barbies and she has never mentioned any thing simular.  All skin colored and hair type Barbies and dolls are beautful!  I just think that children like to identify with the toys they have.

Doctor told me chocolate and strawberry, or other flavored milk are fine its more important they get the milk into them and not the fact that they have sugar in them. The extra calcium and vitamins that Ovaltine and Nest-Quick add are also benefits that flavored milk offers. My 5 year old only liked strawberry milk at that age. Now he likes any type of milk, even plain. You can also try soy milk it has all the vitamins of regular milk and comes in Chocolate, Vanilla, and regular has a bit of a smoother taste than regular milk.

My daughter was the same.  I used the Enfagrow for 12+ months old and I made sure that any juice I gave her also had added calcium. The combination, along with the solid foods she was eating made sure she was getting the nutrients she needed.



Some kids just don't like milk but continue to offer it to her, she may change her mind in the future (did you try adding a tiny bit of chocolate syrup?).  I did this too and it worked and each time I reduced the amount of syrup and now she prefers regular milk to chocolate milk - probably the only kid I know that does.



Good luck.

Many of your flavorings such as bosco, hershey syrup or nestles quik is lower in sugar and fat free, a little will not be any more harmful than 100% fruit juice.



To meet her daily allowance of dairy: remember you can give her cheese, yogurt (many good flavor varieties), make things that contain milk such as cream of wheat, oats, pancakes and she will still get what you are concerned she could be lacking.



When my little one was young, periodically we purchased Pediasure it comes in strawberry, vanilla and chocolate and is fortified with vitamins so it taste good and is good for them.



If your little one gets sick from milk or dairy may want to talk to your pediatrician and make sure your little one is not anemic or lactose intolerant and they can best advise you.

try some goat milk.  it tastes different than cow's milk and it's actually very good for children and babies.  my daughter loves all milk .. goat milk comes in 3% fat too.



maybe try the milk cold? maybe your grand daughter doesn't like it warm because it isn't formula or breast milk.  you could also ease her into drinking milk by mixing it half and half with whatever she was drinking before (formula or breast milk) and slowly increase the milk part until it's 100% milk.



Good luck!

They say that Ovaltine is vitamin enriched.  You might just put a little in the milk - there is also strawberry and banana flavor in Nestle Quick that you can get.  Just don't use the full serving size and maybe that will help.  She might like Soy milk better - I believe there is a brand called Silk and it comes in several flavors too.

If she doesn't like it, don't give it to her. There are plenty of other foods with calcium and protein. I personally don't think milk is that good for us. It's protein is hard to break down and digest for humans. And NEVER willingly put white sugar on or in anything for your small child..or any child for that matter. Its poison and addictive...enough of our foods have sugar in it to give cause for concern. Good luck to you

If she doesn't like milk she doesn't HAVE to have it.



Cow's milk is not a necessary source of nutrition.  It's an easy one, but those nutrients can be found elsewhere.

I suggest you guys try the Homedics Soundspa Lullaby, that has worked awesome for my daughter, she got it for Christmas and is now 19 months old, we use it every night and she never has a problem sleeping. Its nice as it has 3 different discs for different shows for the baby, a variety of music and a timer that I always set for 15 min and she is asleep before it goes off.

They have a sample of how it works and closeups of the projection discs.
You can get it for $20 at walmart.

It's not thier age so much as their "maturity" to handle preschool.  Let me explain:



My nephew is 3 years old.  He doesn't yet go to preschool.  He is very shy, clingy and screams when his mom drops him off--this went on for 3 weeks.  She finally decided that he isn't quite ready to be gone from her side for long periods of time.  She is working on taking him to a play date for an hour at a time and leaving him there so he gets used to the idea of not being with Mommy.  This she hopes will ease him into the lengthier preschool next year.



My niece is 2 1/2 years old. She is very outgoing, social and communicative.  She started preschool this year and really enjoys it. It's very natural for her.



Now, I do think it is important for children to go to preschool because it helps them get used to being away from Mommy and Daddy as well as helps them get used to the idea of what "school" is and helps socialize them.  It just depends on where your child is in that maturity ability where they are comfortable leaving you for periods of time.



That's just my take on it.

My eldest is Anaphylactic to peanuts, and my youngest has extreme intolerances. As your daughter is having physical reactions, it seems to be an allergy, rather than an intolerance. You need to look at the ingredients of all the food you give her and try to get back to basics to rule out what could be causing this. Most common allergies are to Peanuts, Eggs, Dairy and Wheat. Try cutting these out and see if it helps. Remember to remove "may contain traces of" as well. I also give my son Claratyne on a daily basis to build up his tolerance. If she seems to improve, introduce one product at a time to see what she reacts to.

My teenager started getting the same reaction you describe when she was a toddler.  It turns out that she's severely allergic to both groundnuts and treenuts.  However, this wasn't diagnosed until she was about 8 years old.  Up until that point, I would notice hives, and sometimes she would come to me, with her eyelids literally swollen shut.  Definitely press for a total allergy panel-- my daughter's doctors would always dismiss my concerns, saying she was either too young to be so allergic to anything, or else it was just simple hay fever.  Fortunately, I found one doctor who demanded that it get done, and was lucky to catch the diagnosis.  Good luck.

swim diapers aren't meant to hold "fluids" which includes urine. Even when they are wet they don't swell up because they are made to resit fluids hence why the urine also leaks out. You just noticed it because she hadn't been in the water yet.

My 2 month old son listening to metal music?



If I always had metal music playing kinda soft in the background all the time, would it just naturally make him grow up liking music a lot? Has there been anything that has proved this? What age would you give your son a guitar? His father was reaaaalllyyyy good at guitar is why I am asking.

If you always play the same kind of music your son could grow up either loving it or loathing it.  Play different kinds of music so that he gets a broader understand and appreciation of music.  Yes, play some classical stuff too.



Don't give your son a guitar unless you're sure he wants to spend the time learning how to play it.  Guitars are expensive so you don't want to shell out a whole lot of money only to have the thing end up buried in the back of a closet somewhere.

do not give your son metal music at that age, maybe when he is older like 5 or 6 and up, at age 2 months is too young, ti will have a bad effect on him maybe play softer music



and dont force your son to play the guitar, if he wants to learn he will most likely tell you and go on from there, if you force your son to playing the guitar he might hate it in the future and you dont want that

I don't think metal is appropriate music for a baby. It might scare him and it is definitely not good for his ears. Depending on the band, it might also have inappropriate lyrics for a child to listen to. Why don't you just start with some calm, soothing music or some soft rock. This will still let him have appreciation for music.  Most kids like music and if you make an effort to have it in his life and he gets his father's natural talent, he will definitely like it. You can get him one of those toy guitars when he is about 4 or 5. When he gets older- 8 or 10, if he is interested, you can get him a real youth size guitar and have him start guitar lessons, and he can start listening to more hard rock or metal. But who knows what kind of music will be popular by then. Most kids think the music their parents like is terrible, until they get to be college age, and then they like whatever their parents liked as young kids. That's why a lot of teens today love 80's music and people in their 20's love 70's rock.

If you want him to grow up to play, then why not expose him to all sorts of music, then he may be more original?
I have no problems with metal, but there are studies that say the speed of beat in it raises the heart rate and that leads to a sense of anxiety. May be better left until hes older....

in honesty, it sounds like he is just coming down with something. he's only been sick once has he? Check his whole body for any rash, and if there is a rash check that it vanishes under pressure.. either use glass, or another way is to pull the skin so there is tension (as if ur opening a bag of crisps-action) pull the skin apart.. as this gives more pressure than the glass...



keep him cool by stripping him, do not use a fan directly on him, if u use a fan, put it on oscilating mode so it cools the air rather than on him...



keep his temp under control - calpol, check the instructions for the correct dose



try to keep fluids down him
- if he is not taking milk, try with water, as he needs to keep hydrated.



if you can't control his temp at home or his condtion isn't improving / or he not taking any fluids take him to hosp.
As they will do something likea fluid balance thing with him, and administer colpol and brufen to keep temp down and they'll monitor it.

My 17 month old son is having nightmares?



Not only does it wake him and me up many times during the night, it is quite heartbreaking as his mother to not be able to "make them go away" I've heard they get into this very sensitive age now where things can seem a bit scary so I understand it is a normal part of them growing up. He is also very scared of "bugs" and and it could be a string or a hair on the pillow. We comfort him and talk to him about how bugs aren't bad and all that but I really just hope this will pass soon. If you experienced this with your child could you share please? How long did this go one? What worked for you?



Thank you

What are the brands of soy milk in the market.  Is it safe for 3 year old children?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



There are several brands, some with sweetening, some without, some with vitamins or calcium.
The thing that would concern me is the phytoestrogens, these are found in soy products (one reason they think it can help during menopause and why there is research about soy helping prevent breast cancer) Phytoestrogens mimic hormones in the body. For this reason I would limit the amount of soy any child had (which ever gender).
My child had a milk allergy and we used Oatly with calcium.

Night time potty training question...?



I decided to leave potty training until my daughter turned 4.  She is day trained.  I put her in knickers and she only had 3 accidents with number ones and 1 accident with number twos.  She was doing all her number ones in the toilet by day 4.  She was constipated so it took longer to get her to do her number twos in the toilet... but it was only about 2 weeks total before she was fully trained.
So we are onto night training already.  It's been almost 2 weeks and she hasn't had one accident.  She has stayed dry EVERY night so far.  The thing is, she gets a drink at dinner time and she goes to the toilet before bed and sometimes she will get out of bed after about 30 mins and go to the toilet again.  I want to believe she is already night trained because she is 4 and she is just able to stay dry all night.  But then I think maybe it's just because she goes to bed/sleep with an entirely empty bladder?  Should I be giving her a drink before she goes to sleep?  And then wake her up after an hour or so?  I'm thinking if she had a drink right before going to bed she wouldn't wake up if she needed to go.... because she isn't being trained to wake herself up...
What do you think? She goes to bed in knickers.

Probably not - unless you are talking about your 4 year old dog.  Children can be really hard work - but they are not going to learn anything by being kept on restraints.  Unless there is something medically wrong with him, he just needs to learn that if he behaves unacceptably then there will be a consequence for his actions.  You need to be consistent with this and present the punishment in a firm but loving way - just matter of fact with no arguments with him about it.  Time out works for my children (I also have a 4 year old boy - but we have been doing this with him since he was 2).  He has got to learn to respect you, but you may also want to look at the attention he gets - does he only get attention when he is misbehaving or do you spend a good amount of time with him playing with him and doing activities where you are encouraging his good behaviour. All the best, we all have times where we don't particularly like our children but it doesn't mean though that we don't love them to bits.

Of course it is! You're talking about your dog right?



because if your talking about your child it's considered abuse and you being a bad mother. Child Services can take him away.



You gotta learn that 4 year-olds act like that. It's natural. You probably did too.



And if you love him so much you wouldn't even think about doing something crucial like that!

Babysitting problems (bedtime!)?



I'm 14 years old, i babysit for 2 girls. One is called Jilly who is 5 and Caitlen who is 7. I babysitted for them last night from 6.30 until 8.30.
I also babysitted for them last weekened which was my first time and their mom put them to bed before she left because they wouldnt go so last night was my 2nd time babysitting for them but i was the one who put them in bed.



It was a big palava last night.. so the mom and the girls picked me up then the mom dropped me and the girls off because she was going out for a meal with her friends. So i took the 2 girls into the house. They have a puppy too so it came up as well. Their mom had said to me to read them "Daisy" then put them to bed. So i thought that would be okay. There was something on TV that they liked so we went into the house and watched it for 10 minutes. I made it clear that in "10 minutes we'll start getting ready for bed." So while the older one was watching TV i read the younger one her book, she was interested and quite happy. The programme finished so i got the girls to go upstairs with me and the little puppy came. It was sooo hard. The younger one was just going biserk laughing and throwing herself about and she was a little madamme when it came to PJS. They both have their seperate rooms. THe older one kept trying to change the subject, she showed me her collection and i was like "thats really nice! Right lets get into our PJS!" and she was like "oh look and this one too!" she kept trying to change the subject. After about 20 minutes i managed to get the younger one in PJS. The dog then did a poo!!! So i cleaned it up and put the puppy downstairs into its bed. I came back up and got the older one into her PJS which was hard too! THen the older one brushed her teeth and i said to the little one that she needed to do hers. She told me she didnt have a tooth brush! I didnt bother persisting so i bribed the little one to her room, turned the lights off the way they usually sleep. The older one sat on her bed but was still mucking around and then they said they didnt want to sleep alone so they wanted to sleep together. I then put the younger one with the older one and then the suddenly went " we want to sleep in mummys bed!!!" and they were persistent so i called the mom to check that was okay and she said that it was fine so i put them in bed, they then wanted me to read stories and when i finished and calmed them down i turned the lights out and 10 minutes after leaving the room the younger one started crying because the older one pinched her. i thought oh god and she was so upset so i had to call their mom again which i felt really bad about and she said to me on the phone just to keep the younger one up until their dad got home and at that moment their dad got home. Im such a failure!! I didnt actually get them to go to sleep!! I feel so bad and i think the mom and dad are kind of like o..k when they found out that the girls werent asleep when they got home. Im babysitting again though... pleeease i need tips????
I cant put them in a bath and i dont sing...seriously.

Thye need to gain respect for you and they have none. You will have to put your feet down and tell them. Here's an idea.
You tell them that if they don't listen to you and go to bed without any whining or stalling, there won't be a surprise for them the next time you babysit.
No matter how much they ask you, don't tell them.



What you can do for surprises the next time you babysit-let them watch a movie- play a card game (they seem to like it)- play a board game- skits (I used to pretend i was in a fairy land and act it out) the girls loved it.

Worried about toddler?



Our family friends have a child that will turn three years old next week.



He has not yet learned to talk, still has a bottle, and still wears nappies/diapers.



He knows a lot of words, but he doesn't put sentences together or anything.



I know it isn't a learning problem, because he learns really quickly. I taught him how to do a thumbs up in five minutes - he hadn't done it before. I've taught him other things too.



He isn't being taught to talk.
He calls a bottle something else (I can't remember the word), but instead of teaching him the correct word they just give it to him when he uses that word. Stuff like that. I can't correct him in front of them because that would rude, and I can't say anything to them because I would feel really rude.



It's their third child too, so it isn't as if they've never done it before.



So what I'm really asking is, it okay that he isn't talking properly and doing stuff properly yet?



Thanks.

I was six when I eventually stopped using my bottle and dummy. My sister only started walking at three, were both normal, well adjusted adults today.



It's more annoying and frustrating than harmful for a tot to use words like baba for bottle and Tietie for a dummy...Don't worry, he sounds like a bright little one and will develop fine at his own pace.

Unfortunately some parents are lazy and don't spend enough time doing things with their kids to teach them and help them progress as they grow.  Alternatively, some parents just don't realize that they aren't doing enough to help their kids.
The child will suffer when he reaches school as he won't be as advanced as most of his classmates and so will not do as well as them.  If he's not talking properly then it can affect him socially.
If you are concerned and these people are your friends then you should be able to talk to them.  Don't tell them that what they are doing is wrong, but find a way to discuss it without sounding like your criticizing.

My four year old has only recently become potty trained.  And my 2 year old isn't saying any two word sentences and all her words are partial words (eg "ink" for "drink") and we ARE trying to teach her.  Some kids are just slow. Our four year old was saying heaps at two... compared to her sister I mean.  She could say "shoes" and other words that aren't easy like "uh oh" LOL That is our two year olds fav thing to say.
Our four year old was still using a pacifier at 2.4 years.  And our two year old still uses bottles.



Some kids are just slower... it doesn't mean that the parents are bad parents or that they don't care.  Do you have kids?  Keep in mind they have three.  It isn't easy having two and it gets harder with each extra child.  It means you have less time for each one. And that you are more tired... some days I just can't be bothered... so just because they let something like the word he uses for bottle slip, doesn't mean they don't care.

How to solve bleeding nappy rash?



My 1 year old is teething and has a nasty nappy rash that is irritated by any poohs in his nappy. Obviously I change him as soon as I can to prevent discomfort and apply barrier cream, but these sores are now bleeding slightly. Apart from 'airing time' and sensitive wipes, does anyone have any good recommendations for how I can make this better.. .e.g better barrier/treatment creams that are available in the UK or diet tips to make this faeces less irritating to his skin.
Many thanks to all who answer. Sarah and Sam

Don't give your tot any juices or raw fruit, as it's acid content is very high, also, try airing his bottom as much as possible. Maizena is a flour product that looks like talk, wich helps when put liberally over barrier cream, but i'm not sure if it's available in the UK...



You should consult your GP or pharmasist on what p[roducts to use...

Try using creams that are prescribed for eczema while the sores are irritated and red. Our pediatric dermatologist suggest pharmacy type creams such as Hydrozole which contain a tiny bit of hydrocortisone (steroid). You could try getting a prescription for Elidel which doesn't have steroids, but it is less effective.
Sudocrem is a great barrier cream.

Here's what I did/do.  Don't use wipes at all until the sores are gone.  Give a bath each time after a poo.  Like you said, let your baby's bottom air dry.  Use nursery gel (aka Vaseline) as a barrier and use a lot of pure cornstarch baby powder.  It will take a good 24 hours and a lot of baths and time air drying but it will work.  Check with the pharmacist, but mine recommended over-the-counter anti-fungal cream for athlete's foot and it worked.  It was amazing!

Stay away from fruit juice and anything acidic.  Lots of air time and warm (not to the point it would sting their bottom) baths.



Use a cool washcloth instead of baby wipes.  Use Vaseline.  It's the best IMO ... it really puts a thick layer of protection there.  It doesn't come off after they wet themselves.  I use it on my hands because I have bad dermatitis and even after washing them a few times it is still there.



Stay away from anything scented and anything with alcohol in it.  Even the baby wipes for sensitive skin still have the alcohol in them... I'm not talking about drinking alcohol LOL I mean the stuff that kills germs.

Single 22 yr. old mom in need of advice on how to keep her 2 yr. old son away from the television!?!?



My son is very intelligent. Actually, that's an understatement. He is advanced for his age and he learns most of it from tv shows like Dora the Explorer, Go, Go Diego, Blues Clues, etc. The problem is that I feel like I am not showing him enough attention between school (online) and work. Him and I are together all evening and night, but I am mostly on the computer doing schoolwork and I am beginning to feel convicted because I am always putting on another DVD for him to watch and I can see that he is getting bored with the television. I feel absolutely horrible and it hurts my soul to see my son with nothing to do and his mommy always doing schoolwork. Someone please help me....

Make dates with your son. Sometimes you need a break too.  Mark in a calendar at least a day for a weekly activity like going to the park,story time, making no bake cookies. Promise yourself you will keep the date. Also give him activities he can do with his hands while you are working, he can sit in the table across from you and give him play doh or paint and he can let go his imagination, and give him the sense that you 2 are doing something together.  Put a trunk or a big box with costumes, balls, stuffed animals, coloring books, hats, toys, books, puzzless and things he can play with, just let him explore. Is hard being a student and a mommy, let your imagination go!!

Unfortunately you are forced to do what you are doing, someone's gotta look to the future.  You can just ensure that he watches only children's shows and you can try to keep him by your side while he watches TV and you study.  Also, there are other activities you know, like play doh, coloring, etc that might be able to keep him busy 20 minutes at a time or so.

You could always sit him down with books, toys, etc. instead of turning on the t.v. in your free time do active activities with him. when your really busy you can put him down for a nap and when he wakes up spend time with him. Have a family member, or friend come over so they could keep him company. or have them bring someone over his age to play with.

i grew up on sesame street, and went to an ivy league.  with that said, my grandmother did take time out of every day to read with me, and i still have a love of reading.  so on one hand, don't be afraid of the tv, just make sure what he's watching is educational (the tv CAN be a learning tool).  But also try to take the time to be interactive- try to read with him at least half an hour a day, and during the weekends try to do things that are fun and educational, like going to a children museum, hiking, etc.  but if your son sees you working hard towards your education, that's what he will think is normal and will emulate.

I am a 31 year old Dad with 3 daughters ranging from 5-12. I am also self-employed working from home and doing home-school with all 3, so I can very much sympathize with you. What I found works best is to set a schedule. Make a schedule that your son can see that clearly shows Mommy's Work Time, Mommy's School Time and Mommy's Play Time. And when it's time for Mommy's Play Time, stop what you are doing and take time for your Son. Whether you are playing a board game, reading, going to the park, going for a walk or just playing with his toys, you are showing him that you love him and know how important he is in your life. Then, he will be more willing to entertain himself in your busy times. Also, get him Lego Duplo blocks to build with. Those have saved me countless times, and kids love playing with them and showing off what they created with their imaginations :)

Wow... this sounds like my life made over. I have online classes, work full time, and have a 2 year old.



I know what you mean when you say you feel horrible for doing these things. But maybe you should lighten your school load. When I take my classes online, I make sure I only take 2 classes at time, and when I take classes on campus I make sure I only take 3 at a time, that way I can balance my time with my daughter.



Although, its okay for him to watch some of these shows, just set a time limit. Say an hour and a half a day or whatever is good for you. So you will have time to do your homework during that hour and a half and then stop what your doing, and interact with him. You will feel so awesome when you know that YOU taught him those things, instead of a dvd.



P.s.
I put my daughter to bed around 8:30 and I do MOST of my cleaning, school work, and personal time after she goes to bed. I know it means less time for me to get rest, but being a single mom with school, work, and a 2 year old is NOT easy by all means. Sometimes you have to sacrafice in your area of sleep to give him the time he needs with you.



Good luck!

1. Use a cool washcloth instead of baby wipes.



2. Don't use any perfumed, scented, alcohol containing products down there.



3. Heaps of air time... letting her lie on towels or cloth diaper without diaper on.
4. Use Vaseline... it is the best barrier thing IMO I have two kids.
Vaseline stays on for AGES and it's like baby oil... the urine just runs over it.
5.  Stay away from acidic foods eg citrus fruit, juice, etc...
P.S. Don't change her every 30 mins... my god.  Diapers are so expensive!  Every 2 hours should be fine if you use disposables.  If you use cloth every hour. As long as you change dirty diapers immediately then the rash should clear up.
Oh and give her nice warm (not hot) baths every day to keep the bottom clean ... it helps get rid of the rash faster too.

Night time potty training question...?



I decided to leave potty training until my daughter turned 4.  She is day trained.  I put her in knickers and she only had 3 accidents with number ones and 1 accident with number twos.  She was doing all her number ones in the toilet by day 4.  She was constipated so it took longer to get her to do her number twos in the toilet... but it was only about 2 weeks total before she was fully trained.
So we are onto night training already.  It's been almost 2 weeks and she hasn't had one accident.  She has stayed dry EVERY night so far.  The thing is, she gets a drink at dinner time and she goes to the toilet before bed and sometimes she will get out of bed after about 30 mins and go to the toilet again.  I want to believe she is already night trained because she is 4 and she is just able to stay dry all night.  But then I think maybe it's just because she goes to bed/sleep with an entirely empty bladder?  Should I be giving her a drink before she goes to sleep?  And then wake her up after an hour or so?  I'm thinking if she had a drink right before going to bed she wouldn't wake up if she needed to go.... because she isn't being trained to wake herself up...
What do you think? She goes to bed in knickers.



</question>



<additional details>



Really?? Because she has her last drink between 6-8pm and goes to bed between 7-9pm sometimes later... she usually goes to the toilet right before she goes to bed and sometimes she gets up after 30 mins (before falling asleep) and goes again.



How long should I wait before saying she is fully trained?  It's been almost 2 weeks ... should we wait like 3 months or what? I just don't want to go telling my family that she is fully trained and then have her proove me wrong HAHA



Yes she is 4 and yes she just got day trained.  It only took 2 WEEKS to potty train her.  From start to finish.  How long did it take you?  I'm assuming you do have kids?  And that they are potty trained?



As for the drinks... she has her drink with her dinner and she goes to bed at least one hour or longer after she has dinner so no, we don't leave it too late to give her a drink.



And knickers FYI are underpants.  Where are you from??  Knickers are not diapers or pull ups.  ROFL
I bet you are a teenager or in your early 20s.  Talk about judgemental.
What makes you an expert? No I'm not lazy... I chose to leave it later because I knew it wouldn't take as long as she would be more ready and aware of when she needed to go.  And also more physically ready as in ... being able to get onto the toilet and wipe herself and wash her own hands etc...
Grow up!



You can't even write properly... I'm guessing you are like 14 LOL



P.S. Let kids be kids.  Everyone wants them to grow up too fast.  Everyone wants their kids potty trained by 1,2 or 3 (yes some think kids should be trained by 1!) and they think it is wrong for a kid over age 6 months or whatever to use a bottle or dummy.  They should be walking and talking by one... blah blah blah.  Kids are all different and are all ready to do things at different ages.



And it is not going to hurt a child to learn something later.



I guess you think it is wrong to homeschool also?



I think you need to reread my post because you obviously misunderstood me.  I said she HAS NOT had any accidents.  That is good right?  So what if she gets up after 30 mins to go to the toilet again?  Some kids get up in the middle of the night.  Wooptee doo!  It would be different if I said she has been wetting the bed.

4 yrs old???? My god, and you're just finshing up the potty training. Are you lazy or what/
Whatever you do, do not gave her a drink before bed and get rid of the knickers. She should be wearing regular underwears by now.
What if ...she has an accident. Most kids do. Just reassure her during the night, change her and tuck her back into bed.
Don't forget that it takes at least one hour for that drink to get to the bladder, if she's getting up 1/2 hour after bed, then you are gaving her a drink too late after supper.

ok...I am from the USA and we call nickers/half pants/or capris. But anyway...I would say you don't need to give her anything else to drink, because then she will be peeing the bed. Or getting up every couple hours. I think your routine is just fine. And since you know she is going to get up after a 1/2 hour of you putting her to bed, maybe let her stay up for that 1/2 hour?!? Just a suggestion. As for saying when she is 'fully potty trained' honestly...usually its not something you need to go calling your whole family over for. Because most likely they will have suspected that she should have been potty trained by now. But if you do want to rejoice in the matter...I would wait a full month. Starting from today. Let her go a whole month of not having any accidents, especially at night time, then you can call everyone and have a party. Often times kids will try to relaspe. Especially if their lifestyle/routine changes. But at this age, she shouldn't relaspe any. Lets hope any!



Good Luck! And sorry for that other person that was being rude to you! I gave them a thumbs down!

My 17 month old son is having nightmares?



Not only does it wake him and me up many times during the night, it is quite heartbreaking as his mother to not be able to "make them go away" I've heard they get into this very sensitive age now where things can seem a bit scary so I understand it is a normal part of them growing up. He is also very scared of "bugs" and and it could be a string or a hair on the pillow. We comfort him and talk to him about how bugs aren't bad and all that but I really just hope this will pass soon. If you experienced this with your child could you share please? How long did this go one? What worked for you?



Thank you

My son went through a spurt when he was about 2/3 where he would wake up and night crying and he would be afraid. I would comfort him and he would tell me he was afraid of the closet monsters or he'd point to a shadow on the wall.



I would turn the light on low to show him that it was just his clothes hanging etc and he'd go back to sleep.



At the same time he also had a little bit more of a hard time falling asleep too. My hubby said he was the exact same way when he was little.



All of a sudden, he just started sleeping through the night and grew completely out of it.



Good luck, I know how it can feel out of your control.

<question>



My 3-year-old is constantly seeking attention, except it's bad attention.  How can I make this better?



This is very long, sorry.



I answer questions all day and can't answer the one I have the most trouble with.  My 3-year-old seeks attention 24/7, but when I give it to him he lashes out after only a few minutes and starts doing things to get him in trouble.



He gets up in the morning and watches TV for a little while.  I make him breakfast.  He eats and plays for a little while.  He gets computer time (smart 3-year-old) and can play anything he wants throughout the day.  I have no real restrictions.



I will add that my husband works a swing shift job.  He's been on graveyard (12 am - 8 am) for about 3 weeks now due to an employee being let go of.  He's been making up her time and that's extended the days he's on a shfit.  Shifts run 2 weeks.



As soon as my husband gets up, even if we've had a great day, my little boy starts getting into things again.



Example of things he's done lately:



Turning off the computer last night while hubby was on it.  Turned it off today while we were on the floor doing a craft.  He said he wanted to watch TV and that's why he did it.  Usually it's "Yes" when I ask why he did something.
- He put butter in a frying pan with hot grease when I left the room for it to warm up to cook.
- He climbs on my counter either with or without a ladder to get something sweet when he's been told no more sweets.
- He stomps constantly through my hallway while hubby and baby are sleeping.



- He persistently runs from me when we're out places.  I can't trust him to walk alone with the baby by myself.  He has to get in the shopping cart.
- He pours out bottles of lotion all over himself even when I have it put away out of his reach he finds ways to get it. He pours out bottles of anything just to fill them with water knowing he's going to get in trouble.



The list goes on and on and on.  He was confined very much from birth because we were trying to remodel our old home.  I don't think this affected him, but I don't know.  He wasn't quite 2 years old when we moved to our house we're in now.  He has free reign of the house and outside.  He has plenty of play area.



He gets constant attention from my in-laws and parents Tues, Thursday, Sat. and Sun. when I work.



I give him as much attention as my time will allow, but again it isn't ever enough.  Whether he gets all my attention all the time or not he still gets into things he isn't supposed to.



From the time he was able to move around in a walker I was on him about pulling things off my tables and opening things he wasn't supposed to.  Getting on him didn't help any.  I would pop his hand and he's still be going against me.



My 14 mo-old baby is complete opposite.



She listens to me, she doesn't touch things when I tell her no.  She's sensitive and gets upset when I get on her.  She's had free reign of our house from birth, if that makes matters different?



I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do.  I've considered trying preschool, but he's attached to me like white on rice.  He only wanted me from birth and up until he was about 1.5 he didn't have anything to do with my hubby.  Now he still doesn't respond to him when hubby tries to tend to his needs in bed or when he's upset.  My MIL says he has "mommyitis".  It isn't funny after a while.



</question>



<additional details>



Thank you all for your answers.  I agree it's probably his dad's schedule and me giving the baby attention.  I actually went to put on a load of clothes when he put the butter in the hot grease on the stove (bad parent, I know).  Hubby has spent some time with him, but it's not on a weekly basis.  He works different shifts and it makes it impossible to take him somewhere every week.



I add, spankings do not work with him.  Time-out is becoming ineffective also.  My parents use a switch (hubby despises).  They swear it works, but I haven't tried it yet.  I don't want to be a bad parent always spanking and putting my child in time-out.



I will definitely try to get him more "daddy time" and maybe a day of "mommy time".



I think he may be jealous of his Sissy.



Thank you last poster, that was well put.  It does make sense that he doesn't have more structure.  It felt like structure anyway.



I haven't used the switch, just because I don't feel it's appropriate.  It was used on me and it got my attention quick like.  I remember those whelps too well.  I don't want to do that to my kids.



I will definitely try all that has been suggested.  Hopefully, if this question is asked by someone else I can be the one contributing with ways that were suggested to me.  :)

Your child needs more structure in his day and a routine. Letting him play and do whatever he wants all day long is why he acts out. He doesn't see any clear boundaries or order to his day to help him define what to do.  He needs to know what the rules are and that there are clear consequences that will be enforced immediately if he steps out of line. Try getting him in a playgroup with kids his age or try a couple days a week in a preschool program in your area.
Your husband also needs to get more involved in the routine with him and with doing things with him so he gets used to getting help and doing things with daddy.
I would NOT use a switch on any child. It could leave welts and scars. that is not discipline- its abuse. stop buying sweets and keeping them in the house then he won't have anything to "sneak" in that area.  Keep step stools and ladders where he is unable to get to them to use. If he climbs on things like counters or unsafe things, pick him up, put him down and tell him NO.  If he can't respect you then he loses a privilege that he would have gotten to do that day.  Spanking isn't working because if all your doing is popping him on the hand and calling it a spanking then it will be ineffective. You need to smack his little sit spot on his bottom firm a couple times so he can feel it and know you mean business.  You don't use it as an end all cure all, but when he is deliberately not listening and is climbing where it could be dangerous and getting into cupboards for things that could be dangerous (thankfully only lotion, but what's next? cleaners? bleach? medicine?) he needs to be spanked.
Find activities you can do with BOTH children. Play outside with a ball, color, do playdough, read with them, etc.. Above anything, try and catch him being good and then praise him for it.

I wanted to choose the last two, but this one really enlightened me to things I was doing wrong.  Thank you all for your responses.  BTW, my parents do not hit him with the switch to even tingle him.  It's only used to scare him and get his attention (absolutely no abuse).

That sounds really frustrating! All kids have different personalities which is why your daughter probably listens more. I don't think that how much reign a child has on the house has too much of an impact.



Is your son may be still going through a jealous phase, and lashing out because your husband's work schedule has changed, and also because of you having divert your attention to your daughter. Does he do these naughty things when she's around - like the grease in the pan, were you tending to her?



Maybe it would be beneficial for your hubby to set aside some special time for your son - go for a walk, park time, or something. My hubby takes my son swimming once a week, it's there special time. I can't intrude!



Also, do you give timeouts? These work for us. I don't and won't spank so I don't recommend it. I think in the case it'll probably only fuel anger.

Baby's bed on slanted floor?



Hello



I just installed a baby's bed for the new arrival and realised that the floor is slanted (old house) where the bed is which makes the bed slightly tilted. Is it going to be a problem for the baby or it does not matter?

Slanted enough to roll around, or just a bit from old wonky floors? If it is just the smallest bit, then once on a mattress won't even feel it.
If there is a big tilt then get some casters to put under the foot of the lowest corner. That will help level it and keep it from moving.

they actually sell stuff in argos or somewhere to tilt the cot a little so that the head is up as this helps with all their nasal problems and mucus and stuff....so i guess as long as its not too much tilted then its fine

I'm not sure if it matters as in if it's dangerous for the baby.  But, I'd imagine that you would want to put something underneath the two legs where the floor slants because you don't want her to get used to sleeping with the feeling of a slope, then when she changes beds to not be able to adjust because it's not slanted.  Also, before babies change beds, they are able to turn and to crawl.  When she gets to that age, the slant may make it harder for her to move around, like she would keep on flipping to one side (before she masters the flip), thus not be able to exercise both sides of her muscle in equal proportions.

Just be sure baby's head is at the higher end and it will be fine. It's common to prop the head end up a bit anyway as it can help babies who are snuffly with cold or have reflux.



Never do it the other way round, though, sleeping with your head lower than your feet can cause awful headaches.

I never bought a toddler bed for my son. They are to small and the kids end up hitting their heads on the over and over. I went straight to a twin bed. You can buy attachments for the sides. They are cheap and effective. The kids will be excited about the  bed, they get used to it right away.

i was about 2 or 3 when i moved to a "big girl bed"  so i think you still have some time unless she's growing at a rapid speed and needs to get out of that crib.
i got a twin bed and i was so excited because i wanted to be "grown up" lol.



just make sure you have one of those things you hook onto the side of the bed so she wont fall off in the night.  put one side of the bed against the wall too so you wont have to buy two.



just make it really girly.  whats her favorite color? (im guessing pink or yellow)



decorate it with some frilly pillows and blankets, get some stuffed animals, etc.  if you shop around it shouldn't cost much.



a few weeks before hand just start talking to her about a "big girl bed" and "moving out of the baby bed" and she'll get really excited.  i know i did!!!!



the transition shouldn't be hard. she might have a little trouble sleeping at first, she might not (I didn't)

once your child starts to try to get out of the crib to the point where it is a possible danger of her falling, its time to switch. We bought a bed that converted so it wasnt much of a change. Both of my boys were very excited about being "big boys" and didnt have any problems

We moved my oldest son into a toddler bed when he was 17 months. He was still in his crib when we had the toddler bed set up. We had it there so he would see it, get used to it and be interested in it.



We would pretend sleep in the bed and one night he just said he wanted to sleep in it. I won't lie it was a rough night, he got out of bed a few times and was upset because he wasnt' sure what was going on. After the first night he was fine. He is still in that toddler bed .. now he is 4. We will be moving him into his Big Boy bed soon!



Hope this helps! Just let your daughter see the bed, get used to it and feel comfortable around it.

Potty training can be a tiring time.  I remember when I was potty training my girls and had to go shopping.  Every time we went to a new store they had to potty when we got there and before we left.



If we where going on long trips I took a potty with us in the car.

My daughter hates eating breakfast. Is this a problem?



My 18 month old won't eat her breakfast, but willingly eats her lunch. It doesn't matter what we give her, and how close to or how late after she wakes up that we give it to her.



We have tried cereals, waffles, oatmeal, pancakes..pretty much everything, and she just refuses to eat breakfast. All she does is takes whatever is on her tray and throws it on the floor, and trying to force feed is impossible. Lunch time isn't until 2pm when she wakes, because she refuses to eat before a nap.



Is this a problem?



</question>



<additional details>



We have tried giving her milk and she hates milk too. We're lucky to get 3oz of it into her. Most of the time she'll take enough to quench her thirst, and then she'll dump it everywhere.



No, she does not wake for feedings. She has been sleeping through the night since she was 4 months old.

I'm the same way hate breakfast! Its because my stomach get upset I the morning if I eat! Maybe try a good nutrition child's shake they sell!

Does she still wake up for feedings at night time (breast or other)? Most toddlers will go for 12-13 hours without eating (usually while they sleep at night).



As long as she is eating lunch, and dinner, and snacks in between, and isn't losing weight, then she's fine.



Also, maybe try lunch for breakfast (if she usually has a sandwich or pasta for lunch, give it to her for breakfast).



Or, when my daughter won't eat in the morning, I reluctantly turn to the ever successful banana. She'll never say no to a banana unless she isn't feeling well.



Good luck!

Your daughter really needs to eat something in the morning.  What about just hot chocolate (warm milk with some Nestle cocoa)?  She needs to refuel her body and rehydrate it with breakfast.  You might be feeding her too much at dinner (and lunch)???



At your next pediatrician appointment, I would mention this because breakfast is an important habit to establish, especially as she starts school.

She eats nothing till 2pm, yeah that does sound like a problem.  Is she getting milk in the morning because milk fills your stomach and stays for a while giving you that full feeling.  She is still young and eats for living instead of pleasure so if she is getting milk switch to water, no juice or anything where she will get calories, let her body recognize that she is needing food for her fuel.  Don't worry about feeding her breakfast food, just feed her anything she wants or likes or will actually except to break her fast thats the important thing, when she gets on that routine you can introduce her to traditional breakfast food.  My son used to only eat eggs if it had mayonase in it I know weird huh.  He was such a picky eater.  For about a month he would only eat corn dogs.  He went a whole day with out eating because I refused to give in to the corn dog ( we didn't have any) that night at 10 pm I sent his dad to go get one, he did he ate and I realized that was the important thing.  He grew out of his corn dog faze but still likes eggs with mayo on it.  I have learned that my son is a creature of habbit, I think it is an OCD thing.  When he gets stuck on something it stays for a while and that is in everything.  If he gets hooked on me singing a song for him to go to sleep then thats all that works for a while.

Who is responsible for an accidental mess by a two year old?



While visiting a friend my daughter got diarrhea. She came up to me while my friend was showing me her daughter's finished nursery and asked me where the bathroom was. I looked down at her and was about to tell her when I noticed it all down her legs. She has been potty trained for over a year and wouldn't just do something like that. I took her to the bathroom and started cleaning her up while my friend got her kids and locked them in the living room and started cleaning up the mess. She was crying hysterically, saying uncalled things, and had her husband get on the phone and try to get ahold of someone right away to come out and clean her carpets. My daughter only left two spots from what I saw. One in the bedroom where it happened and one where she stopped to ask me where the bathroom was.  I ended up crying because I felt so bad and helpless. My daughter was gagging and was also very upset. When I was done cleaning my daughter I asked her if there was anything I could do and she threw up her hands and shook her head. I said I was very sorry and for her to call me later. I didn't know what to do. I didn't want someone acting like that around my child nor did I want her to get her kids sick if she were sick. When I got my daughter into my truck she told me she was sorry and it was all her fault. I don't think a 2 yr. old should feel that way, it was only an accident. Well days pass and I hear nothing from her. I texted her and told her I was very sorry and I hope she didnt hate me or my child. I got no response. Days go by and I get an email from her with the carpet cleaning bill. $150 telling me I needed to pay for the damages my child created in their home. The bill says that the bedrooms, hall, and living room were cleaned and removale of feces as well as a late night service fee. Her email said I was taking food out of her kids mouths and I was not being a friend if I didn't pay this. I have my own carpet cleaner and would've been more then happy to bring it over and get the mess up but when I was done cleaning my daughter they made it aparent they were going to do what they were going to do and I could've been of no help. I never agreed to this nor do I think I should have to pay for someone to have their carpets cleaned because I wasn't even there to see what was cleaned. It wasn't discussed. But because I don't feel I should pay anything nor do I have the funds just to hand someone for this they are threatning me to take me to court. What should I do and what can I do??

Do you have a rockin' toddler?



My son was on the toilet a few mintues ago and started singing Miss Murder by AFI..... He's 29 months old. It was just too cute! This adds to the list of rock songs he already knows.... 'This is Halloween' from Nightmare Before Christmas, 'Hey Oh' by RHCP, 'Love Like Winter' by AFI, a ton of HIM songs (that's my fave band), He knows parts of some Perfect Circle songs and he loves Nightwish. It's just too cool. I have a mini rocker-in-training! He knows kids songs as well..
So my question is what songs do your kid(s) know that are not your 'ordinary' kids songs?
Just for fun! :D

That is so cool and cute! Our little man (21 months) has a collection of Johnny Cash/rockabilly style western shirts, surfer "baby vans" shoes,  a "gentlemen's faux hawk ( that gets endless compliments)". . . .  but as far as singing goes. . he is into the beach boys.  LOL



Neither my wife nor I were big fans (we are now by "default"). . but he can't get enough of them.



It must be the harmonies and simple vowel sounds.  Oh, he also loves the Ramones and Devo  . .can't get much catchier and simple rock than that. Johnny Cash and bluegrass too (he does the hillbilly stomp). very cute.



If he becomes a rocker I suspect it will be a drummer. . . because he really likes to bang around on EVERYTHING with sticks. .



he drums the keys of  his toy piano with sticks. LOL

If he can pull up to standing and generally has good head control he should be okay. Maybe it would be best if you contacted a local car seat clinic. The Heath Department, Police or St. John's Ambulance in your area likely run them.



I also think it's best to keep him rear facing as long as possible. But if he is a big boy there may not be much you can do. The Radian and the Britax Marathon are two car seats I know of that have high weight and height limits.

It's not about muscle control, it's about anatomy.  Most folks who install car seats or check car seats recommend to wait as long as possible before turning the car seat around, usually 30 lbs is the limit for facing backwards.  If you don't feel ready, then don't do it - it is safer for him to be facing backwards in the event of a car crash.

Walking has nothing to do with how a child reacts in a crash. Rear facing as long as possible is best. A child can't protect their necks during the impact. The force can cause internal decapitation. I congratulate you on keeping him RF this long. Keep it up. And broken legs are better than a broken neck.

you usually don't go by age but by height and weight. when the child out grows the rear facing car seat is when you change. my daughter was in a front facing car seat at that age and she didn't start walking until she was 14 months.
