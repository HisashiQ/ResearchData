A knot is a measure of speed equal to one nautical mile per hour.

A nautical mile is a measure of distance equal in practical terms to 1,000 fathoms, or 6,000 feet.  That's close enough to 1.15 statute miles.

All aircraft instruments have been calibrated in nautical miles and knots since 1968.

Is it possible to gain my Commercial Pilots License (UK)/ATPL(UK) while remaining in my full time job?



I am currently in the RAF as groundcrew, but it's my dream to become qualified to pilot a turbofan in a commercial capacity one day. I've got my PPL but don't see how much farther I can take my training without leaving the Air Force (I'm 30, so military flying is not an option). Any serious advice?

You could take a modular course, but it's hard work if you have a job besides it. It can be done however, I have multiple colleagues that have done it.
It will take you longer than when you take an integrated course, think of at least four years (and you still need to come up with a lot of money!).
Good luck

Sure modular training is available!, it will take longer though (cabair do modular training too), since your in the Royal Air Force as a ground crew it may or may not increase your chances of getting hired I guess.
Since you've got your PPL, you can take out a pilots loan of Â£50,000 for the whole lot of training!

If you need more advice please do not hesitate to e-mail me.

And all the best in trying to gain your ATPL! :)

The one in the engine test bay is an early model Harrier, either GR1 or GR3.  I saw 2 sets of aircraft outside the bunkers.  One group contained a Hunter, a Phantom and something with straight wings and probably a propeller engine.  East of this is an early model Harrier shell with no horizontal tail attached.

That's all I could see, hope it is useful.

The aircraft stood on its own looks like an incomplete Harrier and the aircraft in the engine test area is a Harrier

They use Jet-A which is a fancy way of saying kerosene. They can use just about anything that will burn as long as it doesn't have a flash point below that of kerosene. Gasoline would not work well in a jet engine as it would explode. Think of a jet engine as a glorified oil furnace with a really neat chimney.

'Jet A', is like Kerosene (with different additives, specifications and tighter controls). Jet A weighs about 6.7 lbs/gal verses 6.0 lbs/gal for gasoline. Because it is heavier it more energy per gal but needs higher pressure and temps to burn. 'Jet A' is specially made just for Jets and has particular specifications for flying in jet engines at high altitudes and cold temps. You especially want the fuel to not have water suspended in it, as it could freeze in the fuel, so tight controls in manufacture and distribution are needed. The military has their own blend of  Jet fuel for even more demanding use.



It all comes from a OIL base. Additives and refining makes for the different grades of fuels and products. During refining you get heavy fuel oils like to heat homes are at one other end. Than there is diesel, kerosene (Jet fuel), Petrol (gasoline) and than NG (natural gas) which is not normally a liquid. When NG is cooled and pressurized enough it becomes LNG (liquid natural gas). At the very bottom of the process you get asphalt, tar, paraffin wax. Also lubricating oils are produced by crude oil stock and additives from the refining process.

If you want a real leg up on the competition, check out the Air Force's air traffic controller training.  It's an excellent jump start to your career field and the training time counts toward your retirement.  If you decided to do twenty years in the service, you can retire with half of your pay and still be young enough to join the civilian job market for a second retirement income.  Assuming you're young that is.

I too want to become an air traffic controller, I plan to take the air traffic management course at embry, that is probably your best bet as a college course to be an air traffic controller other than military.

Fact is there is basically no college course that will help you become an air traffic controller.  Oh sure, courses might help you pass the entrance exam, pass the training at Oklahoma, but no courses will help you pass the on-the-job training once you get to your facility.  A college graduate will have the same chance as a high school drop out...literally.

Now, if you can pass the military training that would give you better chance of becoming a civilian controller.



EDIT:  thought I should add they all have at least a GED.

No. You will be perfectly fine honestly. I mean if all the pilots who had hayfever couldn't fly then, the airline industry would be in great difficulty. If it does get any worse, just simply get some tablets for it. Besides it usualy clears up after a few years, so there isn't too much to worry about. You will be perfectly fine when it comes to being a pilot! Good luck and I am sure you will get there!!

When I was in the airlines, I averaged being home about 14 days a month, even when I was senior at the "good" airlines.  When I was junior, about 12.  This was because I commuted to work (i.e. I had to fly on a commercial flight to get to my base).  I was usually not home for more than 3 days at a time.  I typically worked 4-5 day trips, as I was a commuter.



Tack on an extra day on at least one end for commuting time, as my trips frequently started at 5am.  I also was never home on weekends and holidays.  If I was lucky, I'd get Thanksgiving off, but Christmas?  Forget about it.  Again, If I was lucky, I'd have 1 or 2 saturdays off a month.  Luckily, my wife has a job where she works on weekends.

There was a time, when I was a senior FO, that I was home every night and only worked tuesday - thursday.  That lifestyle lasted about 3 months.  Eventually that base was closed, and all those having that great life had to start commuting.

It can lead to a huge strain on family life, depending on your spouse.  I don't have kids, but my friends spouse's felt like they were single parents.  Your spouse has to be very independent.  Trust me, everything in your house is going to break when you are gone.

If family life is important to you, I strongly recommend that you have a backup career.  Still go for it, if you love to fly, but have something else to fall back on.  For me, home and famiily life grew to be much more important than me flying a jet.  That's why I left the career.

<answer>



honestly
it all depends on the airline you fly for
because if you fly for a company like southwest
you can have a flight or two a day and still be home for dinner
but on the other hand
if you fly for a company like emirates, you can be gone for as much as a week. maybe more
you might also try to go for fedex or another cargo company
because i know a guy that flies a Cessna Caravan for Fedex and he only works about 5 hours a day
So he is able to spend more time with his kids than a normal parent would.
Good luck with the studies.
May you earn your wings.

Rob G. has pretty much given an accurate picture of what you can expect. I will add that I have known more divorced pilots paying high alimony than just about any other group of professionals.

This is a subjective question. It really has more to do with you and your family more than anything. If you and your family can handle long periods apart and irregular scheduling, you will be fine. This holds true for any job that requires travel. Some people relish the time away, claiming that time together is better appreciated. Others feel that it is in fact too much to bear. There are so many factors that could influence the amount of time you will be away that it is impossible to determine a baseline. Some pilots and airlines fly very diffirent schedules. It is a well known fact that the industry can be difficult on families. I would encourage you to really look hard into your career options as a pilot. The airlines are not the only route and there are many other jobs for pilots that can be just as lucrative and less demanding on your family. Research, set goals and involve your family as much as possible in decisions and you will be just fine. Good luck!

If this is your dream then no I do not think it is too early.  I started at 17 and completed my license by 18, my little brother started at 16 and finished by 17 and now works in the airline industry.  You will have a few delays in your career due to age, (can not solo until 16, can not get your license until 17), but one of the big big advantages is you will be building hours and experience and that is very valuable later in your career.



Any flying job will ask you about experience.  If you can tell them you have for example a couple of thousand hours experience it helps promote you.  Also a good education and experience in a vary of aircraft and ratings will promote your future career.

So start your lessons, build your hours, build your experience, get new rating (commerical, instrument, multi-engine), get a good education and you will be on your way to a good aviation career.

It's not a good age, nor is it a bad age.  If you have the money go for it, if not it won't hurt your career at all.  I usually recommend concentrating on school and college first.  You can go from 0 hours to flight instructor in less than a year if you can do it full time.  I waited until after I had a few years in another career before I did my flight training.  I'd say about half the airline pilots I flew with started flying in college and the other half started later in life due to career changes.

The new livery has a few variations. White, and ice blue. and they look good on every aircraft in the AC fleet! The old livery with the darker tail looked good too.
The tail looks amazing and intricate. 
White looks great during the summer, in conjunction with the tail and the blue sky.
in winter the ice blue looks awesome on the aircraft parked at the gate. especially in blizzards or against the white snow.

To hold an airline transport pilot rating (ATP) allowing you to fly as pilot in command (captain) of an aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats, you have to be 23 years old, but to hold a commercial pilot rating allowing you to carry less than 10 passengers  you have to be at least 18. You only need to hold a commercial rating to fly as copilot on an aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats.

Australia is a big place.  London-Perth is easy, 8600 nm. Less than 12 hours.  London-Melbourne 10,500 nm more like 16 hours.  Either trip is non stop.  Well within range of a 777.

Certainly a 777 or 747 could make London/Perth without stops maybe not in 12 hours though:
8600NM/12 hrs = 717kts Groundspeed average.  That's 1.1Mach at FL360-390.  One would have to slow down for AR's, so you've got to push the throttles up to make up that time.  But with a good tailwind, yes it's possible.  The F22 could theoretically do it, POSSIBLY the Typhoon as well.
(BTW the SR71's been retired for almost 15years now-don't think they're going to make the trip anytime soon.)

my sister is a flight attendant and she has been working for the airline over 10 years, since she has seniority now is good for her cause she has prefference organizing her schedule. for the newbies is a little harder the fist couple years, but after that you have more flexibility, i mean you can work 1 one and stay at home 2 weeks and so, it all depends on your seniority, is a gerat job with great benefits, but it takes a little bit of sacrifice at the beggining

I worked as a flight attendant for a while.  It was really a good job but it wasn't what I wanted to do for life.  It is strange to have a man as a flight attendant but it seemed I got more respect than the women.  I had a wife and three kids.  Luckily, she was a stay at home mom during the time so it made it easier.  Still I got off for most holidays and when I really needed a day off it was given to me.  There were enough other people that I could get work off.  If you love flying then this is a great job.  You get to see the world but can be back at five.  You see some of the best pilots.  I worked usually a usual 8 to 5 sometimes sooner and sometimes later.  There were often choices given if I wanted to go on a long trip or not.  The flight company that I worked for gave me free tickets sometimes and my kids or wife could often fly on the plane during my free time I could sit by them if there were no passengers there.  I loved this job.  It was very neat to come home to Rapid City and say I had been to Milwaukee, Minneapolis and back.  It wasn't really that stressful.  There are no last minute oh no my kid is sick I have to go.  That is the only bad thing.  Good luck you will see besides bad annoyed, sick passengers it is very worthwhile and even pays good.  Hope all goes well and you make this into a career.

To what aircraft does the speed rule apply to?



I know its one of aviation's laws. No going above 250 knots below 10,000ft MSL. But do military aircraft have to follow this law? I know at airshows they go about 500 knots. So what aircraft don't have to follow the 250 knots rule?

special waivers are available that allow pilots to fly at speeds exceeding 250 kts. below 10,000'. This happens for air shows, air races, test flights, and atc can assign an airspeed greater than 250 for traffic separation.



Military does have to follow the rule unless they are approved to go faster. But the same approval can be given to civilian flights.

There is a great deal of airspace restricted  for military use only.  The restricted areas are shown on civilian air navigation maps.  The military can more of less do what they want within these areas.  There are even some low altitude supersonic corridors in remote locations.  You might remember the government opening these areas to civilian use to ease air traffic congestion at times.  The military must follow civilian traffic rules outside these areas unless they get special permission.

I've currently commenced with a couple of hours of my PPL, but I am serious about getting up there and flying as a career. I am a 21 year old male who will graduate in 2010 with a BSc in Physical and Environmental Geography. I have 4 A levels and 11 GCSE's. What should be my next steps from now (and when I graduate)? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

<question>



Decision to join the RAF to become a pilot?



Following my last question about which route I should take to become a pilot...  If I was to join the RAF then:



A) What are the chances of becoming a pilot?  Is it a rare chance to pass through the selection process?

B) On the chance of being accepted, do you have the choice between Fixed wing, cargo and rotary or are you automatically selected?

C) You proceed through the selection process of the RAF for a pilot and are rejected, do you have to carry on with service to the RAF?  Or can you leave if you do not succeed in the selection process?

Any help on this would be much appreciated.  A lot of people have told me that the RAF is the better route than going commercial?

Kind regards,
JMM

A - the selection process is tough, remember you will be expected to be a leader of men and ambassador to this country above being a pilot. Pilot is only your role within the RAF

B - your training route will reflect your ability - only the cream become Fighter pilots

C - you will be offered another non-flying trade, but you will be free to resign your commission should you wish to do so. The RAF don't like this, so to minimise the chances of it happening they only choose the best at the recruitment stage.

That's only the bad news - go for it if you want it enough!

I am a pilot of fixed wing aircraft and love to fly in general but the hot air balloon ride is unique.
It is so quiet, (except when the burner is on) and the view is incredible.
If you get the chance i say " go for it"

Most airlines can change the names on a booking for a small fee.  You could try to sell the ticket(s) to a friend or on gumtree or ebay and get the name on the ticket changed.  Might get you some of your money back.

I did have to cancel a flight before and I was just going to not turn up, but I called instead and I got my tax back.  That might be a worth a shot as well.

Some tickets you can not get money back on when you book 
they tell you this, So you have one that you cannot get a refund on
but i would let them know you are not travelling,  as its not there fault you are not flying. 
and like every one else says there may be some one needs that seat urgently. i helped some people last week who had to cancel there holiday even though they had just arrived at destination, as the mans mother had died over night, and he needed to get home urgently. so i helped with train reservations and rang the airlines to get a plane 
he had to wait until the next day to fly home as could not get train and plane times connecting i felt so sorry for him there holiday spoilt and losing money as well on holiday and paying for flight home and extra accomodation over night

It's been mentioned already but courtesy is always best. I'd phone the airline and tell them not to expect me.

Standby passengers can always use empty seats and even if that is not possible, one less person and their luggage will save on fuel a bit and reduce some of the environmental effect of the aeroplane.

6000 is kinda high. You can get on with comair with 1500. It will cost you roughly 20-50K to get all your ratings and hours. I will suggest going to a college that offers an Airway Science degree with a professional pilot option. You can also go to American Flyers.

Why don't you go down to your local FBO and ask for an introductory flight and talk things over with the flight instructor. Most people that get into flying really have no idea what's really involved, and give up quickly. It's a lot of study and book work. Learning to fly the plane and building hours is the fun part.

I know of some people that have been hired on with a regional airline in just over a year from their first flight. The cost will be different depending on the route you take to accomplish your individual goals. There are many schools and many different âhoopsâ to jump through to get an ATP certification. I agree that the best way is to find a college that offers a degree program. This will help in many ways, least of which is the networking that many colleges offer to help their students find jobs. If you go the college route you can expect to pay 40-80K depending on the program, time, and type of degree offered. I also agree that you should take an exploration flight first. There is a lot to being a pilot, and its not all about pointing the plane in a direction and buzzing around. On a side note: For those who have Flight Sim 10 (FSX), it can be a great tool in the learning process. I am more than willing to aid in training and help where I can. I can always use the practice, just send me an Email to schedule it if youâre interested. Good luck.

It's a NOTAR (no tail rotor) helicopter which uses a moveable air nozzle to direct a stream of air out of the back of the aircraft. It is very useful having no tail rotor as it reduces the risk of ground strike and/or injury when manoeuvring in places that are not regular airfields - such as roads, playing fields and other places that police or air ambulance helicopters are likely to land.

Doesn't need one.  New improved (and quieter) technology was used.



Design and development
The MD Explorer light twin helicopter is the first all new design to incorporate the unique NOTAR system.[1] McDonnell Douglas Helicopters launched the Explorer as the MDX in January 1989. First flight took place on December 18, 1992. Full certification for the initial PW206B powered Explorer (unofficially designated MD 900) version was granted in December 1994.



MD 900 (N900MH) Helicopter Noise Abatement TestOne of the most advanced helicopters in its market segment, the MD Explorer features Boeing's unique NOTAR anti-torque system, with benefits including increased safety, far lower noise levels and performance and controllability enhancements.[1] Instead of an anti-torque tail rotor, a fan exhaust is directed out slots in the tail boom, using the CoandÄ effect for yaw control. Boeing retains the design rights to the NOTAR technology despite selling the former McDonnell Douglas civil helicopter line to MD Helicopters in early 1999.

Just for the purpose of information only here is a little know fact.
The first successful flight of a NOTAR helo was in 1946 when Stan Hiller flew his J-5. It was followed by the J-10 which never went in production because the Hiller co. was gearing up for production of the Hiller model 360.

Two very simple reasons.

1&gt; The NOTAR system on helicopters like the MD900 is much safer than the conventional tail rotor.
2&gt; The NOTAR system produces a lot less noise, making these helicopters a lot quieter.

Could be searching for someone...not necessarily a criminal. If a small child, that might be mentally disabled, got out of the house, the police might use a helicopter to search the neighborhood if notified in time. In many cases it could be faster than a "foot search." The same is true with an adult with diminished mental capacities or Alzheimer's.

First get a private pilot's licence which will cost about 8 grand.
Then do enough hours to do your Commercial pilots licence (about 5 grand). Once you have done that you need to do your instrument rating (about 12 grand) and a multi engine rating. You then need to study for your atpl (airline transopr pilot's licence). Good luck!

The Taylor Aerocar was a successful roadable aircraft which obtained civil certification about 50 years ago. Only six were ever built, and one of them, to the best of my knowledge, is still flying.



The Terrafugia Transition may be one to watch, however there appears to be a fair amount of 'preliminary' information and assumptions being made.



LaBiche FSC-1 is a high-performance sports car design which features a fully automated conversion into an aircraft -- in theory. The extent to which GPS-based navigation and other digital aids are meant to eliminate the need for a pilot licence makes me dubious, even if the actual vehicle may turn out to be airworthy.

The Urban Aeronautics X-Hawk is a ducted fan design that is claimed to have been flown successfully in the ground effect region, and utilises a quite ingenious approach to stability and manoeuvring. That's if it does, in fact, work.

One project which, to me, seems quite promising is the PAL-V, which is more a flying motorcycle/trike than a car per se. To the detractors that suggest the average driver's inability to be a pilot is an obstacle (which it obviously is), I answer that a PPL is needed to operate this vehicle in flight. I don't know to what extent any actual prototype has been developed, but at least at a conceptual level, the simplicity, short takeoff roll and relatively low power necessitated by an autogyro make this seem like a feasible proposition.

There are several other designs being pursued, however since they are  more or less in the AutoCAD stage of development, I'm hesitant to namecheck them. To an extent, I agree with both the pros and the cons of the Moller project (in answers above). The central issue, I think, is that this is an extremely ambitious project. If it had funding and other resources comparable to the V-22 Osprey, which had a long, expensive and troubled development, I expect the vehicle would be in production by now.

The New M400 Design



The production configuration of the M400 Skycar has gone through a few permutations as many hours of wind tunnel testing showed ways to improve the aircraft's performance.



One of the long-term goals has been to find a way to operate the Skycar in hover in the same configuration as when operating on the ground.



This would allow it to land and hover in a much smaller area, for example on the median strip of a highway as might be done during a roadside emergency medical mission.



The present M400X came close to achieving this but because the wing/tail is so far back the lift/drag ratio is only 7.5 and the dead-stick gliding speed is high, making an un-powered landing very difficult.



We have now found a way to move the wing forward and add sweep so that together with tail extensions on the wing, we achieve a lift/drag ratio of 12.5.



In addition to being able to hover with the wings folded, the under carriage wheels are farther apart for increased ground stability.



This new configuration has less airflow interference between front and rear nacelles, better visibility from the cockpit for improved ground and air operations, and dead-stick gliding speed that is substantially lower.



Presently all test flights of the M400 Skycar employ a safety tether from above to protect the vehicle from catastrophic failure. Certainly during these early tests there are a number of failure modes with an aircraft that has 24 microprocessors and 25,000 lines of machine language software code. Additional factors that make a tether mandatory include:

â¢ We are test flying within the Davis City Limits
â¢ We presently have only one M400 aircraft
â¢ Our insurance will go up substantially when the tether is not used while flying over land

We plan to begin untethered flights when we have at least one additional M400 nearing completion. All flights will occur over a specially constructed lake. This lake is part of the Milk Farm development, a commercial 60-acre development underway near the city of Dixon in California on Interstate 80. The lake will have an area of 5 to 6 acres and will be approximately 10 feet deep with a silt, rock free bottom. Most flights will occur at less than 50 feet altitude and will incorporate flotation gear attached to the Skycar.

Sophie - that's why I said "Still in Work"...  How many planes of differing designs crashed before the Wright Bros. got it together?  Me, I'm pulling for the Moller design!

The Moller Skycar does not actually work very well.

There will not be any "flying cars," in the classic sense of a flying vehicle that is as simple to operate as an automobile and that can be parked in--and flown from--the typical driveway to provide aerial transportation for you and your family.

There are two main problems:

1.  The characteristics of what makes a good car and what makes a good airplane are very different, and in some cases exactly opposite.  A good car is too heavy to fly, and a good airplane is too flyable to run safely on the ground.  A flying vehicle has to be able to fold and unfold so that it can operate within highway rules, and that kind of technology is very costly and failure-prone.

2.  Most people have trouble figuring out how to tie their shoes, much less operate a vehicle that would move in 3-dimensional air space and follow the rules for air navigation.  Most unlikely to be practical.

There are other problems, but those two will kill the deal.  Sorry--no flying car in your future.

are you forgetting the taylor aerocar? it was built in the 50's, though only 7 were ever made. the wings and the back half of the fuselage folded into a trailer that was towed around by the car until you got to the airport. it used a pusher prop and was a nifty little car/aeroplane. there is still an example flying/driving around.

They're in museums or been destroyed. The few that actually flew and drove are still around, but mostly in museums. New ones? It'll still be awhile before they're "practical" in common use, though. I'm sure some rich person's version will be for sale, but for practical use, until there are provisions for roadside airstrips, it won't work. I'd almost bet the first practical air-car will have to be a VTOL type craft.

The aerodynamic principal is that lift overcomes drag. An airplane wing is a specific shape known as an airfoil, and air flows over the top of the airfoil slower than it flows beneath it. This pressure differential is what creates lift, which is how airplanes fly - in a nutshell.

I also thought about how this would work too.. its weird isn't it?

I think it has to do with the air pressure around the airplane. Air usually/always goes from high to low pressure, and the air pressure below the plane tries to go upwards so its pretty much "lifting" the plane up

The wing is rounded on top and flat on bottom. I saw a wrong answer about 2 up. The air flows over the wing faster than on the bottom which creates a vacuum on top. This is called Bernelle's principle. He stated the law of physics that the faster a "liquid" moves, the lower the pressure. An easy way to see this is if you are smoking in your car and crack the window, the smoke will be sucked out the window. The air in the car is at a relative speed of 0, while the air outside is moving past the windows at a faster speed. the pressure in the car is higher than outside creating a "sucking" action.

The above answers refer to the Bernoulli effect -- and all of them are wrong.  The Bernoulli effect says that a faster airflow exerts less side pressure than a slower one does, and this is a correct statement.  And it is true that on modern aircraft, the path on top of the wing is longer than the one on the bottom.  But the bulk of the lift obtains simply from the non-zero angle of attack: the airfoil is sloped into the relative wind, and forces the air downward, and the resulting reaction force pushes the wing upward.  To see that the Bernoulli attribution is wrong, consider:
- The Wright Flyer used a single-surface wing, so the path lengths above and below were the same.
- Helicopters use symmetrical airfoils, so Bernoulli cannot be involved in their lift.
- And, airplanes can fly upside down.  Think about that one.

The same way birds, bats, and bees work.  Like these, airplanes are a lot lighter than they appear to be, and they have wings.  When wings move forward through the air, they twist the air above them downwards as they pass. Twisting the air downwards isn't easy, so the wings exert a lot of force on the air to accomplish itâand the air resists this and exerts an upwards force on the wings, which lifts them and the airplane to which they are attached.

It may seem counterintuitive but it works extremely well. Airplanes are designed to fly and they do it well â¦ just like birds, bats, and bees.

In misty conditions, you can sometimes see the downwash from the wings (air moving downwards behind them, like a fast waterfall).  The amount of air moved by a large aircraft and its wings is tremendous, comparable to the weight of the aircraft itself. But since it's usually invisible, it's hard to appreciate it.

That's the problem. Not many know about the competion. The best way to get cost down on F-22 is to sell some to selected allies like Japan and Israel. That lowers the unit cost. We afford more. But people underate Russian weapons..China only needs J-12 if expect to fight us...

F-22 is super great.  Best thing since F-14 Tomcat.  Most F-22 pilots are Eagle drivers with mucho hours in the F-15.

The USAF had to prove to Congress that the F-22 was worth its price.

So they took 10 Raptor pilots--all formeer Eagle pilots--and placed 5 pilots in the F-22 and 5 pilots back in the F-15.

The F-15s were give the advantage of speed and height at the start of the competition.  At "Fight's On" the only thing the forner Raptor (now Eagle pilots) heard was laughter in their head phones.  The Raptors beat all 5 Eagles in less than 20 seconds.

Damn fine warbird, but OMG the price !!.  Reportedly $50 mil each.

I wouldn't exactly call them direct competition.  The Sukhoi with a less stealthy design than the F-22 won't be operational for over a decade.  The 'J-12' is barely existent as a plan, let alone an actual aircraft.  Give it a generous 15 years to operational capability.  So you're looking at 15-20 years for improvements to raptors, vs aircraft coming online that aren't any better, and likely worse than current raptors?  That's not even a good game of catch-up.



I doubt most people know about them.  That's reasonable--if you don't have much time to following the subject, then aircraft that actually exist might be a better use of the time than aircraft that for all we know right now could just be more on the list of projects never completed (and there are certainly enough of those in the aviation industry)

Nosing over your plane after a climb out is an example of "negative G"; it's more common name BTW.
Negative-G is much more unpleasant to endure, and has some nasty physiological consequences:  headache, burst blood vessels in the eyes.  One doesn't "black out" from negative-G one "Red Outs".  So much blood is forced into the head one's vision literally turns red(dish).
You might have seen movies/documentaries where a formation of aircraft roll over, and dive on a target.  The actual reason they do this is to convert a potential negative-G situation into positive-G: better for the crew, much better for the airframe

The term "negative G's" is actually somewhat incorrect. G forces are always positive because it is a measurement of acceleration, specifically how much force is being exerted on an object that is changing speed or direction, compared to the force of gravity exerted by the mass of the earth.

In straight and level, unaccelerated flight, an aircraft and its occupants experience 1G, which means the only force they experience is that of the earth's gravitational pull attempting to drag them towards the center of the earth. When you start maneuvering the aircraft, you can increase or decrease the amount of G's felt by the aircraft and its occupants. "Negative G's" simply refers to the fact that the direction the aircraft and occupants want to travel is opposite to the normal direction (ie. the passengers feel as though they are being lifted off of their seats towards the ceiling of the aircraft). The force is still positive, but it is PERCEIVED as being negative. Kind of like standing on your head. The force of gravity has not changed, but your body thinks it is experiencing negative 1G.

The human body (and most aircraft designs) can withstand a greater "positive" G load than "negative" G load. The average human can withstand about 5 positive G's for a brief period of time before they begin to black out. With training and special equipment (G-suits) this can go as high as 9 positive G's. However, humans can only withstand about 2-3 "negative" G's briefly before they begin to experience "red out," which is a reddening of the vision caused by the capillaries in the eyes bursting due to the increased blood pressure in the head.

Aircraft are typically designed to withstand greater G-forces than the humans flying them. The theory, I suppose, is that if the pilot does something stupid and blacks out, the aircraft will straighten out (due to inherent stability built into the design) and continue flying long enough for the pilot to regain consciousness.

Minus G is putting the aircraft into a dive and exceeding the acceleration of gravity. The negative g force will push you toward the tail of the aircraft. The faster you accelerate, the higher the g force.

You need to be careful in  doing this, as pullout can result in the aircraft's self-destruction due to stresses beyond its envelope.

Smoothskies is absolutely right. No idea why he has been given thumbs down.

G is always "positive", it is just the direction of pull which dictates which symbol we attribute to it i.e. -G or +G. Contrary to popular belief, feeling weightless (brief nose down in aircraft, hump back bridge etc.) is not the same as negative G. Those weightless feelings are just somewhere equal to or greater than 0G but less than +1G or -1G.

It's called "flight without visual reference to the ground."  There are two types of instruments involved in instrument flight.

Flight instruments are directly in front of the pilot, and provide basic information needed to direct the airplane in the intended direction, maintain control of speed and altitude, and maintain the proper upright position in the air.  For lots more information, including pictures and diagrams, try an internet search on "aircraft flight instruments."

Navigation instruments include on-board devices that work in connection with ground based and satellite based radio navigation facilities.  These include the VOR navigation system, other radio beacon systems, and Global Positioning System (GPS).  The purpose of these navigation radios is to provide the pilot information on the position and movement of the airplane without being able to see outside.

For much more information, search the internet using "GPS" and "air navigation."

Did you ever have a gyroscope as a kid? The thing with a heavy wheel inside a cage. You pull a string to get the wheel spinning and then the entire thing could stand on one little pin?



To oversimplify, that is what pilots use. There are several gyroscopes (we just call them gyros) that give different information. They work so well because they have what is called rigidity in space, meaning they resist movement. So if an airplane moves around the gyro won't, the gyros present different information to the pilot, like pitch and roll attitude, and the heading much like a compass does.



Altitude is maintained based on the outside air pressure, as altitude increases the air becomes less dense, the air pressure can be measured and displayed to the pilot.

Navigation happens mostly from gps now, just like what you might have in a car, only specific to airplanes and their navigational needs.  There are other ground based electronic navigation radios out there, they work by sending out a signal, which airplane radios can read and then display the information to the pilot.

All the instruments in the cockpit work without any visual reference to the outside world, so they work the same in the clouds as they do on a clear day.



Its much more complicated that what I just explained, but I tried to make it as simple and easy to understand as I can for you.

<answer>



Since you know rpm and tip speed you can compute the propeller diameter and disc area.



Thrust is equal to the mass of air flowing through the propeller disc  multiplied by the change in speed of the air entering and leaving the propeller.  that's momentum theory.  Efficiency is based on the mass of air multiplied by the change in velocity squared. (kinetic energy.  to calculate the change in velocity need to know propeller disc area.



Efficiency changes with the speed of the airplane and altitude assuming you're interested in thrust in flight rather than just static thrust.  So, to compare propeller efficiency you will also need to know the effective blade pitch, speed of the airplane, air density,  and the propeller activity factor.  There are many books available on propeller design.  There is a lot more to it than thrust and tip speed.  Here's a start.

Don't know about Easyjet, but Ryanair's training courses are 5 weeks and you do not get paid for it. If you pass the training course you are guaranteed a job at the end of the course.



There is a â¬1,750 charge for the training up-front, or you pay â¬2000 and give a â¬500 deposit and the remainder is then deducted monthly from your salary.

Wow. Now thats ambition. Ok.. here goes.
First you need a private pilots license.
Then you need a high performance endorsement.
Total cost about $25,000 US
Then you need a checkout on a spitfire ( you will need to purchase one as there are no spitfires anywhere in the world that you can rent.)
Cost for that about 1.5 million
Add on insurance of about $50,000 per year.
Then you are all set.

It is a fantastic ambition but one that only a lottery winner may be able to satisfy.

You will need a pilot's licence and then find a museum where they still fly Spitfires. 
Unless you already have a several hundred hours of flying experience I doubt that you stand any chance at all of them letting you fly their aeroplane.



These machines are very high performance compared to the type of aeroplane used by flying schools. It means that the scope for a beginner to crash it is very high.
There are only a handful of airworthy ones left and they're too valuable to give to the inexperienced.

No smart answers, Come on. You just don't get straight lines like yours that often.

Invent a time machine and go back about 70 years. When old enough, join the RAF and go thru pilot training.

Since you don't want "Smart--" answers, do you want us to confirm your desire is possible or do you want the real answer from real aviators?  Part of maturity is being able to recognize that one's desires may not be obtainable..
Off my soapbox:

Become a private pilot.  Cost:  about $10K
Receive a high-performance ticket on your license: $20K 
Amass sufficient hours to convince someone with a two-seat model to allow you to check out.  Guess around 200hrs and an IFR rating as well: $30K
Find one for sale or lease and buy it.  $1-2M
Keep up maintenance and insurance:  in the US zero-timing a RR Merlin runs about $150K.  Good luck finding parts BTW.
Wagged total cost to you:  $3M all told.  Keep in mind some costs will be ongoing: insurance, parts, mx.
Bottom line is no museum, private collector etc is just going to let you walk up and take one around the flag pole.

Get a pilot's license.

Then YOU just may have to build your own.



Or you may have to build a model in the meantime!!!!

You dont !!!

(a) There are VERY few air worthy Spitfires left.
(b) Most are owned by Preservation Groups.
(c) Unless you are an important member of a preservation group and a highly skilled pilot, your chances are zero.

Go for Gordon Browns job instead, you will have a better chance.

Im presuming that your in the UK here and what a terrific question.  Of course there are not many spitfires left flying now and those that are airworthy cost around a Â£1,000,000 to buy so unless your incrredibly rich thats not an option, as a guess i would say that you would need to obtain a private pilots licence and also the ratings for navigation and instruments as well as the spitfire even these days has a massive performance edge on the private planes that are normally used.  when you have amassed enough hours and money too you could contact Carolyn Grace who owns and operates ML407 a mk ix 2 seater that has been restored to flying condition and see if she would be prepared to teaach you to fly the spitfire, which again isnt cheap, there would also be civial aviation checks and someone would need to sign you off as competent to fly the plane, after all that you would need to find someone who owns one that needs a pilot, i wish you well in your search

You could build your own from a kit or set of plans.



search for Spitfire Mk26



or Isaacs Spitfire and you should get suitable results.
