Could you help me to find inspiration for the exterior of my little house?



Hello!! I've just builded a 1/12 scale model of a Victorian house and shop (http://www.sidcooke.co.uk/Dolls_House.as... Now I would like to decorate it in the most realistic way in a true Irish or British style but I have no ispirations under my eyes as i live in Italy. Could you please give me some links to pictures of real-size houses and shop that can help me? The shop front is very particular for me and I have no idea about how to decorate it to make it feel real..
Thanks a lot! (...and sorry for bad English...)

This is really rather a nice house. The Victorian Society here should be able to help - http://www.victorian-society.org.uk
They have a home owners advice column.

The thing is to remember that certain paint colours were not available (or popular). Youa re right to distinguish between British/Irish and say American (aka Federal) which would give a very different result.

Will furniture delivery people mind moving my old sofas for me (I don't mind giving them extra money)?



My mum's getting new sofas delivered on Thursday,  and I said I would like her old sofas because they're not very old.  The problem is that the removal people aren't coming to take the old sofas to my house until Friday so we had planned to move them into the garage tonight to make room for the new ones since there isn't enough room in the living room for both...only thing is both myself and my mum are only 5' tall and moving the old sofas out ourselves turned out to be nigh on impossible.



What I'm wondering is, would it be cheeky to phone the new sofa delivery company in advance to ask if they can move the old sofas out when they deliver the new ones?  My mum doesn't mind paying the delivery people extra but I know there can be insurance issues with moving furniture.  Has anyone done this before?  If we can't get the old sofas moved in time then my mum will need to postpone delivery of her new ones for another week :(

How much should I be offering each delivery guy to do this for me? £5 each? £10 each?

They love a bit of cash! I used to deliver furniture for a living and they all love a bit of extra cash so just ask (they will not be offended), but ask the men and not the company as the company will probably say no. We used to like it if we got at least four or five little paid extras a day as it bumps up the low wages. Try £5 if its not enough they will let you know.

Since you only need them moved to the garage, I would think they'd have no problem moving them for some extra cash. It's not going to take them any time and they get extra money. Everyone wins. I would take a chance and wait until they show up and ask the guys directly.  Don't recommend calling the company in advance,  they might not like non-standard requests and might say no.

How can I decorate my stairs when the ceilings are too high?



I have started stripping the horrible wallpaper off but can only get as high as an arm reach above my head. There is about a foot of wallpaper left at the top which I can't reach and even with a ladder I can't do it because it's too high and I can't use both hands while steadying myself. I would also still have to lean and I'm pretty damn scared tbh. The stairwell itself is about 10ft high and I simply can't do it! I am skint though and can't afford to pay for a proper decorater. Any suggestions welcome! Thanks

You would need a board (plank may do) which comes off the top step and the other end is sits by one of the treads of a short ladder (closed step ladder may do). That ladder being somewhere halfway down the stairs both bootom feet on the same stair tread and the top resting on the wall above the stairs themselves.

Sorry I cannot explain it any better than that.

Purchase a "Little Giant" ladder. They work exceptionally on stairs. You can adjust it so one side will be longer than the other so you get a level platform to work from. They come in varying sizes but I would recommend the 4' one. It adjusts to different heights for flat surfaces as well as stairwells.

You will need a ladder, pair of steps and a strong plank.Put the steps at the top of the stairs and the ladder on the opposite side then place the plank between them.

general recommendation for in shower area or bath surround is cement based board, hardibacker or aquapanel (B&Q, wickes) as it does not disintegrate when in contact with water, thats what waterproof means in this instance. £ 4x as much
many builders will use green plasterboard which is moisture resistant, so not as good, £2x as much
normal plasterboard not recommended £1x

waterproof tile adhesive is also not affected by water but it still allows it to pass into the wall behind. if you need waterproof, like a coat, apply a waterproof coating, dunlop, bal etc  to the board and tile on top

btw plaster board is the same as gypsum board, plaster and gypsum are the same thing

Normal plasterboard will do fine as long as you paint/tile/paper it. An untreated peice of plasterboard isn't really suitable as it will retain the moisture is splashed or if there is alot of condensation.

You must use 1/2" cement board if it's one of the walls for the tub. You should find it in the section that sells tile. Any other part of the bathroom can have ordinary drywall.

I assume you mean gypsum board - not plaster board?



If you want to it hold up for a while, you should use moisture resistant gypsum board throughout the bathroom except in the shower/bath tub area. There you should use tile backer board.

Any wall which may be subject to direct water pressure should be of a waterproof material. Aquaboard is commonly used for these areas. The board is slightly more difficult to cut and should be screw fixed to the wall. When tiling use a waterproof adhesive and grout.

There is inspiration almost everywhere you go.  Just make a note of what is in any room that makes you feel comfortable, rugs, furnitures, window treatments, lamps, etc.  Take your time and buy pieces because you like them, not because you "should" or because it "matches."



Good design is about how functional a room is, how comfortable and how good it looks.  Some of the most beautiful rooms I have ever been in are the result of years of thoughtful purchases, not a lot of money spent for an instant decor.

Have fun and think of your home as a work in progress!

I want to sand my wood floorboards but we've noticed a concrete slab where the fireplace once was?



We are planning on having our floorboards sanded (we are hiring a company to do it) but after we lifted up the carpet we noticed there is a concrete slab where there used to be a firepace.

How easy is this to remove? Or more importantly, how costly?

It is possibly not concrete but only a mortar bed that was used to fix a hearth. If this is the case then  it will break up quite easily. if you wish to make the area good then consider lifting boards from another part of the room that is less conspicuous (from an alcove or from the corner where the TV will be positioned) For the area that you have robed try matching the floorboards from a reclamation yard or from another room in the house that has a floor covering over it. The final result will depend upon how much time,  effort (or money if you are paying a tradesman to do the job) that you wish to throw at it.

What colour would go with black and gold wallpaper?



The wallpaper i have is black and gold but it is the new like indian style one. I am so sorry i don't really know how to describe it, like the new patter that is out now. I absolutly love it and i bough it because it did have a indian feel to it. However i have my back wall and front wall covered with this then just beige painted walls which i am no so bored of, therefore my question is...
What colour could i put with black and gold to make it look nice, i was thinking deep purple but any suggestions are welcome
and also i would like it to feel like an indian princess bedroom. I will eventually get all the drapes and everything for around my bed but help with the colour of paint is very welcome now.
Thank you

I would keep the beige walls and add a border either at the top or near the middle to break up the plain walls.  Or add some sheer fabric or dramatic framed prints to break up the blank beige.  You could even use offcuts of the wallpaper you are using to create framed 'pictures' on the walls.  That way you are following the theme, keeping it consistent and matching yet not too busy so it becomes overpowering.  You could then go to the extreme with colourful drapes and bedding as these can be changed a lot easier than wallpaper.

If you like it then keep it.  You are the one who has to live with it.  Unfortunately, were you to sell your house, a new buyer may not share your taste and would probably prefer a neutral palette.

What can I use to paint on steel ikea bed frame?



Hi I just bought a used steel bed frame and it has a lot of scratch and black marks on it. I wanted to spray paint or paint the bed frame to a silver metallic color. I was wondering if that is possible and if it is what are the steps that I should take to prepare to paint the bed frame. For example, do I need to wipe it down first to get rid of all the dirt so the paint will stick; etc.Thanks!

If it is not bare metal then you do not need a primer.  I would go to Halfords and buy a car spray paint in the colour you want.

You want the surface claen and free from grease.  So wipe it over with white spirit.

You could very lightly scuff the current paint with some P180 or finer grade of abrasive paper.

And spray.  Build up thin coats to avoid runs.

Wiping is a good start but not enough.  I washed a 4-drawer steel file cabinet with liquid **** and Span (diluted, of course) to get oils and any dirt off.  Fingerprints leave oily residue.  I left it to air-dry thoroughly, then sprayed with enamel.  No problem.  A light spray of a clear protective coat might be advisable -- glossy or matt, up to you. Make tests on a hidden part.

This should be done in some place like a garage, with the door open and plenty of light.  Wear a mask, put down plenty of plastic tarp, don't work near anything you'd hate to get paint on.  The spray goes everywhere.  Prop up pieces on something like pieces of lath.

If you spray in the open outdoors, pick a day when there is no breeze.  Otherwise you will get a stucco finish -- dust and dirt.  It's best to pick a still day, anyway.

First you need to sand the scratches out of the paint..no matter how many coats you put on it they will show...You have the choice to either try to spot sand the scratches ..or totally sand the whole frame....which will give you a much better job..then simply wipe it down with paint thinner..let it dry(which will be less than 30 minutes..then cans of a good quality spray paint such as rustoleum will do the finish work..spray light coats and let it dry as suggested on the can and spray another coat you are going to need more than likely 3 coats to paint the black to cover with silver...Be careful on the timing of the recoats for even if they seem dry to the touch and have not dried according to the label..you may get a wrinkl;e effect on it...Seems weird , but what happens is that the second coat will soften the base coat up to much if sprayed too soon and the first coat will "buckle" creating wrinkled paint finish..

Non-water soluble wallpaper paste/glue for bath ceiling?



I wallpapered my bath ceiling with a vinyl linen-weave to cover an uneven ceiling.  It looks GREAT - crisp, classy and spa-like.  But now the seam over the tub is starting to peel a bit despite ungraded exhaust fan.  Is there a better glue or paste to use on this section?  How do I apply?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



I have never heard of anything not water soluble.  The strongest is ready mixed heavy duty paste which is white and looks like a mix of paster and PVA.



Papering a ceiling in a bathroom is a bit optimistic.  It may have been better to get a plasterer to skim the ceiling.

So there is nothing specified for your problem, but you could have a go with ideas, wood glue?

When any type of wallpaper is pasted it expands in width. If the paper doesn't make good contact with the surface it is applied to, you will have air bubbles. These bubbles will usually disappear after the paper dries and shrinks.



Each time you apply any moisture to the surface, the detached areas will absorb it and expand again, making the bubbles visible once again. After the moisture dries, they disappear. If you want to end this cycle, you will need to apply an oil based primer to the entire wall surface. This can be top coated with latex paint without fear of the problem recurring.



Water based primers will not solve the problem however.

Mention that Black and Orange are too Halloween looking for the whole year long. Also, those colors remind me of football teams (there is Oklahoma State, also TN is Black and Orange). Plus, if both of you are female wouldn't you want something that looked a little.. uhm.. "softer" or more girlish and not so I don't know.. I just see a Halloween room in mind

Staining Pine- Grain Problem?



Here's the situation: I am working on my table which is pine to the best of my knowledge. I have stripped all areas and it is nicely sanded and has a natural bare wood look. You can see a nice wood grain look!



Problem is today I tried some samples from Sherwin Williams on the underside. Here's where it gets tricky.The grain that normally looks darker after sanded is coming out as the lighter grain after we stain it. And the lighter grain prior to staining is coming out darker . Its as if the grain has traded roles after staining. I don't like this because being reversed the color is too dominant.

Picture a tiger....before staining the table represents a tigers pattern. Dominantly orange with black stripes. After staining the table looks as if the tiger is dominantly black with orange stripes.



I am using a darker stain. When we tried a very light stain the roles did not reverse.

Table: Currently sanded 150 grit and not conditioned. We tried various brands of stain.

Why is the stain causing the roles of the grain to reverse and how can I stain it dark without this happening?

After reading I realize its recommended to condition the wood but I still don't have an answer if the condition will prevent this reversing problem.

Any help will be highly appreciated. What was supposed to be the fun part is becoming the hard part!

Thanks
B~

Ok, here is my "take" on your problem.  It's hard without actually seeing your table.  The lighter areas are less dense and therefore absorb more of the stain.  That's the only thing that would cause the problem you are describing.

Are you using an oil based stain or a water based?  When we refinish furniture we use nothing but oil based stains because you do have more "control" over the penetration.  So if you're using water based, get some good oil based stain.  Do a test patch on a hidden area  with the new stain.  If you like it, great!  If it's still doing the same thing, you need a seal coat to help stop the lighter wood from taking in too much stain.  What we use when we get into that is a coat of tung oil.  Formby's make a good, all tung oil and it's not terribly pricey.  Watch the labels though, some so called tung oils actually have poly in them and you don't want that!

Did I mention oil based stains and tung oil are MUCH easier to put on?  You pretty much just rub them on with a soft lint free cloth, always going with the grain.  No brush marks.  And tung oil is a great finish all by itself too!  Now it will take numerous coats to get a good seal on the wood but the result will be a nice, rich finish that can be repaired if you get a scratch or a ding!  Can't do that with poly!



My best suggestion is to sand the table with a 300, 320 grit sandpaper to really polish it up more than the 150.  150 is still fairly rough.  The higher # sandpaper might just smooth things out enough to keep that from happening also.  But I honestly think if you get some oil based stain you will be much happier with the results.

There is no way to reverse the grain structure/pattern and the way it takes stain..here is what is happening though...The "strong" streaks of grain in pine is much tighter(denser) than the other open grain not in the streaks (the more solid part)...so it does not absorb the stain as much..the open part of the grain, the larger areas are a very loose type grain in the wood and absorb the stain more thus darkening it...As mentioned you cannot change the way the wood accepts it...A lighter stain would have made the dense grain show more..and the open grain show less...The more "red tone" a stain has..the darker the loose grain will show also..You have a question that has no proper answer..for the wood will accept thestain as it does..sorry to say...but is the truth..you cannot reverse the acceptance of the stain in the wood...

If a fox is ripping my binbags everywhere, is it the councils problem?



He is a big fella, and I don't want to hurt him. Much. It is communial bin area and I am the only one who clears up all the nappies, etc. If I phone the council, will they sort it out? The bin men won't clear it up (Quite rightly too) and we have a groundsperson who never turns up-and I mean NEVER. Is it up to the council to get rid of the fox, or do I have to do it? If so, how? (Without blasting a 12 gauge, thanks!)

i think you may be within your rights to ask the council to provide large wheely bins so the fox cant get to your rubbish. perhaps if they do not help you in that way (make sure you approach them in writing so you have the evidence if they refuse to help) then maybe you could presnt the option of helping you clear it up. I imagine if you bring it to your councils attention they will provide wheely bins - they have certain responsiblities when it comes to health and safety.

Its upto the council to get rid of the filthy neighbours who seem to have no respect for themselves or the babies whos soiled nappies are creating a health hazard. you lot attracted the fox

edit &gt;&gt;&gt; yeh you attracted the foxes with your animal like behaviour. not yours personally but you know. have you voiced your concerns about the neighbours and the nappies, thats what I mean. its all too easy to see fault with the fox but if the mess wasnt there then the fox couldnt open the bags. btw they will continue to chuck out their garbage while ever you go round pickin it up. make a stand ok maybe youll have to grit your teeth a while but sooner or later a respectable mum concerned over her own childs health will make a complaint. Now being the perfect neighbour as youve already proved, you wont wait for that to happen surely.

It would be great if you wanted to make a wall look like a collage (multilple pictures and/or objects in a pattern on a wall).  Also, a great idea for a college dorm room since they usually don't let you put up anything permanent or let you nail things into the walls.  It really depends upon what type of room it's going into.

If you have the base made out of Velcro you could buy fabric and apply on the top of it , and this way you would be able to peel and change the fabric when you are tired of one pattern. 
It would be a very good idea because it would also be an extra layer of insulation and also be sound proof. I don't think that it's a bad idea!

I said fabric because paper would rip unless it would be a very thick one.

Crown Molding - Filling and Sanding Seams?



I need some help from anyone with hands-on experience installing crown molding. I have installed my crown, corners look great. I am have trouble getting the seams to ddisappear I mated the ends on two long lengths of crown with a straight joint. Now everything I'm reading says I should have done this with an angled overlapping joint. But nevertheless, I used plain straight butt joints.

I have tried everything to get the joints to fill with spackle or caulk (tried both) I have tried hand sanding the spackle (the joint is still visible) and also a light grind to level with a dremel bit,and then spackle and sand (same line.

What do I need to do to finish these seams to make this look pro like the rest of the job???

Help, almost finished!

Easy answer, and this is what I would do.
Tear it down, re-do it.  Especially if you have used mdf or some other relatively inexpensive molding.  You will never be able to get the seams to blend on a butt joint.
Chalk it up to a lesson learned.

Paint will cover it up, but other wise you'll need to take them down, and either re-cut them, or sand them back. The back edges are what causing the problem.

Spackle and caulking can only do so far to lessen the effects of the straight (also known as a butt) joint.

Professionally speaking, best case is to take down the offending molding and properly angle cut the joint.

Since you do not want to do this, you may also try filling in and shaping the crack/space with wood putty.  Use a putty knife if you have one to spread on the wood putty, then use your finger lightly to brush over and mold the putty to the form of the crown molding.  Let it completely dry, before applying a second or third coat until desired affect is achieved.

Touch up painting to cover and blend into the existing molding.

Over time, cracks in these types of joints can re-appear and you may need to do the steps above again if they do.

You will spend a week trying to fill in the joint and make it look even remotely passable.  The only to make it look "pro" as you stated is to take it down and cut a cope joint.  It's a little tricky, but it looks great when it's done right.  If you need help, e-mail me.  Good luck.

So you're all celebrating "Talk like a pirate day" tomorrow?
Great!  I am not a pastafarian, but I will join in if you do.
Maybe use small squares of pirate skull and crossed bones on a black background?
Use wax to make the pattern and black cold dye from Woolies.
