Why are people worried about the bees dying?



Well I can imagine because of the reduction of honey but many are scared because they assume if bees died off plants wouldn't be pollinated. Bees aren't the only creatures that pollinate.

True, not only bees pollinate, but they are the chief pollinators of our produce.  Without them we would suffer a big reduction in things like fruit.



OK, not the end of the world, but a bad thing nonetheless.



Why have you asked so many questions and given so few?

Yes, there are other pollinators out there, even humans can become pollinators, but not all other pollinators pollinate diverse species of plants, bees are able to.



Well that's what I think.



Try finding a documentary(I think it is) titled "The Silence of the Bees", it was shown in National Geographic Channel.

Because Albert Einstein once said that, "If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe, then man would only have four years left to live."



so the people now are getting paranoid and afraid of the end of the world.



but in fact i don't know how that theory works, perhaps someone would answer that in their answers!

One year,there were no bees at our summer property. There were also no Apples, Pears,Figs, Plumbs, Cherry's and very few flowers around. We need them. Anyway the loss of one tiny little species whether bugs, bears or fish is a catastrophic loss to this earth. We can't afford to let even one die out.

it would be pretty devastating pickles a LOT of plants would go extinct in the wild. those in cultivation would have to be somehow alternately pollinated (probably by hand).



it's hard to say how many species of plants would disappear, because some have different pollinators.- from moths to bats to birds, wasps,ants, the wind - maybe some we are yet to find out about!



but a lot of plants from little annual flowers to tree's need or set Better when pollinated by bee's.



& bee's aren't just honey bees there are lot's of different "wild bee"  or "native bee" species worldwide-some living in pairs instead of a hive.



& if enough plants start disappearing then the other pollinators (moths,birds etc as above) may lose there habitat, food sources & breeding areas.



this can snowball knocking out species after species & affecting more & more in the food chain. until every living thing on the land is affected.
hope this helps

It seems like people do like to find things to worry about.



It also appears to be the case that Einstein never said we would have 4 years to live if the bees disappeared.

Like motor vehicles that you may want to purchase, there are all different kinds of weed.  The typical price for an ounce of weed can range from 200 - 800 dollars depending on quality and THC content.
Usually weed of low caliber has names like ditch weed, commercial swag. this weed typically has seeds, whereas high quality expensive weed known by names like cush, kind bud, AK47,crippy and others are derived from seedless female plants that are much more potent, this is why some ounces cost more than others.  For really good weed you probably should not pay more than 400 per ounce.

How to deal with squirrels tearing up my expensive landscaping?



OK I have had it they have been tearing up my red japanese maples for years now they have started tearing apart the evergreens too. There are way too many of them everywhere and they just wont stop. Its not like they are eating anything they just chew off the branches and let them fall to the ground. Can I use a rat trap? Is there any poison? can you train cats to hunt them sobs down?

One old school way of detering squirrels is bagging up hair clipping from a barber or salon. be sure to use a porous bag, like one made of cloth. They dont have to be big bags. Throw these bags in your attic to deter them from making residence in there. Hang them on limbs to deter them from trees. Throw them in bushes around your landscaping.
Hair is a way they determine there areas. Human hair present will make them believe that this area is already taken, by something besides a squirrel, and could possibly be a predetor.



LOL, people sell these in the back of some pest control magizines. One time my employer had ordered this product, only to find out it was human hair in a bag.

Because of the season.. right now or a bit later perhaps, would be a good time to "Re-Plant" these bulbs.. Its great that you have found these flowers.. and your going to enjoy working with them in the future.



The bulbs have become "dormant" and will no longer grow in the cool or cold months.. If they are in a general area you wish to keep them, Simple weed the weeds from this spot as to make a clear areas for the bulbs never spring.



At this point there is no way to tell what they are or let alone the colors they possess. I would suppose this would be a wonderful surprise next spring when your finally allowed to see what colors these bulbs will offer your yard.

Since you don’t know what they are a good rule of thumb is to plant them twice as deep as they are high – so if the bulbs are 2 inches tall, the top of the bulb should be four inches below soil level.
I would definitely plant them to see what happens but since you don’t know what they are, what colors they may be or their height – plant them somewhere where you can enjoy them but they will not interfere with your garden ‘color scheme’. A good midpoint would be to plant them where they will get four hours of full sun a day. Once you find out what they are, you can plant them where it is best.
As long as you cull the bad bulbs and do not plant them so they are touching each other, you should not have any problems with disease.

You can always plant more bulbs with the bulbs you already have in place.  Discard the eaten ones and move the good ones to wherever you want them but do it soon.  Do you know what they are?  If not, I would put them around the front or in the back of the patch of lilies that you know are there just in case they are bigger or different than what you have.

Serious answer. If you have just moved into a new home and have inherited a garden, then just sit back and leave the garden for a year. Why? Well, who knows what hidden treasures you have inherited. You could have any number of bulbs and corms in the ground, all of which may put on a stunning display in the next year, but if you go in like a bull in a china shop then you could be losing a lot of wonderful plants and flowers.



Honestly, unless there is something you just can't stand in the garden and can't live with (like a Leylandii for instance), then just leave it for a year so you can take stock of what you have. Get yourself a piece of paper and draw up a plan of your garden. Over the next year, start making notes of what is growing where, and when it is growing and flowering. You can then take a step back and start planning the garden properly, working out what changes you want to make, what you can leave, what you can live with, and what you can remove.



With regards to the bulbs you have already dug up, if they were under slabs as you state then it is most likely that replanting will probably kill them off given the constant state of stress they probably exist under. Bulbs are generally not expensive for the likes of daffodils and anemones and the like when bought in bulk, so it might be a safer bet to just to bin the ones you have exposed and buy them fresh and plant them as you wish.

<answer>



from what i can see gumamela is hibiscus.



pick a sunny spot , take into account how large you variety will grow.



then dig a hole twice as wide & deep as the pot.



"backfiil" the bottom of the hole until the top of the soil in the pot matches the original ground soil level.



then carefully remove the plant from the pot, (this can be tricky).



put plant in middle of hole & fill in around it with soil.



the soil level from the pot MUST MATCH the soil level of the ground! - this is the most important part. that is why its good to put the plant in the hole BEFORE taking out of the pot to check you are right!



water in & fertilise!



if the plant is tall you may want to stake it, to help get it started.
hope this helps

Tiger lilly bulb question?



Anyone know about them? A few months ago I bought some tiger lillies, and planted them in my container garden. Unlike all of my other flowers, they didn't last long, and first the flower leaves fell off, then once I had only green stem and leaves, they started turning yellow and dying. I went to dig them up to plant something else and discovered bulbs. (Yes I'm new at this) and was wondering if I could do anything with the bulbs or are they dead too? Thnx so much! :)

Well welcome to the plant world yes the tiger lilly is a bulb and to my understanding you want to take the bulb out of your container garden because you thought it was dead. The bulb as long as it is not mushy should be just fine this flower like a lot of other perennials will completely die except for the roots or in your case the bulb in fact you do not want to move this until the plant has turned yellow. Go ahead and plant it where you want to but I would take it out of the container garden and plant it in the ground and next summer you might have more flowers coming from that one bulb.

Yes I had already taken them out of the container (I didn't want a big empty looking container out front, I planted other flowers in it's place for now) and the bulbs were not mushy, so I put them in another container that is out of the way for now. Thank you all for 'learnin' me about the bulbs!!!!

bulbs for tiger lilies are perrenial ...  you just leave them there and they sprout up at least once a year, a couple times in some climates ...



yes, the whole plant dies back to the bulb underground ...  the bulbs can eventually multiply, too if your conditions are right ...



it is fine to plant other stuff around them and they'll just poke up when they feel like it ...



be sure they stay at the same orientation and depth you found them at ...

your soil needs a triple phosphate  boost. Phosphate encourages root development and flowers.tiger lilies don't last too long any  way, and everything else that is happening is normal. Just cut back the brown growth, add phosphate (buy this at your local nursery about $10)put them back into the pot  about 2 and a half .inches deep. they will be fine.

With most bulbs plants, you can cut them back down around 1 inch from the bulb and it will sprout a new plant next season.  And as with most bulb plants, after a couple of years, those bulbs will multiply.

How much more will i grow?



i am 14 years of age im a female and the last time i checked my height which was quite recently i was 175cm im in year 9 now and i've stayed the same height since yr 6, i think 175cm is about 5'9 the last time i checked my height i did have my period but maybe not for exactly for one year. I believe i have stopped growing well i keep thinking positive i should say. Is there much a doctor can do about this situation if i was to see one?. I've heard that you can get an x-ray to see if you have stopped growing is this possible. Will i grow much more??

You're pretty tall already, how much taller do you want to be?  I'm 5'9 and I'm in my 20s...I stopped growing in high school.  Maybe you'll have another growth spurt or two, once when you're in jr. high school and another in high school.  Maybe not.  You don't need an x-ray to see if you'll get any taller, you could always ask your doctor at your next check up to see how your rate of growth has changed over the years and they might be able to predict how much taller you could be, but no one can tell for sure until you stop growing, and everyone stops growing once they have finished college, that is for sure.  :-)

You can freeze them whole or chop them to the size you want before freezing if you prefer.  They don't even have to be blanched.  You can dry them by stringing thread through the stems and hanging them in a dry, well ventilated area or you may can them, which is the most work and requires the most equipment.

How long should I sit my indoor plants in water?



How long should I leave them sitting in water, how do I know when they've had enough? I have no idea of measuring how much is too much or too little! For example, if they haven't soaked up all the water after, say, 30 mins, should I take them out and empty the surplus water? Conversely, if they have drunk up all the water in 30 mins should I give them more? Any guidelines would be much appreciated! :)

You should leave them long enough so that the soil is uniformly damp. The time will vary depending on how big the pot is and if it is clay or plastic. You can stick a chopstick or a pencil into the soil to check dampness. But unless these are African Violets, why are you watering from the bottom? Water from the top and when they have had enough the water will drain from the hole in the pot.

Typically, all indoor houseplants suffer when over watered. If there is standing water after 30 minutes, you probably over watered and need to drain it. But if all the water was absorbed by the plant you shouldn't add any more. I usually water my plants once or twice a week but this is depending on how hot its been, humidity levels etc. After awhile you will get to know each of your plants needs and water/fertilize accordingly. When in doubt I will look up the plant on the web and see what kind of conditions it prefers. Good luck!

You should try not to let your plants sit in water as (a) this can rot the roots and (b) it will smell if the water stagnates.

Do not be afraid as you will get to know your plant after a while,  If there is no label, water the plant at least once a week.  Look at the leaves as well as the soil.  The plant will respond to your care and will thrive.  Enjoy your plants and good luck.

You will not need a cold frame unless you are expecting freezing weather.  Both of those veggies are cool season crops.  They thrive in cool weather, and even withstand light frost.  They will not do well in the heat.  In Florida, where I live, we plant cabbage and cauliflower in the fall and harvest in early winter.

As well as runner beans and cucumbers you could grow  Peas, Grape vine, other types of cultivated blackberry or related fruits, kiwi fruits if it's not to cold where you are. You could even train apples, pears or plums on the trellis.

Any of the flowers already mentioned are nice... but you might also consider grapes, or there is even a version of the tomato plant designed to grow on a trellis, up to 6ft high.



Rather depends on where your trellis is, and whether you want it to be 'decorative', or 'productive', hehehe.

I would suggest going to one of the local farmers markets in your area.  Not only will the potato's eyes not be treated to not grow but also you can learn about which types grow best in your area

Caterpillars eat plants, so if they are on your or near your garden I urge you to place them elsewhere. Don't kill them though! Caterpillars grow into butterflies that help pollinate your garden. Without them and bees and other creatures gardening would be difficult.



As for your question I can't clearly answer. I would say that they should be watched and kept away from your garden... so yes they are pests. But they grow into your helpers.

<question>



How likely is it that a tree branch falling on top of a hedge row of conifer trees would kill them?



neighbor took down a bradford pear tree and one of the larger branches must have hit the top portion and knocked off two feet of the top portion of two of the Tsuga Canadensis (Canadian Hemlocks).

this was about a couple of weeks ago.

since then they have seemed to become slightly discoloured and turning yellow portions are. dont know if it is due more to the stress from the hot , dry weather (even though they have been watered reguraly every few days) or due to the damage from the tree.

think they did this last summer a bit, but was concerned as to the liklihood that it is due to the tree branch falling on them and knocking the top portion off and breaking them.

is this possible?

why so?

Thanks for your answers!

It depends on your growing season. Mine bloom in late spring all the way up to late fall. There are hardy fushias that can be about 3 feet tall and the common trailing fushias that you see in baskets. They will grow easily from seed. Most fushias are hybrids so the offspring will not look exactly like the parents. The seeds form in the little berries of the plant they are ripe when they are very dark and soft.

They are eating bugs in your garden.  The big garden spiders are actually helpers.  Since they will be dieing off shortly with cold weather, can you live with them?  If not, just knock the web down.  Good luck on finding or catching the spider.  If you must, kill it or let nature take it's course.  Don't use pesticides please.  No use poisoning yourself and the garden killing the good guys.

The best way to get rid of spiders in your garden is to remove all the plants and pour a slab of concrete from one end of the property line to the other – and make sure it goes right up to the foundation of the house.



No plants – no bugs.
No bugs – no spiders.
As long as their food source is gone, they will make their lairs somewhere else.



You might get a stray every few years but other than that, all should go as planned.

Anthuriums... any information?



My aunt recently gave me a plant called an anthurium, and it has been somewhat neglected. Several of the leaves have rather largish brown spots on them, I'm not sure if this is because of under watering or what the deal is. I would like to know some basic care tips for it such as the kind of light it likes, when and if I should put it in a bigger pot, how wet should I keep it, what it's life expectancy is, do I give plant food, etc... Any and all information would be greatly appreciated.

The length is about 10 metres, and I need to know how many plants per metre I should plant.
PLEASE no suggestions for evergreens ( box, cyprus, thuja etc) as these are poisonous and I have horses.
Thanks in advance for the advice of any keen gardeners out there!!

How can anything grow if horses are close enough to eat it? Hedges are evergreens because if they lose their leaves in the winter they don't make for much of a view blocker. Maybe you should consider a privacy fence instead. You won't have to worry about the horses or how long it takes the thing to grow.

laurel is the quickest growing hedge that i can think of. but again its an evergreen! 
you could plant a mixed hedge from 'whips'(small, cheap bare rooted trees used for hedging).tree suppliers like www.treesplease.co.uk would be able to tell you what varieties they include in their mixed hedge plants, but something like- hawthorn, horbeam,guelder rose, dogwood( these can be very beautiful if used on their own, very colourful stems ranging from greens to yellows to oranges to reds to purple), beeches copper or purple,hazel and holly. you would be able to omit the holly if you really didn't want any evergreen. whips come in sizes 30-40cm 60-90cm 90-120cm i would get the tallest, they will look a bit scrawny but will be best by next summer. you shoul plant them every 30 cm, so its 3 per metre and an extra couple for the end.about 35 would do your ten metres.
i hopeyou have luck with finding what you want, and give the horses a carrot from me :)

it is evergreen but is not poisonous to animals or humans.

The best thing you can do for those little grapevines is to plant them in the ground.  They just won't do well at all in pots.  They need their space.

If you try growing them in pots, you're just in for a big disappointment.  They most likely won't make it through the winter, and if you do manage to keep them alive, they sure aren't going to produce grapes for you.  Plant them in the ground where they belong.

I don't know what zone you are in, if it freezes where you are you can use this method until next spring then plant them in a permanent place.
I would not plant them in the soil now.
 Plant the pots if they’re not in terra cotta. But plastic pots can be ‘planted’ right in the ground. This may seem foolish, but it actually provides all the benefits of in-ground insulation without any risk of transplant shock—and it protects the plants’ roots from underground winter gnawing by voles. Just bury the pots, water as directed above and dig them out again in the Spring. When they start to develop leaves and when the night time temperatures are in the sixty's plant them in the ground. They will need suport.

I'd keep them in the pots till spring and then plant them out in plenty of compost.  As they grow pinch out the side shoots if you want a long plant.  I've found they are pretty tough and survive through winter once established

If it is green, they have most definately been dyed! One sure way to tell is when you put them into a vase, (especially a clear one) the water will also turn green from the dye running out. 
Blues, purples, hot pinks, etc. tend to be dyed also. Carnations are almost always dyed, even in their natural colors to enhance their colorful appeal.

It is much easer to dye white carnations any color you want,



But there is a cultivated green carnation,  called Prado, the information is below. If you got them from a florist just call and ask.

The natural color of a carnation is a pinkish-purple, but it has been cultivated to include green, yellow, red, and white varieties. It is a popular choice for boutonnières and corsages.



The cultivated green carnation is called. PRADO REFIT Green, 
Green with light Red stripes
Wonderful mint green, as admired by the Queen at the Chelsea Flower Show in 2000. 
Mixes well with many other colors and an added delight in floral arrangements.
This plant has received an Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society.

Grow as a patio plant and have outside during the summer or grow them in a greenhouse, conservatory or cold frame.



Prado Pino  Ref: PF310



These plants have been trialed at Wisley as a Patio plant and we grew them like this ourselves last year and had superb results.
We would recommend potting them up into a 5lt (9") pot at least, (to give a quick effect, pot 3 plants per pot) provide support as necessary, and you will get an amazing crop of flowers to either enjoy outside or cut for a vase. They will require winter protection in either a coldframe, greenhouse or conservatory, treat them like a houseplant.
If they are kept in a heated environment during the winter months (minimum temperature of 45F) they will continue to flower but not as polifically as during the summer, but it is possible ot have your own cut flowers for Christmas!

They dislike prolonged wet conditions during the winter months. They do not mind the cold or frosts.

Florists suppliers often use dye in the water which when the flowers drink this they turn the respective colour.

It is flower friendly dye so I would not suggest doing it with ink, although you could try diluted food colouring to see if this will work,  I would suggest the flower colour would be white to begin with.

How do I keep an artichoke plant alive over the winter?



I planted an artichoke this spring - my yearly garden experiment.  While it has large, thistle-like leaves it has not produced a bud or flower and doubt that it will given it's mid-September.  I understand that they come back every year and wonder a) what I should do to keep it alive over the cold Ontario winter and b) if I can expect fruit next year.
Thanks....

You'll need more than plastic up there. Plastic transfers cold!  When cold weather comes, not super cold, just tuck in the garden cold, cut off the leaves and put a dry mulch around the plant......straw for example.....and then add a box over that and cover that with more straw.  If you get a lot of wind, throw some chicken wire over the whole thing to keep it in place.  If you can find the Styrofoam rose cones, that might work instead of the box.

If you're leaving it outside cut back all the leaves until you reach the growing point at the top of the stem, make a cage with a few bamboo canes and wire netting then stuff with straw making sure you protect the growing tip. You can then cover the whole thing in garden fleece. If you can't be bothered doing all that, just move inside for winter and it will lose its leaves much more slowly. Make sure you water it if it is looking too dry but don't overwater.

Almost any kind of apple will keep for three or four months, or even longer, if stored properly. It’s cheap and easy to do. All you need is newspaper, a box or basket, and apples.



The main causes of apple spoilage are time, bruises, and contact with a rotten spot on another apple.



Time can be stretched by selecting long-keeping varieties of apples for storage. Tart and thick-skinned apples like Jonathans generally keep longer than sweet or thin-skinned ones like Delicious. Good keepers also have very firm flesh.

Prevent contact between apples stored for the winter by wrapping them individually in sheets of newspaper. The easiest way to do this is to unfold a section of newspaper all the way and tear it into quarters. Then stack the quarters. Avoid sections printed with colored ink, which contains poisonous heavy metals.



Place an apple on top of the stack and fold the top sheet of paper up around the apple, wrapping it in paper. Give the corners a slight twist—just enough to make them stay wrapped. If you twist them too hard, the paper will tear. It’s not necessary to exclude air. Just twist hard enough so the paper doesn’t come unwrapped before the apples are boxed. The paper prevents contact between apples, so just one rotten apple won’t spoil the whole bunch. With practice, you’ll be able to wrap and store apples as fast as you can scan them for bruises and sort them.



Sorting
Always handle apples carefully, to avoid bruising them. Apples with even small bruises must never be stored with “keepers.” Only perfect apples should be used for long-term storage. Even minor imperfections speed spoilage. While you’re wrapping, check each apple for cut skin, soft spots, or bruises. Even bruised apples taste fine when they’re fresh, so sort the best culls into a box to be eaten right away. If there are too many, make apple pie filling out of the excess.

Storage
Boxed apples need to be kept in a cool, dark spot where they won’t freeze. Freezing ruptures all of an apple’s cells, turning it into one large bruise overnight. The usual solution is to store apples in a root cellar. But root cellars often have potatoes in them, and experts say that apples and potatoes should never be stored in the same room. This may seem incongruous, but there is a reason. As they age, potatoes release an otherwise harmless gas that makes apples spoil faster. If you can keep the gas away from your apples, they will keep just fine. Just don’t store them right next to potatoes.



Keep wrapped apples in a cardboard box. It need not be airtight, just tight enough to impede air circulation.

Hope this helps.

Wrap them in newspaper or brown paper and pile ' gently' into large cardboard boxes to give an airflow. They should be kept in an outbuilding if possible without any heating and should give you good apples until around May next year. Don't try to store any with brown spots, they just deteriorate and then make adjacent apples go bad. Cut them up, microwave, make into a good sauce and freeze for puddings or apple sauce.

Christmas cactus is pretty.  It needs a period of cool temperatures first, and only blooms when the nights are long and days are short.  There are also varieties that bloom around Thanksgiving and Easter.

Pansies are the best flower for winter color, there's one shrub that I know of that flowers in winter: camellia, but i'm not sure of it's hardiness zone I'm in 6a and I think it's right on the line here. but pansies will flower all winter, even if there's snow on the ground.

Orchids I have found easy to take care of they will be comfortable in 11c or above but like a humid atmosphere, I used rain clean rain water to water them and I mostly i used normal plant food, they hate cold, if you want to re pot i waited until the roots were almost bursting the plastic pots the special compost can be had at your local garden centre.
 The reason for it dying could be anything from vine weevil grub to over watering, it's hard for anyone to help you there but take the plant carefully out of the pot holding it on a paper or something to save the soil/compost check soil is not dry or too wet then take the compost from the roots and check for any grubs as weevils will eat the roots any other problems try looking up www.gardenersworld.com or http;//www.dgsgardening.btinternet.co.uk it might just help.Or try take your plant to your local garden centre someone might just know the answer when they see it. but good luck anyway

Tiger lilly bulb question?



Anyone know about them? A few months ago I bought some tiger lillies, and planted them in my container garden. Unlike all of my other flowers, they didn't last long, and first the flower leaves fell off, then once I had only green stem and leaves, they started turning yellow and dying. I went to dig them up to plant something else and discovered bulbs. (Yes I'm new at this) and was wondering if I could do anything with the bulbs or are they dead too? Thnx so much! :)

I think you can get containers for the poison that allow easy access for rats, but not for other animals...such as dogs, cats and probably chickens. Just check at a hardware store. I'm sure the poison would be bad for animal who ate it.

The chickens ought not come in your yard.....it's like a leash law-if you can't control your animals you shouldn't have them-so I say set thew poison out-as long as it's in your own yard and you have a good reason to use it, like rats coming in...then by all means-if the chickens eat it then maybe the neighbor will keep her chickens where they belong, or get rid of them. Does it not make you mad that chicken poop is all in your yard? That's gross

You sound like very caring person and your neighbors are lucky.

The farmer's fields are providing food for the rats.



You need a predator. What about a few large sized cats? (Hopefully the chickens are kept in roofed cages.)

You will have  happy cats, albeit a bit frustrated because of the unreachable chickens.

Over the last week or so I keep finding animal faeces on my gravel driveway which is becoming very annoying.  I'm not sure if this is from an irresponsible dog owner, a cat or another animal such as a fox but I would like to know what I can use to stop it.
I've previously used anti cat pellets (the little green waxy ones) but they didn't work.

I know how annoying your situation must be.  There are several dog and cat repellents on the market.  One that I like is called Repel, and they also make one called Ropel that repels squirrels and other such varmits.  The only downside is that they have a moth ball-like odor which you might find objectionable.



You might even want to stay home from work one day and try to find out if it is a dog that is doing the dirty deed and talk with the owner about proper dog walking etiquette.

I hope this helps and good luck with your problem.

Try buying some Eucalyptus oil and put drops of this all around the edges and entrances of your driveway including any wall that animals may walk along, they hate the smell of this stuff well I know the cats do anyway, re-apply again if it should happen to rain at all or put orange or lemon peel around the sides of the driveway but this may look unsightly! If you dont mind windchimes these will be good at startling any animal because of the noise or finally get one of those lights that light up when it detects movement, this would also startle the animal especially at night. Goodluck.

Cheap solution, which won't stand out like a sore thumb, for deterring a cat.
Peel an orange and chop the peel into tiny pieces.  Sprinkle this wherever the cat has been offending.  It will dry up and blend into the gravel.  The citrus smell will linger for some time to a sensitive moggy nose, whereas most sprays and pepper dust is washed away in the first downpour.

I have 2 Salix harlequin trees with stems about 2 inches in diameter planted in half barrels (real barrels made of wood) in front of my house. (north side).
Could anyone please tell me, if I wrap them in bubble wrap or such could I leave them out for the winter?
The problem is the barrells are so heavy I would need a fork lift truck to get them into the barn.

Salix is the latin name for willow .The variety maybe japanese but as they have cold winters there I would think they would be winter hardy in the UK.As they are in pots I would try to keep them in a fairly sheltered spot because if temperatures drop considerably the root ball might freeze and if for a long time the effects are the same as drought.They would however be fairly dormant through the winter so this might help them to survive.They are deciduous so expect them to lose their leaves for the winter.

Growing vegetables from store bought seeds?



Brussels sprout seeds and others. I plant them in potting soil, follow the instructions on package.tried several times. they start and grow about an inch or two. then croak.soil just damp, then let it dry out a little , then some i tried to water lightly. then they croak. had them on the screened porch no direct sun.,but plenty of light, here in cocoa, florida. they never get passed that seedling stage. used Scott's garden soil in 4 inch pots ,I don't think i  over watered them.--same thing with jalapeno seeds, but got a couple of them to grow.

The easiest way to solve your problem is by buying any "seed starting kit". They cost about $8.00 from Lowes, or any other garden center. Ferry Morse makes a good one which gives you about 60 little peat circles (you don't have to use them all at once) and has it's own plastic cover - which really helps with germination. Also, don't bury your seeds, just lay them on top, and don't water them - mist them. It's so easy and gratifying you'll want to start everything from seed! Hope this helps and happy planting!

If the growth is light green AND soft and a little shiny, it is new growth and nothing to worry about. If old leaves were turning pale they would probably be either very wilted or brittle. I think what you describe is just new growth because that is the appearance of new growth in full size plants grown out of doors.

Ducks are not stupid!! Choose whatever you think will look nice. If ducks ate gravel then there would soon be no ducks around. In a little town near me there are about 50 ducks that live on the edge of a river and a gravel car park, they are thriving. Ducks feet are really tough and it is very unlikely that you can buy any sort of gravel that would harm them.

Do not worry about sharped edge gravel on thier feet..there is none that will hurt them for thier feet are tougher than dried leather...Use basically any gravel that is appealing to you, the ducks could care less..and about all of this ducks eating gravel..yes indeed they will eat a little smaller gravel to aid in digestion..all birds do..the small gravel bits go to thieer gizzard  where the food they eat also goes through..they contract thier muscles naturally to have the small gravel grind thier foods like seeds etcetera that have a rough texture..this is common...The ducks know when,how much, and what size gravel they need for digestion..there is no threat here..use any gravel you want to use..unless it is a treated gravel with a clear sealer of any sort..some places sell a coated gravel so they will shine ..some(most) gravel have thier own natural sheen to them and some don't but by a duck pond..they wont stay shiny long anyway...here is some info on how a gizzard works in digestion ..so this will take any fears of the gravel use away from you..

In organic gardening, soil quality decides vegetable quality. That's why you need good quality compost to keep the soil productive for organic vegetable gardening.

Compost can be made from leaves, dead flowers, vegetable scraps, fruit rinds, grass clippings and manure. The ideal organic soil has a dark color, sweet smell and is full of earthworms.  Some soil may need more natural additives such as bonemeal, rock phosphates or greensand.  A simple soil test will tell you the pH balance and which nutrients you need to use.

Hi Lee,
 If you’re going to invest in winter flowering plants, make sure you plant them near the house, where they can be seen from the windows and along any paths that are regularly used even in the coldest days of winter – like the front garden path or the route to the washing line. Great plants for both colour and fragrance are Chimonanthus praecox 'Luteus' – fragrant yellow flowers on bare winter stems, Hamamelis x intermedia 'Pallida' – spidery yellow flowers with a sugared tea odour, all the mahonias with their yellow flowers and strong clear fragrance, and Viburnum x bodnantense 'Dawn' – lightly scented flowers really worth investing in for their gorgeous pink blooms. 
Enjoy your gardening and good luck.

Euphorbias are fun and interesting plants, some of which flower in winter, others have the coolest folliage they don't need flowers.

Winter pansies are are a great standby producing masses of flowers well into winter.  My weather is pretty close to yours and my pansies bloomed though the whole year (not so much in summer though too hot).

These were great suggestions from David H on another Yahoo question, same subject 11 months ago ( http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?... ):

Camellia - some species flower from November
Winter flowering jasmine - yellow flowers on bare stems
Winter flowering honeysuckle - a favorite of hummingbird moths
Sarcococca- dwarf evergreen shrub with white scented flowers
Helleborus niger - known as the Christmas Rose
Winter pansies - large flowers in lots of colors, good for containers
Snowdrops - some specialist varieties will be flowering around Christmas
dwarf Narcissi - last year I had them in flower on New Years Day
Crocus - plenty of color variety, flower earlier in pots.
Ornamental Cabbage - not really flowers, but great fun

I'm also in the south of England and I find cyclamen to be a lovely winter garden flower, they come in lots of different colours and the delicate flowers are on the top of stalks that poke above the snow (unless you get more than a couple of inches..lol), in spring they die down to leave an all summer green foliage that looks a bit like a sort of non-spreading ivy! 
One tip though, make sure you are buying the outdoors variety as there is also an indoors type that will die in harsh conditions.

I did see this on a news report a couple of months ago - yes, it is true!  The faeces are processed, super heat treated and resemble ordinary compost by the time they are finished (the product has no smell as I recall from the report!).  Whether or not the mushrooms grown on this are deemed organic or not, I can't recall (...or whether they are actually for general sale)  Sounds disgusting, but there you go! :-)

i doubt that - it is probably cow poo as a previous answerer said.

however this brings to mind every single food network show i have seen when they use mushrooms.  the host always admonishes the viewer to "never wash mushrooms, just gently wipe the dirt away with a paper towel".



forget that - i always wash them really really well with lots of water.  they do not "hold" water it is an old wives tale.

No, this is not true. To be able to call a food organic it must be grown on a certified organic farm which is a farm that follows all the USDA organic regulations, has a paper trail as to all inputs used in growing food on that farm and the farm is inspected annually by an inspector that is bonafide by the USDA NOP (national organic program).

The NOP prohibits the use of human feces (AKA sewage sludge or night soil) in organic production. Conventional farms have no bans on such fertilizers so a conventional mushroom farm might use such, though the vast majority of mushroom farms use sterilized horse or cow manure for the white mushrooms and other material such as sterilized straw or hardwood sawdust for other kinds of mushrooms such oyster mushrooms.

I wouldn't recommend "killing" with a chemical. Best is to remove it to the roots. The fastest would be with a Caterpiller or machine that will strip it like sod. Killing the grass with a chemical, doesn't mean it won't come back later.

a machine is unnecessary.  just spray weed killer over the area you want to put the deck.  throw down a couple inches of mulch or riverstone if it makes you feel better.



once the deck is built, little or nothing will grow underneath it.  is it simply a flat deck 8 or so inches off the ground?  chances are the deck alone would be enough to kill the grass, but i'd spray anyway.

goto the store you're buying the lumber from.  they'll help you figure out how much you'll need.  it'll depend on how long the boards are that they sell.  hopefully they sell 14 footers.

First lay down a covering of thick guage black plastic to kill the grass. when the grass is dead remove the plastic. Now level the base and relay the plastic. You will need 420ft of decking @ 6" wide. 150ft of wood Joists @ 8" X 2" and a box of 3" wood screws. Now you are all set to go. There can be a lot of wastage if you are not careful with your cutting. Just one other point, do not have all wood joins in a line, stagger them. Set the decking boards out at 3/4" spacings. Oh and make sure that the water can run off the plastic below, otherwise there will be ponding.
Good Luck.

I would use a ground sterilizer/herbicide such as Ortho's Triox, although I understand it has a new name now..Ortho Ground Clear or something like that. This will kill off anything there and keep anything new from starting for at least a season. Round Up only lasts a couple of weeks before weeds and grass start to regrow. Then build the your deck over the area. I would only cut out the area for your timbers, and then cut it down about 2 inches deeper then you would wish and refill with sand. This will help with stopping some frost wedging if you live in a northern climate. If you wish you can fill the rest of the area with sand as well this may also deter some of the weeds from growing under your deck, down the line.
I agree with the second poster that you should just bring your dimensions to the lumber yard and they will help you with what you need. I can tell you that you will need close to 64 board feet, but that is just for the decking with no spacing, and not the timbers which you will be attaching it to. Also plan on using galvanized screws, not nails. Nails come loose after a season or two and start to rise up. 
You can just get a screw bit for your power drill to take the sweat out of the project.

Here's what i did:

It was summer-autumnish. I got one of my brother's building blocks (they were plastic) and scrunched up a bit of catalogue paper to fill in the bottom and hold water. Then i folded a piece of tissue into a square so it fit the block perfectly and put it inside. I wet the paper with a bit of water, then placed the seed (i had only one) on top. I got some cling wrap, cut it into a rectangle, and taped it to the edge of the block, so it was like a veil i could lift up. Then i left it on a sunny windowsill. When ever i came home, i would check the seed, and if it was dry, add a bit of water. It germinated in about 2-3 weeks. I let it grow about 2 cm tall, then i planted in a container with a bit of dirt and compost. It's still growing after a year. Yay.

chives need some darkness to germinate..here is some info on this



Allium schoenoprasum is the smallest member of the onion family. It can be started from seed by sowing 1/2 inch deep in flats or pots. They need to be in a warm environment of at least 60 degrees to germinate. They require darkness and constant moisture to germinate. Chives germinate slowly - in about 2 to 3 weeks you will see the tiny seedlings begin to emerge. When about four weeks old, they can be transplanted to the garden.

Chives, unlike many herbs, require rich soil to thrive. They need plenty of sunshine, but will grow well in partial shade. Plant in clumps of 4 or 5 in well drained soil, keeping clumps at least 8 inches apart. They should be separated at least every 3 years and divided to perform well.

Of course, it is not possible to maintain the entire greenhouse at exactly the specified range, and this is an advantage. For within each range, it is possible to provide widely different climatic conditions. When you run a check with several strategically placed thermometers, you will find that there are pockets, sections, corners, and high and low locations where the temperature varies five to ten degrees from the general setting. In these areas you can indulge yourself with a plant or two from the list recommended for the moderate greenhouse even though you run your house cool; or you can have success with plants on the moderate list although most of your plants are grown warm. http://www.lovelygreenhouses.com/climate...

these kinds of machines are not really all that difficult to use.  takes time to get good at it, sure, but almost anyone could learn the controls.  the place you rent it from will give you advice.



when digging, plant the machine on flat, stable ground.  large stumps can be tough.  come at them from different angles.  a chainsaw and a shovel might be handy, you are talking about a 'mini' after all.  when turning, don't spin on a dime.  keep both tracks moving to avoid stirring up the soil below too much.  when leveling, keep the tracks lvl.  the blade is only as lvl as the tracks.  often pulling the dirt is easier than pushing when making a lvl surface.  expect to have to rake the soil smooth when your done.  the machine can't do it all.  have fun!

There is no way to teach you the operation of that type of equipment in this venue.



As to digging out tree stump with this type of equipment you need to dig all the way around the stump, breaking the roots as you go. Then try to pull it up with the tap root attached. If the machine stalls then try to cut the tap root. If you can't, you'll have to cut it by hand. Once the tap root is severed, lift the stump out and replace the soil.

Mosquito Plant ( Agastache cana ) It's a purple-ish plant that is good in zone 7, also it's perennial, and is supposed to attract all 3 (bees, butters, and hummies).



The " Butterfly Bush" is another good one, it attracts the butters and hummies too.



The "Hummingbird Bush" is supposed to attract all 3 as well. Butterfly's like Columbines and Hollyhocks too.  Bees LOVE lavender, as well as butterflies.



There are a ton of websites devoted to "creating a butterfly garden" and "bees and butterflies".  I have hummingbirds that visit my feeder and my lemon tree, and like someone else said, they are extremely territorial, and you will have only so many in one area.  Good luck, I hope your garden will attract every kind of creature you want and be your own little piece of heaven!

My hummingbird's are leaving for the winter, take care of them for me, as they pass through.
Put up feeders, butterfly houses, and provide shelter and host plants for the butterflies is very important. you can get more information below at these links



To do a outstanding butterfly garden you need to plant a variety of flowers that will attract them and the host plants to live on.
Allot of people know to plant a butterfly bush for butterflies but with out the host plants you may not have as much variety.

To answerer number one,South Australia has a severe shortage of water post a horrendous drought, and the government is encouraging people to investigate water saving measures.

I think if you have a small area why not leave it the way it is – without grass. Maybe put down some paving stones you can collect (or make them yourself) and strategically place some well thought out planters.



The planters would need very little water as compared to a lawn and stone or brick paving looks nice.
With a few garden accents (not plants) and a couple a nicely planted containers you could have a very pleasant oasis.

It is a wonderful option, esp. for a small lawn, I am in southern California, and not only have we had drought, but a water shortage as well. Some people have used artificial mulch, it comes in different colors (I believe it is ground up old tires that they dye in different colors) or, they use different color gravel. BUT, as for what it is you want, you can get astro turf or what has come out recently, "Easy Turf". It looks real, it drains well, and is dog friendly (some humane societies have it). Also, my hubby is in the military K9 unit, and they have an ENORMOUS training area, and they decided to put the artificial turf in (I don't know what brand), and it looks great and saves money on water (if a dog 'poo's', they just hose it off).  It seems to drain well if it rains too.  There is a little house in my area I walk by that has fake grass, and they have little flower pots all around and they keep it so clean and neat it is adorable. (advantage: no weeds!)



Hope I kinda sorta helped! (PS: Visited Australia once, loved it so much I didn't want to leave!)

I agree with the answerer above, I am also in SoCal and my neighbor's installed easy turf in their backyard because they have 5 dogs that constantly tore up their grass.  We are also under severe water restrictions and have the 20 gallon challenge so we can only water lawns 3 times a week which in this heat means they don't stay real green.  A couple of hints.  You really have to plan well.  They put in a couple of trees and made a couple of gardens after they installed the turf and had capped off the sprinklers.  That necessitated calling the company back out to cut into the turf remove it and provide water to those areas for an extra charge.  You have to vacuum up the little black pellets that will arise out of the turf for the first few months, so make sure your shop vac has an extension cord that can reach all over your yard.  Finally, they have had a little problem in the heat of the summer when we get triple digit days when the smell of urine gets a bit potent with that many dogs.  They occasionally spray down the turf with vinegar to control that.  They did a relatively small area of the yard for the fur kids and it cost them around $10,000.  They also spent an additional $8,000 before they installed it to regrade and put in catch basins and provide drainage for a pre-existing problem.  Their turf has a 10 year warranty and even barefooted I thought it does have a real grass feel to it.

Tree with Raspberry like Fruit What is it?



Hi,
I'm in the southeastern United States, and discovered a tree growing close to the Savannah river.  The tree is fairly tall, over 8 feet, and has fleshy raspberry like fruits ranging from orange to pinky-red in color.  The pinky red fruits, which look ripe, are the color, shape, and texture of Raspberries.  These fruits are a bit larger then a raspberry (about 2 times the size), and when squeezed, ooze a sap looking stuff, but are very soft.  They DO look like the fruits from a Purple Flowering Raspberry Tree, but I was told that tree doesn't get over 6 feet tall...and this tree is much taller then that.  Also the leaves aren't shaped like the Purple Flowering Raspberry Tree (their leaves are more shaped like an oak tree's leaves, while this tree's leaves are more heart shaped).  Can someone please tell me what this is, and if it's fruits are edible? They sure look edible!



</question>



<additional details>



I saw the first 6 answers, and I must say it's not a Mulberry Tree, and I'm not quite sure about the dogwood.  The fruits are not hanging from stems, but are clustered together.  The dogwood looks a little different from a raspberry, and this fruit looks IDENTICAL to a raspberry but bigger.

You're seeing a Chinese Dogwood tree.  The fruits on the tree have seeds inside.  Chipmunks love to eat the seeds but I can assure you that they don't have a good flavor for human consumption.



Watch that tree in the spring and you'll see the lovely white dogwood blossoms on it.

That is like asking, “Who is the most beautiful woman in the world?”



Charlize Theron? Angelina Jolie? Uma Thurmon? Eva Longoria? Grace Kelly? Ornella Muti? Sophia Loren? Ava Gardner? Catherine Deneuve? The list is endless.



They are all beautiful but in different ways and for different reasons.



There is no way to pick just one.



And since you could only pick the most beautiful flower in the world if you have seen every flower in the world, and no one has done that – it is just as impossible to choose.

Yes.  Vegetables that are not planted from seed don't need to be pollinated to reproduce.  Some examples are potatoes,  garlic and jerusalem artichokes.  All fruits require pollination.  That's what causes the fruit to develop from the flower.  You can grow and harvest lettuce,  cabbage,  broccolli and any greens without pollinating your own plants but none of those plants were polinated there would be no seed production.
