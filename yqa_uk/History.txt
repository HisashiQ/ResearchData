In hindsight all wars are avoidable what was important was the real time choices that were made. In that case no it could not have been avoided, the Germans felt wronged by the treaty of Treaty of Versailles, and the rest of the world had to respond. In the end both sides are at fault and neither could have done anything real time to change what happened.

yes if the Allies had stopped Germany in 1935 when it began to rearm.....they were viloating the treaty of Versailles when they started to esablished a tank force and a air force witch they were not allowed to under the treaty if the western allies had  declared war a forcfuly disarmed germany and Hitler than before he was fully armed we would have avoided the whole war....

that being said the Nazis were masters deception and every diplomat right up to 1939 were convinsed the nazis wanted peace....So there really was no willl to go to war with gemany till 1939 because the west of the world was convinsed that they wanted pecace....However i think that with out ww2 the world would be differnt as we know it the jet engine would have never been invented neither would the assult rifle and the wourlds economies would have taken alotn longer to recopver from the depression if it wern't for ww2

If France, Britain, and other countries in western Europe had stopped Germany and Italy earlier, before they were prepared, it could have a bloody, but probably short, war.

Inevitable. With the Germans, Austrians and Italians still pissed about the Treaty of Versailles and how aggressive Hitler himself as a commander was, it is very unlikely that Hitler, Germany and the axis powers forget about all the land and money (due to reparations) they lost because of the Treaty of Versailles. There was no way Germany wouldn't of not invaded Poland to get their lands back and if the allies did not join at the times that they did, Germany definitely would be a lot stronger than they were when the allies did enter. The allies had to join, or the world would be a lot different than how we know it today.

Yes it could be stopped. If the European countries would listen to President Wilson during the peace treaty signing ending the First World War. Wilson's ideas for peace were fair to all sides of the war. It would not create the conditions that allow Hitler to gain power. Instead The Allies wanted to punish the German Nation.

Hitler and Mussolini both came back from World War I very upset about how their respective countries were treated after the war. Both the Italians and the Germans were oppressed people who were in the midst of a depression after World War I. By Mussolini and Hitler giving hope to their people they got them to follow them blindly. Even if Hitler had been killed in World War I there was no way to prevent the Second World War. If it wasn't Hitler leading the Germans into war it would have been someone else.

It is possible albeit tenuously to trace cause and effect for the events that led to the outbreak of WW11 to the harsh reparations and territorial loss of France following the Franco Prussian war of the 1870's. Given that historical consequences have to be faced I do not believe that WW11 could have been avoided.

The Allies were heartily sick of war and economically ruined after WW1 and were in no position to faced down the resurgent military threat of Germany led by an unstable dictator.

It is possible that it could have been avoided. If the Treaty of Versaille had not been so punishing to the Germans, they may not have been so resentful and beat down that Hitler found a receptive audience. If after WW1 the Allies had helped rebuild Germany instead of kick her while she was down, it's possible that Hitler would never have been able to get elected chancellor.

Yes. If appeasement hadn't been pursued, the Nazis could have been stopped when they attempted to reoccupy the Ruhr. It is unlikely Hitler could have survived in power without the support of the army after this point.

History is an art, not a science.  Though history is studied, recorded, and analyzed, it does not fit into traditional sciences.  History is too open to interpretation to be a solid science.

Historians have resisted their field being classified as a science.  By using methods of pyschology and sociology, others have attempted to define the study of history into scientific terms, often missing key elements of the field of study.  Historians also dislike history being referred to as a social science, preferring the term social study.



Though historians often look for trends in history, they do not believe in the cyclical theory of history that social scientist refer to. To quote two of my history professors: "History does not repeat itself, but it sometimes rhymes," and "History does not repeat itself, but idiots often do."

There is only 1 official Empress of China, i.e, Wu Zetian.  Her official title was the Empress Regnant.  Empress Dowager Cixi ruled as the Empress Dowager of China and the "de-facto" Emperor though she is neither officially recongised as the Emperor or the Empress at her time.  Besides Empress Dowager Cixi, there is one more anicent Chinese female ruler that was the "de-facto" Emperor .. Empress Dowager Lü Zhi (also known as Empress Lü Zhi) who was also not recongised officially.  Empress Dowager Lü Zhi was the wife of Emperor Gao during the Han dynasty.

One must remember that in all of China's long history there were many different dynasties and each had their own empresses. The list is quite long and after copy and pasting each I then counted the total. The list may not be as complete as it should be, however, this is the number that I found. There were 160 empresses of China representing all dynasties scattered throughout the empire.

I don't think he was bright, but very lucky, but in the end, he got his men killed.
Men like Custer, (who Graduated LAST in his class in 1863)  were referred to as Goats of their class in West Point. In other words they graduated at the bottom of their class. There are two basic types of Goat. Charles Nelson Warner, for example, Goat of 1862, was the type who struggles with his studies, finds himself in over his head, but hangs on to graduate at the very bottom. The other model was the intelligent and talented cadet to whom grades and class rank were less important than pranks, socializing, and other pursuits. These were men like George Custer, George Pickett, and Henry Heth, who might well have excelled at their studies had the pursuit of knowledge been more compelling than the lure of good times. They and their comrades lived on the edge, seeking new and inventive ways of skirting the rules, and rising to the occasion only when the situation absolutely demanded it.

James Whistler got expelled. Whistler was another good-time Charlie, a West Point legacy whom everyone loved but he could not stay out of trouble. In his third year he failed chemistry by misidentifying silicon as a gas. Superintendent Robert E. Lee reviewed his record and tried to be lenient (as he had been in the past), but Whistler had too many demerits and had to leave. "If silicon had been a gas,” he later said, “I would have been a major general." But, as Marcus Reno noted, if he had then no-one would have known about his mother.

How good was "Custer's luck"?



Pretty darn good until the end. Custer got out of many scrapes at West Point that led to the expulsion of others. And in the Civil War he was within inches of death many times. It says something that the expression became a commonplace throughout the Army. Custer took great risks, for great rewards. But ultimately his luck ran out.

There are several reasons why one should not ask General Custer for battle advice, and in my view it relates not so much to the fact that he lost his final battle, because many great warriors lose their final batte.  The following reasons for not seeking out his advice are more important:  firstly, he graduated last in his class at West Point and his entrance into the army was expedited so that he could join the Civil War.  The next reason would be he went AWOL at least once in his career and was court martialed.  He was kicked out of the army for a year and then rejoined once the Indian Wars were in full swing.  Another reason that I would not ask him for advice is because he hated his enemies (the natives) so much that he failed to respect them for what they were . . . intelligent and resourceful humans who were only defending their land and their way of life.  The final reason relates the fact that he failed to keep firm control of his troops at the Little Big Horn.  He was woefully out numbered and needed a much better strategy that he employed.  About one third of his troops panicked and fled or fought in isolation.  He failed to take charge and take command.  History has not always been kind to George Custer and I believe that his demise was both just and expected.

What's ironic is how many people over the years have said Custer made a huge mistake dividing his forces even though it was not an uncommon strategy, Robert E. Lee as well as other Civil War generals did it.

Something tells me that the survivors of his command were glad that he divided his forces, if he hadn't they too would have been killed.

The biggest problem at Little Bighorn was that the indians were better armed due to the superior weapons they were given by the U.S. government "to be used for hunting only" while Custer and his men had to use obsolete guns that routinely jammed.

Not an expert but apart from his other failings already mentioned here, Custer, I believe, once he made a decision would not reverse his decision as he would not countenance being wrong. I seem to remember at Little Big Horn he was expecting support (from Terry?) that did not materialise due to encounters with bands of Indians, and Custer, rather than delay or reassess the situation went ahead with the attack. 
So I might take advice from him, but only if I were able to make decisions ‘on the hoof’ that might conflict with Custer’s advice.

Picnic at Hanging Rock is a novel by Australian author Joan Lindsay.



Picnic at Hanging Rock is about a trip by a party of girls from an exclusive private school, who travel to Hanging Rock in Victoria's Mount Macedon area for a picnic on St. Valentine's Day, 1900. The excursion ends in tragedy when three girls and a teacher mysteriously vanish after climbing the rock. Only one girl is ever seen again; no reason for their disappearance is ever given, and the one girl who returned had apparently fallen and hit her head, according to a doctor who examined her, and has no memory of what had happened to the others.

The novel is written in the form of a false document, implying that it is based on a true story and even begins and ends with a pseudo-historical prologue and epilogue, adding to the overall mystery-feel. However, while Hanging Rock is a real geological feature near Mt Macedon, the story is entirely fictional.

Why did Japan started their conquest only long after the European war?



I just noticed one thing. On Dec 7 194, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor and dragged the United States into the war. At the same time, it also moved down south to attack Shanghai and Canton before invading  Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. It also bombed Darwin, Australia.

However, at that very moment, Nazi Germany had already long conquered Western Europe. The Battle of Britain had already been fought and lost by the Nazis. The war was then concentrated in Africa. In fact, if I am not mistaken, Europe was in a state of lull.

Why did Japan started its conquest only nearly after one and a half years after Nazi Germany? Were they really as strong as they had seemed to be?

Japan was already at war- in China and in Korea. Korea had been conquered and so was manchuria- but they had problems in China

Japan started early. In 1905 they fought a war with Russia in order to take Manchuria( up to then a Russian colony) because it was a wedge between Japanese Korea and Japanese Manchuria/China

In reality Japan was very weak militarily. Their equipment was definetly sub-standard by European measure- even the Italian tanks (renowned for their poor armour) look impressive when compared to Japanese machines. The success of Japan early in the war was caused by the fact that while the japanese had bad tanks- the Allies had none (in the area)

The reason Japan attacked the US? One theory (and a good one) is the activity of Japanese communists led by the communist german/soviet agent Richard Sorghe. The Japanese army in China - by it's very existence- was blocking the movement of Stalin's siberian divisions. Pushing Japan into war with the US meant Stalin had a free hand and could use these divisions against Germany

very cold blooded and cynical- a typical communist move

They annexed Manchuria and carried out atrocities there.
They were probably encouraged by Nazi success in Europe and used the same aggressive tactics to satisfy their own need for raw materials for their imperial ambitions.
Apart from the British fighting in North Africa and the Mediterranean, one of the only ways they could fight the Nazis was through aerial bombardment of German Cities. so if you lived in Berlin and there was a Thousand Bomber Raid, you would not agree that there was a "lull".

Japan started its imperial conquest in the 1930's in Manchuria (Korea) and China. in 1941 noticing the weakness of European forces in colonies such as Java, Singapore, Malaysia etc) Japan extended its campaign by attacking Pearl Harbour and invading those resource rich countries.

in part this was because there was no longer any effective support for the colonies of occupied countires such as Holland & France, and Britains dire shortage of resources (men and materials). by destroying the US Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbur Japan hoped to give themselves enough time to build up a insurmountable lead and then pesuade the US to sue for peace.

and incidentally it was a world war from the very first day in 1939, just becauee America was late (again) didn't mean that it was not a World War. you may care to check on the nations that were fighting on the Allied side (effectively the British side, especailly after the collapse of France). these include: Australia, Canada, Rhodesia, South Africa, New Zealand and a host of other commonwealth nations from the Caribbean, Africa, India and the Far East.

Yes, Japan already had been at war with China, officially since 1937.  The problem was China sked for US diplomatic pressure to end the war for the very reasons you stated, the war had stalled.  Because of this Japan knew taht they needed to secure their own resources.  To do that the needed to head south but also knew that any such invasions would bring them into war with the US and Britian.  Japan knew that the US Navy was the one thing that could stop them, o that was the reason for striking Pearl Habor, destroying the US navy to allow Japan to capture the resoures.

Yes they did help. We'll never know if the war could have been won without the USA. But they sold arms to the Germans, didn't react when the Brits had to evacuate their troops from Dunkirk. They didn't come into the war until the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour. I don't believe there was any sympathy, they were just bloody annoyed about their fleet being attacked. 
As for Europe, they couldn't have given a sh"t.
Which is why some of us feel so strongly about the UK licking 'donkey' and following the USA into battle, these days.

Germany was winning the war before Japan attacked the U.S. It took a couple more years before the United States impact was felt. Germany had already overtaken France so one ally was out. From about 1939 to about 1944 Germany was the strongest nation in the war, in war terms.
The United States involvement helped to win the war for sure. If they had not entered the war the world would be under the control of the Germans.

Yes, the USA did help win the war.  It is however, answers like those I see here that makes me sad that the Japanese drew us into the war.  I think it may have been better if the rest of the world had suffered through a 20 or 30 year war before we got involved.  Maybe they we wouldn't hear the whining and crying of those we saved... those who couldn't save themselves in that relatively short war.



The Axis might have lost eventually, but it would have destroyed all of the world powers except the U.S.  The victory of the British (the French were already beaten) would have left them little more than cavemen who conquered a people who had been reduced to cavemen.  Russia would have just drawn back into Siberia and waited the whole thing out and come out of it better off than Britain.



Then, after the smoke cleared, the U.S. could have bombed Japan into submission and done whatever it wanted to do with the rest of the world.

You can think of WW2 as being two wars in one -- the Pacific War and the European War...

Throughout the 1930s, the U.S. and Japan engaged in a diplomatic war in Asia due to Japanese expansion in Asia, primarily China. In late 1941, the United States embargoed exports to Japan, including metal exports. This embargo was felt deeply in Japan, which imported much of its metal from U.S. controlled sources. As a result, Japan entered into an alliance with Germany, signed a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union and attacked the U.S. fleet in Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941. I mention this to note that these items were independent from the war in Europe.

The United States would have probably stayed out of the war in Europe had Germany not declared war on the United States on Dec. 11, 1941, three days after the U.S. declared war on Japan. Once Germany declared war on the U.S., the United States declared war on Germany.

The United States was one of two nations in WW2 to fight on two fronts, the other being Germany. The United States fought the war in the Pacific against Japan, with assistance from New Zealand and Australia, the war in Europe.

The War in the Pacific:

The war in the Pacific would not have been won without American involvement. The two major European powers in Asia, England and France, were occupied by the war in Europe. In fact, when France surrendured to Germany, Hitler made Vichy France turn over French Asian colonies, such as Indochina, to Japan. England was not able to provide troops to the Pacific campaign due to its conflict with Germany. Australia and New Zealand were not strong enough to withstand Japan alone.

Several have mentioned negatively the atomic bombs which ended the Pacific war. The Japanese defense of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, where 66,000 of the 100,000 troops on the island died, many in suicide attacks, convinced American military planners that an invasion of Japan would cost between 5 million and 10 million dead American soldiers, Japanese soldiers and Japanese civilians. Given the religious ferocity of the Japanese solider and citizen, who worshipped the emporer and considered it great glory to die in his service, the atomic bombs probably saved millions of lives by ending the war without an invasion of the Japanese home islands.



The European War:

If Hitler had not attacked the Soviet Union, but had kept his focus on defeating England, then the war would not have been won without American involvement. If Hitler would not have declared war on the U.S. on Dec. 11, 1941, there is every liklihood that he would have conquered England or forced England to sign a peace treaty to end the war.



Hitler, in my opinion, made two fatal mistakes that cost him WW2. He declared war on the two post-WW2 superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Either the United States or the Soviet Union, in conjunction with England, would have, in my opinion, won WW2. Although the Soviet Union bore the brunt of the German attack in WW2 and the brunt of pushing them back to Berlin, English and American efforts in Africa and France should not be underestimated for hastening the end of the war.

There was no sympathy. They refused to enter the war until they were openly attacked. The whole policy of isolation. 
But yes they were very very influential. by the time USA entered the war, france was taken over and a vichy government was set up. England was loosing the 'battle for britain' which was fought in the air. 
The only thing that wasnt going in germnay's favour wasthe attack on russia. stalingrad and many of those other places were complete failures. The russians would have contained them, but usa entering the war did have a massive impact.
till then they had only supplied arms and loans to their allies (completely profit motivated, not as aid), but after pearl harbour they were forced to enter the war.
The war did not end with the atomic bombs. germany was defeated by then and japan had sent peace feelers already. the bombs were used as a warning to the USSR. the americans wanted to show what they were capable of in order to stop russia's communist iron curtain take-overs. it was an 'underhand' threat to russia.

no it was not sypmathy. america didnt care that their allies were loosing. they entered only when they were openly attacked and had no choice but to retaliate.



The war might have been won without the americans because hitler had taken on a war on too many fronts and it was bound to catch upto him (failures at stalingrad and mistakes with his airforce on britain already)
but yes USA did play a vital role in the war victory.

Without a doubt, those who have said they helped with armaments befor their entry was true.
GB was in dire trouble at the beginning of the war...Dunkirk was a disaster, and the North Atlantic was a nightmare..in 1940 we were weeks from being starved into submission we were losing so much shipping, and even the Battle of Britain was won with the help of incredibly brave Polish fighter pilots.  We were determined and no doubt,in battle and on the home front brave, but there were murmurings of defeat even amongst the people on the street, surrender was looming terribly.
The attack on Pearl Harbour was the catalyst, the reports from Europe of the Nazis real intentions, and the increasing presence of the Communists was made very real to the Americans, as they held the Nazis. And I do hope that there was a very small part of that special 'ally' relationship that the politicians bang on about today.

As for the Japanese, and the atomic bombs...naturally the use of that weapon is abhorrent to me, but having listened to the testimony of those men who fought against the Japanese, soldiers who believed that death was preferable to surrender, I'm not sure how long the war would have continued...Japanese soldiers were found on Pacific islands in the 50's and 60's still manning their posts!

I think it would be unfair and churlish to claim that WWII would have been won without US support and troops. If that was the case, why did Churchill work so hard to secure US support before Pearl Harbour? Why did he never point this out to the US after the War?
As to why the US got involved, didn't they get as involved as their isolationist policies would allow them without declaring war. Pearl Harbour was probably a massive mistake on Japan's part. I think US involvement was probably a mixture of sympathy for the "plucky Brits" and allies and political desire to soothe the public's wish for revenge.
Hope that helps

Yes the USA was a major player in WW2. And no, the war would not have been winnable for the Allies without US involvement. If any of the big three: USA USSR or UK had not been involved, the war would have been won by the Axis.

The US had been providing some materiel and monetary assistance, but not enough to actually turn the tide. But once the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour the US was at war. Then a few days later Germany declared war on the US in support of her Japanese allies. This brought the US directly into the war in Europe and they joined the Allied forces. And Churchill managed to convince the US to make Germany the first priority.

There are two fallacies that are becoming common lately. The first is the the Russians would have been able to win on their own. This is simply untrue. Without the massive amounts of equipment and raw materials they received, they would not have lasted long enough to counter attack. Also, without the Western front and Italian campaign to draw off significant fighting forces they would have faced a much larger German force. The other fallacy is that the A-bombs were some kind of cowardly atrocity. The US was facing a very long and costly invasion to take Japan. Dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which were scheduled to be destroyed by conventional bombardment anyway, convinced the Japanese they could not win, and accelerated their surrender. In the end the A-bombs actually killed far few people than would have died if the war had continued for another 6-12 months. And more people died in the fire bomb raids on Tokyo, so it death toll wasn't even that high for that time in history.

The war would not have been won without U.S. involvement, the British wouldn't have lasted as long as they did against Germany had it not been for American aid.  The U.S. being involved meant that Hitler had to fight a two front war which kept him from concentrating his forces against Russia.  Some people have little knowledge of history and since America is not that popular in Europe right now they tend to reinvent history to make it seem as if England & Russia won the war and the U.S. had a small role.

The fact is that the U.S. was producing more war materials than every other nation Axis & Allies combined.  Also don't forget that had it been up to Churchill the invasion of Normandy wouldn't have happened meaning the Allies would have had no foot hold on western Europe and therefore Hitler would have been able to keep more forces in the east.  Anyone who really thinks the U.S. didn't play a big role in winning the war should ask why Churchill wanted America in it so badly.

356 BC

Alexander was born the sixth of Hecatombaeon [7], which month the Macedonians call Lous, the same day that the temple of Artemis of Ephesus was burnt [8]; which Hegesias of Magnesia makes the occasion of a conceit, frigid enough to have stopped the conflagration. The temple, he says, took fire and was burnt while its mistress was absent, assisting at the birth of Alexander. And all the Eastern soothsayers who happened to be then at Ephesus, looking upon the ruin of this temple to be the forerunner of some other calamity, ran about the town, beating their faces, and crying that this day had brought forth something that would prove fatal and destructive to all Asia.

Alexander the Great was born in 356BC in Pella the ancient capital of Macedonia. Alexander was the son of Philip II, king of Macedonia, and Olympias a princess of Epirus.
Alexander was born in the northern Greek kingdom of Macedonia in July 356 BC. His parents were Philip II, King of Macedon, and his wife Olympias. Alexander was educated by the philosopher Aristotle. Philip was assassinated in 336 BC and Alexander inherited a powerful yet volatile kingdom. He quickly dealt with his enemies at home and reasserted Macedonian power within Greece. He then set out to conquer the massive Persian Empire.

Germany which was occupying France at the time.
There were two harbours codenamed Mulberry which were built in sections in England during 1943 and 1944 and towed to France soon after the invasion.
Mulberry A was constructed in the British Sector at Arromanche and Mulberry B was constructed in the American Sector at Vierville.
On July 19 a big storm damaged both harbours , destroying the American one completely and this reduced the anmount of supplies that could be landed for the invading forces.
The remains of Mulberry A can still be seen at Arromanche.

some of the earlier answers are great, so just to add a little.
The allies (Britain and its Commonwealth, The U.S.A. and Free French, Polish Etc Etc ... ) drew up plans for an amphibious invasion of Northern Europe to enable them to defeat Nazi Germany. The overall plan had the codename "Overlord". Experience of other operations made them realise that to support a large scale operation they needed an operational port. The problem was, to capture a port you would need to land, and overpower the defenders, and ports were VERY well defended.
The ingeneous answer was to take your own port with you.
The mulberry harbours consisted of hollow concrete "Caissons" which could be towed across the channel and sunk to make breakwaters and piers for ships to dock at,  prefabricated steel pierheads, floating roadways, powered rafts for unloading ships, and breakwaters (some of which were lines of old ships, deliberately sunk) to give the rest some shelter from the waves.

The whole project was a genius of engineering, and while severe storms damaged or destroyed the harbours after only a few weeks the mulberrys enabled thousands of tons of equipment and stores to be unloaded and were a major factor in the success of the Normandy Landings and the subsequent successfull liberation of Western Europe from the Nazis

Milk, cheese, meat, cereals and some vegetables formed the main part of the Irish diet from prehistoric times up until the introduction of the potato. (Danaher, K 1992). Bread does not seem to have been eaten in large quantities, but eight types of cereals were known and distinguished by the Irish and their use varied from place to place and with one's income. Oats and barley the most common cereals were used to make a variety of breads, the seeds of which were milled in querns or hand mills. Oats, a rain tolerant cereal most suitable for the Irish climate, and barley also acted as a thickening agent in most soups and stews. Oat-meal which was much more important than wheat or bere barley as a food source was prepared in many different ways e.g. porridges, boiled in its un-ground state as a gruel or ground and boiled in fresh or sour milk, flavoured with honey and seeds, salt or herbs. Porridge was made very thick as a morning meal or almost liquid, in the liquid state it was usually eaten at night. Porridge was consumed both hot and cold (Danachair 1958).



Rye and wheat were also grown but not in large quantities; the commonest wheat bread eaten by the poor was a mixture of rye and wheat flour made into bread called Maslin which was well known throughout the Celtic world.

What backgrounds did 19th century Butlers come from?



the typical portrayal of an english butler of those times is of a refined, well spoken gentleman often more respectable than his employers.  i find it hard to believe that an educated, well-heeled man person would opt for a life in service, yet it is equally unlikely that a poor urchin would be taken on as butler.
what did their backgrounds tend to be like?

I think the stereotype of the butler as more respectable and better educated than his employer comes from the portrayal of Jeeves and Bertie Wooster from the P.G. Woodhouse stories originating in 1915 but popularised in the 1920s, not from Victorian times.  Jeeves is often thought of as a butler, but he was more of a valet and only worked as a butler sometimes, a butler was the top dog in the management of the house, the valet was the top personal servant to the person:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeeves
You may find this interesting as well, about the hierarchy and tasks of Victorian servants in general:
http://www.ourwardfamily.com/victorian_s...
I tend to agree with some of your other answers that Victorian servants worked themselves up through the ranks as it were, and were recruited from quite an early age, and that country children were preferred apparently.  I don’t think their parents would have paid out for an education for them, and that even if they had and the children failed it they would not have been fast tracked into service jobs as ‘fallen aristocrats’, there were increasing clerical jobs, and jobs in the Empire and with the right contacts a person could always get them.  P.G. Woodhouse indicates that Jeeves was pretty much self educated to gain his intellectual superiority and began his working life as a pageboy.  Remember that the mid-Victorian times onwards saw a great movement towards universal education, and that affordable and popular editions of books began to be published, so there was a movement of self-education and improvement which many servants would have picked up on regardless of their backgrounds if they had at least learned to read.

I think they started out as lower servants, and rose, with training and ability.  I don't think they ever actually talked upper-class -- but to us Americans, a lot of English accents seem upper-class!

In Britain the butler was originally a middle ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the butler gradually became the usually senior male member of a household's staff in the very grandest households there was sometimes a steward who ran the entire estate, rather than just the household, and who was senior to the butler into the nineteenth century. Butlers used to always be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the livery of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a business suit or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions.

Butlers used to work their way up from the bottom and belong to clubs in larger cities such as London, but today, tend to go to butler schools and belong to guilds such as The International Institute of Modern Butlers and The Guild of Professional English Butlers. Butlers are also found in hotels, corporate settings, yachts, and embassies, and are available as temporary service providers.

I'd guess that they would start training 'in service' when they were quite young and as another poster has already said, that they would rise up through the ranks that way.



If they worked for the same family for many years and had little social contact with people outside of the family that they worked for then their accent and speech pattern would eventually reflect the way people around them spoke.



Like Brits who live in America eventually pick up on the accent around them. Especially if they are very young when they move out there.

Other than that, many familes back then had enough money to educate their children but not quite enough for the children to not need to work so it's feasible that they could be well-spoken and yet not quite wealthy enough to own a house of their own and employ their own butlers!

Before it was the state of Texas, it was part of New Spain, then part of the United States of Texas as Coahuila y Tejas, then the Republic of Texas.

If you were from the republic of Texas, you were called a 'Texian.' (Now, just Texan.)

Yes, he was the top dog, just like Stalin was the top dog. When he assumed the throne, people feared him, and those who were in a position of authority did their best to earn his support and respect.

Hitler was a maniac, and he also had a poor work ethic when he eventually did become the Fueher. He wasn't all that intelligent, but the people who worked directly under him were very good at what they did, and that's why things lasted up until they got over their heads in WWII.

He was on his own thing. His own cousin was Jewish (he cared for him) as much as he was evil to the Jews he was also somewhat lenient towards them. (he allowed them to go to the olympics) What he wanted truly was pure German power, while he has the rep. for being harsh towards the jews it was also anyone that was of a different race then him. If he were to follow in any ones steps I think it would be Karl Marks the man that came up with the idea of communism.

Okay... others have joked but my answer is serious. Adolf Hitler was the leader of the Nazi party, which developed after he was already elected and in power. He started out with a platform of promising jobs and success (or at least financial stability) for everyone under his power, at a time when the German economy wasn't so hot and lots of people were out of jobs and out of luck. In my classes, I compare him to the powerful people in gangs (or in the mob). A gang will approach a youngster or teen who is unsure of his place in the world, with maybe a sorry home life, and with little self-esteem, and they promise him protection, power, and even money. But of course, there is a price in both situations.

If Britain and Germany had been on the same side, the US would not have joined in.  It's also likely that Germany would have satisfied itself with Poland and not gone on to attack Russia.  That would have given an alliance that lasted rather longer than the third Reich.  However, it would have collapsed in time in the same way that the Soviet Empire collapsed.

No, the Americans would do some reverse colonization on the UK!

But the UK and US had a strong alliance, which was stronger than the UK with the axis (of course)
if the UK would've went over, the US would've probably done so as well... or build 2 more bombs.

I don't think such axis could exist, since Tokyo was cut off from the other countries by China, Russia, and Middle East. Japanese was already losing the war in china and south east Asia before the atomic blast since they spread their troops too thin over a large geographic area. It's like watch a snake try to swallow an elephant. Besides, United States would never allow England to join with Germany.

if you think that the people of Britain would have countenanced being a party to murder mayhem and the extermination of a whole race that was visited on the world in the late thirties by a raving maniac. you are living in a dream world , the people were a different breed from the people today they were strong independent and incredible fair minded . To kick a man when he was down was considered a dreadful crime and nobody would have even given it a second thought if they wished to have many friends left. To stand by while the dreadful crimes and murders  were going on around them would have been alien to there very way of life . True there were the black shirts and some aristocrats that favoured the Nazi's but they were looked on by the rest of the population as scum and were often stoned and jeered in the streets that's before the war started.

It would never have happened - just because Hitler offered troops - SFW, the British people had shown their revulsion of fascism in Cable Street, Olympia and other places where the British Union of Fascists met.  The BUF had shrunk to the status of extreme minority party by 1935.
The Americans had a much longer and more indepth discussion with Nazism that the British - the Deutscher Bund and the American Nazi Party were making real inroads into American politics before the start of the war - now that axis, Japan, Germany USA and Italy would have been almost unstoppable.

This is obviously a reference to the British administration of Iraq after WW1.
Iraq was formed from territories of the old Ottoman empire in 1920 by the British who had a mandate from the League of Nations to administer the new state.
They put in place a puppet government under King Feisal and the borders of the new state were decided by civil servants in London who had no knowledge of the area which is why so many mutually hostile groups were forced to live under one government.
Some of these people revolted against the new government and the R.A.F. bombed the villages of anybody who caused trouble.
Gas could well have been used as it was not a prohibited weapon in those days.

I can find no reference to any gas attacks on the Kurds in the early 1920s.
Kurdistan, comprising parts of present day Syria, Iraq and Turkey came into being at the Treaty of  Sèvres in 1920. At the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 Kurdistan was divided between those countries and ceased to exist.

For me, it'd have to be Helen Keller. I can't think of a single woman who had more far reaching influence simply by being herself. In a time when women rarely went to college, she graduated Radcliffe Magna *** Laude, with a Bachelors of Arts, the first deafblind person ever to have  done so...quite an impressive accomplishment for a girl who was considered defective, wouldn't you say?
Aside of her awards, which were numerous and spanned the world, she was, most of all, instrumental in changing the attitudes and erasing the misconceptions, of an entire society about deaf/blind people. 
Mme. Curie was astonishing also.

Unquestionably Queen Elizabeth 1st.
She became queen despite being declared illegitimate, imprisoned by Mary queen of Scots and her brother, Edward VI, cutting her out of the succession.
She refused to take the advice of her advisors when she thought them wrong. They thought they’d control her!
She stood up to Catholic Europe (and won) while being as accommodating as she could to Catholics here. 
She took England from being a little island off the coast of France to a world power. (Something even her father Henry VIII never achieved.) 
She renounced her own happiness as a woman to concentrate on being a Queen. (Though there is some argument to suggest a broken heart left her cold and this is what drove her.)
Finally, it has been suggested that in many ways she was superior to her father, Henry. Though he undoubtedly loved England, he used his position for personal ends whereas Elizabeth’s whole being was for the glory of England.

Elenor of Aquitaine, Catherine de Medici, Elizabeth I (Elizabeth had to use great political skills to maintain and expand her power, others tended to have a strong power base to begin with). The Dowager Empress of China was powerful, but during her time China lost a lot of power. Jiang Qing, Mao's last wife, probably held the fate of more people in her hands than any other woman. Indira Ghandi and Golda Meir were also highly influential.

And according to Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton.

Is it history repeating itself first georgia and now Poland?



is russia going to forget the lessons of  67 years ago, when germany allowed Hitler to take them to war with all the consequences of such a futile and stupid action. germany attacked poland and occupied that country,and took us into WW2. and now a russian general has threatend poland with a nuclear strike, if they allow the U.S.. to position a nuclear shield on its soil, does'nt Putin realise such an action in peacetime could only result in full blown nuclear war, and please dont remind me Putin isn't president any more, because he's pulling the strings for the so called russian president elect,, whoever he is.

Its sort of a rule of time, or whatever you prefer to call it.
The purpose of teaching history in school is so that it isn't repeated.
That solution doesn't seem to be too dependable.
History will always repeat itself.
So i think the answer to your question is yes.
That's the problem, people dont seem to get that through their thick skulls that when you repeat things that happen in the past, you only get the same results as before.
You cant do things almost exactly the same .. and expect a new out come, i mean think about it.
There will always be those people that you just want to personally insult and knock some sense into, but unfortunately you cant.
But i had fun writing about this.
Lol, Hope i could help you..

No , it's a different situation.
America's excuse for putting their missiles on Polish territory is that they would provide defence from an attack by rogue nations such as Iran which is clearly a lie as a attack by Iran would have to cross Russian and Ukranian territory first.
If your neighbour puts up impregnable defences on your border you are at risk if he chooses to attack you.,
Don't forget that the USA has already invaded one country on the border of Russia, Afghanistan.
It can hardly criticise Russia for doing the same.

The actions of Russia follow its attempts to regain his hegemony over neighboring states it had during the existence of the USSR.  There is not a lot that can be done about it although the verbal threats one military officer made against Poland is probably going to be more common in the future.  Poland is taking a calculated risk but it knows that if it caves to Russia, it is only a matter of time before there are Russian troops on its soil as Georgia is experiencing.

Russia is being the traditional bully it has been even in the Czarist days.  They are not very suave when it comes to diplomacy jumping too quickly to military "solutions".  What we have to do is to get them preoccupied with other problems.  Internal disputes and such.  Ideally Russia needs to be split into two countries to trim their innate aggressiveness, with Siberia being a separate country as a Pacific and Arctic Ocean nation.

You are correct that Putin is in charge and what we now have in Russia is a virtual democracy.  If you want to explore the failure of democracy in Russia you might want to read "Democracy Derailed in Russia" by M. Steven Fish, who is at UC Berkeley, published in 2005.

No - you have made some baseless accusations.  Russia did not attack Georgia, it was the other way round.  Russia is economically strong, and in much better political shape than it has been for a long time.  And in no way does it resemble Nazi Germany.
If the US decides to threaten Russia by placing nuclear missiles on its doorstep - then why shouldn't Russia get very annoyed about it - how would the US react if the Russians placed missiles on Cuba?



Russia is concerned that the US is expanding into areas that are traditionality its backyard - the US has troops in Uzbekistan, Georgia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan and has held exercises with Ukraine and the Baltic republics - no wonder the Russians are worried.

I hate the sound of sabre rattling no matter who does it, and the only people who like it are the bastards who make the guns for other men's kids to carry into battle.Aircraft, helicopters, tanks and guns last for years unless they are used up, and there is no profit in that. Anyway, its only poor mens kids that get killed and crippled, and who the hell cares about them if there is money to be made?

The United Kingdom was on its death throes before the US and USSR entered the war. However, they would've held off for a couple more years (the German failure at the Battle of Britain indirectly led to their invasion of Russia)

They did play an important role as a supply route and a base to launch invasions of continental Europe.

But concerning the overall European front, the United States and the Soviet Union did most of the work against the Germans and Italians.



@JPA
"MCL - The UK was not in its death throes - where did you get that idea from? We were fighting in N. Africa with some distinction, our Navy was still keeping the Germans at bay..."

I said that because Britain really could not mount an effective resistance against Germany. Yes, they had troops and ships fighting elsewhere, but much of their equipment came from the US in the lend-lease policy. They would've ran out of equipment, money, supplies, etc if it wasn't for the lend-lease policy.

If the US did not join the war, Hitler would've mounted another air battle over Britain after their initial failure at the Battle of Britain. With air superiority after destroying the RAF, he would've commenced the land invasion of Britain, and would've easily conquered the island.



@Mike
"The German Navy was paultry at best and the British could have held them off easily. You cannot cross the channel with a large army in river barges."

I'm not talking about an invasion by ship. Germany wanted air supremacy over the UK so they could fly bombers and land paratroopers over the island. Germany was well known for using massive fleets of para-gliders/hang-gliders and had even designed massive 'super gliders' specifically for the invasion of Britain.



Remember, the question is: "Would great britain have won world war 2 without the US and USSR."

If Britain was alone against Germany, then they would've lost for sure.

it would have been a much longer war for a start, and Britain would have been a lone free state in Europe.  Britain could not have won on there own, they are too small,  but then the Americans could not have done it on there own either, they needed a launch area, which of course was southern England. The USSR had no choice but to join the war as Germany invaded.  they could have done the Job that the USA did, but the Iron  Curtain would have been a lot further west.  Of course it wasn't just Britian, USA and USSR, there was also Australia New Zealand, Canada, and most of the other commonwealth countries

Much as I'd like to say that we could have won without Soviet, US, French, Empire, Polish, Czech and many others help the fact of the matter is that without the invasion of the Soviet Union by Germany in Summer 1941 all of Hitler's attention would have been focused on the Channel.
The best case scenario would be for the Navy and Air Force to keep the invasion at bay, and to sue for a peace which left us our Empire.

The truth is that without any one of the allies the war would have been lost.
Put extremely simply:
UK vital staging post for the Invasion of Europe
US - food, men and materiel
France (& other allies from occupied Europe) men
Empire men, food and materiel
USSR soaked up the Nazi invasion and pushed them back to Berlin.

MCL - The UK was not in its death throes - where did you get that idea from?  We were fighting in N. Africa with some distinction, our Navy was still keeping the Germans at bay, and we were begining to get the better of the U-boat menace and were nowhere near capitulation.

Hitler had a real opportunity to knock Britain out of the war in 1940-1. Just a fraction of the forces he deployed against the USSR would almost certainly been sufficient to seize Egypt and the Suez Canal.

With the loss of the Canal, Britain already tenuous connections with its Asian and African possessions would be basically severed. That loss of resources, as well as the new German threat to its Middle Eastern oil fields, would probably have forced Britain to sue for peace.

A fact, compare the size of Britain to the US and USSR, actually it was Russia then, and ask how Britain managed to keep Hitler out as long as they did. The US loaned, yes loaned Britain the money to sustain the war effort, only when they thought their loan was jeopardised did they feel the need to get involved. Actually, I have had enough of defending this issue, it was not about war and who could defeat whom it was about money and world domination as any look at political history will teach you. 
At the end of the day we stood alone for three years against the greatest threat posed to mankind.at that time. We all know what Russia did in the aftermath, and we know what the US did, trouble is the US has never forgiven us for not supporting them in Vietnam. 
You have only recently tasted what terrorism means on your own shores, we Brits have lived with that since 1914, including the IRA which was mainly funded by your countrymen. 
Who do I think is right? Neither, because war and killing is an abomination, it is engineered by politicians and the "elite" who have their own agenda and to whom lives lost mean nothing.

There was no single country that brought about the downfall of Nazi Germany as it was a combined effort.

However, if Britain had not stood up to the tyranny of Hitler and his thugs and had accepted the sharing of Europe and kept it's own Empire (as was offered by Hitler who did not wish to fight Britain, admiring them and regarding the English as historical allies against the French) then the chances are that Germany would be the dominant superpower today. After all, it would have retained the scientists that would have created nuclear weapons rather than them being recruited by the US.
It was the supreme effort displayed by Britain on it's own in preventing an invasion of it's shores that forced the Nazi's into an early invasion of the USSR and thus into a war on two fronts. All done without any aid from the US as this took place even before the Lend Lease Act of 1941. Therefore it could be argued that without Britain, there would have been nowhere and no chance for the US to get involved which may have resulted in it being left sitting nervously waiting to see if Germany would use this new creation of it's scientists.

There could be no senario without the Soviet Union, because Hitler had it in his mind to invade the whole time (depending on who you read, Stalin was in no shape to start a war as he purged his military leadership in the 1930's and was pretty much embarrassed by Finland).



The Germans had no chance to cross the Channel as they did not have the amphibious troop carriers the United States built for D-Day...they were using river barges in practice which would have capsized in the Channel, killing many that would have crossed.  Britain might have suffered a slow starvation if there were no US supplies comming their way.  They would not have received help from the Commonwealth countries as Australia and New Zealand were cut off by the Japanese.



At the very least, Great Britain needed US supplies and the Soviet Union using up German soldiers.  They did not have the agricultural or industrial capacity to win the war alone.  Also without the second front in France (which Britain in no way could have started alone), the Soviet Union would have capitulated.



Your cousin does have one point though...Roosevelt wanted to invade Northern Europe as early as 1942, and Churchill had to remind him how green the Americans were in N. Africa (Kasserine Pass).  Without Churchill, the war would have been lost no matter who was in it.



M.C.L. - Germany would have never invaded GB because they did not possess the means.  The German Navy was paultry at best and the British could have held them off easily.  You cannot cross the channel with a large army in river barges.

A good friend of mine who is majoring in History with a concentration on Russian history put it succintly "When discussing World War II, we have to realize that it was primarily a Soviet-Nazi war, with the rest of the allies having a secondary role."

Hitler had 30 divisions of men deployed on the Western Front, and over 300 divisions deployed on the Eastern Front. To put that in perspective, when the joint U.S/U.K/Canadian forces invaded Normandy, Hitler initially thought it was a feignt, not believing that such a small force could be the vanguard of the Western allies. The western front could be best compared to a rear-guard action by the Nazis, as the significant majority of German soldiers were desperately trying to staunch the Soviet advance.



The bulk of the fighting was done by the endless supplies of Soviet manpower backed up by the economic prowess of the United States. There's no way that Britain would have been able to repell that kind of manpower by itself, certainly not without American support, and certainly without the support of its empire,which would have been cut off had the Nazis focused their efforts on Africa, which would have certainly buckled.



The Western Front was more of a desperate grab to liberate as much of Europe as possible before the Soviets steamrolled over the Nazis and declared all of Europe a Soviet Satellite.



All you have to do is throw the numbers at him. We were fighting such a small portion of the overall German military, that if we had to face the full fury of the German war machine, there would have been little hope for survival, much less victory.

As far as the invasion of Britain, It would have been a tremendous undertaking, but the plain truth is that with the full fury of the war machine of Germany aimed at the island, the Luftwaffe would have had a much greater superiority, and easily could have won the Battle of Britain. If that had happened, Britian would have been simply bombed into starvation and submission.

I think u cuz is pullin u chain!  GB was up a Creek without US intervention.  Mostly those Limeys were reliant on others for resources and we were their best supplier.  Even before we officially entered the war we were a huge aid manufacturing what they needed to survive against the Nazis.  But of course that is all looking at through the pried of man.  In actuality God was in total control of every thing.  Ultimately His concern is  not who rules which country but rather keeping mankind fully aware of their vulnerabilty and spiritual depravity.  It is, has been, and will be right up to the last day God's objective to spread the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ throughout the world for the purpose of saving each person he originally planned to.  When that is done then Christ will rapture His people (Some are ADAMENT that will occur in May 2011! A HUGE worldwide earth quake with every corpse and all the remains of ALL the unsaved  dead since man began thrown out of the graves and tombs or wherever they may be and then



the remaining live inhabitants will have all those rotten and roting corpses to deal with for the remaining 5 1/2 months of the earth's existence,  During these final months there will be unspeakable anguish as God shames the majority of the people (approximately 97% of the 6.5 BILLION people will remain unsaved after May 2011) as the unsaved are judged and destroyed.  The most bewildered and wretched will be all those church goers that THOUGHT they had got themselves saved through the ministry of their churches but they will find out they have been duped into worshipping Satan when they THOUGHT they were right with God.  The take home message today is that there is still time to plead with God for mercy and to search the Scriptures for Truth rather than getting the watered down adulterated bunch of lies that churches everywhere have for you.  Forget about the wars and the past wars of men vs men and focus on spiritual warfare.  Will you make the Satanic led world and or  the church your  Allies against God???  Or will you realize that hopeless position and cry out to the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, looking to the Bible ALONE and in it's entirety as the ONLY 100% true and trustworthy source of truth.

Sean C, you have absolutely no idea at all what you are talking about!

Britain was the only country in Europe, apart from neutral Switzerland, to not have germans on their soil because they fought back.  The Americans were well less than half of the D-Day forces, it was mostly British, Canadians, Australians making up more that 65% of the landing forces.

Would Britain have fallen without the US eventually entering the war?  Hard to say, but it would not have been pretty.

Britain had the world's best navy and had one great victories in North Africa before the US came along.  The German Kreigsmarine was nowhere near equal to the Royal Navy.

In the end, Germany would still have lost because of Russia, though the war would have been protracted.  I still have my doubts that Britain would have fallen anyway.

Probably not but the USA and Soviet Union did not enter the war on the British side , Germany declared war on both of them so they had no choice.
Otherwise the USA would have been happy to continue trading with both sides
Of all the Allies the USA was the last to enter and most of the hard fighting had been done by then, their contribution was mainly material

Britain would've probably win the battle of Britain without the help of the US or the USSR. But they would never ever win the war with out the US or the USSR. At the same time if it wasn't for Britain things would've been a lot harder for the US.

The British managed to win the Battle of Britain - which was an attempt by the Nazis to invade the Island of Britain.  Their first course of action being to knock out the Royal Air Force and gain control of UK air space.



The Nazis failed and lost the Battle of Britain.

Okay thus far?

So, by 1941, UK was alone, but thus far un-invaded and building up it's forces rapidly.

Let me try and explain a little about UK.  UK does not have a very large army and never did have.  However, what UK does have is an enormous fleet of warships.  Even today it remains the world's second largest navy.

By 1940 the Royal Navy were already destroying the German pocket battle ship fleet at sea.

Graff Spee - German Pocket Battle ship.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XTr4tkJD...

So, to do a quick summing up.  The British alone could not have defeated the Nazis.  This was made possibly due to the fact that Germany declared war on both the Soviet Union and USA.

So, you tell you cousin that the combined might of the Allies, lead by the USA, finally destroyed the Nazis and it could not have been done by UK alone.

Anyone who tells you different, does not know what they are talking about.  The Britain stands alone plan was to invade France in c1949 - can you imagine?  But, because the Americans were in the European war from c1942 [January of that year approx] the invasion of Europe became possible as early as 1944 - five years ahead of the original Britain alone plan.

Here's some very interesting footage from the city of Paris 1944 the French Resistance [Armee Secret] taking over the city and beating the German Garrison [note that it was US soldiers who fought alongside the Resistance in Paris and no other army].

Paris 1944
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oawZEYXIC...

There's a lot more I know about WW2 - I was born in 1941, my dad fought in the War.  I also knew a leading member of the French Resistance who for reasons of personal safety lived in England in the 1950s - he died in the 1980s but was an excellent source of info.

Colonel Rol [Armee Secret] took the surrender of the German Garrison of Paris three [3] hours before Charles Degaulle entered the city.  He was furious but nothing he could do.  Degaulle insisted that the surrendered be re-enacted including him taking it etc.  It's a lie.  The Armee Secret together with American GIs liberated Paris.

We will remember them.

Have you ever heard of "Google?" If not, it's an AMAZING resource, fully capable of directing you to hundreds, thousands, maybe even hundreds of thousands or MILLIONS of relevant sites to help you with your homework/research.

If you don't already have a Google search box, here's what to do: type 'Google' (without the 'single-quote' marks) in a Yahoo search box. When you get the results from the new pages that show up, click on Google and then type a question like ' famous London



architecture' and you should get results for zillions of entries like Big Ben or Parliament or The Albert and Victoria Museum, etc. Pick one of those and undoubtedly one of the many sites that subsequently show up will be Wikipedia. "Wiki's" articles are usually in-depth and should have more than enough (= more than 250) words for you to compose an intelligent essay.

Use 'Google' often; the more you use it, the more you'll appreciate its breadth and depth of informational resources. And your teachers and parents will think you're a genius.

Oh look: by the time I finish this, I will have typed about 250 words, telling YOU how to get 250 words for a homework assignment which YOU are supposed to be doing, not some faceless stranger on YA (no disrespect intended toward people without faces). 
I don't do homework any more. I'm smarter than that. Ha ha. No, actually, I've been out of school for many years. And I sure wish that Google and Wikipedia had existed when I was in school .. but PCs hadn't been invented then either, so it's a moot point.

Good Luck in your Googling so that you can do your own homework.

In my opinion the worst invention ever conceived/created would probably be a skirt designed by Japanese 'artist' Aya Tsukioka; the invention itself is a skirt that can be pulled up over ones' body to disguise the wearer as a vending machine. For a start, off the top of my head I cannot think for one moment where the need to disguise yourself as a vending machine would arise. As if a vending machine wasn't conspicuous enough, your feet are clearly visible beneath the skirt.

I started work in 1978 and earned £27 a week which was considered to be a pretty good wage for a college leaver, but I'd studied to be a legal secretary so was in demand at the time.  So it would seem that the 1930s would have been considerably less than that.

I also know that my father who had a highly skilled job as a crop inspector when he married my mum back in 1954 took on a £200 mortgage to have a bungalow built and apparently he was terrified at the time that he wouldn't be able to pay it back each month!

From Googling 'average wage 1930s' it seems that it would have been somewhere around £1-£2.

A 1931 UK survey found 10.6 per cent of workers earned £3.5s per week or more (Ref 1) but this was in London where average wages were higher than the rest of the UK The largest category of workers shown in the schedules were labourers earning £2.18s.9p per week 
(ibid) - remember this was a wage when a worker was in work. A lot of workers would experience sporadic, or even extended periods of unemployment. - At its peak 20% of workers in northern Britain were jobless and had to rely on Unemployment benefits payable for 26 weeks @ 17/-.  (Seventeen shillings) Then ‘Transitional relief’ provided by Public Assistance Committees takes over with means tested benifit. Own a anything more than the clothes (rags often) you standn up in? the means test man will expect you to sell it before he hands over your pittance. During the 1930s the government -cut- these benifits  (Ref 3) by 1932, 35% of miners were unemployed, as were 31% of textile workers, 48% of steelworkers and 62% shipbuilding workers. (ref 4)



The average U.S.salary in the 1930s was $1,368/year (Ref 2) the ref also gives some prices of food in the USA at this time

Why do USA Americans refer to the mid to late 19th Century as 'Victorian' ...?



... when in living memory in that period they had fought several wars to escape from the British empire?



</question>



<additional details>



Thanks for all the answers so far - some very good ones.
I now think I was trying to combine two questions into one.

Firstly why doesn't the English speaking world talk of the Lincolnian or Kennedean eras?

Secondly, as a catch-all term, do most people consider it to cover late Georgian and Edwardian?

Just as a side thought - when the Prince of Wales succeeds, will it be a Carolean or a Caroline age?



In reply to Felicity O, my additional question was only asked because people do seem rather frequently to describe both Jane Austen and Thomas Hardy as 'Victorian' novelists.



LOOK, I MARRIED THE BLOODY WOMAN ON STAGE, I KNOW THE DATES OF HER REIGN, THAT ISN'T THE QUESTION.



I'm sorry, I had just had a flurry of emails telling me things I already knew. The above comment still stands, but I shouldn't have shouted it.

Probably because UK was still the most powerful country in the world during Victorian times.  Calling them 'Victorian' does not make a judgement over whether this was good or bad; it's just describing reality as it is.

The Americans have never in history been anti British.They were anti having to pay taxes to pay for public services,that's why they went to war.No taxes levied and there was no clamour for independence.The term Victorian is used by all the English speaking world as this was the greatest building boom ever and it was in queen vic's reign.Most of the builders had origins in the UK also in that century.They didn't want to escape the british empire.When they were meeting to formulate a constitution they was strong backing to have the british monarch head of state (with less powers than in the uk) in the end it was decided the monarch would not accept and voted to have a president instead,as this was the next nearest thing to having a monarch.This is why the American president  has more power than any other president in other countries as it was modelled on british monarchical rule at that time

In the English speaking world, the term Victorian, refers to a given period in history.

First thing to bear in mind is that immediately after the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 the Brits turned their total attention to winning the Napoleonic Wars which culminated in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 [1815-2015 by the way - date for the diary].

The other thing is that the British very quickly formed a new relationship with the new United States of America.

The Brits have a saying that nothing, not even a war, must be allowed to get in the way of free trade.

The Victorian age from the mid-19thC was the height of the Industrial Revolution, in which both the UK and USA were deeply involved.

You will be absolutely gob-smacked when you start digging into real time American culture - take a look at these sites below:



The Victorian Society of America
http://www.victoriansociety.org/

Victorian Age USA
http://www.archaeolink.com/victorian_age...

High Victorian Gothic in America
http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/fnart/f...

The Americans have preserved much in their culture which is quintessencially British - including painted shop fronts, most of which have simply been allowed to disappear here in UK but which are lovingly restored and preserved in the States.

Also masses of 18th and 19th centuries music is also kept alive and well and living in the USA.

As Winston Churchill once said, "we are two great nations separated by a common language".

. . .and, for the Americans, here's how to speak English properly.

They wouldn't like to call it 'the Civil War era.'
Victorian describes the period when Queen Victoria reigned. 1837 to 1901. Nothing to do with Georgian or Edwardian.

This site explains about the circumstances..however it still remains that in these days, it was impossible without the forensic science capabilities we have today, that any true conclusion could be made, and the evidence did support at that time, that J Hanratty did commit the crime, but we will never really know.

Nobody saw Hanrattys face,so his execution was dodgy.Though I agree with Capital punishment,this case highlights why our legal system needs overhauling.
See also the Christie/Evans case,though Evans was probably guilty of killing his child.

In them days many cars had different gear positions it could well have been an unfamiliar gearbox to him so it did not signify much at that time.  EXAMPLE many were three speed boxes , some had reverse  were most first gears are now some the reverse was press down and and over to the right and forward. and some were completly the oppersite , on four speed boxes the reverse could be in five differant places , although the forward gears were nearly always as todays cars. add to that it was proved he was in the car and the fact was they were badly injured

You know how it is, the politicians get letters from the people demanding something be done about this terrible murder etc.  The politicians then put the pressure on the fuzz to find the person 'what dunnit'.  So, there's a handy bloke whom they know of, [a Barry George if you like] who fits the bill and half the description.  Hanratty guilty etc.



Imagine if we still had the death penalty today.  Barry George would now be dead and no one in authority would give a damn.

Nothing much has changed, because when the guilty verdict against Barry George was over turned on appeal, what did the fuzz say, "that's a shame".

Shame is that they banged up a bloke on a trumped up charge.

What's gonna happen?

George will probably be compensated.  And guess who pays for that?  Yes, me the taxpayer.

Personally I think the money should come from the police officers involved in this miscarriage of justice and take it from their pension funds or salaries etc.

DNA was recently removed from his body and proved conclusively that hanratty was guilty.  He was identified as the killer by Valery Story who gave a very detailed and accurate description of H weeks before he was idd  and arrested as the main suspect, a cartridge case fr the murder weapon was found in hotel room where he spent the night , he changed his alibi half way thru the trial etc etc.  The evidence was conclusive at the time but the professional conscience wankers of the time were/ are determined to work up a miscarriage of justice scenario

b) escaped every rathole in the world
c) captured overseas, brought here and enslaved by (a) or (b)
d) driven off their land and subjugated by (a) or (b)

Fax4voice3 sums it up quite well.
I can account for Irish, English, Scot, and German - and there is a question about a sailor aboard the ship that brought my Great-grandmother here from Bremerhaven. We think that was the family's story to avoid acknowledging a bastard, but who really knows? She's dead and never admitted anything to anyone. Guess old Otto just appeared one day - but she was kicked out of her father's house in Berlin and little Otto appeared three (3) months after her arrival here.
I am PRIMARILY Scots/Irish and German.
Who cares?
Other than the D.A.R. of course...those ancestors were Irishmen who had previously been forced out of Scotland by the English. Gee - I wonder why they fought the British in the Revolution?

That's true. In American history there is a very large emphasis on the English colonies, and little time spent on learning about Native Americans, the kingdom of Hawaii, or the French, Spanish, or Russian colonies.



People seem to have missed the point of the question because it has nothing to do with ancestry.

Honestly? I really hope you're asking this because you're not American. This is like... basic knowledge. The name, at least.



This is copied directly from the whitehouse website:
 Born in 1732 into a Virginia planter family, he learned the morals, manners, and body of knowledge requisite for an 18th century Virginia gentleman.



Born: February 22, 1732 in Westmoreland County, Virginia

And, by the way: It's George Washington.



His reign was from 1789-1797.



I hope that this has helped!

He wore a normal felt hat of the time for casual/work/"everyday" wear.  The "coonskin" or other fur hat was a winter item.  There is one source that suggests that he wore the coonskin hat more often after actors on stage started portraying him with it.

He wore a floppy felt hat when on normal business about town or in the country.  He wore a hard felt hat (top hat) for formal functions in Congress, although in the 1830s this style had not evolved to the silk hat style of the Civil War period.

There is only one mention of his wearing a hat made from the pelt of a raccoon, complete with tail, and no one believed it at the time.  However, since then, actors and poets have referred to the raccoon hat as if were his brand.

Incidentally, he was known as David Crockett in his lifetime; not Davy.  He was a very proper 19th century gentleman and would have been highly offended by such a familiarity.

The Chinese show their pride in Han accomplishments by calling themselves the Han people. Philosophies and institutions that began in the Chou and Ch'in periods reached maturity under the Han. During Han times, the Chinese distinguished themselves in making scientific discoveries, many of which were not known to Westerners until centuries later. The Chinese were most advanced in astronomy. They invented sundials and water clocks, divided the day equally into ten and then into 12 periods, devised the lunar calendar that continued to be used until 1912, and recorded sunspots regularly. In mathematics, the Chinese were the first to use the place value system, whereby the value of a component of a number is indicated by its placement. Other innovations were of a more practical nature: wheelbarrows, locks to control water levels in streams and canals, and compasses.



The Han Chinese were especially distinguished in the field of art and the historical writing that began in the Han period. In addition the Confucianism that the Han Dynasty restored differed from the original teachings of Confucius. The leading Han philosophers, Tung Chung-shu and others, used principles derived from the early Chinese philosophy of nature to interpret the ancient texts. The Chinese philosophy of nature explained the workings of the universe by the alternating forces of yin and yang—dark and light—and the five elements: earth, wood, metal, fire, and water. The Han period was marked by a broad eclecticism. Many Han emperors favored Taoism, especially the Taoist idea of immortality.

Manchuria has long been a meeting ground for different peoples and a point of conflict for different national interests. Historically Manchuria was the setting for different nomadic peoples related to those groups who migrated back and forth from Central Asia to the Pacific, though archaeological evidence suggests that the closest association was with early Chinese groups.Manchuria, usually regarded as outside the pale of Chinese civilization, was attractive to Chinese settlers from the densely populated North China Plain who were seeking new farmland. Manchuria's fertile southern Liao Plain was largely unsettled. As early as Han times (about the beginning of the Christian Era in the West) Chinese pioneers began immigrating into southern Manchuria, but they were vigorously opposed by local tribes. These tribes were composed of both indigenous Manchurian groups who inhabited the forests and plains and Mongolian nomadic pastoral tribes who occupied the grasslands of the west. The centuries following the decline of the Han Dynasty represented a lessening of Chinese influence and the ascendancy of Mongol (Tunghu) power. Over the next 1,000 years power and influence ebbed and flowed between Chinese and tribal groups, but there was always close contact between the two. When the tribal groups were strong, they tended to locate their capital and power centers near the Chinese. In this way they began to absorb elements of Chinese culture and influence that were generally held to be more advanced than those of the various tribes



Your second question what is the difference between the Mongol and the Manchu?



The Mongols were the first of the northern barbarians to rule all of China. After creating an empire that stretched across the Eurasian continent and occupying northern China and Korea in the first half of the 13th century, the Mongols continued their assault on the Southern Sung. By 1276 the Southern Sung capital of Hangzhou had fallen, and in 1279 the last of the Sung loyalists perished. Before this, Kublai Khan, the fifth “great khan” and grandson of Genghis Khan, had moved the Mongol capital from Karakorum to Peking. In 1271 he declared himself emperor of China and named the dynasty Yüan, meaning “beginning,” to signify that this was the beginning of a long era of Mongol rule. 
In Asia, Kublai Khan continued his grandfather's dream of world conquest. Two unsuccessful naval expeditions were launched against Japan in 1274 and 1281. Four land expeditions were sent against Annam and five against Burma. However, the Mongol conquests overseas and in Southeast Asia were neither spectacular nor were they long enduring.



Mongol rule in China lasted less than a century. The Mongols became the most hated of the barbarian rulers because they did not allow the Chinese ruling class to govern. Instead, they gave the task of governing to foreigners. Distrusting the Chinese, the Mongol rulers placed the southern Chinese at the lowest level of the four classes they created. The extent of this distrust was reflected in their provincial administration. As conquerors, they followed the Ch'in example and made the provincial governments into direct extensions of the central chancellery. This practice was continued by succeeding dynasties, resulting in a further concentration of power in the central imperial government.



Like the Mongols in the 13th century, the Manchus (formerly the Juchen) were barbarians who succeeded in ruling the whole of China, but, unlike the 13th-century conquerers, the sinicized Manchus made their rule more acceptable to the Chinese. As a result, Ch'ing rule lasted 267 years, compared with 89 years for the Yüan. Ch'ing was the last imperial ruling house of China. During its reign most Chinese literature tended to be old-fashioned and imitative; genuine creativity was rare. Toward the end of the period, however, China had its first extensive contacts with European powers, and ideas from the West began to filter into the literature through translations of novels and other books.

I have a Russian badge dating from 1982. It is a dark blue portrait rectangle with gold edging. At the top it says: VI.CS in gold The next line reads: Konference. Then there is an enblem made up of a wreath of golden leaves with a red five-pointed star at the bottom and the letters PS on top of the letters VB inside it. At the bottom it reads NOVY JICIN 1982 in Gold. This badge is definitely genuine, but what is it? If you can tell me more about it or translate it, please help.

The badge should not be Russian but Czech: Nový Jičín (German: Neutitschein) is a town in the Moravian-Slesian Region of the Czech Republic close to the Carpathian Mountains. It has 26,500 inhabitants.



VI should be 6th in Latin numbers and CS is probably a short way for Czekoslovakia (Československo) as was the name of the country before 1990.
PSVB and the emblem where those of the Public Security auxiliary services in Czekoslovakia, or  Pomocné Stráže Veřejné Bezpečnosti a mainly politic police.
So it should be the 6th Československo Public security conference in that town

Generally, the Victorian Era began when Queen Victoria took over, in 1837; the period is generally considered to have ended in 1901. Scholars in certain fields might say the period started about 5 years earlier, and some might also say the period ended a few years earlier - but these are specific areas of study. The general date of the Victorian Era is 1837-1901, so its people would have lived anywhere between 107-171 years ago, depending on which part of the period they were alive during.

Economics can be used to explain much in history, because 
it focuses on two important drives, human 'greed' and 'need.'

'Greed' is one of the most sincere human emotions.  People can lie about certain values (eg., I love you), but when they admit 'greed' it is very clear they are telling the truth.  Also, 'greed' is very hard to deny.
'Need' is another sincere human emotion - The need to survive is clear for everyone.

In short, economics explains much of history, because it accounts for two undeniable human drives.

I like the answer from "NazF" above.
An added note is that economic factors have been key in the history of warfare. Wars have often been fought with the hope of economic gain - though modern warfare has become far more expensive than economic gains can usually justify.  [Examples being WWI and WWII especially.]

Clearly, history shows that strong economies allow more extensive military build ups and consequently greater ability to project military power over other people in the world.  The British predominance of the latter 1800's until WWI was based on the economic ability to afford a huge and powerful navy.  The military power of the USA from WWII to the present has been based on economic power - having the money to spend on advances in armament technology.  For example, the development of the atomic bomb in the 1940's cost ~ $2 billion dollars at a time when that was a great deal of money.

Much of human history can be related to man's greed for possessions and his willingness to kill others to get them - land, food resources, precious metals, and now - - oil.

Because those monkeys decided to stay in the jungle. (They evolved to the enviroment of the jungle, and monkey is better than human in the jungle)

Our ancestors however, went to the plains to hunt and explore, and so we evolved to the plains, where we had to stand up to see, and to walk the great distances.

We are still monkeys. When unhappy apes behave badly, because of the actions of governmens we call them criminals and terrorists and pay the police to oppress them. The reason we can answer what the meaning of life is because there isn't one. The only meaning s to servive, overcome and advance as a result of trouble. We can only advance from the trouble caused by our governments. We are a product of the earth and drivern by nature to do this. We are dumb and perpetual at best. We learn our behaviour and perpetually, accentuate it by doing onto others as was done onto us. We have no choice at all.
Nature is our father.

This is a simplification of the evolutionary process, and when people say it, it tends to illustrate their lack of understanding of the theory.

People DID NOT evolve from monkeys.  People AND monkeys evolved from a common ancestor, but took divergent evolutionary paths some several million years ago.  Why those paths diverged was probably the result of isolated populations and random mutations thereon, plus local conditions that supported survival of certain characteristics.  That's the short answer.  The long answer would require you to read a couple books or two on biology, chemistry, genetics and statistics, for starters.

I appreciate that some people do not believe the theory of evolution, but if they want to seriously attack the theory, they need to have at the very least a basic understanding of what it is all about.

An oldie, but a goodie... It's because we shared a common ancestor, not because we evolved from them. The apes and monkeys you see today are just as evolved as we are.

Evolution isn't about ending up with the cleverest life-form, it's about fitting into a niche so that a species can make a 'living' from it. Monkeys make a very good living hanging out in trees and eating what they can find up there... Fish do it in the sea... Tigers do it in dense jungle and cheetahs do it out on the plains.



We, meanwhile, do it by making tools to counteract our disadvantages.

That's a misconception. Humans did not evolve FROM monkeys, monkeys and humans evolved from the same ancestor called. generically "hominids", which is why apes, monkeys and humans share similar skeletal and genetic characteristics while being distinctly separate species linked to that common ancestor.

It showed America that the war was unwinable and the world that a small band of insugents could hold a major superpower hostage as long as it wanted to. When Walter Chronkite got on the CBS Evening News and said we're fighting a war we can't win, a lot of people on the fence jumped at the chance to protest against it.  That led to Lyndon Johnson's speech on March 30, 1968 when he announced he "would not seek and would not accept the nomination" of the democratic party.  That's when Bobby Kennedy put his hat in the ring, which led to his assassination in June of that year. Nixon's election that year can be directly attributed to the Kennedy assassination and the riots that occurred on TV every night for a week during the Democratic National Convention. Nixon's election meant the US would continue fighting in Vietnam for the next 6 years.  Kennedy probably would have ended our involvement in a year or two.  That led to an additional 30,000 US troops being killed in action.  That led to the anithero mentality of US citizens towards the soldiers when they returned from Vietnam.  That led to a lot of those soldiers becoming drug addicts and homeless.  It simply never ends.

During World War II, the Japanese occupied French Indochina. When Japan surrendered, Lao nationalists declared Laos independent, but by early 1946, French troops had reoccupied the country and conferred limited autonomy on Laos. During the First Indochina War, the Indochinese Communist Party formed the Pathet Lao resistance organization committed to Lao independence. Laos gained full independence following the French defeat by the Vietnamese communists and the subsequent Geneva peace conference in 1954.



[edit] The period of the Kingdom of Laos
Elections were held in 1955, and the first coalition government, led by Prince Souvanna Phouma, was formed in 1957. The coalition government collapsed in 1958 under pressure from the United States. In 1960 Captain Kong Lae staged a coup when the cabinet was away at the royal capital of Luang Prabang and demanded reformation of a neutralist government. The second coalition government, once again led by Souvanna Phouma, was not successful in holding power. Rightist forces under General Phoumi Nosavan drove out the neutralist government from power later that same year.

A second Geneva conference, held in 1961-62, provided for the independence and neutrality of Laos, but the agreement was subverted by both the United States and North Vietnam and the war soon resumed. The government and army of Laos were generally neutral during the conflict. The United States and North Vietnam subverted the agreement by forming private proxy armies. Growing American and North Vietnamese military presence in the country increasingly drew Laos into the Second Indochina War (1954-1975). For nearly a decade, eastern Laos was subjected to the heaviest bombing in the history of warfare, as the U.S. sought to destroy the Ho Chi Minh Trail that passed through Laos. The country was also repeatedly invaded by Vietnam.

Three years ago I've been in Plymouth and I've been a little taken aback by the fact that the city is proud...



...of being the port from which sir Francis Drake started to defeat the spanish armada (I can agree with that proudness), and was also proud of being the port from which Fathers Pilgrims started their trip to America, few centuries ago. Not a word about the fact that Darwin started form Plymouth his first trip to South America. I was really surprised of that fact; maybe it's just fault of the italian teacher that bring us to Plymouth - he is catholic and we know that they don't really love Darwin - but I saw in the harbour the commemorative plaques about Fathers Pilgrims and no more...



Now I ask to myself (and to you), how can a city be proud of people who escaped in America (most of the first Pilgrims were little ciminals or political opposers; why else would somebody leave his homeland to risk life in a trip across the ocean?), where, I could add, they started to steal other people's holding and kill that people in the progress?

Lots of facts about Plymouth are hidden from direct view - such as the fact that hundreds of American prisoners of war were kept at Dartmoor prison and only released at the end of the American war of independence.  Many of these Americans were sailors and a lot ended up working in the Royal Dockyards at Devonport as Dockyard Maties.

Plymouth was one of several main ports used by British naval vessels over a long period of time. Darwin's voyage on the Beagle started there, but that was hardly unusual. 
Actually, the Catholic church - at least the upper hierarchy - has no problem with Darwin. They learned to keep their noses out of science after the Galileo debacle.

People still dispute the Darwin teachings, there has been a programme on British Television about that tonight. Darwin was a controversial figure, so probably Plymouth has dissociated itself from this over the generations as the inhabitants try to attract tourists.
The pilgrims were a minority group, persecuted in this country. Perhaps some of our ancestors were politically correct even back then! Also they are credited with the founding of the modern USA. Whenever did British conquerors worry about stealing natives' land and murdering?

I only visited Plymouth once and liked the Port at first sight. You could firmly  breathe the tradition in every cranny. The nearest I got to being stationed there was RAF Hullavington  to the North and RAF Gosport, on the coast near Portsmouth. The entire coast is steeped in Naval tradition, but Plymouth Ho always had a special place.
Why?  How do traditions take root? Why one theme (Francis Drake) overshadow others? People are just proud of one and not the other.
Pudsey, where I grew up was proud of Len Hutton.
Not an easy question and certainly nothing to do with the Church.  The Elisabethan Era has always been something special, when the Royal Navy started becoming  a factor to be reckoned with all over the world. Perhaps that is why people have a soft spot for Plymouth.
Darwin?  Certainly important, but not as  fascinating a character as Drake and his other pals.

And everyone who signed the treaty that ended the Civil War died as well.
Of course they died, it was 230 years ago -- duh. But most signers of the Declaration did well after the Revolution -- they were some of the wealthiest, most influential people in the new nation.

Thomas Jefferson and John Adams both did rather well after signing the declaration, and died on its 50th anniversary.

So any talk of a curse is silly.

Of course it wasn't cursed! All the people who signed it either died naturally or in the war. It's not like they're going to be immortal! So of course they died. That doesn't mean it was cursed. Even people who didn't sign it died!

Sure.
Why not?
Look in the real world.
Since it was written by the dead Mummy in ghostly kitchen's dialect with ghostly and deadly words.
From the graveyards of different ghostly ancestor's culture and custom.
That was dead and buried was long gone with time.
When it is not even a universal constitution and universal law in living words.
Matt 22.32
Getting kick on the butts as casualty of the dead Mummy without being aware of it with self lack of knowledge being expose in time.
Luke 6.39-40,41-45,46-49

Hitler liked the British and the Royal family believing that Britain and Germany had alot in common. Which of course they did considering  Kiaser Willhem and King George where first cousins.
What Hitler disliked was (in his own opinion) British hypocracy over his plans to build an empire in the east for Germany, when the British had their empire all over the world. Hitler was truely shocked when Britain declared war over Poland.

Even by the summer of 1940 when Britain was technically defeated and alone, Hitler offered terms for peace as his fight was always against the Bolshiveks in Russia. In 1941 Rudolph Hess (Hitler's deputy) flew to Scotland to begin peace talks with the British. Considering this, it is possible to conclude that maybe Hitler had a "soft" spot for the British. But who could ever say for sure what was going on in that mind?

Hitler also knew the history of the people from Britain and knew they were desendents from the germanic tribes 1000 years before -Jutes,saxons,Franks,Vandals..........so in an essence he saw the British as ancient German people

Elvis Presley is now a part of American History.

Henry Kissinger, who was the Secretary of State in President Nixon's administration (1972-78), wrote several books about US and Soviet relations during that time (Though Stalin was dead by then.).  You can also read the memoirs of President Ronald Reagan, who was the one who caused the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 with the words he said in Berlin, "Mr. Brezhnev, tear down this wall".  He had good relations with Ms. Thatcher and I'm sure she will be covered in his writings too.  I suggest that you check for them in your library under author (Kissinger, Reagan) for the titles, since I can't remember the exact titles at this moment.  As a Cold War veteran, I have distinct memories of the time, since that was when I first served in the Army.

If you mean in England, then as now there was no fixed "age of majority" in legal terms. It varied depending on what the context was.

Canon Law (Church Law) governed some aspects of this: Church rulings of the 1150s and 1160s stated that “there can be no espousal or marriage before the age of 7”. In the 1170s, 12 was made the critical age. Espousal was like today's engagement, but rather more legally binding.

As far as becoming treated as an adult, for the nobility this was at age 12 - for example Prince Richard (son of Henry II and later Richard I) was granted his first personal seal at the age of 12, indicating his entitlement to issue warrants, charters and other legal documents in his own right.

For the vast majority of the population (the non-nobles), no age of majority was ever established, in other words there was no set age at which a person became an adult. When they were old enough to do manual work they did it, this could be as young as 6 or 7. If a girl could be promised in marriage at age 7, she would normally wait until about the age of 14 until the ceremony took place (Matilda grand-daughter of William I married the Holy Roman Emperor at age 11, but this was slightly younger than usual).

Today in England there is still no universal "age of majority" - different age restrictions apply in different situations, just as in the 12th century.

The legal age at which people could marry in medieval times was 14 for boys and 12 for girls.  However, most did not get married as young as that, especially the common people, who more usually got married in their mid-twenties, when they were in a position to set up a household together.

Young people in towns were often apprenticed to trades, and would be under the authority of their master until they had finished their apprenticeship.  They would not be really independent while they were still apprentices.

Basically as soon as you could make babies you were considered an adult. For girls that was much more clear cut than for boys, but still very young compared to modern standards. Of course their life expectancy was much shorter as well, so they didn't have time to waste.

In the early 20th century, who was housing owned by?



council/corporation housing doesn't seem to have begun until the 60's, so before those times, did people simply pay rent to a landlord who owned the properties?  Obviously, rich people had their own homes, but how did this happen?  Wre their houses passed down throughgeneratins/ If a rich person moved into a new property, did they buy it outright or pay a mortgage?
For the majority of people, who were poor and working class, was there (even purely in theory) a prospect of owning the home they occupied?



</question>



<additional details>



Caramac's answer is a good start; what I want to expans on is where the term "slum landlord" originates, and who owned the slums in which people lived in the late 19th/early 20th C?  In the cases of those who lived on land owned by their employers, what hapenned when that person retired, or to their family if they died?

The whole history of housing is a pretty vast area!
As far as I can gather mortgages for house purchase only really became popular in the inter-war years, until then lower income people would have been renting.  Who the 'slum landlords' actually were would have varied from area to area, this article tells you about some of the worst slums in the East End of London actually being owned by Lawyers, Peers and the Church of England, who appointed 'managers' to be responsible for the day-to-day running of them:
http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/t...
The problems though of slum housing were being recognised from the mid to late Victorian times onwards and in 1900 a National Council for Housing Reform was set up.  There were various trusts and charities, local councils and philanthropic employers who were trying to improve things and building better often called 'model' housing for poorer people or employees.  Lever built Port Sunlight for its workers, and Rowntrees and Bournville built similar 'model' villages, which I do not think could have been linked to the jobs in the way that tied cottages were.  But probably only a minority were living in these few better housing or slum clearance projects, I just wanted to mention this to correct your first answer which implied that council building only started in the 1970s, (actually that was when it often ceased to be decent and brick-built), there were good building programmes in the 1930s, and of course in the 1950s when they were needed after the War.
If you want to know more about the other part of your question, 'tied cottage' is the term btw in case you hadn't heard it and you might find something in a search, the inhabitants of tied cottages were evicted if they lost their jobs or could no longer work, the houses would have gone to the new workers, which is why a lot of older people ended up in the workhouse if they did not have other family members who could house them or a son to take over the work, and why the Trade Unions campaigned against the tied housing system.  Of course I suppose a few employers could have been compassionate, the odd case might come up on a family or local history site.

In the early 19/20th century, many of the dwellings belonged to the industries, like the cotton mill owners, farmers cottages, miners homes, and when the poor were unable to house themselves there were 'poor houses', work-houses, and even unused caves, shelters.

The upper-class had their fortunes tied up in property, and these were passed down to their male 'heirs', girls were married into families with wealth and standing (properties) where the two separate families (in-laws) could combine their resources.

It wasn't until around the World Wars that housing became a priority for the soldiers returning home, and even then, wives and children often lived with their spouses parents, until they as a family, (when their husbands returned home) could manage to rent cheap housing, from private landlords.

It was in the early 1950/60's that the idea of 'rented property' came into being, mainly 'prefabricated buildings', but decent brick built family houses, didn't really come into existance until the start of the 1970's in most districts, with organised Local Authorities.



Having a mortagage was almost unknown until quite late on in the last century and even then you had to have/earn a decent income, to afford such a luxury.

Renting property was quite widespread in times past, even wealthy people didn't always own the properties they lived in, it was not uncommon for well-off people to rent from others.  For instance, in 'the Importance of Being Earnest' Jack Worthing tells Lady Bracknell that he owns a house in town but that is it rented to a Lady somebody (I can't remember her name).

And in 'Persuasion' by Jane Austen, when Sir Walter wants to cut back on his living expenses, he rents his country home, Kellynch Hall, to Admiral Croft.

In past centuries, both renting and buying property was much, much cheaper, in real terms, than it is now.  For instance, in 'The diary of a Nobody' by George and Weedon Grossmith(written in the 1880s), Mr Pooter's employer buys the freehold of the Pooters' house and presents it to Mr Pooter as a gift.  This is a very generous thing to do, but less generous, in real terms, than it would be nowadays, since the value of a house is very much more now than it would have been then.  You did not have to be rich to own your own home.

Interesting perspectives posted thus far.

The Yalta conference laid the foundation for the "cold war."

Stalin drew a vail over the territories he controlled and, no one being allowed to see in, those in the west grew suspicious.  Add to this, Stalin's going back on his word about allowing free access to western Berlin via the highway was cause for great concern.

There were many milestones.

Eisenhower's spy flights over Russia

Kennedy's basing Nuclear missiles in Turkey

Castro's Russian missiles based in Cuba

Numerous proxy wars in Central, South America, Africa and Asia.

Coupes and assassinations galore.

From 1945 to 1948 the Soviet Union strengthened its hold on Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany. But the Cold War was marked by other effects of the policies of the two superpowers—possession of nuclear weapons; the attempt to establish spheres of interest and alliances with other nations; the division of Europe into two military alliances, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact; attempts to start or prevent revolution in smaller nations; and several less-than-total confrontations between the superpowers such as the Berlin Blockade of 1948–49 and the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.

Soldiers from Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada all fought for the allies during the war.  The Battle at Galliopi was fought by mainly Australian and New Zealand troops.  The British Navy fought to control the seas and protect the convoy routes from the German U-Boats.  Also fought an indecisive battle at Jutland against the German surface fleet.
Almost forgot about the Indians.  They fought for the crown on the Western Front, in the Middle East and in East Africa.

The colonial troops played an enormous part in Britain's efforts in World War One. They ranged from the Australian and New Zealand soldiers (ANZACS) nicknamed the "Diggers" who earned themselves a fearsome reputation amongst the enemy, similar to the Scottish Highland regiments who were known as "the Devils in skirts".
Canadians and South Africans were conspicuous in the valour of their battalions, especially at Passchendale and Ypres.

Perhaps the supreme symbol of imperial war effort was the Imperial Camel Corps, formed in 1916. Although ANZACS accounted for three quarters of it's strength, there were also troops from Hong Kong and Singapore, volunteers from the Rhodesian Mounted Police, a South African mining prospector who had fought against the British in the Boer War, a fruit grower from the Canadian Rockies and a pearl fisherman from Queensland.
Yet it would be a mistake to think that this was an "all-white" affair. For at the outbreak of war, the man who would become India's most famous political and spiritual leader declared "We are, above all, British citizens of the Great British Empire. Fighting as the British are at present in a righteous cause for the good and glory of human dignity and civilization. Our duty is clear: to do our best to support the British and fight with our life and property." Many thousands of Indians shared Ghandi's sentiments, for in the autumn of 1914 around a third of British forces in France were from India and by the end of the war more than a million Indians served overseas, more than all the other "white" dominions put together.
Also came the men of the British West Indies Regiment who (much to their disgust) were used primarily for the extremely dangerous and thankless task of ammunition carrying and very little respect was paid to them by other nations officers.

Altogether, this was a thoughroughly multinational enterprise which, unlike it's Hapsburg and Russian counterparts, somehow lasted despite profound ethnic divisions and frequently lamentable leadership.

The Gulf of Tonkin incidents reportedly began with an attack by three P-4 torpedo boats of the navy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) on the Maddox, a U.S. destroyer, on an electronic intelligence gathering mission in the waters of the Gulf of Tonkin on August 2, 1964. Two days later, that vessel and the U.S. destroyer Turner Joy both reported themselves under renewed attack, although Hanoi subsequently insisted that it had not attacked — and no attack is now believed to have occurred on that night.[2]

Within hours, Johnson ordered the launching of retaliatory air strikes (Operation Pierce Arrow) on the bases of the North Vietnamese boats and announced, in a television address to the American public that same evening, that U.S. naval forces had been attacked. In a message sent to Congress the following day, the President affirmed that "the North Vietnamese regime had conducted further deliberate attacks against U.S. naval vessels operating in international waters."

Johnson requested approval of a resolution "expressing the unity and determination of the United States in supporting freedom and in protecting peace in southeast Asia". He said that the resolution should express support "for all necessary action to protect our Armed Forces" — but repeated previous assurances that "the United States... seeks no wider war". As the nation entered the final three months of political campaigning for the 1964 elections (in which Johnson was standing for election), the president contended that the resolution would help "hostile nations... understand" that the United States was unified in its determination "to continue to protect its national interests."[3]

On August 6, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara testified before a joint session of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees. He stated that the Maddox had been "carrying out a routine mission of the type we carry out all over the world at all times" and denied that it had been in any way involved in South Vietnamese patrol boat raids on the offshore islands of Hon Me and Hon Nieu on the nights of July 30 and July 31.[4] The administration did not, however, disclose that the island raids, although separate from the mission of the Maddox, had been part of a program of clandestine attacks on North Vietnamese installations called Operation Plan 34A. These operations were carried out by U.S.-trained South Vietnamese commandos under the control of a special operations unit of the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam called the Studies and Operations Group.[5]

After fewer than nine hours of committee consideration and floor debate, Congress voted, on August 10, 1964, on a joint resolution which authorized the president "to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom."[6] The unanimous affirmative vote in the House of Representatives was 416-0. (However, Republican Congressman Eugene Siler of Kentucky, who was not present but opposed the measure, was "paired" with another member who favored the resolution — i.e., his opposition was not counted, but the vote in favor was one less than it would have been.) The Senate conferred its approval by a vote of 88-2. Some members expressed misgivings about the measure, but in the end, Democratic Senators Wayne Morse of Oregon and Ernest Gruening of Alaska cast the only nay votes.[7] At the time, Senator Morse warned that "I believe this resolution to be a historic mistake.

On August 2, 1964 in the Gulf of Tonkin the USS Maddox engaged North Vietnamese torpedo boats, two days later it was reported that the Maddox had engaged another torpedo boat but that was found to be a mistake.  Lyndon Johnson never told anyone of the mistaken engagement and was able to use the incidents as cause to get further involved in the Vietnam conflict.  Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution authorizing Johnson to militarily assist countries in Southeast Asia that were seen as being threatened by communism including South Vietnam.

Since the 1950s, there had been increasing tension between North and South Vietnam. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement led to Vietnam being split into two - North (Communist) and South (Capitalist).

The Golf of Tonkin was the area around Vietnam that the US were patrolling due to increased tensions. They had an interest in checking the spread of communism in this part of Asia. In August 1964 it was reported that the North Vietnamese had attacked a US patrol boat - this became known as the Tonkin Incident.

Lyndon Johnson, President at the time, decided to pass the Tonkin Resolution as a result of the incident. It meant that the US Congress had given permission for America to enter fully into conflict with North Vietnam. The Tonkin Resolution began the Vietnam War. However the incident never happened - the US government manipulated events as an excuse to go to war.

It was another event that the US used to start a war.  A US general has since admitted that it was a mistake (because it was almost certainly either completely made up or exaggerated beyond all measure) and the "official" deaths of 60,000 US service personnel and 5 million Vietnamese really does suggest that to be the case.  War is profitable: and nothing else matters.

The American Revolution -- without it, we would be talking about the history of Colonial America.

And since the Declaration was the formal document seperating the United States from England, its debate and adoption are the most important events in US history.

Some historians would argue the Civil War (1861-1865) had a longer lasting and more profound impact on the US. But Lincoln would not have had a union to save without Washington and Jefferson.

The Civil War:

You can argue it defended and promoted the principles of the Constitution more than the Revolutionary War by fighting for the freedom and equal rights of every individual.

Could we have ever been one nation without this war? You can argue this war was the most important event because it ensured one united nation rather than groups of individual states, meaning the US benefits from resources throughout its land, not just the Northern states.

You can argue that this event is the most important event in US history because we still see the fallout today. Racial equality is still an issue and something countless organizations, public and private, deal with.



The Civil War preserved and expanded the federal government's power over states' rights, which is still practiced today, and was an incredibly huge turning point in our nation's history.



The pledge sums it up: "One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all" - does this pledge, the mantra of what we are as a nation, make any sense without the Civil War and its results?

Drafting of the Constitution.  The revolution itself was obviously very important, but what set it apart was the idea of democracy embodied in the Constitution.  One of the few occurrences in history where the history of the world changed with a few signatures.

While both the Civil War and WWII were important, both events may have been avoided by stronger efforts at diplomacy and stronger leaders before the wars.

Looking at the poster it seems obvious. They wanted the same rights as a man, who, at the time could do as he wanted. It wasn't especially the vote that they were after, but the right to choose, the same as men had the legal right to do.

Getting the vote was only the beginning of the women's movement. albeit a major land mark, but it took another 50 years before women had anywhere near equal status.

A lot of women will still dispute the job is over, and I agree. It will take another generation, when all the old farts, of which I am one, have died off and no one remembers how things were

El Himno Nacional Mexicano no es de México
Publicado por uroom en Agosto 25, 2008

Una editora de EE.UU, dueña del derecho de autor del Himno Nacional Mexicano.
La siguiente es una historia real, narrada por Gabriel Larrea:

El Himno Nacional es una obra originariamente mexicana, pero el titular de los derechos de autor es la compañía Wagner y Lieven en Estados Unidos.

Cuando se hizo el concurso para la composición del Himno Nacional, se ofreció un premio a los ganadores, mismo que el gobierno mexicano nunca entregó; entonces ni Bocanegra ni Nunó cobraron lo que se habían ganado.

Mucho tiempo después se buscó a los herederos para darles el premio.

Y nadie se dio cuenta de que, aparte del concurso, estaban subyacentes los derechos de autor.
Los herederos los vendieron a esa prestigiosa empresa estadounidense.

Manuel Avila Camacho expropió los derechos, pero Avila Camacho no rige más que para México. Así que esta historia, que parece antigua, se refleja en la actualidad: cada vez que se toca fuera de México el Himno Nacional, se deben pagar regalías a los titulares de los derechos: la Wagner Lieven en Estados Unidos.

Pero otros dicen que no fue vendido, pero fue víctima de una práctica común en la actualidad (y que alguna ley debería detener) Como no tiene un registro de autor porque no se estilaba en la época de su creación, una empresa de EEUU lo registro como de su propiedad. Se supone que los derechos de autor se respetan por acuerdos internacionales, pero en este caso no se exactamente que pasó, el asunto es que cada vez que en EEUU se toca el himno nacional mexicano, se tiene que pagar un porcentaje al “dueño” de los derechos es este país. Así sea un evento de caridad o público, se use en una película, etc.

Iranian Revolution 1978-9 - Shah's liberalisation as 'too little, too late' a realistic assessment?



People in the west viewed the Shah as a progressive and an emancipator of women.  But, as the unrest grew, they had to confront the fact that his regime was a dictatorship and was supported by a security apparatus of considerable brutality.

The answer seemed to be that he should liberalise and become a constitutional monarch 'on the Juan Carlos model'.  The Shah's efforts or gestures in this direction are supposed to be tragically overtaken by events; I have twice seen them characterised by the journalistic cliché 'too little, too late'.  My question is, is this a realistic assessment in the context of Iranian society and the upheavals in it?

Not only is it not realistic, it is so bizarre as to be practically insane.  The Shah could do those things not although, but because he was a dictator.

The idea that a broader-based regime would be more sympathetic to the west is one of the west's mist persistent illusions.  If there were a free election in Saudi Arabia, Osama would win by a landslide.

The American public were very much against joining in the European war after their experience in the first and the great depression.

Roosevelt' s first masterstroke was to get the 'Lease and lend' law passed, so that America was not seen as supplying arms to the UK.

He desperately wanted to join the war effort because he could see that if Hitler conquered the whole of Europe and then Russia, America and world domination would be well within his grasp.

Roosevelt and Churchill colluded together to keep harassing and goading Japan to attack American interests anywhere in the world, because if they did, the American public would not stand for it and support America's involvement.

It is a sad fact of history, often covered up that Pearl Harbour was the sacrificial lamb, but with the condolence that America joined the war, Hitler and Hirohito were defeated and the whole world breathed a huge sigh of relief, without America's help and money, none of this could have happened.

There is no 'MAY' about it, the outcome would have been totally different.

I believe your view is about the best assumption which any educated and unbiased tactical historian could come up with! As most Historians say! America was not the sole winner of the war but they did help a massive amount to get it to its end in a much quicker time than would be otherwise.
But the  USA got a lot out of it even though it`s children paid a heavy price.

The Americans and Russians both joined the war because they were invaded, while Britain (and France) joined because Poland was invaded.  Generosity has nothing to do with any of it, self interest was at the core of the reason for every country entering the war, but slightly less so for Britain and France than for America and Russia.  The war would have ended very differently without America's involvement.  For one thing, Japan would have been defeated by conventional warfare by Russia, possibly over several more years, but certainly at a much lower civillian cost.  I suspect that the soviet union would have been stronger, bigger and longer lasting, too.

Well, the problem with historical "what-ifs" is that anyone with a little knowledge of history can make a very convincing sounding case. The problem of course is that in real life people have almost always totally failed to anticipate the future, so why should it be any different in hypothetical situations? You also don't state whether or not the USA was at war with Japan in your hypothetical situation.

The Allies gave the Russians a lot of trucks, otherwise their supplies to Russia were rather modest, since there was basically no easy way to get supplies to Russia. Especially early in the war when they would have done the most good. And by the time the Americans entered the war, the Germans were already in BIG trouble in Russia. So it's pretty much a given that even without the USA, the Soviets would have defeated Germany and rolled to Berlin.

After that it gets pretty iffy. Even before they entered the war the USA was giving tons of support to the Brits with the lend-lease program, in fact the lend-lease program was a clear violation of neutrality. So it's not like the USA wasn't helping out from the beginning. The British would still have won the fighting in North Africa. They probably wouldn't have invaded Italy though, but Italy's contribution to the German war effort was minor.

The Russian advance would likely have been slower without the USA, since the Germans would have had more resources to throw at them. Still, the German situation was hopeless. Even if D-Day had come a year later, it likely still would have come, it would just have been a 100% British/Canadian instead of 60% British/Canadian.

So the safest guess is that the war would have lasted longer, but the end result would have been pretty much the same, with maybe the Russians occupying all of Germany instead of just East Germany. The idea that Germany would have won the war or that the Russians would have conquered all of western Europe require some pretty radical departures from what really happened. The Germany winning the war idea is especially ludicrous.

With American aid the Soviet Union (please use their proper name people) and the UK would have had a harder time holding out like they did.  During the early years of the was the USA was "Neutral" but was selling arms and supplies to the UK and USSR almost esclusively.  Not really a neutral stance but in the eyes of the American Public it was.  The USA did not want to get involved in another European conflict/problem but would aid them.  Have to love a Capitalist Economy.

Had the UK not been receiving the military aid from the USA it was getting the Battle of Britian could have gone much differently.  Without ammo the Spitfires would not have been very useful.

The Soviets also received a lot of aid from the USA, but not as much as the USA.  What saved the Soviets was that Hitler launched his invasion to late in the year and the Soviet winter set in and caught the Germans ill prepared.  Unable to further advance in the winter the Soviets were able to move troops from Siberia to help reinforce their positions.  These troops were trained for the cold and also had seen minimal action.  Come Spring time Hitler resumed his campaign however he now faced a much more formitable foe with the Soviets.  The Soviets were able to hold out until the next winter again when they finally were able to grab the upper hand and start driving Germany back out of Soviet Lands.

Even after Japan attacked the US Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor the USA did not declare war on Germany and its European Allies.  We waited until they declared war on us and returned the favor.  That is when the USA really kick started its war effort.  Prior to the attack at Pearl, FDR realized the USA would at some point be dragged into the war and ordered a mass build up of the Navy and Army, however this was going to take a few years.  That is why it wasn't until the USA was in the war a few years till we really started to steam roll Japan and intensify our efforts in Europe and Africa.

It is quite possible that the war in Europe could have been won soley with the UK and USSR had the USA remained Neutral and been supplying both nations under the lend/lease program.  However the war would have taken longer.  Also I do not feel the UK would have been able to launch an invasion like D-day without the USA.  They lacked the required materials to do so.

The war in the Pacific though required the USA.  We won the war mostly on our own in the Pacific.  While the UK and her commonwealth territories supplies naval support a huge majority of the material were from the USA.  The war in the Pacific was more the USA vs. Japan then anything.  No nation other than the USA was able to produce the materials and Navy required to fight a battle over such an expanse of space.

Why does the three-generation rule apply to the modern rich, but not to the aristocrats before?



'Rags to rags in three generations'; the first generation established the fortune, the second increases it, but the third just spends it.'  There are many cases to illustrate this feature of the rich who have come and gone in the last two centuries.
But up until the 20th century there were aristocrats who had enjoyed wealth, power and prestige for centuries.  Why were they not victims of the three-generation rule?
I know this is generalisation - there were aristocrats who gambled all their possessions away, and there are one or two plutocratic families who have been up there since the 1850s, but the general rule holds, doesn't it?



</question>



<additional details>



Felicity - I accept your point about the aristocracy today, but originally aristocracy went with possession of land.  Until the 20th century, when someone not rich, such as a military man, was ennobled in Britain, Parliament granted him enough money to support his new dignity.



A Chinese friend also told me the Chinese have the same saying about three generations.

The aristocracy (when they controlled politics and government) could provide well-paid government work for the half-wits of their families (or push them fast through the military ranks).

In many countries, the laws of inheritance played a part.If it's the rule that large estates have to go undivided to the eldest son, they are provided for at least (together with the family name) - the younger children are less well-cared for, of course. Not sure what this institution is called in English, though? (A "fidei-comiss" in some languages, including mine).

The three generation rule is not a rule. It was a clever saying dreamed up by someone to account for the fall of a once rich family, but they were talking to the particular , rather than the general but it became part of folklore. In fact, most rich families manage to keep their riches within the family through many generations, nowadays with the help of clever lawyers and accountants.

It doesn't apply to the aristocracy because of death duties. The aristocracy can be reduced to poverty in one generation.
Just as a by-the-way, being a member of the aristocracy has to do with your lineage and ancestry. It has nothing to do with the size of your bank account, whether in the UK or off-shore.

I guess because by the time Europeans 'discovered' it, it was not fully populated like Asia. So compaired to Asia, not many people had to be convinced of the European 'good-will'.

Hammurabi is right.

I would like to add a historical detail or two. First, the Suez Canal cut weeks off the voyage, avoiding the long drag round S. Africa.



Secondly, the British Government contracted with the Continental railways and with the town of Brindisi in S. Italy to cut the journey even more. Sealed express trains were run at the highest speed then available to Brindisi, bypassing all customs formalities. At Brindisi the troops detrained at a private station behind a seafront hotel which catered for them. The hotel was divided by floor: one floor for officers another for NCOs and OR, and when a troopship docked at a jetty next to the hotel, the ship's gangways communicated directly with the two floors, allowing direct embarcation.

This arrangement obviously cut out the crossing of the Bay of Biscay and the long journey round Spain. So (within the limits of available technology) the journey time was reduced to a minimum, avoiding expense, fatigue and operational difficulties if rapid reinforcement became necessary.

In the 1WW this facility was also used to bring troops from India to France. Villagers in S. France got used to seeing troop trains full of both white & brown faces on their way (poor sods!) to the trenches.

I do not know if it is still there, but when I visited Brindisi (45 years ago) you could still see the disused station (signs in English still visible) behind the hotel and the doors above ground level with which the gangways once connected. The hotel was purpose-built and so close to the the edge of the jetty that only one vehicle at a time could pass its frontage - so it might have been demolished by now. Anyone know what's happened to it?

They got there by ships. Perhaps some of them might still have been sailing ships, and some were steam ships. They went through the Suez Canal, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea.

Britain used to hire mercenary soldiers, too, so not all of them had to come from Britain. Some of those soldiers, who  were from India, itself, rebelled, as they did in the Sepoy Mutiny, in 1857.

The British also hired Irish soldiers, one of whom, that had served in Ceylon, was the subject of the song "Johnny, I hardly knew ye."

By ship.

Britain had by far the largest Military and Merchant Navies in the world throughout the 19th Century.

Large numbers of Soldiers were shipped over to India, many spending huge lengths of time there.

In the first half of the Century, much of India was actually controlled by the British East India Company, they also shipped troops there in large numbers.

The British troops were a mix of English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh.

A large part of the British army was actually native Indian anyway. India was a mix of many different races and religions, and when the British arrived, many different countries existed in India, it was not one nation, and never had been.

Many Indians had no problem with joining the British Army, they were often deployed outside the region of their origins- for example Punjabi Sikhs fought hundreds of miles from their homeland in places like Burma and Nepal.

Why was the American Revolution the most important event in United States?



Three supporting arguments please...
so far I have 
(1) We would still be deprived of rights, still be used, and still be under Britain control if not for the Rev.
(2) We fought against Britain that was super power back then, if we didn't, they might still be super power now.
(3) Because of the Revolution and thinkers, Declaration was formed & we had our own rights.



</question>



<additional details>



Sorry, I didn't make it clear. The question was asking what the most important event in U.S was, and I chose the American Revolution. Of course there are many other events, but I chose to focus on the American Rev.

It is debatable that the Revolution was the most important event in HS history.  Is this a question on a homework assignment?  If so, here are a few more.

It excited a spirit of resistance to tyranny (perceived or real).

Disseminated  sentiments of the rights of mankind and the nature of legitimate government

The idea of "liberty of discussion" or freedom of speech which was only practiced superficially before

Upon the end of war and the settlement of the new nation, automatically produced a new super power that could with stand the influences of the British Empire.

Opened up free trade routes and oppurtunities for the world at large allowing for less hunger and the advancement of technologies.

Hope this helps a little.

It sounds good.  You might want to omit the second point or at least change the wording.  They still kind of are a super power.  Maybe be sure to include the word "free" in there somewhere.

First of all, the Globe Theatre didn't even exist for most of the 1500s. It wasn't built until 1599.

Most peasants only had one set of clothes, so that was what they wore. Royalty and nobles may have dressed up, but peasants couldn't.

I'm not sure peasants even got in to the Globe. They went to public theatres, but I thought the Globe was for the aristocracy. But on the other hand, I remember learning in school that Shakespeare's plays were for the common people. They weren't all hoity-toity - they were popular entertainment. So either peasants got into the Globe, or Shakespeare's plays were put on in public theatres, too.

'Peasants' are by definition country people, and they would seldom get a chance to go to a city theatre.  Ordinary townsfolk could and did go to the Globe - they were 'groundlings' who paid one penny for standing room.

I think it Depended on the Modern Tactic of Rapid Mobility of Troops by Motorisation. It started off Great with a Rapid Advance into Belgium and France but eventually Bogged Down by Lack of Logistics. They were Still Depending on the Horse and cart to move Guns and Supplies over great Distances, and did not have Enough Lorries or, Truck's in American Parlance. It was a Great Plan but just got Bogged Down Eventually.  The same thing has happened in the Second War as Well with the Supply Train not being able to keep up with the Forward Troops and Eventually The Push  for Territory has to stop, as has happened in many Famous Battles from Napoleon's Era to the Modern Day.

The Schlieffen plan was devised long before the First World War actually started. It was devised so that Germany would not have to fight a war on two fronts with both France and Russia.



The key problem with the Schlieffen plan was that the right flank of German soldiers advanced too quickly and their supplies could not keep up with them. They had to slow down because of this, but they were also slowed down by the British joining the fighting. Britain joined because they promised to help keep Belgium neutral and safe. Once the Germans invaded Belgium, Britain had to help the Belgians.

The delay meant that they could not reach Paris as intended, and the two sides dug their trenches in.

It was confidently expected that on the outbreak of any war with Germany, the French would almost instantly launch an invasion of Germany through Alsace-Lorraine, the best invasion route on the Franco-German border. When was came, both expectations were proved to be true. The German plan was simply to mass 90% of their troops - some 35 corps - to the north, and when war came marching them through neutral Belgium and Holland, and sweeping round to the west of Paris, enveloping the French army, who would have been allowed to make some progress into Germany. The French army would then find itself attacked from the rear, and with Paris threatened or lost.



In the original memoranda outlining the plan, Schlieffen himself had considered the likelyhood of success to be slim, with three main problems unsolved - how to neutralise the very strong fortifications and garrison of Paris, the inability of the transport network to take the number of troops his plan required, and an unsolvable shortage of troops even after full mobilisation.. However, in the years between the retirement of Schlieffen in 1906, and the outbreak of the First World War, the plan was repeatedly watered down by General Helmuth von Moltke, his successor as chief of the German General Staff. First, he decided not the break Dutch neutrality, only that of Belgium, leaving the important 35 corps struggling through a narrow gap to reach France. Next, loath to allow surrender of German soil, he limited the scope of the withdrawl planned for Alsace-Lorraine. Finally, and for the same reasons, he moved more troops to East Prussia, intending to defend against any Russian attack near the borders. Thus the 2.1 million troops envisaged by Schlieffen as attacking through Belgium and Holland became 1.5 million troops attacking through Belgium, while the French armies, instead of being trapped some way inside Germany when the attack came, were instead close to the frontier and able to be redeployed much quicker. Even so, the German plan nearly succeeded, and was only defeated after the battle of the Marne (5-10 September 1914).

As Vice President he became president upon the death of JFK on November 22, 1963 and he was elected to his own term in 1964.  He wanted to continue American involvement in Vietnam to show the country that he was tough on communists.  He never had a real plan for how to fight the war and didn't let his generals do the planning, he decided every aspect of it even deciding what targets were to be bombed.  The war dragged on with no end in sight and by the election of 1968 Johnson was so unpopular he knew he wouldn't be re-elected and decided not to run for another term.

Lyndon Johnson took over as President following Kennedy's assassination in 1963. Before this, he worked as Kennedy's Vice-President. His presidency ran until 1968. Over that time he passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and Voting Rights Act in 1965. Both of these helped to improve the rights of black Americans and move towards desegregation.

Johnson also brought America into the Vietnam War by passing the Tonkin Resolution. This meant that he authorised US soldiers to fight in Vietnam, where previously they had just patrolled the waters around Vietnam. The war was to have damaging effects on America's morale as it lasted 12 years.

What he did for the Viet Nam war?  He killed a lot of young men for no reason whatsoever.  He escalated the war in VietNam and insisted on have JFK's widow  stand by while he was sworn into the presidency by a long time friend in his home state of Texas before JFK's body was flown back.  Necessary, yes, but it was not necessary to have Jackie Kennedy stand by with her husband's blood drying on her suit.  LBJ was an egomaniac by all accounts and a particularly cruel person who did not like the president he served under and would have done anything to be president.  There are those who believe he was a part of the assassination.  He lied to the country, they used to call it the some sort of gap because some of the lies were so outrageous but still some people believed him and were led into slaughter in Viet Nam.  Since it was such an unpopular war the poor veterans of that war came home to being treated like THEY had done something wrong when they just did what the country asked them to, all for oil.  Check and see if most wars since the civil war didn't have some basis in fossil fuel, it's horrible, all that blood for oil and we're still doing it when there are alternate energy sources out there.

President Lydon Johnson was predident from 1963-1969. He succeeded president Kennedy after he was assassinated. He was the main person responsible for passing the great society programs. The great society programs are a series of programs meant to improve the quality of life in the united states such as administering funds to health care and educational programs. He served as senate minority leader and senate majority whip. He then unsuccessfully for the democratic president nomination but was beat by Mr. Kennedy. Then he was chosen by Mr. Kennedy to be the vice presidential nominee.Johnson



During his presidency Johnson launched the war on poverty. It was a nick-name for what Johnson did against poverty. He had tax cuts for the poor and also pa\ssed an act called the Economic Oppertunity Act that had numerous social programs in the health care and education fields. It was for the general welfare for the poor but it was not a long term act as most of it is gone today.

Henry VII was Catholic.



He started out as Henry Tudor and won the crown during the last days of the Wars of the Roses.



He married the last York princess, Elizabeth and had 4 children:  Arthur (died young), Henry VIII, Margaret and Mary.

If you're asking if Henry VIII was Catholic, he was born Catholic and was a staunch supporter of the Pope until Henry wanted to marry Anne Boleyn.



When he couldn't get the Pope to agree to an annulment from his wife, Catherine of Aragon, Henry broke from the Catholic church and formed the Church of England.

Still, this was not a true Protestant church.



The Church of England (Anglican) was in most ways Catholic in it's observances except Henry was the head of the church, not the Pope.

Protestantism didn't gain popularity until after Henry's death when his son Edward took the throne.



Edward had been raised by powerful Protestant men who used him as a tool to drive the Catholics out of England.

To this day, Catholics are not very accepted in England.

Henry VII was Catholic.  so was Henry VIII. Despite his break with Romen, he never thought of himself as a Protestant, and in fact continued to persecute Protestant heretics during the later part of his reign.  His last Queen, Katherine Parr, got into trouble for supporting a Protestant heretic called Anne Askew, who was burnt at the stake by Henry.

The earliest English monarch we know was certainly Catholic was Aethelred of Wessex (and of Kent). He was also revered as a saint by the people, though was never canonised by the church.

His successor Alfred the Great, the first true king of all England, was certainly Catholic, and then all monarchs up to Henry VIII were Catholic, but Henry VIII split from Rome to found the Church of England, in defiance of the Pope's refusal to annul his marriage.

So Henry VII was Catholic.

EDIT - Countess's answer made sense right up until the last sentence "to this day Catholics are not very accepted in England." As a (former) Catholic, I have lived in England all my life and can tell her religion does not matter one jot to people in England today. In fact, thanks largely to east European immigrants, Catholics are now more numerous than Church of England for the first time in almost 500 years! Being a Catholic does not hinder you in any way in England, unless you plan on claiming the throne, in which case you would be barred from doing so.

LHO left the book depository building by bus.  When traffic clogged up he exited the bus and took a cab to his rooming house.  At his rooming house he put on a light jacket and tucked a pistol in his waist.

While walking to an unspecified location he was confronted by Officer Tippett of the Dallas PD.  For reasons unknown, he pumped several bullets into Officer Tippett, including a final fatal head shot.  Several witnesses observed the incident.

He briskly departed the scene on foot.  He eventually ducked into the Texas Theater without paying.  Witnesses reported his whereabouts to police who sped to the scene.

When the police entered the theater, Oswald jumped from his seat and shouted "This is it!"  He pulled his pistol and tried to fire it point blank at an officer.  The gun either failed to fire, or it has been reported that the officer somehow got his hand between the hammer and pin of the pistol (which seems unlikely).

After a physical confrontation with the officers in which Oswald was pummeled pretty good, he was arrested and taken into custody.

There's a lot of information from the Warren report in the reference from Wikipedia, however, if you believe the Warren report you didn't live through that time.  In answer to the one that said JFK was not a nice man anyway don't worry about it, if all the Presidents that were not "nice men" were gunned down by the FBI director in conjunction with the Mafia we would have had an assassination of every president.  You don't get to be in that position by being a "nice man."  Do a little research on almost any one of them, they were egotistical, self righteous, war mongers, unfaithful to their wives,  and many other things.  I'm not saying those are necessarily bad characteristics in a president though.

i think America gave the final push but i think Britain took a lot during the entire war and shouldn't be forgotten nor that they've been working since then as well.  Russia also involved gave lots of their sons to that war. So the Answer is no without Britain and Russia  holding them off for so long who knows what would have happened Germany could have been spread out to far to stop.  So at least this American knows how important other countries were. and i would ask the question do all other countries think we're arrogant  not everyone is if you think that i would say your ignorant and believe things off TV.

I think there are many Americans who get their history lessons from Hollywood movies.  They are not taught that Roosevelt did not get involved in the war until Pearl Harbour - which was after the Battle of Britain.  American opinion would not allow any involvement in the war before then.  They also never learn about lend-lease and the fact that America was the only country that earned millions from the war.  Yes, the Americans played an important part in the war but they were well paid for it.  In Europe, America mainly mopped up but did not play a major part in it.

Personally, I don't believe WWII could have been won without the combined efforts of a number of nations. 
America did not "just sit back and watch". The U.S. remained neutral until the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Some might argue that our involvement in WWII prior to any direct attack to our country would have been wrong.
Anyway, it is very hard to tell what all the Americans think about World War Two. I am sure many of them agree that America was not the only country who fought against Japan and Germany. Please do not judge an entire country on a single book.

Scouse is right.

There's an element in Britain who think "we won the war". It wasn't any one nation or people.

The UK - and particularly England (I'm Scottish) - was the only country able and willing to stand up to Hitler; but for that, the war would have been lost before it really began. Things like "The Blitz" and Battle of Britain are truly heroic episodes in the war, the former because of the immense courage of the English people - civilians - , the latter because it is, rightly, portrayed as a romantic "last stand" that came out right.



The USA sustained the UK through the worst of the war; without "lend-lease" and the willingness of US politicians to support the UK, it's very probable the UK would have starved or been defeated (not allowing, of course, for the sheer stupidity of Goerring and Hitler).

The USSR, as Scouse says, bore the brunt of the Nazi war-machine at huge cost; they ultimately, broke the Nazis. It's an astonishing story, heart-breakingly moving.

In the end, though, the USA did "win" the war; World War 2 saw the final end of the last of the European empires (The British), the descent of the USSR under Stalin and the emergence of the USA as the principle super-power.

Power is shifting now - once more to Russia, and to China, India and the east, with the European Nations forming another, proto-super-power. This is a process that has been going on for centuries and is far from finished now.

The USA did win the War of Independence !

im sure most americans dont think they won wwii alone, just as most british people dont think they did.
the fact is that the deciding factor in german defeat was the ussr.



during wwi in order to defeat germany, the western allies had to endure climactic battles such as the somme, verdun, paschendale etc, which saw the deaths of thousands of allied troops in short periods of time. the western front was curiously devoid of equivalent battles in wwii. this was essentially because the soviets endured a hundred sommes and verduns, meaning the west didnt have to, they won the war, no body else. britain could not have dealt a decisive blow to germany without the united states. the united states could not have intervened on the ground (in a decisive way) in europe without britain. both nations greatly helped the ussr in its campaign, strategic bombing, prevention of maritime trade, draining of german army resources, giving material support to the ussr etc. but ultimately if any one nation is going to be said to be the most crucial in the defeat of nazi germany, it is the soviet union. 
i realise my answer focuses entirely on the western theatre of war, as opposed to that in the far east, in which clearly the americans were the deciding factor.

Yeah, Stephen Ambrose does tend to think that the yanks won world war 2 alone. The fact the red army wiped out 60% of the Wehrmacht on their own doesn't seem to matter to him. Also the Fact that without the RAF having effectively won total air superiority over the British skies in 1940, casualties on the normandy beaches would have been significantly higher. However, to be fair, the americans provided technical and financial support even when they were supposedly "neutral".

<answer>



Hernán Cortés de Monroy y Pizarro, 1st Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca (Spanish pronunciation: [ɛrˈnan korˈtɛs]; 1485–December 2, 1547) was a Spanish conquistador who led the expedition that caused the fall of the Aztec empire and brought large portions of mainland Mexico under the King of Castile, in the early 16th century. Cortés was part of the generation of Spanish colonizers that began the first phase of the Spanish colonization of the Americas.[1]

Born in Medellín, Extremadura, Spain, to a family of lesser nobility, Cortés chose to pursue a livelihood in the New World. He went to Hispaniola and later to Cuba, where he received an encomienda and, for a short time, became alcalde (magistrate) of the second Spanish town founded on the island. In 1519, he was elected captain of the third expedition to the mainland, an expedition which he partly funded. His enmity with the governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, resulted in the latter recalling the expedition at the last moment, an order which Cortés ignored. Arriving on the continent, Cortés executed a successful strategy of allying with some indigenous peoples against others. He also used a native woman, Doña Marina, as interpreter; she would later bear Cortés a son. When the Governor of Cuba sent emissaries to arrest Cortés, he fought them and won, using the extra troops as reinforcements. Cortés wrote letters directly to the king asking to be acknowledged for his successes instead of punished for mutiny. After he overthrew the Aztec empire, Cortés was awarded the title of Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca, while the more prestigious title of Viceroy was given to a high-ranking nobleman, Antonio de Mendoza. Cortés returned to Spain in 1541 where he died peacefully but embittered.

If Port Moresby fell, it would give Japan control of the seas to the immediate north of Australia.

It was initially meant to be a sea borne assault. The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought from May 4 – May 8, 1942, with most of the action occurring on May 7 and May 8, was a major naval battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II between the Imperial Japanese Navy and the United States and Australia. The Japanese lost sufficient of it's force that it turned back, even though technically they had won the engagement.

It was standard practice with the Japanese to attack around their target. They had done the same with other colonies around the rim. They launched an assault down to port Morseby over the Owen Stanley Ranges via the Kokoda Trail and Buna.



The Kokoda Track campaign or Kokoda Trail campaign was part of the Pacific War of World War II. The campaign consisted of a series of battles fought from July to November 1942 between Japanese and Allied — primarily Australian — forces in what was then the Australian territory of Papua.

The differences are large - firstly, Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland are seperate countries, with, at the time seperate wealth. Ireland was much poorer than England.

Secondly, as the area was so important, it is impossible to give such a general view.

We also need to know the background for the woman - for instance - in Ireland, up until at least the 1960's, a woman who had given birth to a child out of wedlock, would be treated abysmally. (Magdalen Laundries for instance.)

Because the 'owners' - removed in many cases from the cultures which created them by numerous centuries - were neglecting or abusing them. Islamic caliphs, for example, wantonly destroyed Egyptian artifacts as anti-islamic.

To their owners? Those owners died centuries ago. Great Britain shouldn't feel guilty about anything because Great Britain is just an area on the map where a large population of people with individualistic qualities who agree and disagree on matters such as this live. And the Chinese, Greeks, Persians, Italians, Egyptians and Indians shouldn't feel like victims because the group of victims living in those countries died centuries ago as well, and again, a country is just an area of areas connected through a very small group of people who proclaim themselves as "rulers/lawmakers" of those areas.

How about also, for example, Spain returns all the Inca gold it stole ?
.........



By July 1533 more than 24 tons of exquisite treasure had been collected: idols and chalices, necklaces and nuggets, accumulated through centuries of placer mining. Though this was only a fraction of the plunder that awaited the Spaniards elsewhere in the Four Quarters of the World, Atahuallpa's ransom, as duly recorded in the Spanish archives, was worth at least 267 million dollars at today's bullion values for gold ($315 ounce-Nov/02/1997-) and silver........

Do bear in mind that many of these artifacts and "masterpieces" were actually being destroyed, broken-up, damaged and sold off by the countries from which they were created.

A prime example would be the Elgin Marbles which were rescued from being broken up by the Ottoman Empire (who occupied Greece at the time) as they were using the Acropolis as a military fort, when the 7th Lord Elgin paid the Turks a vast amount of money for him to take them and keep them safe.



Another example, should you require it, would be the the tomb of King Tutankhamun and other sarcophagi that were removed. These priceless artifacts were being looted by locals and sold off piecemeal to tourists. Howard Carter and Lord Carnarvon primarily wished to discover them to keep them preserved. Those that lay unclaimed were eventually stripped bare by Egyptian grave-robbers.

Oooh - you're right, we should give back all the treasures that we have carefully and at massive cost preserved for years, for all the world to see, rather than leaving them in countries where civil wars were raging or dictators ruling.

Quick. Get the Persian (thankyou so much for reminding us that this is now Iran), masterpieces, and send them straight back. And whilst we are at it, lets put the plundered pieces of art that Saddam and Hitler took, and stick 'em right back where they came from.

By the way, your final sentance should read "I think THAT Great Britain should give back THESE ITEMS, to their owners.

As others have stated, Alaska and Hawaii.

But technically USA might have only 46 states, not 50.  Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia are Commonwealths rather than states.

Virginia (one of the 13 original states) declared itself a commonwealth in 1776, shortly followed by Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.  Kentucky (which had been part of Virginia) became a commonwealth in 1792.

Puerto Rico also declared itself as a commonwealth of the USA in 1952, but is not a US state.

Rolling Thunder was a sustained air campaign against North Vietnam lasting from March 2, 1965 to November 1 1968.
The objectives changed over time from morale boosting in Saigon to trying to reduce support for the Viet Cong from North Vietnam to interdicting supplies from the north to the insurgency.
Due to the restrictions on U.S. and allied air operations, forbidding them from attacking certain areas, and the support for the the Viet Cong and NOrth VIetnam by other communist nations the operation was a failure.  None of the objectives were obtained.
John McCain was shot down as part of Operation Rolling Thunder

Ultimately futile attempt to bomb the North Vietnamese Resistance into submission during the 1960's as part of the Vietnam War, which caused unnecessary suffering and destruction of the civilian population. As the Vietnamese fighting forces were able to exist in tunnel complexes (such as the Cu Chi tunnels near HCMC - the former Saigon) and defend themselves with primitive weaponry the operation achieved few, if any of its obectives, and is one of the ignominious periods of US military history.

Operation Rolling Thunder ( 2 march 1965 - 1 November 1968) was one of the many air campaigns of the Vietnam war. It's objectives were:

1. bolster the Saigon regime
2. convince the North Vietnamese to cease supporting the Viet Cong in South Vietnam
3. to destroy the North Vietnamese air defense system,  transportation system and industrial base
4. to interdict the flow of men and material into South Vietnam

Rolling Thunder was the most intense air/ground battle of the Cold War and at its conclusion was deemed a failure, because it had not achieved any of its goals.

Actually, Hitler did claim to be a vegetarian and a teetotaler, but in fact there are witnesses that he both drank beer and loved German sausage.  Due to digestion problems he probably did not indulge in either very often.  He was not concerned about the morality of eating meat.

They used whatever they had available to make their own sanitary towels. Another answer correctly describes the origins of the phrase "on the rag" as a euphemism for menstruating.

But Victorian women could buy commercially produced sanitary products from 1888, when Southall's Sanitary Towels first went on sale, soon followed by Hartmann's of London sometime around 1900.



As for women shaving, they almost had certainly been shaving for a long time by the Victorian age. Men were shaving facial hair for thousands of years, and art suggests women also shaved. You never see much pubic hair in art do you? Is it just artistic licence, or where the artists' models actually shaven? I would say they were almost certainly shaven.

Most working class women of menstrual age were either malnourished, pregnant or nursing babies. All of these suppress the hormones needed for periods. Body hair was not a problem as hair done the job it was designed.... it kept you warm. Aren't you lucky today!!!!

Periods were not a problem. They didn't have Kotex or Modess pads, so they made their own. They were called rags, but were just pieces of material that were folded and secured in place. They were washed clean and kept for re-used. Pretty ecologically sound, in fact. 
The notion of shaving airm pits and legs is fairly recent - if you look at Victoria dreses, they all have long sleeves and no one could see what your arm pits looked like - and Victorian women wore long dresses as well - no shorts, even in the middle of summer - so hair on the legs was just regarded as normal and no one could see it in any case.

- they were able to trade freely BUT even after the war, the  British were still America's leading trading partner
- the Articles of the Confederation banned the national govt. from issuing or collecting taxes, and from controlling interstate commerce; this lowered the nation's overall economy since for the time between the war until the Constitution, the states undermined eachother's trade/etc.

Switzerland enjoyed a favorable reputation in America until recently. Today, after a relentless and astonishingly one-sided media campaign, there is scarcely a horror tale about the Swiss too extreme or absurd to be picked up in the press.



The assault began with widely circulated allegations--the truth is less clear-cut than news reports have made it sound--that Swiss banks swallowed great sums deposited in private accounts by victims of the Holocaust. (At press time, Swiss banks had reached a tentative agreement to settle those allegations, and avert threatened sanctions, by paying more than $1 billion.) Picking up its own momentum, the indictment soon expanded into a depiction of the Swiss as a nation of heartless profiteers, "Hitler's silent partners," working to advance the Nazi cause without being shot at. In June the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center made worldwide headlines by issuing a report claiming that pro-Nazi activity "thoroughly saturated the core of Swiss society." Teenagers now grow up hearing that the Swiss spent World War II rooting for the Axis powers.



Now Stephen Halbrook, an attorney and well-known Second Amendment expert (he's the author of 1984's That Every Man Be Armed), has taken a much-needed look at the Swiss wartime record in a new book titled Target Switzerland: Swiss Armed Neutrality in World War II. The book not only provides a starting point for all future discussions of Switzerland's military role in the war but also makes an interesting contribution to the literature on both federalism and gun rights. According to Halbrook, Switzerland's traditions of extreme decentralization and of an armed populace played a key role in preserving its freedom in an hour of peril.



Switzerland virtually invented the policy of "armed neutrality": It started no wars and sought no empire, but defended itself with ferocity when attacked. This policy committed it to staying out of other nations' quarrels and trading with all belligerents to the extent permitted by circumstance. The rise of modern nationalism, with its presumption that national boundaries should reflect commonalities of language and lineage, posed a direct challenge to the reasons for Switzerland's existence. Only historical accident, it seemed to nationalist thinkers, separated Swiss Germans (the majority) from the mass of Germans. 
By the same logic Swiss French clearly belonged with their fellow French-speakers and Swiss Italians with Italy. By the late 1930s, Nazi cartographers were provocatively including German-speaking Swiss cantons in their maps of Grossdeutschland. The Swiss Federal Council replied as follows: "We reject the concept of race or common descent as the basis of a state and as the factor determining political frontiers." The Swiss "national idea," said the council, rests instead on a "spiritual decision" to commit to certain values, of which the most important, it added pointedly, were federalism, democracy, and "respect for the dignity of the individual."

Because the Swiss were an "Aryan" nation by his standards, they did not pose a military threat to Germany, they provided a useful place for unofficial contact with other nations, neutral or allied. Most importantly, invasion of Switzerland would have required a ridiculous amount of troops. This is a nation that had provided some of the best mercienaries in the world centuries before, and that had maintained its nuetrality by maintaining a militia-based military system. Fighting Switzerland literally meant(and means) fighting every adult male in the country, and given the terrain, the natives enjoyed a major advantage. So, Hitler chose to concentrate on places that were real threats to him, or what he imagined were real threats.

Quite simple - a ship from the Cape, perhaps stopping off at the coaling stations of Mombasa and Aden - and then on to whichever Indian port was nearest - probably Bombay.  Then by train to Peshawar and the rest either on foot, if infantry, or mounted if cavalry.
The whole journey a matter of a couple of weeks. maybe ten days.

hello

Ochre was the most important painting material used traditionally by Aboriginal people. It is mined from particular sites and is a crumbly to hard rock heavily coloured by iron oxide. The source material was traded extensively across Australia in the past, with some material traveling many hundreds or even thousands of kilometres from where it was mined to where it was used. It comes in a variety of colours from pale yellow to dark reddish-brown

Ochres give a rich warm colour to contemporary artworks from the Western Desert, Kimberley and Arnhem Land. The surfaces it was used on varied widely from rock, wood and bark to the skin of participants in ceremonies. Red ochre was particularly important amongst desert peoples as it symbolises the blood of ancestral beings.



note that ochre is mined from the earth , has natural earth pigments, and therefore represents mother nature in it purest form ... hence its desirability to the aborigines

The Fuzzy Wuzzies were Papa natives that helped Australian soldiers. They helped carry supplies and wounded and dead Australian soldiers. They didn't actually do any of the fighting but they played a vital role in defeating the Japanese.
They were given this name because of the type of hair they had which was curly.

Credo che Leonardo, in realtà, leggesse, pochissimo. E per pochissimo intendo quel poco che circolava in volgare, perché lui, uomo del rinascimento, era un figlio illegittimo e, invece di poter andare a a scuola o avere pedagoghi, in giovanissima età è stato messo a bottega a imparare un mestiere. Quindi non conosceva il latino, lingua nella quale sono stati scritte tutte le opere scientifiche fino al '700. Anche qui sta la sua grandezza, tutto quello che ha pensato, tutto quello che ha fatto, tutto quello che ha escogitato, lo ha fatto senza poter accedere ai testi scientifici dell'epoca.

The Soviets won.

The US lost a trading partner (95% of Cuba's trade was with the US, even when it was illegal under the Spanish).  The Cubans were forced to turn to the Soviets for aid, which meant the Soviets could plant a military base right in Cuba.

"factual" or not, the new testament had (and still has) a huge impact on the development of "western" culture, political ideals, ruling methods, patriarchies, etc.  the language of the new testament is also important: greek.  why not latin, hebrew, or some other language of the time?

"EDITOR'S NOTE: This article does not debate the divinity nor the spiritual aspects of Christianity, but only the historical evidence that Jesus Christ did, in fact, exist. The recent finding of the burial cave of Caiaphas, the high priest, adds even more evidence to the general historical truth of the New Testament."

Truth is a little of both. I mean if you look at the trial and crucifixion of Jesus it is historically true overall. There are some issues within it that seem to not be correct but the way it was handled is and is used by professors of history to show how Roman Law worked. While some aspects can not be proven by historical record many can be. We know where one of the church is that Paul wrote to in what is now Turkey. So yes parts of the New Testament are supported by historical fact. Now we do not know about things like the resurrection and so on that is something that is for faith.

<answer>



As a previous answer alludes to, the actual existence of Jesus as a real historical figure is debatable - there are surprisingly few extant sources other than biblical and religious texts, which clearly possess something of a bias. Ultimately, if Jesus himself is open to question, many of the events in the new testament are themselves doubtable, even before you start dealing with miraculous goings on.



What is also clear is that the new testament was a political construct - a great number of alternative writings were simply left out as they didn't fit with the aims of the people putting the new testament together, or indeed contradicted the words of other books. What was ultimately accepted as the teachings of Christ were what was acceptable to Christ's followers at that time. Other teachings that were unacceptable politically or were just inconvienient were simply discarded. Again, this has to bring into question any historial accuracy claimed from the bible.



In the end, the only real source we have for the truth of the words in the bible are the bible itself. It's fairly simple logic that you can't argue the truth of the bible by saying that the bible says it's true therefore it must be. As with most things religion, it all comes back to faith.



Edit... to clarify, my personal feeling is that jesus was a real person - I doubt much of the rest of attributed to him, but it would have taken an extraordinary effort to make him up out of nothing. However, for those of your repliers to this question making blanket statements that Jesus was fact and so was the much of the rest of the new testament, the following websites demonstrate there is a lively debate about the man's very existence, let alone his actions or teachings:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity...
http://www.tektonics.org/jesusexist/jesu...
http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_jc...

etc. There's plenty of others.

Pretty much all the major characters in the New Testament were real with additional documents , often from Roman sources, showing there existence.

Of course many of the acts within it are not verifiable however a lack of evidence is not evidence against anything.

Biblical archeology has been finding more and more each year to support both old and new testaments.

Some it does, some it doesn't, and some is for faith not historical knowledge.  Examples:
1. John the Baptist, Herod, and pretty much everyone mentioned in the NT is historical.  There are no reasonable grounds for doubting the existence of Jesus.
2. The birth story cannot be true as stated.  At the time of Jesus' birth, Judaea was not in the Roman Empire and did not pay Roman taxes.
3. incarnation and resurrection.

It was founded as a British penal colony. A little known fact is until our Revolution America was the main British penal colony. After the British lost they needed another, so they selected Australia. The union jack just refers to the British origins. The Australians have their strains with the British for the same reasons Americans do if we go back...Being arrogant is bad publicity. Hey thumbs down truth is the truth....

The US flag also has remnants of the Union Jack in it. The red, white and blue was taken from the British flag. Many parts of the Southern US was used as a British penal colony, the Carolina's and Georgia were major detention centers for convicts.  The southern accent in the US, is a far removed but distantly related English accent.



The State of Hawaii, uses a Union Jack in their flag. The only state in the United States to have a Union Jack incorporated in its design.
Hawaii was never a British colony, but England's recognition of the sovereign Kingdom of Hawaii and a period of being a British protectorate 1794–1843, as well as the nation implementing British English as its language besides Hawaiian, led to the unique design of the flag.  The Hawaiian Flag still flies above the Iolani Palace, the only royal palace on US soil.

their political systems, philosophical views and technology formed the basis of what is modern western society.
It's really too big a case to put in the space of a descent answer but there are too many things that influenced us in too many ways
a few important ones:
democracy.  the Greeks invented the concept and the romans developed it to a system with elected representation pretty similar to our modern democratic system.
philosophy.  The way we view the modern world today is based upon the works of the great Greek philosophers such as socrates and Plato.
Technology.  Modern road design, public sanitation and indoor plumbing were all developed by the romans also means for water transport and building techniques like concrete are roman inventions.
Modern medicine would be impossible without the first developments of the Greeks.
but again there's too many things to put in the space of just one answer

A large amount of the influence has to do with the educations that Americans received in America.  Most universities were founded to provide ministers to the pulpit, as a result they required students to learn Greek and Roman.  Most students didn't stop at these but went on to read various classical authors and their philosophy.



So you find the influence in their political philosophy and their art, why is America a Republic?  Why do half the buildings in Washington look like Acropolis knock-offs? Monticello, Mt. Vernon, every other American government building with a row of pillars, and pretty much every mansion of the antebellum south.  Why can you find so many Greek and Roman place and people names used as place names in the Ohio Valley?  Cinncinnati and the man it was named for tells you a lot about what those Rev war vets valued.

websites that say this, 
Most likely they're out there, but why not search the books Thomas Jefferson owned? or check that index of the latest John Adams biography, you'll find plenty of proof.

If you're talking about James VI of Scotland, who became James I of England, I'm not sure what you want.

He came to the throne after Elizabeth I.



He was a great-grandson of Margaret, her father Henry VIII's sister.



He united Scotland and England under one rule.



The English Parliament approved of his accession, as the other possible claimants were either illegitimate or had died.



James inherited a reasonably prosperous country, and there were no wars during his reign.

There's a whole big article on wikipedia, check it out.

The Japanes battleship Yamato.



The Yamato was built in so much secrecy that the US  Navy's Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) didn't even know how big until after the war!  The super guns on her main battery were 18" (460 mm) naval rifles that could throw a 2500 lb (600 kg) shell nearly 30 miles (42 km)!

While the heaviest all-gun warships ever built were certainly the Japanese Yamato class, displacing 65,027 tonnes (empty, including 21,266 tonnes of armour) and 72,800 tonnes (estimated, full load), the largest in terms of size were the USS Iowa class (BB61-64).



The Yamatos had an overall length of 862' 6", a beam of 121' at the waterline and drew 36'; the Iowas had a length of 887' 3", a beam of 108' 2" and drew 37' 2".



The Iowas were thus both longer (by about 25 feet) and of deeper draught (by at least 1') than the Yamatos.  Despite the narrower beam (13' less) this qualifies them as the largest all-gun warships ever built.



The main reason for this is that the Iowas were built to attain cruiser-type speeds of 33 knots (the Yamato did about 27 knots and most battleships of that generation 28-30 knots).  The Iowa's greater speed requirement (as a fast carrier escort) necessitated a greater hull length for the massive machinery required.

hello



Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna von Habsburg-Lothringen (November 2, 1755 – October 16, 1793), known to history as Marie Antoinette was born an Archduchess of Austria and later became Queen of France and Navarre



Marie Antoinette was married to Louis the Dauphin of France on May 16, 1770



The purpose of the marriages was to cement the various complex alliances that Maria Theresa had entered into in the 1750s due to the Seven Years' War, Austria's traditional enemy, France.



The marriage made Marie Antoinette the Queen of France.



In France , only a male heir could inherit the throne, and to ensure the bourbon family dynasty continued ... a son was essential



So in effect the only role of the queen was to bear a son ... a prince who would be trained to one day assume the role of King !



And daughters were usual as they could be married off to other princes/kings and thus cement other political alliances with other countries !



So all in all , children were an essential part of a queens royal duties !

she's not only a princess, she's the effing daughter of an absolute monarch and by that, she has the duty and obligation to produce heirs when she became the wife of the dauphin, the heir to the throne.



and besides, there's a rumor circulating then, during her time, that louis xvi was suffering from phimosis, and became quite impotent. and to quell those nasty rumours, she was torn between her duty to produce the next heir and desperation to stop the rumours of the king's impotence from turning into a royal scandal.



and as a royalty, children are assets, as they cement alliances made between countries, when they married off their children to other foreign royalties.

There is actually some dispute about that.
Sanskrit of India is claimed by some to go as far back in to prehistory as far as 9,000 Bce, it is generally accepted that it goes back to 3,000 Bce,



Cuneiform of the Babylonians is around 3,500 to 4,000 Bce and It's only contender is the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs at 3,800 Bce but the ancient Egyptian language was very detailed where as cuneiform was very simple markings that were used as a number system early on.



My personal opinion is with the Egyptians 3,800 to 4,000 Bce

Do you think Anne Boleyn pursued the king?



In some fictional accounts I've read (such as The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn by Robin Maxwell and The Lady in the Tower by Jean Plaidy), Anne was nervous when she learned of the king's affection for her and didn't encourage it at first; she only pushed him to get the divorce from Catherine when she realized what power she had over him. In another fictional account, Doomed Queen Anne by Carolyn Meyer, Anne sort of encouraged the king's affection by flirting with him and she sort of planned to have him fall in love with her. Obviously these are all fictional accounts and therefore probably fabricated, but I'm just curious as to what you think: was she upset when he took an interest in her, or excited?



</question>

I mean, do you think he just fell in love with her because of her wit and the way she stood out, or do you think she encouraged him by flirting?

Her family was extraordinarily ambitious, and saw her as a pawn in gaining power at court.  Once Henry was done with Anne's sister, Mary, then they saw an opportunity to gain additional power by putting Anne in his path.  One must consider that morality at court was not the same morality that most of the country practice, with regards to sex. Sex was the only currancy most women had to gain power and influence.  I'm sure she set out to attract him -- almost every woman at court did, because, let's face it, he WAS the King, and he was known to have a wandering eye.  I'm not sure she planned to be Queen, though, until Henry's frustration with being unable to have his way with her put the idea in her head that, perhaps, she could actually be Queen if she played her cards right. While most knew that Henry was anxious for a male heir, Catherine produced child after child from 1509 until November 1518.  In 1518, she was 33 years old, and by the time Henry fell for Anne Boleyn in 1525, Catherine was 40 years old, 6 years older than Henry, and past child bearing.  It took another eight years for Henry to divorce Catherine.  Presumably, during that time, Anne and Henry came to some sort of accomodation with regards to sexual favors -- that's a LONG time to wait to become Queen on the basis of a promise.

From what I have read in historical accounts Anne Boleyn was an extremely ambitious woman that new exactly what she wanted. That doesn't make her a power hungry vamp, but it doesn't mean she was an innocent angel either. She had much to to with feeding Henry with the Protestant dogma which they both used to their advantage in his putting away of Catherine of Aragon.



I have no idea if she was excited, shy, or whatever. I'm sure she loved Henry, but she wanted to be queen. She got what she wanted for awhile at least.

Anyone with ANY Jewish ancestry was killed. A friend of mine had his family's ancestry traced back to the 1600s by the Nazis, simply because they had large noses - the Nazis took this as a Jewish trait, and so thoroughly investigated the family. Thankfully for Harry, they found no Jewish heritage; unfortunately this wasn't the case for six million others.

hello



Mischling ("crossbreed" in German) was the German term used during the Third Reich era in the German Empire to denote persons deemed to have partial Jewish ancestry



As defined by the Nazi Nuremberg laws in 1935, a Jew was a person who had at least three Jewish grandparents, regardless of religious affiliation or self-identification. A person with two Jewish grandparents who either belonged to the Jewish religion or was married to a Jew or belonged to a Jewish organization or had two Jewish grandparents coupled with maternal illegitimacy was also legally "Jewish". People who did not belong to these 4 categorical conditions but who had two Jewish grandparents were Mischling of the first degree. Someone with only one Jewish grandparent was Mischling of the second degree



as a general rule only jews (with 3 or 4 jewish grandparents) were sent to the death camps



Mischling's were regarded as second class citizens but were not actively pursued,



According to the 1939 Reich census, there were about 72,000 Mischlings of the 1st degree, some 39,000 of the 2nd degree, and tens of thousands more of higher degrees.



According to historian and Israeli Army and U.S. Marine veteran Bryan Mark Rigg, up to 160 000 men of one-quarter, one-half, and even full Jewish men served in the German armed forces during World War II, including several generals and at least one field marshal



•future federal chancellor Helmut Schmidt, 2nd degree Mischling



•Kriegsmarine captain Bernhard Rogge, 2nd degree Mischling



•Wehrmacht soldier and Nazi model Werner Goldberg, 1st-degree Mischling



•Luftwaffe builder Erhard Milch (Jewish father and Gentile mother, 1st degree Mischling) reclassified as Aryan by Adolf Hitler.



•Luftwaffe general Helmut Wilberg, 1st degree Mischling and declared Aryan in 1935 by Hitler.



•General and 1st-degree Mischling Arty Johannes Zukertort, who received the German Blood Certificate; brother of General Karl Zukertort.



•General and 1st-degree Mischling Karl Zukertort, who received the German Blood Certificate; brother of General Arty Johannes Zukertort.
•Colonel Walter H. Hollaender, 1st degree Mischling receiving the German Blood Certificate.



•Commander Paul Ascher, 1st degree Mischling receiving the German Blood Certificate.



•Iron Cross-awarded soldier Horst Geitner, 1st degree Mischling



you'de would have been regarded as a 1st degree Mischling so would not necessarily have gone to a death camp,  your mom would have been executed, and your dad ... probably sent to a work camp for reeducation

In Germany, HItler was very intolerant towards all people who were NOT Aryans, the purest and highest class of Germans. They alone were considered the most strongest who could maintain their strength and rid Germany of all those who were Jews, gypsies, Poles or phsically or mentally disabled Germans. Even if your mother is Jewish you would be severely punished or would have been gassed in the various killing centres after being made to thrive in the ghettos. Every German hated the Jews or those who even looked like them. Once you have been found suspicious then the people would find immense pleasure in handing you over to the police. This was so because Nazis wanted only people who were the finest and no one else not even if you had a single feature of a Jew though they were highly assimiliated in the Nazi Germany. Your condition may be better than your parents however as they would have been punished, especially the mother who bears "bad","impure"  children in the country.

Anne died in April (some say May) of 1945 she died about a month before the camp she was held at was liberated, she died of typhus.
She wrote a famous diary.
She lived with 9 people.
She was an amazing person and many people read her diary because she died at such a young age for being Jewish by the pigdog Nazis.
She is actually German, her family moved to the Netherlands when Hitler rose to power.
They lived in the attic of a house hidden by many other houses behind her dads Companies building.
Who thumbed me down? Well I answered the question well....

If you google her name you will get more info in Wikepedia than in here.



She died from typhoid in a Nazi concentration camp during in March 1945 at age 16.
She was 13 when given a diary that she used to chronicle her life and time in hiding from the Nazi's during the occupation of the Netherlands by the Germans because of her Dutch heritage.



8 people hid all together. The Frank's another family with a son Peter and a dentist.



Her father was the only survivor when they had been found and sent to the camps.  I think he died in the 80's or 90's.



Her diary had been found by him after the war and he had it published. It won a pulitzer prize and is regarded as one of the best chronicles of the Holocaust because it was written by a teenager.

Anne Frank was born on June 12, 1929 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany as the second daughter of Otto Frank and Edith Hollander Frank. Anne spent the first few years of her life in a mixed neighborhood of Christian and Jewish children, and spent many afternoons playing with her older sister, Margot. In March 1933, Adolf Hitler’s Nazi party was elected in Frankfurt, and anti-Semitic measures were put into effect immediately. Otto Frank, fearing for his family’s safety, began to search for a new home in Amsterdam. Edith, Margot, and Anne moved to Aachen, Germany to stay with their grandmother until Otto Frank secured a new job and an apartment in Amsterdam. Otto was joined by the rest of his family in February 1934. Anne began school and attended a Montessori school where she enjoyed reading and writing.



Anne had a very good relationship with her sister, although their personalities were polar opposites. Anne was very outgoing, energetic and extraverted, while Margot was quiet, dedicated to her studies and introverted. The next few years in the Netherlands were relatively quiet, but the Franks kept hearing stories from friends in Germany about the deteriorating conditions for the Jewish population.



Otto Frank established a second company in June 1938 with Herman Van Pels, whose family would join the Franks in their hiding place. The Van Pels had also fled Germany in 1938 because of the escalating anti-Semitism. The escalating anti-Semitism also became evident in the Netherlands, and in May 1940, the Germans invaded the Netherlands, and immediately began to impose restrictions on the Jewish population. The restrictions included the registration of all Jews, segregation into Jewish schools, and the requirement that Jews wear a yellow star to distinguish them from other citizens.



In 1941, Anne started to attend the Jewish Lyceum, and had to leave many of her friends behind, and was discouraged to talk to them. The discriminatory laws continued to get worse over the course of the next year. Anne experienced a brief period of happiness when she turned 13 on June 12, 1942. Anne received a red, blue, and white plaid autograph book from her father, which she decided to use as a diary.



In July 1942, Margot received a notice to report for transportation to a Jewish work camp. Otto Frank then informed Anne of their plan to hide in the rooms behind Otto’s office at 263 Prinsengracht. This plan had to be moved up a few weeks so that Margot would not be forced to go to the camp. The Franks moved into the Secret Annexe on the morning of July 6, 1942. According to Anne, she had to squeeze into two vests, three pairs of pants, a dress, a skirt, a jacket, a summer coat, two pairs of stockings, lace-up shoes, a woolly cap, and a scarf before leaving for the Secret Annexe because if the Franks had suitcases, they would look very suspicious.



The Franks were eventually joined by four others in their hiding place: the Van Pels family and Fritz Pfeffer (the family dentist and friend). Anne recorded the most intimate details of daily life during her two-year stay in the Secret Annexe, and conveyed her fear of being discovered almost daily. The members of the Secret Annexe passed time reading and studying. Anne wrote almost daily in her diary until her last diary entry on August 1, 1944. Three days later on August 4, 1944, the Franks, Van Pels, and Mr. Pfeffer were discovered and arrested by the Gestapo. They were then sent on to concentration camps. All members of the Secret Annex except Otto Frank died in the camps. It is believed that Anne died of typhus in February or March 1945.



When Otto Frank returned to Amsterdam, he was given Anne’s diary that had been forgotten when the Gestapo came. The diary was first published in German in 1947, and then published in America in 1952. Several films and documentaries have also been made about Anne’s experience in the Secret Annexe. Eleanor Roosevelt wrote the introduction to the diary’s American edition, and described the diary as "one of the wisest and most moving commentaries on war and its impact on human beings that I have ever read."

Referring to the 5 (i believe) roman values?



-They showed their devotion towards their families by doing deeds worthy of honor. This honor was often bestowed upon the family as a whole, not just on the family member who did the deed.



-They respected the patriarchal dominance in society. (this means they respected that the father was the main head of the family). And they obeyed the wishes and showed reverence of this family figure.



I hope this helps you :-)

That was the handywork of British bullying, specifically, intellectual.  The tyranny of the British empire has never been burning houses, killing people en-masse, or genocide of any sort.  The Brits have been accused of something much worse than that; cultural tyranny.  Anywhere the British went, they sought to "bully" the English language onto the populace.  Not just the language but British costums, culture, etc, basically, the goal of the British empire was to make the whole world British.



Not as in ruled by the British, they wanted everyone to think like the British, to talk like the British even take a dump like the British.  See therein lies the animosity towards them; you will notice that in the vast majority of nonwhite areas that the Brits ruled, the majority of the inhabitants are still alive.  While the empire wasn't shy about blood letting, it wasn't anywhere near as bloodthirsty as they U.S. was towards native americans.  Ultimately though, this resulted, in places in Africa, of entire cultures and histories being erased outright.  And it nearly happened in India if it wasn't for the fact that many descendants of the upper castes and Tamil royalty stubbornly held on to traditional modes of Indian education, which I believe still exist but are not very common.



Indians look at history from the western point of view, because of Brit cultural bullying.  The Brits were a bit of a paradox; on the one hand wanting to get rich of everyone else, but on the other hand seemingly driven by guilt with a mentality of "okay; we exploited them, and raped some of their women, the least we could do is Britanize them so that when we leave they'll be civilized...."  In a nutshell, that's the British empire for you.....



Britain saw itself as a latter day "messiah" culture, and they felt their culture was such a high achievement, that EVERYBODY just HAD to be British.  Everyone had to play cricket, drink tea and eat crumpets and all that bullcrap.



You want to see the results of British cultural bullying?  The most highly educated people in Hong Kong, and yes they're fully Chinese genetically some of them, all have British accents, as thick as any upper class Brit's.  You will hear British accents among black people in Africa, and, because of the close ties, many people from Iraq have British accents.  In fact I think Britain has the largest Iraqi diaspora community, and they all sound British now, and because of the value Arabs place on education, they all sound like upper class "snob" Brits.



lol.



I'm sorry but, the British upper class accent will forever be tied to snobery and arrogance.

Writers are free willed and free thinkers. Writing in India was very popular and you can see the number of books written by our great Rishis - like - Four Vedas, Four Up-Vedas, more than 110 Unishads, Six Shastras, Un-countable number of Puranas - 18 by Ved Vyasa and then the longest and the oldest Epics of Ramayana by Balmiki and Mahabharta by Ved Vyasa. What the Europeans have of that period?
Even we had a Golden Age of Sanskrit literature after the A.D. period. The Gem is mathematician Arya Bhatt and the Poet Kalidasa and many more. Space does not allow. Then came the reign of terror through Mohd. Ghori and his followers. All the existing libraries were burnt, universities destroyed  and the students and teachers were killed. Period shifted to Mughal kings - AD 1526. Sanskrit Language replaced with Persian and some easy languages developed through contacts of the invaders with the local public. Hindi and Urdu and Punjabi languages evolved. Next came the reign of English. When their converters, teachers, nuns, priests and historians with no knowlege of India or Indians or our culture and its old religious philosophy and great kings and their lives - they were simply surprised and astonished. They wanted to know through the interpreters, the essence of our highly valued and deep philophical literature. Naturally, they felt small. Because they had only Chaucer and Langland as old writers and few others at later stage - like - Marlow, Shakespear and Wordsworth, Keats etc. who had written in praise of the queens and places & language.  Nothing more. India's past which was so glorious they simply could not listen or bear. They wanted to exploit the rich to make them more richer and bestow on them degrees like Rai Bahadur and Sir etc. The poors were ready for conversion as they were needing both ends meat. With the help of  our greedy sanskrit knowing pandits and scholars, they started mis-interpretting  even the Vedas. Mr. Maxmueller called himself a  Sanskrit Scholar and Indians like Sayanacharya and other Indian Pandit have mis-translated our such scholarly literature which has no other equals in the whole world. The only thing is - even our own govt. which is a secular - hardly pays any attention to the study of Sanskrit so that the oldest culture of India with richest legends and history could be taught to our students.  But are giving step motherly treatment to Sanskrit without which we cannot reach and achieve our lost glory. Because of this, it has become our general attitude to study our own books in the form of translations and never could know the Truth. It is our leaders who committed the mistake at the time of receiving Independence and writing our Constitution. They followed the policy of prefering Indians knowing English and doing the clerical jobs. Even today we are studying the job giving studies like Bisness Managements, Administrations, IT and the like. For all the sophisticated services, Mughals used to call the Iranians and the Indians are consulting and believing the English. The oldest Universities of Kandhar - The Takshila, the Kashi University and others are no more. So, friend, we have started looking for the stale things and do not seek freshness which is in originals - The India was that.

If there was WHAT ?....Modern technology and science ....Or Egyptian ancient language ??? I think that it would be possible if  the "Defenders of the faith" and the "Fathers of modern science" had not destroyed all of the remains that they found "offensive" and if the items they found were ALL protected and studied in whole , and not sold to the highest bidder. And I believe that the items that had no retail value were left to ruin and lost forever, and so the language may never be completely "decoded".

The ability of a computer to read, understand, and decipher ANY language is the holy grail of A.I., and the wet dream of every geek, nerd and hacker.  The reason that is, is because the human brain's modus operandi, that is, its "software," is rooted in language and it can be argued that all "intelligence" is, is data processing and coding using various symbols since language is not restricted to just words and numbers.  The sheer complexity just of the human being's biological computer system, has made that an imposibility.  So far.



Computer technology, even that cutting edge artificial neuron technology that the U.S., Israeli and Saudi militaries use, can still only do what they are programmed to do.  If a computer had the ability to understand a language it has never encountered before, it would be smarter than we are.  To be able to understand ANY form of communication, and to use existing data in a way that lets it decipher something it has never seen before, would be the ultimate in computers, and something, like I said, smarter than us.



What you are talking about is the Rossetta stone, and ancient Egyptian language has already been decoded by linguists a long time ago.  It was tedius work from what I read, but the results paid off; much of what we know of the ancient world, from Babylon, to Persia, and even India and China, comes from Egypt.  The ancient Egyptian kingdom ruled as far south as the Sudan you know; and from the Sudan, ships sometimes arrived from as far away as India.  Also, the ancient language that has yet to be decoded is I believe Sumerian; there is no language like it anywhere on this planet, and some quaks and cranks take that as evidence that they were aliens because of their monstrously huge eyes.  Sumerians are generally depicted as having enormous, unnaturally large eyes, no one knows why.



To answer your question more directly, again, that achievement would be the ultimate in computers; we are talking the "mother brain" computer of the Matrix movies here, a computer on that level, or, like the one from I-Robot (V.I.C.K.I.)  Although I don't think there is a "C" there....



hope this was adequate.

<answer>



The 'Rashid stone' is better known as the Rosetta Stone, a bilingual decree by Ptolemy V Epiphanes thanking the priesthood for not supporting Ankhennefer's rebellion, the virtue of which is that it is inscribed in Greek, hieroglyphic Egyptian and demotic Egyptian.



And no, modern technology and science would be unable to understand ancient Egyptian without having had the use of at least one bilingual text or copy text in Egyptian and another language (e.g. a treaty), or hints from ancient authors (e.g. Ammianus Marcellinus providing a translation of an inscription on a pillar or obelisk at Thebes).  Fortunately the Egyptians were thoughtful enough to provide us with sufficient clues to understand the vast majority of their written language.



Translating an ancient language has a number of difficulty thresholds, beginning with the script.  The cuneiform script was often used in the ancient near east for official diplomatic documents, which could be written in Akkadian (the usual language of diplomacy) or in the language of the country addressed or addressing, but still using the cuneiform script.



The next difficulty is the nature of the writing system itself: is it alphabetic, syllabic, ideographic or even (like hieroglyphic ancient Egyptian) all three?  Alphabetic systems are usually easy to recognise, because they contain between twenty and forty characters, with character groups frequently repeated.  Syllabic systems usually have a greater number of characters, often hundreds or even thousands. Ideographic writing is usually a development of syllabic, where a single character is used to convey a concept or phrase, and supplements rather than replaces the basic syllabic system.  Characters such as 'determinatives', which differentiate meaning in otherwise similar words but have no inherent syllabic or semantic value, need to be recognised as such.



Then there is the language itself, which can present unfamiliar or even unique challenges in both vocabulary and grammar, and even in context.  Translation of 'Hittite' has been hampered by inability to relate the place names in the texts to actual geography.  A language may be largely understood but some texts unusable because of one or two unknown words whose potential meaning could alter the entire understanding of the text.  Understanding an ancient script and language is a formidable exercise, and without confirmation from other, more familiar sources (Greek in the case of the Rosetta stone and similar bilingual inscriptions) it is hard to be sure that one's understanding is correct.



Hence one cannot use computers to try and 'auto-translate' an unknown language.  One needs to understand certain essential features about the script, the nature of the writing system and the language itself before one can make sense of available texts.  This is very much a human activity, and science and technology can only support, not replace or even supplement, the dedicated work of human beings.

<answer>



There are two things that can help crack an previously untranslated language.



One is a translation key, like the Rosetta Stone, where it has the unknown language in parallel inscriptions with at least one known.  In that case, it was Greek, hieratic (Egyptian non-formal writings), and the hieroglyphics which are famous.



The other thing is sample size.  The more samples of writing, the easier it is to find common words, phrases, etc.  Linear A has been translated, but Linear B (ironically an older language) has never been translated.  Archaeologists have found only a few scraps of Linear B, far too little to translate.



Computers are more than capable of learning a language, but they need a large enough sample size to produce an accurate translation.  And until we build a truly learning computer, they won't be any better at solving problems we can't solve.  They can solve problems we know how to solve much faster than we can; but don't learn yet.



And haven't we all seen enough Sci-Fi to see what happens when we build a learning computer?  ;-)

I've got a QUESTION for you! About the Enlightenment Era!!!!!!?



Come on, I know everyone's EXCITED to hear my question...Or not.



" Explain how the Enlightenment has had a long term impact on the west's belief in progress, increased secularization and belief in individualism.  "



I'm kind of confused, because...well. I don't really know how it impacted the west.
For any of you who don't know...The Enlightenment was and era mainly in Europe & North America. It was basically people saying, "Hey, I can think for myself! Religion is a bunch of crap, science explains everything, and I'm generally a good person, who's whole Good/Bad thoughts were shaped through my environment, parent's friends, and everyone else around me!"

Well, the west IS Europe and North America!



The Enlightenment has had a direct impact on every government in Europe, North and South America- no where in those areas is there one absolute monarch (Castro is closest, but that is another story).



The concepts of limited government, natural rights and freedoms all spring from the Enlightenment. The ideas of representative have been- if not defined- then refined by Enlightenment ideas.



Thanks god for the Enlightenment!!

hello



no, it was not part of the paris peace accord



In 1981,a Treasury Department agent, John Syphrit, was on Secret Service duty then in the White House, claims he overheard a conversation about a proposal from Hanoi to turn over a number of live POWs for $4 billion. Four people were involved in that conversation — President Reagan, Vice President Bush, C.I.A. director William Casey, and national security adviser Richard Allen.



Allegedly, they had just emerged, with others, from a meeting on national security issues in the Oval Office, where the ransom offer had apparently come up, and the four stepped across the hall into the Roosevelt Room to discuss it further. Syphrit and a colleague were in the room, installing some technical equipment



Other than Syphrit's claims , there were no other witnesses willing to testify, and a commitee found the claim to be untrue , and its been dismissed as false. Currently only pow/mia groups quote it as truth, the majority of historians debunked it as a conspiracy theory with no factual basis.

What was the motivation behind eugenics in America ?



did the supporters of eugenics really believed it would improve the quality of the American population, was population growth control the main reason, or even racism, which would have had mainly black women subjected to Eugenics ?

You are determining what is good and what is bad, without any absolutes, Eu means (Good), Nazi Germany used this.  Whoever is the dominate race at the time Eugenics is being used will probably control the program and therefore control what there society will look like, so unless you are a WASP you probably would not reep the benefits of Eugenics.

The Nazi's started this study by "killing millions of Jewish people" in order to gain their Aryan race. When it came to America, equally or even more influential on popular culture was Margaret Sanger 1883-1966. Sanger is known as a crusader for contraceptive rights; but few know that her concern for contraception was based firmly on concern for racial control. Her early work in impoverished environments led her to the belief that 'genetically inferior' persons should have less children, and that centers for birth control should be 'wisely' placed in neighborhoods which were impoverished, which also frequently happened to be in minority settings.



If you ask me, on a personal level, I think it was influenced by racism on both counts ! People nowadays, should be informed more about "birth control" and or "consequences", especially, in teenage years !

I have had my doubts but for a long time now, I have been convinced it was to prevent excessive cow-blowing.



Lonely single farmers in the late 70s started complaining how frequent cow blowing resulted in increased milk yield, but only at the stake of decreased carnal pleasure.



Hence the Ministry of Health started a nation-wide campaign for eugenics, which circumstantially translated to the form we know it in today.

Why did the Nazis use Zyklon B in the gas chambers ? Did they shy away ?



from asking the german chemical industry for an efficient poison gas (zyklon b took up to 30 min to kill) preferring to order "harmless" pesticides ?



</question>



<additional details>



Kevin the reason they adopted gas chambers wasnt efficiency, part of the leadership was concerned that employing a large number of Germans in the extermination would bring up a generation of brutes, having to shoot women and children, the gas chamber was to expose less Germans to the holocaust.



oh yah kevin its what you said, didnt read beyond. Yes they had experience with poison gas, made me wonder if the reason they ordered pesticides was secrecy.

It was much more efficient than the methods they had been using.  They started out shooting victims, but after the invasion of Russia there were just so many who had to be shot that it got demoralizing for the Einsatzgrupen SS troopers.  Himmler was very solicitous of the bad effects on his boys and looked for more efficient methods.  They started hooking up hoses from exhaust pipes of vehicles and running the motor to pump carbon monoxide into the rooms where victims were confined, but this was also time consuming and wasteful of scarce gasoline.



So the introduction of fixed facilities using the available agents (mainly Zyklon B) enabled an assembly line approach, and gave industrial efficiency on the scale they wished to operate.  This was a vast improvement and gave a much greater capacity to their efforts.



German industry had much experience with poison gases, which the German military had introduced on the WW One battlefields, first releasing it from canisters when the winds were favorable and later firing it into enemy positions in shells with a low bursting charge.

Well one of the state of affairs is that they had to become a secular government, that was one of the agreements after the war ended.



During WWII, Shinto the native Japanese religion, was the state religion and was used as a tool to move people patriotically. So you can see why taking this from per se would have a demoralizing effect.

In 1922 Benito Mussolini made himself master of Italy, and in 1933 Adolf Hitler, having been chosen as chancellor of Germany, became the effective leader of the German people. Poland, Austria, Spain, and some of the Balkans also abandoned parliamentary government. In most of these countries free enterprise was supplanted by socialistic government control, free speech by propaganda. Mussolini and Hitler diverted the resources of their nations to building up military power and flouted international law.



After Hitler's rise to power in 1933, Germany and Italy, at first individually and then together, began to upset the political structure that had grown out of World War I. The two dictators regarded their nations as the “have nots,” wronged by the Versailles Treaty. France and England were the “haves,” interested in maintaining the status quo.



As a result of this, Hitler in 1933 announced Germany's withdrawal from the League. He then threw off the restrictions of the peace treaty by rebuilding Germany's army, navy, and air force. Italy followed the German lead in flaunting the authority of the League by invading Ethiopia. As Mussolini's forces, despite League sanctions, neared victory, Hitler in March 1936 sent troops into the Rhineland.

The Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip (18 April 1862 – 24 April 1862) in the American Civil War was the decisive preliminary for the capture of the city of New Orleans by the Union naval force under Flag Officer (later Admiral) David G. Farragut.



The government of US President Abraham Lincoln assembled a combined force of 18,000 soldiers.The Union Army was called the "Army of the Gulf".



At noon on April 25, Farragut anchored in front of New Orleans; Forts Jackson and St. Philip, isolated and continuously bombarded by the mortar boats, surrendered on April 28. Soon afterwards soldiers under Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler occupied the city, which surrendered without fighting. The Union forces engraved "The Union Must and Shall Be Preserved" on the statue of Andrew Jackson that honored him for the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812.



The amount of troops on the CSA side that situated in Fort  Jackson & Fort St. Philip were unknown.

Were as varied as the number and makeup of the many tribes.  Most were superb when confronting members of their own tribe/clan.  Few were truly competitive when confronted with European firearms and armor.  Most learned very quickly that the ability to strike from ambush and then disappear back into the wilderness offered the best chance of meeting the enemy on somewhat equal terms.  Camoflage (war paint), concealment, light and easily portable weapons and cunning were mandatory.  So was knowing how to live off the land for prolonged periods with minimal accoutrements like cooking gear and well-made shelters.  Understanding and manipulating the enemy's mind set was also critical.

The great majority of Native Americans were peaceful people, and only a couple of tribes, namely the Siux and the Apache, were warlike, also, south of the border it was only the Aztecs, the Misquito, the Shuar and the Panama (yes, the Panama, the country is named after them).  Now, to put this in perspective, in both Americas combined, in the whole of what the rest of the world calls the American continent, the 5th continent, there were well over 10,000 tribes, and the ones that had a war culture you can count with your fingers.  However it is from that small handful, that white historians portrayed the rest of them, to put this in perspective again, imagine a space alien came to earth, and he visited the hillbillies of the Louisiana bayou, and based his impressions of the human race on them.  Just try to imagine; let that give an idea, of the damage done to the natives.  Some historians have argued that writting about them like that, portraying them like that, was not real history but malicious slander to justify genocide.  Not at all dissimilar to what the Arabs are doing actually; basing their impressions only on what the ashkenazi do, and if I have learned anything from history, first comes the slander, then comes the killing en masse.



So anyway, the skills; most native americans who were refered to as "warriors" were in fact hunter gatherers who adapted their skills for warfare.  The majority of tribes south of the border never domesticated the horse, however, they were adept archers and clubbers, as they used the bow and arrow, and clubs, to shoot or bludgeon hunted animals to death.  They also used spears of course.  Why did they adapt their hunting skills for war?  Hey, they were being invaded, and if something can pierce the hide of an animal, it can pierce the hide of a man; the logic isn't exactly rocket science you know.



The native americans of north america, as most were peaceful, like their cousins to the south, adapted their formidable hunting skills for war.  Instead of riding hard along the back of a mustang to hunt buffalo, a given "redskin" would ride hard and instead hunt U.S. army.  Think about it; stalking prey, staying down wind so that it doesn't catch your scent, stealth, all the skills of hunting are easily adapted for war.  Naturally because if they did not hunt well they didn't eat, most natives were very adept at it.  Indeed, true westward expansion, did not really take place until the 1880's, when magazine loading technology, and more reliable revolvers that did not leave a white smoke cloud were finally invented.



Gun powder weapons prior to the 1880's were extremely unreliable, so unreliable in fact that mobilizing cannons, using muskets, etc, required a good year of training or so to be used effectively.  In fact, it wasn't until WWI, that old tactics of warfare involving charging, keeping tight formations and marching towards the enemy, were finally discarded.  War, was hand to hand, and up close and personal, clear until the late 19th century; because of that, westerward expansion was very slow with the U.S.  Think for a second; people in what is now the east coast tended to skip over what are now the mid western states, and many mid western states did not even appear in the Union until AFTER the last of the native tribes was pacified.



People were scared to death of them, and you will do well to observe oficial U.S. history does not record battles of the "Indian wars" prior to the 1860's.  It only records the victories of the 1880's and after, it does not record the humiliating defeats dealt to whites by the natives of the 1860's and before which, by the way, modern Native Americans DO remember.  At the local Nez Perce reservation just about an hour and half's drive away from here, Custer's Last Stand is celebrated as a holiday; no school, and all the stores are closed.



Sorry, overanswered; the short answer is, all the skills of a good hunter, because that is what most native americans were.

Karl Marx once was asked to summarize his ideas in one sentence. He said, "Abolish private property." Capitalism allows one to retain one's elemental right to private property. This is the primary difference.



Capitalism is not explicitly atheistic, nor does it contain any explicit denial of free will. Capitalism is not holding its breath for the day when the division of labor, government, religion and family all go away. Capitalism is doing much better than Marxism.

First, lets look at a definition of economics which can be found in "Basic Economics: A Citizen's Guide to the Economy" by Thomas Sowell. Sowell quotes the British economist Lionel Robbins who defined economics thus: "Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources which have alternative uses."



Under Marxism (aka communism) there is no real private property. The State owns everything, including all businesses and manufacturing. It is a "command economy" with the State determining what and how much will be produced. Once there are more than two or three items involved the system quickly becomes unworkable. Command economies are notoriously inefficient in their allocation of resources. It may take several years for a command economy to realize that scarce resources are being used to make typewriters when everyone wants computers.



In a capitalist economy (aka a price-directed economy or free market economy) individuals own all businesses and manufacturing facilities. Businesses can be easily started and are allowed to succeed or fail based on whether or not a profit is made. Businesses that inefficiently use those scarce resources which have alternative uses quickly change their processes or go bankrupt. Have you checked lately to see how many typewriter manufacturers there are? Have you noticed how many businesses are started each year only to just as quickly disappear? According to the Small Business Administration, 1/2 of all small businesses fail in the first year. Of the ones that survive for a year, 1/2 of them fail in the second year.



In a price-directed economy, scarce resources which have alternative uses are efficiently allocated and that benefits everyone in society.



Suggested reading:



"Basic Economics: A Citizen's Guide to the Economy"



"Economic Facts & Fallacies"



"The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation As A Basis for Social Policy"



All are by Thomas Sowell, PhD. Economics. Dr. Sowell has written the two economics books without the jargon and charts and graphs usually associated with economics texts, making them readable for all us non-economics majors.

In the ownership of the fruits of labor.  Meaning: in capitalism, the owner of capital (means of production) pays somebody a wage in exchange of his or her work (more or less).  When the production is sold, the capitalist is then entitled to the gains (the difference between the cost of production and the price of the product).  In fact, Marxism is the explanation of this mechanism.  If you are referring to socialism, in that system the worker is entitled to receive all the fruits of production, both his wages and the gains (called in marxist terminology "surplus-value").

It is not clear what Marx would have regarded as a Marxist society, as he wrote so much and contradicted his previous ideas so often that it is hard to discover what his most mature ideas actually were. In fact there is a flourishing industry among Marxists producing books, articles and pamphlets arguing about exactly what Marxism is, and what sort of regime it should ultimately lead to, and through what intermediate stages. Therefore read my comments (and anyone else's) with this caveat in mind.



Capitalism is simpler to define, but also with a caveat: unlike Marxism it has no 'holy writ' - no 'Das Kapital': no body of work purporting to describe and guide it as a movement. There is, then, no universally accepted definition. Capitalist societies differ from each other, but all tend towards a common pattern.



In a capitalist society, generally,
1...There will be a common measure of value, applicable to all transactions: money. In many pre-capitalist societies some commodities we regard as saleable (e.g. land) were explicitly forbidden to be sold, and so had no sale value such as an ox or a plough would have.
2...Capital - i.e. accumulated wealth, whether in the form of money, industrial plant, land or stored commodities - can be (but is not universally) owned, managed and controlled by individuals, alone or in combinations such as companies. This naturally establishes commercial competition as a fact of life, the market as the central mechanism for exchange, and the cycle between the establishment and break-up of monopolies/oligopolies as a norm (think of what happened to IBM and Bell Telephone!)
3...Since there is a single measure of value, income can usually be expressed as the equivalent of a capital lump sum or vice-versa. In practice almost everything (including a human life) has an equivalent in terms of capital. To find out the capitalisation of your own life, apply for the largest mortgage you can get, and you will soon find out how the market rates you.



It is obvious that the existence of lending at interest (usury) is central to this, and so usury is an outstanding feature of capitalism, and religious objections to it have delayed financial developments in many parts of the world.



How capitalism, in its various forms, works in practice is visible all around us here in the west.



Marxist thought tends to regard capitalism as merely one stage through which society must pass on the way to the Communist utopia - after which there will be no more political/financial changes, and so the end of history. Roughly speaking, there will be:
1...An end to private ownership of capital.
2...An end to competition and 'wasteful' duplication of effort.
3...No significant difference in standard of living between classes - and in fact no distinguishable classes of people.



Beyond this it is hardly possible to go with confidence because of the disagreement between the Marxists themselves. How these ideas work out in practice can be estimated by studying the USSR, N. Korea, Cuba, China etc.



A big subject. I hope I've been some help.

The term colonial history of the United States refers to the history of the land that would become the United States from the start of European settlement to the time of independence from Europe, and especially to the history of the thirteen colonies of Britain which declared themselves independent in 1776. Starting in the late 16th century, the Spanish, the British, the French, Swedes and the Dutch began to colonize eastern North America. Basically the British settlers wanted to seperate themselves from British rule.

Definitly not Teddy Roosevelt who made more noise than a Bull Elephant in a China Shop - - -



HOWEVER _ - - - Teddy did recomend and then pushed his friend William Howard Taft into the Presidency and Taft qualifies as a quiet leader.  TAFT was the sort who preffered to be a JUDGE, a job require quiet concentration until that SINGLE moment when he banged down his gavel and delivered a Judgement.  Taft hated being President but quietly went about doing his job and what Teddy was unable to do with his loud bluster & big noices, Taft accomplished by quiet plodding dull thorough work.



Much later after leaving the Presidency, Taft was appointed to the Supreme Court where he could quietly write enormous legal briefs that spoke much louder than words.



http://www.nndb.com/people/906/000068702...
And not Victoria who could be a SHRILL and annoying with petty persistant letters and demands but her son,  KING EDWARD the 7th was a quiet forcefull leader who mostly let others make a lot of noise, then he would clear his throat and with quiet steadfast dignity would clearly state what had to be done.  Big beefy Edward shared the girth of contemporaneous Taft as well as the temperment, perhaps more fat men should be made national leaders?



Queen Elizabeth the first made lots of noise but namesake Queen Elizabeth the 2nd leads by quiet dignified example though many are ignorant as to what it that she does!!!



Oh and how can I ignore Abraham Lincoln, though he made noise with several effective speeches, Lincoln was actually a quietly effective leader, quite capable of leading others to assuming they were responsible for achieving 'greatness' when in truth it was Lincoln working his magic  with his diplomacy & tact  (all of the Lincoln haters on this forum are ignorant of the fact that Licoln gave several of his bitterress enemies key position both in his cabinent and elsewhere, valueing them for their talent, ignoring their nasty noisy barbs & criticisms, and getting out of them the sort of work that leads to victory over great odds. ),........

so to answer your question; Alexander's reign occurred before the imperial era of Rome.  However Rome was an established state when Alexander was campaigning in the east, but had not yet risen to ascendancy.

It's because it was fairly easy to cross there - the surrounding land was mostly marshy islands (which they built on), and the river had narrowed down from the wide estuary nearer the English Channel.  In medieval times, the part west of the City, where the Houses of Parliament and Westminster are now, was an island surrounded by the rivers Fleet and Bourne (still there but in culverts now).  And similar for all the land adjoining the River Thames.

There was a already a settlement there long before the Romans arrived. London (which of course really meant only the square mile) was a village built on two hills; Cornhill and Ludgate Hill. There was good observation of enemies etc, and two rivers joined at this point; Thames and the river Fleet (now underground).

It was the lowest ford/crossing point on the River Thames which made it the major transportation hub in the island. Since the Thames was a large river the settlement of Londinium was conveniently accessible by water (sea) and roads that went both North and South. This also made it an important strategic point and thus it was fortified and had the largest garrison.

safe waters to dover then only about 23 miles to  Calais France



Farming and fishing were the main occupations. In the Bronze Age men in boats started to trade with Continental ports and the Thames valley became a leading trading area. Later the Romans came to the site of what is now London

The City of London [Londinium - after the Celtic place-name Lyn Dyn] has a lot of flood free high ground, esp. arround St. Paul's which was the location of the citadel.  Also there is a major fresh water supply from the River Fleet which now runs beneath Farringdon Street, but which was open to the sky back then.



Here's a map of Roman London [not very detailed but has the basics].
http://www.britainexpress.com/London/rom...



The city of London was burned down by the British Queen Boudicca and her British Army in AD60; -  the Icani and Briganties and other British Celtic tribes.  Thus when we dig down 30 feet today anywhere in the city of London, we find black charcoal and ash - all that remains of the original Londinium.  The Romans had to start all over again.



Boudicca's Revolt
http://www.britainexpress.com/History/Bo...



The picture of Queen Boudicca at the next link looks very authentic.  In her own lifetime the Romans described her as having long red hair which hung to her knees.  She wore a coat of many colours [plaid], probably a tartan mix and she carried a heavy war spear.  Her voice is also described by the Romans as being harsh.  Her language would  not have been much unlike modern Welsh.
http://www.uroczysko.republika.pl/budyka...



The location of Londinium is easily defended - at least that's what the Romans believed, but they had not reckoned on Boudicca in all of this.



The National Eistedfodd
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzwqEryew...



The Welsh folk you see in the above video have an ancestry here in Breten going back about 17 thousand years.  This is based upon findings carried out by a DNA research team from Oxford Uni.



Thus the people you see in the above video, look very much like the folk who inhabited Britain in c60AD+.

The Hessians were soldiers from the German province of Hesse. They had very strong military traditions and were very fierce soldiers. As King George III was of German origin and retained sovereign control of several provinces in the area that is now Germany (the British royal family would retain these until 1916 when they renounced all of their German claims and changed their family name from the House of Saxe-Cobourg to the House of Windsor), and they were hired by the British crown to fight in the American Revolution, thus being referred to as "mercenaries."

Has the world always been on the edge of the end of the world?



As long as I've been alive there's always been this mass paranoia that the earth is going to be destroyed. The cold war spawned paranoia of WW3, after that it way Y2K, now its the environment yada yada yada. Through all of recorded history is this been the same general fears by the various civilizations just in different forms. I heard that people were afraid in the years 999 for example. What about in the years 542, or 1139, or 234 bc, or 1542 were people just a paranoid about the end of the world like people seem to be today?

For a long time there has always been at least one or two people preaching that the world would end in their generation. Perhaps not always the mass panic as it has started in the last few generations (during which humans themselves acquired powers to end it, insted of being forced to rely upon acts of god, nature, etc.), but as you put other examples... This is hardly the first time/s we have thought the end was near. Plenty of people I know thought we were closer to the end more around the cold war and all then we are currently.

Pollution and disease were worst back then because there was no way to treat pollution. Human Waste was thrown out the front door right in the street. Even as late as the 1940s in the USA less than 60% of the people had indoor plumbing.



They had worst than presidents. If the royal master did not like how you bowed down to him you were executed. It you did not pay what tax he said you owed, you were executed.
Get the point?



To  Martillo
I worked on the Y2K project. All of us working on it knew there was not going to be any mass destruction. You didn't look at the underlying reasons.



Our computer systems (mainframes and PC) were lagging behind the rest of the world in technology. Our communications systems were falling apart. Corporate executives put the money in profits instead of maintaining and developing new systems. (I can give you more details if you want)



The Y2K bug would only attack maybe 1%  of desktops and very few mainframes. The panic was created to get the money we needed to upgrade, develop or replace systems



so we could be compatible with the rest of the world.

Yes, much of the time (A.D.) has been on edge of the end of the world because it has been foretold from God to His prophets.  People know this, and have known that after Jesus ascended to heaven it could happen anytime.
As for me, I am not paranoid.  I know what has to happen, and ever since the rebirth of Israel in 1948, the time clock was set ticking.  Israel is the key...as it goes with that tiny nation, so it goes with the world.  Why do you suppose most nations are at odds with Israel?!



Here's a hint: if you are not with Israel, you are against her.  If you are against her, you have set yourself against God.  Look at what happened as a result of the Road Map to Peace in the Middle East drawn up by President GW Bush.  Israel gave up Gaza and the West Bank.  Shortly thereafter, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon (who agreed to the carving up of Israel's territory) suffered a massive stroke.  The US was hit with Hurricane Katrina, and from that point on, the American people completely turned on President George W Bush...who has become one of the most hated Presidents of all time.
So much so, that they are willing to put a detrimental man in the Oval Office just because he is so opposite of the Republican Party...and for that reason alone.  The key word has been "CHANGE" and although people do not understand the real reasons why, they go along with it.
Do you think all of this is coincidence?  Hah, no such thing as coincidences.
If you think GW's Road Map brought judgment to the US, watch what happens if Obama (clearly not a friend of Israel) gets into office.



Anyway, that remains to be seen.
All the dominoes are lined up.  Whether you believe it or not, is not the issue.  What is, is.
As I said, I am not paranoid.  Knowledge and understanding of God's word completely irradicates fear.  While I live and am responsible while I am on this planet, I also look up for I know my redemption draws nigh (and is so for all of God's people.)  We do not know the actual day or the hour, but God told us what season, and specifically what to watch for...and we are definitely in that season.

People fool themselves into thinking they can predict when the end will come.  Some people are foolish enough to think they can interpret The Bible to figure out when the world will end even though it clearly states that nobody knows when it will happen.  This has been going on for thousands of years, it's sort of like the old saying "live every day as if it were your last for one day you're sure to be right", the trouble is that when the end does come all those predicting the correct date will not be able to say "I told you so" because nobody will be left.

I believe the "truth" has  been established.  (Anna Anderson is dead, by the way.)



Two sets of remains found recently were confirmed to be members of the Romanov family through DNA testing, so it is fairly certain now that all members of that family, including Anastasia (who Anna Anderson claimed to be)  were actually killed in 1918.

When France capitulated in June 1940, Japan moved into northern French Indochina. And though the United States had no interest there, we imposed an embargo on steel and scrap metal. After Hitler invaded Russia in June 1941, Japan moved into southern Indochina. FDR ordered all Japanese assets frozen.



But FDR did not want to cut off oil. As he told his Cabinet on July 18, an embargo meant war, for that would force oil-starved Japan to seize the oil fields of the Dutch East Indies. But a State Department lawyer named Dean Acheson drew up the sanctions in such a way as to block any Japanese purchases of U.S. oil. By the time FDR found out, in September, he could not back down.



Tokyo was now split between a War Party and a Peace Party, with the latter in power. Prime Minister Konoye called in Ambassador Joseph Grew and secretly offered to meet FDR in Juneau or anywhere in the Pacific. According to Grew, Konoye was willing to give up Indochina and China, except a buffer region in the north to protect her from Stalin, in return for the U.S. brokering a peace with China and opening up the oil pipeline. Konoye told Grew that Emperor Hirohito knew of his initiative and was ready to give the order for Japan's retreat.



Fearful of a "second Munich," America spurned the offer. Konoye fell from power and was replaced by Hideki Tojo. Still, war was not inevitable. U.S. diplomats prepared to offer Japan a "modus vivendi." If Japan withdrew from southern Indochina, the United States would partially lift the oil embargo. But Chiang Kai-shek became "hysterical," and his American adviser, one Owen Lattimore, intervened to abort the proposal.



Facing a choice between death of the empire or fighting for its life, Japan decided to seize the oil fields of the Indies. And the only force capable of interfering was the U.S. fleet that FDR had conveniently moved from San Diego out to Honolulu.



And so Japan attacked.

America was imposing sanctions on Japan because it invading China and breaking treaties e.g. the washington naval treaty.  In Aug 1941 the USA cut off 80% of Japans oil.



Japanese naval history believed wars are won by Naval forces in decisive victories.  They studied the british navy and saw Trafalgar as an example.  Their victory over the Russians in 1905 was due to a decisive naval battle too.



Pearl Harbor was meant to wipe out the US navy in the pacific.  They didn't send any troops to occupy hawaii.



So here are two elements:



oil being cut off by the US
history of successful decisive naval battles.



I'm sure people will add other reasons.

I am very stuck on my history courswork about conflict in Northern Irealnd?



I am on the last part of the third and final task of my history coursework on conflict in Northern Ireland. In this task I have written about previous attempts at peace in NI and problems that still remain. The last part is the conclusion where I have to say if peace is possible in NI and sum up what problems need to be overcome. I am stuck on this part, can you help? Thanks



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



The conflict in Northern Ireland stems from the fact that there are two distinct traditions among the population, one Protestant the other Catholic, each of which wants a different political outcome. Broadly speaking many of those who are Catholic are also Nationalist and support the reunification of Ireland, while most of those who are Protestant are also Unionists and wish to see the constitutional link with Britain maintained. There is a deep lack of trust between the two traditions and this is apparent in the attitudes of many politicians in Northern Ireland. Trust is something that is only likely to develop over a very long period of time.

Ergot is a fungus that infects grains. When ingested by humans it can cause "St. Anthony's fire." Ergotism was once posited as being the cause of some of the symptoms of the supposed witches at Salem, but I can't imagine the hypothesis came from a medical person. Ergot alkaloids, by the way, in controlled doses have medical uses. Google away.

People in Elizabethan London suffered almost the same illnesses as nowadays.  In addition were typhoid and bubonic plague which killed one third of the population.  These were caused by garbage and open sewers in the streets and the Thames.



Most people could not afford treatment from a qualified physician who would normally charge a gold coin worth 10 shillings.  They might be able to afford treatment from a barber who was allowed to extract teeth and let blood.  Otherwise, people had to resort to homemade cures based on herbs.

People were afraid of a nuclear holocaust.  Some even dug "bomb shelters" in their back yards or under the house.



In schools, students had "bomb drill", where they hid under their desk and wrapped their arms around their heads.  (As though that would help.)



It was the beginning of an era of more sexual freedom and drug use for teenagers who thought that it was unlikely they would live long enough to get in trouble.



Many people hoarded food and began to store bottled water.  They learned to make emergency kits with battery powered radios and other supplies.

In the 20s, the economic boom helped strengthen the middle class which made the perception that the US was winning the war on poverty.



Being able to buy on margin in the stock market was a partial reason that normal people were able to start accumulating a lot of wealth with little investment.



And, as I'm sure you know, the problem was that these normal people were buying on margin (only purchasing part of the investment stock, then the bank would cover the rest of the cost and then the individual would have to pay back the loan through interest). The problem was that once the banks started failing after the stock market crash and everyone started to panic, all these banks were calling in these loans to cover the massive withdrawals (under most contracts you had to payback the full amount of the loan in 24 hours if the bank called in that loan). Flat out, people did not have the money on hand to payback the loan because the market had crashed, their stocks now worthless,and people couldn't get to their savings because the banks did not enough money to cover all their customers' withdrawals.



In other words, the population's accumulation of wealth was artificial and was only based on the assumption that if the stock market continued to do well, so would everyone else.



You can make a lot of connections between the Stock Market crash on 1929 and the housing/credit crisis of the present.

No taxation without representation?



What did the British say about the taxes, like did they say it was for the war or defending them against indians and french?



</question>



</answer from>



<answer>



Yes, the Brits said taxes were to pay for the defence of the colonies.  But, since this defence had always been given FREE of charge before, to charge anything for it was outragous - so, it led to rebellion.

- It is not an elected position, no official duties, no paycheck.
- The first lady attends many official ceremonies and functions of state either along with or in place of the President.



- There is a strong tradition against the First Lady holding outside employment while occupying the office.



- Many first ladies advocate for projects they find important.  The first lady frequently participates in humanitarian and charitable work.
- Many have taken an active role in campaigning for the President with whom they are associated.

The Taj Mahal is not a wonder of the ancient world, it is relatively recent (1500-1600's, me thinks). Some douchebag organized a contest last thursday to choose new seven wonders and there were many stupid candidates like Timbuktu or the statues of easter island. Gullible individuals voted and new wonders were choosen, like anyone with half a brain cared.

Gallipoli was not a war, it was a battle in WWI.  The British mounted a major campaign, took a large risk, and lost.  They thought success would be a shortcut to end the war quickly.  It is known not just as a military battle but for the controversy and criticism that the British govt and top generals received for major blunders in its planning and execution.



There was war in Vietnam from the mid 1950s until the mid 70s.  First it was a rebellion to get rid of the French colonial govt.  The area was known as French Indochina.  The country was officially split into North and South Vietnam when it gained independence.  North Vietnam had a Communist govt and was under the influence of The Soviet Union and Red China.  South Vietnam was under the influence of the Western world, and the U.S.  What is known in the U.S. as the Vietnam War was fought as part of the Cold War, the struggle for influence and control of the world that took place from 1945 to the late 1990s between the USSR and the US.  The Korean War was an earlier part of this struggle, starting in 1950.



For more about the huge subjects just mentioned, and about the even larger subjects of WW I and II, ....hey, be glad they invented Wikipedia.  Also, if you get the Military Channel, they have old documentaries that the History Channel doesn't run anymore.

They lived very elegantly for the times - but compared to modern digs, they were pretty bleak. There was no indoor plumbing, or electric lighting, which means no air conditioning or furnaces for heating so the whole place was drafty, cold in the winter and hot in the summer. However, that was par for the course in those days. They had sumptuous hangings on the wall (not for artistic merit but to cut down on drafts) and they lived very well for the times.



You refer to 'they' and to 'she' - which kings and/or queens are you thinking about?

From Historic Royal Palaces:



The Medieval Palace at the Tower of London contained fabulous interiors used by medieval kings and queens during their frequent but short visits to their most important fortress.



King Edward I’s financial accounts record a payment of ‘11 shillings and a penny for timber, boards and sawn panels for a bed for the lord King and for transporting it through England’.



This piece of information was our starting-point for re-creating Edward’s bed, and you can see it in the royal bedchamber in St Thomas’s Tower.



The little chantry off the bedchamber is one of the most peaceful and evocative spaces in the whole of the Tower of London.

The Inmost Ward
In the early thirteenth century Henry III (reigned 1216-72) transformed the Tower into a major royal residence and had palatial buildings constructed within the Inner Bailey to the south of the White Tower. This Inmost Ward was entered by the now ruined Coldharbour Gate to the NW and bounded by a wall, fortified by the Wakefield Tower to the SW, the Lanthorn Tower to the SE, and the now ruined Wardrobe Tower to the NE. The well appointed Wakefield Tower and the Lanthorn Tower were integral parts of this new royal palace, and adjoined the now demolished Great Hall situated between them. The Tower remained a royal residence until the time of Oliver Cromwell, who demolished some of the old palatial buildings.

DNA Testing
=========
In 1991, the bodies of the royal family were exhumed, and it was discovered that the bodies of Alexei, and one of his sisters, identified as Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia by Russian scientists and as Grand Duchess Anastasia by American scientists, were not in the grave. The mitochondrial DNA of the bones unearthed from a forest grave, presumed to be those of Alexandra and three of her daughters, were compared to that of the Duke of Edinburgh, whose maternal grandmother Princess Victoria of Hesse and the Rhine was a sister of Alexandra. This proved to be a match.



Anderson's tissue sample was later discovered stored at Martha Jefferson Hospital. Anderson’s DNA was compared with those of the Romanovs, at the suggestion of Marina Botkin Schweitzer, the daughter of Gleb Botkin. Anderson’s DNA sample did not match that of the Duke of Edinburgh or that of the bones, meaning that the tissue sample tested belonging to Anderson could not have belonged to Anastasia.



On August 23, 2007, a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned, partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky's memoirs. The archaeologists said the bones are from a boy who was roughly between the ages of 10 and 13 years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of 18 and 23 years old. Anastasia was 17 years, one month old at the time of the assassination, while her sister Maria was 19 years, one month old, and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his 14th birthday. Anastasia's elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were 22 and 21 years old at the time of the assassination. Along with the remains of the two bodies, archaeologists found "shards of a container of sulfuric acid, nails, metal strips from a wooden box, and bullets of various caliber." The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes. Tests have been repeatedly and independently conducted on the remains to determine that they are the remains of the two missing Romanov children.



Preliminary testing indicated a "high degree of probability" that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters, Russian forensic scientists announced on January 22, 2008. The testing began in late December 2007 and was originally scheduled to be completed by February 2008. However, scientists with the Sverdlovsk Regional Medical Forensic Bureau and a Moscow laboratory were still conducting testing. One report indicated uncertainty about when the final report will be released.The Yekaterinburg region's chief forensic expert Nikolai Nevolin indicated the results will be compared against those obtained by foreign experts and a final report could be issued by April or May of 2008.On April 30, 2008, The Associated Press, BBC, Reuters, CBS, CNN and other news organisations reported that the regional governor for the Ekaterinburg, Russia, area, officially announced that the DNA tests indeed proved that the fragments found in 2007 were those of the last two missing children, declaring



“ Now we have the whole family.”



Independent DNA testing carried out by the University of Massachusetts Medical School, USA, made public in July 2008, on the final two remains confirmed the earlier Russian findings that the last two remains were indeed members of the Romanov family murdered in the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg.All members of Nicholas II's immediate family have now accounted for officially.

Jackson, then Lee were the two leaders that Shaara spent most of the time on. They were the preeminent leaders of the Confederate forces.
Lee had also been the Commandant of West Point. So is was in conflict with an old allie, George Meade.
Most of the generals on both sides knew each other and were well acquainted with the other guys tactics.
The proliferation of Generals, would make you believe that every time you turned around there was a General looking at you. Buy Shaara, as he does in his other books, does not pay much attention to the common soldier. His imagination of the rhetoric between the Generals is entertainment, at best.

For example, remembering trivial details and everything with little effort and studying.



Like, I read about the Theory of Multiple Intelligences and stuff. How can you categorize someone who is really good at social science. There are people who are good at math. People who are good at language and literature. etc

History is not trivia.  History is what historians say and write about the past.  If somebody is good at remembering trivial details, it means only that.  To be "really, really good at history," you have to be able to take those details and build a critical story.  This always involves recognizing your own politics and perspectives in the present.



At this point, History is much closer to Literature and the Humanities than it is to social science.  Part of this is due to the wave of literary and postmodern theory that has affected how historians go about telling their stories.  But by and large, the field of history no longer embraces the idea that "just the facts" is a plausible idea.  Facts don't speak for themselves, and the past does not speak for itself; we speak for them.  We make sense of them from our own positions in the present.



If all you do is memorize trivial details, you're no better than The Schwab.

Having never lived in the South, I cannot answer from their point of view.  However, I have heard that this is true.  Sherman was a merciless General, who, in his march to the sea, decimated thousands of families and homes, farms and money making businesses.  This was horrid, but then, war is horrid.  I guess many of the Southerners are bitter, however, and all of this was brutal, but it was greatly instrumental in bringing about the end of a horrible war between the states.  Hope this helps.

It's the Missouri Compromise line of 1820.  It was 36°30' north latitude.



It really didn't divide all the slave states from the free states.  That line is actually the Northern borders of Virginia (West Virginia was part off Virginia back then), Kentucky, Texas, and Maryland.  Also, Northern, Western, and Eastern boundries of Missouri.



Oh, the boundaries of Delaware count as well.  It was a slave state.  I don't know why.  I think they never really had any need for slaves, and just never saw the need to get rid of slavery since it barely existed.  In fact, they had some of the best white / free black race relations in the nation.  Go figure.



The compromise line was actually the Southern border of Missouri.  Missouri was allowed to come in as a slave state on the agreement that no other new slave territories would be allowed North of its Southern Border.  Anything South would be Slave Territory.  The agreement only applied to those territories in the Louisiana Purchase.



The Southwest would not be acquired until after the Mexican War of 1846-48.  This really screwed things up.  Because of the gold rush of 1849, California became eligible to be a state in worlds record time.  It wanted to be one free, state.  The problem is that the compromise line runs right through the middle of California.

At first it was the southern border of Pennsylvania, also called the Mason-Dixon line.  But that line allowed slaves in states on either side of it but there was were gradually increasing restrictions on slavery in those states north of the Mason-Dixon line.



Later it was the Missouri Compromise line of 1820 that attempted to keep the balance of power between slave and non-slave states in the Senate.  Some in the south sought to increase the number of slave states by sending a band of soldiers to some countries in Central America and try to make them slave states of the South somewhat like was done with Texas.  That tactic didn't work.  Gradually the south realized that they had run out of options and that eventually there would be more non-slave states and that the institution of slavery was doomed if they remained in the union.  That realization led to the Civil War when they attempted to go their own way.

Russia didn't switch sides - Germany did.



There was an agreement (the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) to divide up Poland, which happened in 1939.  (Incidentally; I've never heard anyone ask why Britain and France declared war on Germany for invading Poland; but did not declare war on Russia for invading Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Finland).



Both sides viewed the M-R Pact cynically.  Both expected to go to war against the other eventually, but used the pact to buy time.  To look at Russia specifically, their armed forces were in a mess after the purges, and expected Germany to become bogged down in the west after the fashion of 1914-1918.  When this didn't happen, Stalin still thought he had until at least 1942 to prepare, and was caught utterly by surprise by the German invasion of 1941.

The USSR didn't really switch sides: the Soviets and Nazi Germany were very much enemies.  As Germany started expanding before WWII, Stalin had been pushing the Western powers to fight Germany together.  When the British and French let Germany cut away part of Czechoslovakia at Munich, the Soviets thought that Germany was being steered towards the East -- that Britain and France were trying to avoid conflict with Hitler by getting Germany to attack the USSR instead.  So he signed a "Non-Aggression Pact" that the two (enemies) would leave each other alone.  Besides the fear of a German invasion without support from the Western Allies
1 - Stalin was greedy and used the treaty as a pretext to invade innocent nations.
2 - The USSR faced a potentially hostile Japan, and could have wound up fighting a two-front war.



There's lots of conjecture in any "what-ifs", but without signing the "Non-Aggression Pact," WWII might have begun with Germany and Japan attacking the Soviet Union from both sides and tearing it to pieces, perhaps without the Western powers ever getting involved.

Russia was a chaotic country ruled by a ruthless Dictator, Stalin. They had been thrashed in WW1 by the Germans and were unable to fight any country.
Molotov was the Foreign minister who signed a Peace Treaty with Germany to keep out of the war. I was in Poland years ago and they had to teach that Russia was their saviour and England did not come into the war until forced to. Indeed the Poles did not know that England declared war on Germany within three days of the German invasion of Poland. I told some history teachers that they were teaching propaganda not history. They were not allowed to teach or even know the truth. However, Russia did not declare war on Germany, Germany declared war on Russia. We flew Spitfires to give to Russia to help them to fight back. We also had the 'Balkan convoys' who took arms and aid to unprepared Russia.



The Russians built the T1 which was the best tank of the time and fought back. The designer of the tank was imprisoned and died in prison as far as I remember. Stalin was a murderer. Watch the forthcoming BBC programm that is coming soon on Stalin.

Could you please tell me the story of Anastasia?



By the way, the Anastasia I'm talking about is the one who was said to be killed on the night of July 17, 1918.



I partially read it in wikipedia.com but I didn't understand. Please give me a summary that can be understood by minor (me).



Please tell me only the necessary information because in wikipedia.com, they have a lot of information there but some information there aren't necessary.



Thanks!

Anastasia was the youngest daughter of the Russian Czar, Nicholas Romanov and his wife, the Czarina, Alexandria, formerly Alix of Hesse.
The entire family was killed by the Bolshevik.



They took over the government and the building blocks for Communism were placed on top of the rubble left by the collapse of the Russian monarchy.



For decades, many believed Anastasia survived, but DNA testing has proven, beyond doubt, that she perished with her family.
In the past, she was the subject of many books, movies and documentaries.



There are some great photos of the family on hubpages.com.

I'm from SA, so I should be able to help ya out. Blacks were given certain areas of the country to live in. To enter a white area, they had to present a "dompas" which was like a passport. Schooling was almost now existing and they couldn't get a decent job in white SA. In prison, they even received less food than coloured and asian inmates. The person who started with the apartheid idea, was Hendrik Verwoerd who was of Dutch decent. The Black struggle heroes are numerous incl. Nelson Mandela, Oliver Thambo, Walter Sisulu. Wikipedia should have a detailed description of apartheid. There was a lot more to it, but it will take pages to type everything.

The Population Registration Act of 1950 required all citizens of South Africa to be classified into categories according to their race. The categories established were white, black (African), and coloured (people of mixed descent). The Reservation of Separate Amenities Act of 1953 created separate public facilities to be used by whites and blacks. Workers, Africans or Coloured, were restricted by law from protesting the enactment of the Native Labor Act of 1953. Government officials, under the Public Safety and Criminal Law Amendment Acts, possessed the power to declare states of emergency and increase the penalties for protesting against any or supporting the repeal of any government established law. Imprisonment, whippings, and fines were a few of the penalties the government could enforce. One such state of emergency occurred in 1960, during a peaceful protest at Sharpeville. Large groups of blacks refused to carry their dompas, attempting to overthrow the unjust Pass Law. According to the police, the protest became violent. During this particular protest, 69 blacks were killed and another 187 were wounded.

Some people would say so; for instance, Michel Foucault, who is utterly fascinating if you are a fan of history. I'm linking his wikipedia article below.



The problem with history is that there is no such thing as an objective narrative; in ways, it was true when Karl Marx said "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles," so in ways it is about power. If you're writing a paper about it, you can pretty much argue either way.

SFAIK there was some gold discovered in the Black Hills- which meant a lot of people started digging up the mountains. The territory was officially a Sioux area but fighting between the Indians and the diggers meant the US had to intervene- and (politics being what they were) there was no way they could intervene on the side og the Indians. The Indians were given a "peace offer" - leave the Black Hills or else - and then the war started.
Custer was not a brilliant thinker- he divided his forces and attacked the Sioux camp from different directions- and got anihilated. In the process he wasted practically his whole family (his brothers and brothers in law were all in the same unit)

November 1986:  A UN human rights report said that 10,000 to 12,000 Afghan civilians had been killed in the previous nine months by Soviet and Afghan government forces, and that children had been killed by the indiscriminate use of explosives disguised as toys. The same month, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution, by a vote of 122 to 20, calling for a negotiated settlement to the war. Karmal resigned from the largely ceremonial post of president of the Revolutionary Council. He was succeeded on November 24 by Haji Mohammad Chamkani.

Quote:



"President James Monroe was no stranger to the institution of slavery. Born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1758, Monroe grew up on his family's 500-acre tobacco plantation. When his father died in 1774, Monroe (as eldest surviving son) inherited the land and personal property, as well as "a Negro boy Ralph," according to Spence Monroe's will. Throughout his life, Monroe's relationships with slaves revealed a pattern of paternalistic racism. While he never acknowledged equal rights for the slave population, Monroe sought a gradual end to slavery and advocated re-settling freed slaves in the Carribean or in Africa. Monroe was also humane in the treatment of his own slaves. In repeated instances Monroe prevented slave families from being separated from one another; allowed certain slaves a degree of self-determination in work assignments; sought medical treatment for slaves who were ill; and demanded that his slaves have access to the basics of food, clothing, and shelter."

What did Republicanism mean to the people in the 1830's?



I know they first believed it to be democratic but then it began to branch down during the reign of Andrew Jackson or so I believe. And then the people began doubting republicanism for some reason. I need to know why. It doesn't make any sense to me at all.

Republicanism was an attempt to deemphasize the democracy in the Democratic Party and emphasize that we had a representative, that is a republican form of government.



But it also had an anti-slavery agenda which came to be its most important characteristic by the 1860s.

Yes.  The US government sponsored a military coup in Chile, which overthrew the democratically-elected socialist Salvador Allende in order to establish the military dictatorship of General Pinochet.  Large numbers of torture and desaparecidos (disappeared) followed.  Countless Chileans were guilty by association, and anybody remotely connected to "radical" ideas or people was interrogated, intimidated, tortured, or killed.  This was all done in the name of "freedom."

From mid-August 1973 there had been rumblings of a coup brewing in Chile - the economy was suffering due to the withdrawal of foreign investment in the democratically-elected state. At 4am on 11 September, a date that is now synonymous with strikes against democracy, military units stationed throughout Chile reported for action to the leaders of the coup, led by Augusto Pinochet2. By 7am, these troops were being deployed, their aim to wrest the urban centres of Chile from local politicians. The most effective operation was carried out in Concepción, the country's third largest city - the military had cut all the phone lines of governmental personnel and had rounded everyone up and placed them on an island to keep them from communicating what had happened to the rest of the world. Once these key players had been removed, the city slipped into military hands. The whole operation took less than 85 minutes to execute.

I find it amazing how many times this question (or similar questions) appear here in Yahoo/Answers.



All the other evidence can be put aside and all you have to do is be aware of (in fact you can go and look if you wish) the records of the NAZI's themselves. They kept nearly complete and total records of what occurred. Today's descendants can go and find their relatives who were killed in the Holocaust in these records.



In addition the trials after the war made records of all of this.



From a personal perspective relatives of mine were among the allied liberators of some of those camps and we yet have photographs that they took.  I have also worked with some individuals who survived the camps and I have seen their tattoos.



The number of times this question comes up here is amazing.  I can't help but wonder about what is taught in school these days.

The Nazis meticulously recorded everything, and by meticulously, I mean, METICULOUSLY.  They even catalogued who the fattest people were writting down crap like "yes, from this group, we extracted this much soap...."  Now, the lampshades made with tattooed skin is bogus, however, the soap story IS true, although this was unknown to the German public that they were in fact washing themselves with soap made form human fat.  Human fat makes some high quality soap by the way, the best; makes you wonder why plastic surgeons don't use some of the stuff they suck out of fat men and women.  Hey, its only a chemical, and so long as its treated first I don't mind washing myself with it.



Although there is something to be said about a "wash yourself with Oprah's @ss!" scenario.  The "yuck" factor however, will prevent people from ever making soap from human fat.  I mean come on, fat just sits there, its unatractive and metabolically inactive; in making soap with it, hey, all those burgers and pizzas consumed would have SOME use at least right?  Now, that specifically ashkenazi Jews have overplayed to death the Holocaust, and profited it from it, that is no secret.



Yes it did happen but see, unscrupulous ashkenazi Jews have marketed it so much, everyone is starting to think its fiction now.  WWII, oh trust me, no one will forget that war with all the video games that have been made with that setting.  If all the bullets, artillery, and bombs fired in every WWII video game ever made was magically made real, you'd have enough weaponry to destroy Germany and Russia 10 times over; its only a guess, but its probably not far off the mark.  Ashkenazi Jews have marketed and sold to death the Holocaust much the same way video game companies have profited on WWII.



There are children out there, who think WWII is made up fiction, that is how saturated video game world is with it now.  If you put, as your setting, a given historical event, because of the mass produced nature of entertainment, and people's greater interest in it than actual education, the actual facts, it is the entertainment's take on things that will become more ingrained in the psyche, pretty soon with the bovine masses thinking "oh, it didn't happen."  By marketing the Holocaust to death, those ashkenazi retards are doing the Holocaust denier's jobs for them.

and murders wanting to loot everything  what they could

HMmmmmmmmmmmm - - - Your question is a contradiction.  You ask why 'people' do not like Hitler and then you ask what did he do to 'me' or whoever.



'People' tend to not lke Hitler because Hitler has become the poster boy for 'evil Dictator Incarnate' mstly due to his actions which led to a World War and a Holocaust that consumed millions of lives.



Mostly People do not like Hitler because they do not read History and have very little understanding of History.
Oddly enough this is the EXACT same reason why there are people who 'like' Hitler and jump up excitedly and say/write stupid things such as 'Germany was Flourishing.'
As a Historian I find that there are are many things to dislike about Adolf Hitler.  He was a long winded bore who spent hours pontificating on various subjects convinced he was an expert.  Hitler would have loved Yahoo Answers but he would have been frustated not getting 10 points each and every time up at Bat.
Hitler farted a lot and that made it even more difficult to sit in a room listening to him talk & talk & talk & talk some more.
Hitler squandered the resources of Germany and led the nation into a disasterous War which resulted in a chunk of Germany and much of Eastern Eurpe enduring the H^ll of Soviet Domination.
Conversely Hitler did break Germany of the Habit of dragging Europe into a Major War every 20 to 25 years.



What did Hitler do to me personally?  Well I really think my birth was a botched mistake (long story).  Because of Hitler my dear Mother at the age of 9 was forced to abandon a life of upper class privellege and along with her family was forced into exile in America which eventually led to her meeting a man who fathered me.  Thus it can be said that Hitler helped my Mother get f******d  and I am the f***ing result of Hitler's madness.  Trust me, if you knew me you would agree that is sufficient reason to dislike Hitler.

bearstiringfromcave gave a pretty good answer.  As with your other question about the holocaust (assuming that you are serious about this question) it demonstrates the lack of education in today's schools.



Hitler was a person at the right crux of history ( a nation and a world in deep economic suffering) who promised anything and blamed everyone else for the problems.  (A little like today's Obama.)



Due to a lack of eduction of the people, at that point people wanted solutions to their suffering and little by little he gained full power.  He really wasn't competent but with full power he began to take (using the power of government) and give to a selected segment of the people and his power grew and so did his unwarranted belief in himself.



He came to believe in his imagined imaged and believed that he should run the world and from that position he brought the world into ruin.  War (that he started) killed millions, destroyed economies and cities and countries and it took the combined resources of several countries to end that insanity.  In ending his road to world domination most of the world's countries were brought down to near subsistence with the only effective economy and production force of any size being left in the United States and Canada and those having been altered to support a war footing.



Read a little history and you won't need to ask such questions.

I LOVE learning about Ancient Egypt the most!!! Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome are next.  I also really like to learn about Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Finland, Estonia, etc) and Vikings!



I dislike learning about U.S. History (colonies, the American Revolution, urbanization).  I know that it is important stuff that happened, but it all just seems so boring to me.
